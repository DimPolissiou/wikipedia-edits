{"title_page": "Praetorian Guard", "text_new": "{{short description|Imperial Roman unit who guarded the emperors}}\n{{redirect|Praetorians|video game|Praetorians (video game)}}\n{{Roman government}}\n{{RomanMilitary}}\nThe '''Praetorian Guard''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''cohortes praetoriae'') was an elite unit of the [[Imperial Roman army]] whose members served as personal bodyguards and [[military intelligence|intelligence]] for the [[Roman emperor]]s. During the era of the [[Roman Republic]], the Praetorians served as a small escort force for high-ranking officials such as senators or provincial governors like procurators, and also serving as bodyguards for high-ranking officers within the Roman legions. With the republic's transition into the [[Roman Empire]], however, the first emperor, [[Augustus]], founded the Guard as his personal security detail. Although they continued to serve in this capacity for roughly three centuries, the Guard became notable for its intrigue and interference in Roman politics, to the point of overthrowing emperors and proclaiming their successors. In 312, the Guard was disbanded by [[Constantine the Great]],  as he oversaw the destruction of their barracks at the [[Castra Praetoria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-praetorian-guard|title=8 Things You May Not Know About the Praetorian Guard|last=Andrews|first=Evan|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Under the Roman Republic ==\nPraetorians originated as guards of [[Roman general]]s during the [[Roman Republic]]. They are first recorded as bodyguards of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipio]] family around 275 BC. Generals with ''[[imperium]]'' (the right to command an army) were [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]]s or [[promagistrate]]s, accompanied at all times by their [[lictor]]s, who would act as close protection. [[Roman consul|Consul]]s and [[proconsul]]s had twelve lictors, whilst [[praetor]]s and [[propraetor]]s had six; enough to guard the general's tent in camp, but too few to be effective as a bodyguard in battle. There was no permanent bodyguard formation, so some military officers began to surround themselves with temporary units of hand-picked soldiers to ensure their security during battle. For example, during the [[Siege of Numantia]], [[Scipio Aemilianus]] formed a troop of 500 men to protect himself against [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]]s, which were often directed at commanders. This practice become more widespread in the [[Roman army of the late Republic|army of the late Republic]], as generals remained on campaign for longer periods. In camp, the bodyguard would sleep close to the commander, whose tent was known as the ''[[praetorium]]''. Accordingly, the picked guard became known as ''cohors praetoria''. In battle, these [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s would act as a final [[Military reserve|reserve]].\n\nAt the end of the year 40 BC, the [[second triumvirate|triumvirs]] [[Octavian]] and [[Mark Antony]] both operated praetorian units of hand-picked veterans. Octavian garrisoned his praetorians within the [[pomerium|sacred boundary of Rome]], the first time troops had been permanently stationed in the city. Antony commanded three cohorts in the [[Orient]] and in 32 BC, he issued coins in honor of his praetorians. According to Paul Orose,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Octavian commanded five cohorts at the [[Battle of Actium]]. Following his victory at Actium, Octavian merged his forces with those of his adversary in a symbolic reunification. When Octavian became Augustus, the first [[Roman emperor]], he retained the praetorians as his personal bodyguard force.\n\n== Under the empire ==\n[[File:Lens - Inauguration du Louvre-Lens le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2012, la Galerie du Temps, n\u00b0 058.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Praetorians Relief]] with an [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]] grasping a [[thunderbolt]] through its claws, in reference, to the [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' form of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].]]\nThe legionaries known as the Praetorian Guard were first hand-picked veterans of the Roman army who served as [[bodyguards]] to the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]. First established by Augustus, members of the Guard accompanied him on active campaign and served as [[secret police]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} protecting the civic administrations and rule of law imposed by the senate and the emperor. The Praetorian Guard was ultimately dissolved by Emperor [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century. They were distinct from the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] which provided close personal protection for the early Western Roman emperors.\n\nThey benefited from several advantages due their close proximity with the emperor: the Praetorians were the only ones admitted while bearing arms in the center of sacred [[Rome]] \u2013 the ''[[Pomerium]]''.\n\nTheir mandatory service was shorter in duration, for instance : 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions starting year 13 BC, then carried to, respectively, 16 to 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus.\n\nTheir pay was higher than that of a legionary. Under [[Nero]], the pay of a Praetorian was three and a half times that of a legionary, augmented by prime additions of ''[[donativum]]'', granted by each new emperor. This additional pay was the equivalent of several years of pay, and was often repeated at important events of the empire, or events that touched the imperial family: birthdays, births and marriages. Major monetary distributions or food subsidies renewed and compensated the fidelity of the Praetorians following each failed particular attempted plot (such as that of Messalina against Claudius in AD 48 or Piso against Nero in AD 65). The Praetorians received substantially higher pay<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman Economy \u2013 Prices in Ancient Rome|url=http://www.ancientcoins.biz/pages/economy/ |publisher=Ancientcoins.bis |accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> than other Roman soldiers in any of the legions, on a system known as ''sesquiplex stipendum'', or by pay-and-a-half. So if the legionaries received 250 [[Denarius|denarii]], the guards received 375 per annum (year). [[Domitian]] and [[Septimius Severus]] increased the ''stipendum'' (payment) to 1,500 denarii per year, distributed in January, May and September.\n\nFeared and dreaded by the population and by the [[Roman Senate]], the Praetorians received no sympathy from the Roman people. A famous poem by [[Juvenal]] recalls the nail left in his foot by the sandal of a Praetorian rushing by him. \"Praetorian\" has a pejorative sense in [[French language|French]], recalling the often troubling role of the ''Praetorian'' of antiquity.\n\n=== History ===\nIn [[ancient Rome]], ''[[praetor]]s'' were either civic or military leaders. The ''praetorianus'' were initially elite guards for military praetors, under the Republic.<ref>[http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-praetorian-guard 8 Things You May Not Know About the Praetorian Guard]</ref> As the Republic ended, the first emperor, Augustus, set up an elite guard of praetorianus to protect himself.\n\nThe early Praetorian Guard differed greatly from that in later times, which came to be a vital force in the power politics of Rome. While Augustus understood the need to have a protector in the maelstrom of Rome, he was careful to uphold the [[Principate|Republican veneer]] of his regime. Thus, he allowed only nine cohorts to be formed, each originally consisting of 500 men. He then increased them to 1,000 men each, but allowed three units to be kept on duty at any given time in the capital. A small number of detached cavalry units (''[[turma]]e'') of 30 men each were also organized. While they patrolled inconspicuously in the palace and major buildings, the others were stationed in the towns surrounding Rome. This system was not radically changed with the appointment by Augustus in 2 BC of two [[Praetorian prefect]]s, [[Quintus Ostorius Scapula]] and [[Publius Salvius Aper]], although organization and command were enhanced. Tacitus reports that the number of cohorts was increased to twelve from nine in AD 47. In AD 69 it was briefly increased to sixteen cohorts by [[Vitellius]], but [[Vespasian]] quickly reduced it again to nine.<ref>Bingham 1997, pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n==== Under the Julio-Claudian dynasty ====\nIn Rome, their principal duty was to mount the Guard at the house of Augustus on the Palatine, where the centuries and the [[turma]]e of the cohort in service mounted the guard outside the emperor's palace (the interior guard of the palace was mounted by the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]], often also referred to as ''[[Batavi (military unit)|Batavi]]'', and the ''[[Statores]]''<ref>In Rome, near the Emperor, they were designated as [[Statores Augusti]] (''Statores Praetorianorum'' starting from the 3rd century); they formed a ''[[Numerus (Roman military unit)|numerus]]'' assigned by the Praetorian prefect. This ''numerus'' was formed of five principal centuries which commanded the [[military police]]. At their head, there was a ''[[Curator Statorum]]'' and a ''[[Praefectus Statorum]]''.</ref> Augusti, a sort of [[military police]] which were found in the general staff headquarters of the Roman Army). Every afternoon, the ''[[tribunus cohortis]]'' would receive the password from the emperor personally. The command of this cohort was assumed directly by the emperor and not by the Praetorian prefect. After the construction of the Praetorian camp in 23 BC, there was another similar serving [[tribune]] placed in the Praetorian camp accordingly. Their functions included, among many, the escort of the emperor and the members of the imperial family, and if necessary to act as a sort of anti-riot police. Certain [[List of Roman and Byzantine Empresses|Empresses]] exclusively commanded their own [[Imperial Guard|Praetorian Guard]].\n\nAccording to Tacitus, in the year 23 BC, there were nine Praetorian cohorts (4500 men, the equivalent of a legion) to maintain peace in [[Italy]]; three were stationed in Rome, and the others, nearby.\n\nTheir mandatory service period was shorter than that of the legionaries: 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions in 13 BC: these were increased respectively to 16 and 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus, and their pay was higher than that of a legionary.\n\nAn inscription recently discovered suggests that, towards the end of the reign of [[Augustus]], the number of cohorts increased to 12 during a brief period.<ref name=Rankov /> This inscription referred to one man who was the tribune of two successive cohorts: the eleventh cohort, apparently at the end of the reign of Augustus, and the fourth at the beginning of the reign of [[Tiberius]]. According to Tacitus, there were only nine cohorts in 23 AD. The three urban cohorts, which were numbered consecutively after the Praetorian cohorts, were removed near the end of the reign of Augustus; it seemed probable that the last three Praetorian cohorts were simply renamed as [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]].\n\nThe first intervention of the Praetorians on a battlefield since the wars of the end of the Republic took place during the ''mutinies of [[Pannonia]]'' and the ''mutinies of [[Germania]]''. On the death of Augustus in AD 14, his successor Tiberius was confronted by mutinies in the two armies of the ''Rhine'' and ''Pannonia'', who were protesting about their conditions of service, in comparison with the Praetorians. The forces of Pannonia were dealt with by [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], son of Tiberius (not to be confused with [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], brother of Tiberius), accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian Cavalry, and [[Imperial German Bodyguard]]s. The mutiny in Germania was repressed by the nephew and designated heir of Tiberius, [[Germanicus]], who later led legions and detachments of the Guard in a two-year campaign in Germania, and succeeded in recovering two of the three legionary [[Aquila (Roman)|eagles]] which had been lost at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].\n\nIt was under [[Tiberius]] that Lucius Aelius Seianus ([[Sejanus]]) rose in power and was among the first prefects to exploit his position to pursue his own ambitions. He concentrated under his command all the Praetorian cohorts in the new camp. Sejanus held the title of prefect jointly with his father, under Augustus, but became sole prefect in AD 15. He used that position to render himself essential to the new emperor Tiberius, who was unable to persuade the Senate to share the responsibility of governing the Empire. Sejanus, however, alienated Drusus, son of Tiberius, and when the heir to the throne, [[Germanicus]], died in AD 19, he was worried that Drusus would become the new emperor. Accordingly, he poisoned Drusus with the help of the latter's wife, and then immediately launched a ruthless elimination program against all competitors, persuading Tiberius to make him his heir apparent. He almost succeeded, but his plot was discovered and revealed in AD 31 and he was subsequently killed. Emperor Tiberius used for this purpose the ''[[Cohortes urbanae]]'' which were not under the control of [[Sejanus]].\n\nIn AD 37 Caligula became emperor with the support of [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], Sejanus' successor as prefect of the Praetorian Guard. Under Caligula, whose reign lasted until AD 41, the overall strength of the Guard increased from 9 to 12 Praetorian cohorts.\n\n[[File:Proclaiming claudius emperor.png|thumb|left|250px|''Proclaiming Claudius Emperor'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], oil on canvas, 1867. According to one version of the story of Claudius' accession, members of the Praetorian Guard found him hiding behind a curtain in the aftermath of the assassination of Caligula in AD 41, and proclaimed him emperor.]]\n\nIn year 41, it was disgust and hostility of a praetorian tribune, named [[Cassius Chaerea]] \u2013 whom [[Caligula]] teased without mercy due to his squeaky voice \u2013 which led to the assassination of the emperor by officers of the guard. While the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] sacked all in a search to apprehend the murderers, the Senate proclaimed the restoration of a Republic. The Praetorians, who were pillaging the Palace, discovered [[Claudius]], uncle of [[Caligula]], hidden behind a curtain. Needing an emperor to justify their own existence, they brought him forth to the Praetorian camp and proclaimed him emperor. He is the first emperor proclaimed by the Praetorian Guard and compensated the guard with a prime bonus worth five years their salary. The Praetorians accompanied Emperor Claudius to Britain in 43 AD.\n\nWhen Claudius was poisoned, the Guard transferred their allegiance to [[Nero]] through the influence of his Praetorian prefect [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]], who exercised a beneficial influence on the new emperor during the first five years of his reign. Officers of the Guard, including one of the two successors of [[Sextus Afranius Burrus|Burrus]] as the Praetorian prefect, participated in [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso|Piso]]'s conspiracy in year 65. The other Praetorian prefect, [[Tigellinus]], headed the suppression of the conspiracy, and the Guard was compensated with a bonus of 500 denarii for each man.\n\n==== Year of the Four Emperors ====\n{{main|Year of the Four Emperors}}\nIn AD 69, the new colleague of Tigellinus, [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], managed to have the Praetorian Guard abandon [[Nero]] in favor of the contender [[Galba]]. [[Nymphidius Sabinus]] had promised 7500 [[denarius]] per man, but Galba refused to pay that amount because he stated \"It is my habit to recruit soldiers and not buy them\". This permitted his rival [[Otho]] to bribe 23 [[Speculatores]] of the Praetorian Guard to proclaim him emperor. Despite the opposition of the cohorts in service in the palace, Galba and his designated successor, the young Piso, were lynched on January 15.\n\nAfter supporting Otho against a third contender [[Vitellius]], the Praetorians were restrained following defeat and their centurions executed. They were replaced by 16 cohorts recruited from the legionnaires and auxiliaries loyal to Vitellius, almost 16,000 men. These ex-Praetorians then aided [[Vespasian]], the fourth Emperor, leading the attack against the Praetorian camp.\n\n==== Flavian dynasty ====\nUnder the Flavians, the Praetorians formed 9 new cohorts, of which [[Titus]], son of the emperor [[Vespasian]], became the prefect. [[Vespasian]] returned the effective strength of each unit to five hundred men. He also cancelled the guard service of the Praetorians at the entry to the emperor's palace, but retained guards within the palace itself.\n\nUnder Vespasian's second son, [[Domitian]], the number of cohorts was increased to 10, and the Praetorian Guard participated in fighting in [[Germania]] and on the [[Danube]] against the [[Dacians]]. It was in the course of these actions that the prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]] was defeated and killed in 86.\n\n==== Antonine dynasty ====\nFollowing assassination of [[Domitian]] in 96 the Praetorians demanded the execution of their prefect, [[Titus Petronius Secundus]], who had been implicated in the murder. The Guard supported [[Trajan]], commander of the Army of the Rhine, as new emperor.\n\nAt the death of [[Nerva]], at the beginning of 98, [[Trajan]] executed the remaining Praetorian prefect and his partisans. Trajan returned to Rome from the Rhine, probably accompanied by the new unit of ''[[equites singulares Augusti]]''. The Praetorian Guard had participated in the two [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars of Trajan]] (Dacian Wars 101\u2013102 and 105\u2013106). The Praetorian Guard served in the last [[Trajan's Parthian campaign|campaign of Trajan against the Parthians of 113\u2013117]].\n\nDuring the 2nd century, the Praetorian Guard accompanied [[Lucius Verus]] in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 161\u2013166|Oriental War Campaign of 161\u2013166 AD]], as well as accompanying [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] in his northern campaigns between 169\u2013175 and 178\u2013180. Two prefects were killed during these expeditions.\n\nWith the accession of [[Commodus]], in 180, the Praetorian Guard returned to Rome. [[Tigidius Perennis]] (AD 182\u2013185) and [[freedman]] [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander]] (AD 186\u2013190) exercised considerable influence on the emperor. [[Tigidius Perennis|Perennis]] was killed by a delegation of 1500 persons of [[Great Britain]] which came forth to complain about his interference in the affairs of the province (a delegation of [[Lanciarii]] of the 3 legions of Great Britain). Cleander abused his influence to nominate and dismiss prefects.\n\nIn 188, Cleander obtained the joint command of the Guard with the two prefects. Cleander ordered a massacre of civilians carried by the ''equites singulares Augusti'' which led to an arranged battle with the [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]].\n\n==== Severan dynasty ====\nCommodus fell victim to a conspiracy directed by his Praetorian prefect [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]] in 192. The new emperor [[Pertinax]], who took part in the conspiracy, paid the Praetorians a premium of 3,000 [[denarius|denarii]]; however he was assassinated three months later, on March 28 193, by a group of Guards. The Praetorians then put the empire up to auction and [[Didius Julianus]] bought the title of emperor. However the armies of the Danube chose instead the governor of [[Pannonia Superior]], [[Septimius Severus]], who besieged Rome and tricked the Praetorians when they came out unarmed. The Praetorian Guard was dissolved and replaced by men transferred from his own army.\n\nThe new Guard of Septimius Severus made their mark against his rival [[Clodius Albinus]] at the [[Battle of Lugdunum|Battle of Lyon]] in 197, and accompanied the emperor to the [[Orient]] from 197 to 202, then to [[Britannia]] from 208 until his death at [[York]] in 211.\n\n[[Caracalla]], son of [[Septimius Severus]], lost favour with his troops by assassinating his own brother and co-emperor, Geta, immediately after his succession. He also created problems by trying to recreate a Macedonian phalanx witnessed previously in the Roman Army. Finally, in 217, while on campaign in the [[Orient]], he was assassinated at the instigation of his prefect [[Macrinus]].\n\nAfter the elimination of the latter, the Praetorians opposed the new emperor [[Elagabalus]], priest of the oriental cult of Elagabal, and replaced him by his 13-year-old cousin [[Severus Alexander]] in 222.\n\nIn this period the position of [[Praetorian prefect]] in [[Italy]] came increasingly to resemble a general administrative post, and there was a tendency to appoint jurists such as [[Papinian]], who occupied the post from 203 until his elimination and execution at the ascent of Caracalla. Under [[Severus Alexander]] the [[Praetorian prefecture]] was held by the lawyer [[Ulpian]] until his assassination by the Praetorian Guard in the presence of the emperor himself.\n\n==== 3rd century ====\nIn the spring of 238, under [[Maximinus Thrax]], the bulk of the Praetorian Guard was employed on active service. Defended by only a small residual garrison, the Praetorian camp was attacked by a civilian crowd acting in support of [[Roman Senate|senators]] in revolt against the Gordian emperors. The failure of Maximinus Thrax to win the [[civil war]] against the contenders [[Gordian I]] and [[Gordian II]] led to his death at the hands of his own troops, including the Praetorians. The senatorial candidates for the throne, [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]], recalled the Praetorian Guard to Rome, only to find themselves under attack by the Praetorians. Both were killed on July 29 238 and [[Gordian III]] triumphed.\n\nAfter 238, literary and epigraphic sources dry up, and information on the Praetorian Guard becomes rare. In 249, the Praetorians assassinated [[Philippus II]], son of the emperor [[Philip the Arab]]. In 272, in the reign of the emperor [[Aurelian]], they took part in an expedition against [[Palmyra]]. In 284, Diocletian reduced the status of the Praetorians; they were no longer to be part of palace life, as Diocletian lived in [[Nicomedia]], some 60 miles (100&nbsp;km) from [[Byzantium]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Two new corps, the [[Jovians and Herculians|Ioviani and Herculiani]] (named after the gods Jove, or [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Hercules]], associated with the senior and junior emperor), replaced the Praetorians as the personal protectors of the emperors, a practice that remained intact with the [[Tetrarchy]]. In 297 they were in [[Africa]] with [[Maximian]]. By the time Diocletian retired on May 1, 305, their ''Castra Praetoria'' seems to have housed only a minor garrison of Rome.\n\n==== Dissolution ====\nDuring the early [[4th century]], ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' [[Flavius Valerius Severus]] attempted to disband the Praetorian Guard on the orders of [[Galerius]]. In response, the Praetorians turned to [[Maxentius]], the son of the retired emperor Maximian, and proclaimed him their emperor on 28 October 306. By 312, however, [[Constantine the Great]] marched on Rome with an army in order to eliminate Maxentius and gain control of the [[Western Roman Empire]], resulting in the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]. Ultimately, Constantine's army achieved a decisive victory against the Praetorians, whose emperor was killed during the fighting. With the death of Maxentius, Constantine definitively disbanded the remnants of the Praetorian Guard. The remaining soldiers were sent out to various corners of the empire, and the ''Castra Praetoria'' was dismantled in a grand gesture inaugurating a new age in Roman history and ending that of the Praetorians.\n\n=== Participation in wars ===\nWhile campaigning, the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman army. On the death of Augustus in 14 AD, his successor, Tiberius, was faced with mutinies among both the Rhine and [[Pannonian]] legions. According to [[Tacitus]], the Pannonian forces were dealt with by Tiberius' son [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]], accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian cavalry and some of the [[German bodyguard]]. The German mutiny was put down by Tiberius' nephew and adopted son [[Germanicus]], his intended heir, who then led the legions and detachments of the Guard in an invasion of Germany over the next two years. The Guard saw much action in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] in 69, fighting well for [[Otho]] at the first [[battle of Bedriacum]]. Under [[Domitian]] and [[Trajan]], the guard took part in wars from [[Dacia]] to [[Mesopotamia]], while with [[Marcus Aurelius]], years were spent on the Danubian frontier during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. Throughout the 3rd century, the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns.\n\n=== Political role ===\nPraetorian Cohorts intervened on numerous occasions in the struggle for the imperial succession. Lacking troops of its own, the Senate had no choice each time but to accept the choice of the Praetorians as well as that of the various legions. The new emperor was always proclaimed by the Praetorians before being ratified by the Senate and the legions stationed in the various provinces.\n\nAfter the death of Sejanus, who was sacrificed for the [[donativum|donative]] (imperial gift) promised by Tiberius, the Guards began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody game in the Empire. For the right price, or at will, they assassinated emperors, bullied their own prefects, or turned on the people of Rome. In 41, [[Caligula]] was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard, along with his wife and daughter. The Praetorians placed his uncle [[Claudius]] on the throne, daring the Senate to oppose their decision. In 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], after the emperor [[Galba]] failed to provide a donative for the Praetorians, they transferred their allegiance to [[Otho]] and assassinated the emperor. Otho acquiesced in the Praetorians' demands and granted them the right to appoint their own prefects, ensuring their loyalty. After defeating Otho, [[Vitellius]] disbanded the Guard and established a new Guard sixteen cohorts strong. [[Vespasian]] relied in the war against Vitellius upon the disgruntled cohorts the emperor had dismissed, and reduced the number of cohorts back to nine upon becoming emperor himself. As a further safeguard, he appointed his son, [[Titus]], as Praetorian prefect.<ref>Bingham 1997, pp. 118\u2013122.</ref>\n\nWhile the guard had the power to make or break emperors, it had no formal role in government administration, unlike the personnel of the palace, the Senate, and the bureaucracy. Often after an outrageous act of violence, revenge by the new ruler was forthcoming. In 193, [[Didius Julianus]] purchased the Empire from the Guard for a vast sum, when the Guard auctioned it off after killing [[Pertinax]]. Later that year [[Septimius Severus]] marched into Rome, disbanded the Guard and started a new formation from his own Pannonian legions. Unruly mobs in Rome often fought with the Praetorians in [[Maximinus Thrax]]'s reign in vicious street battles.\n\nIn 271, [[Aurelian]] sailed east to destroy the power of [[Palmyra]], Syria, with a force of legionary detachments, Praetorian cohorts, and other cavalry units, and easily defeated the Palmyrenes. This led to the orthodox view that [[Diocletian]] and his colleagues evolved the ''sacer comitatus'' (the field escort of the emperors). The ''sacer comitatus'' included field units that used a selection process and command structure modeled after the old Praetorian cohorts, but it was not of uniform composition and was much larger than a Praetorian cohort.\n\n=== Organization ===\n==== Leadership ====\n{{Main|Praetorian prefect|Praetorian prefecture}}\n\nStarting in the year 2 BC, the [[Praetorian prefect]] was the commanding officer of the Praetorian Guard (previously each cohort was independent and under the orders of a [[tribune]] of [[Equites|equestrian]] rank). This role (chief of all troops stationed in Rome), was in practice a key position of the Roman [[polity]].\n\nFrom [[Vespasian]] onwards the [[Praetorian prefecture]] was always held by an equestrian of the ''eques'' order. (''Equestrians'' were traditionally that class of citizens who could equip themselves to serve in the Roman Army on [[cavalry|horseback]]).\n\nFrom the year 2 BC, the cohorts were under the control of two prefectures; however cohorts continued to be organized independently, each commanded by a tribune. Tribunes had as immediate subordinates ordinary [[Centurion]]s, all of equal rank except for the ''[[Trecenarius]]'', the first and prime of all centurions of the Praetorian Cohorts, who commanded also the 300 ''[[speculatores]]'', and with the exception of his second, the ''[[Prince Castrorum]]''.<ref name=Bohec21 />\n\nFrom the second century the Praetorian prefect oversaw not only the Praetorian Cohorts but also the rest of the garrison of Rome, including the ''[[Cohortes urbanae]]'' (\"urban cohorts\") and the ''equites singulares Augusti'', but not the [[Vigiles|''Vigiles'' cohorts]].\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Praetorian Cohorts by the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] after he defeated them at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312, the role of the Praetorian prefect in the Empire became purely administrative, ruling large territories (''prefectures'') comprising Roman [[diocese]]s (geographical subdivisions of the [[Roman Empire]]) in the name of the Emperor.\n\n==== Size and composition ====\nThe Praetorian Cohorts were designated as ''Equitatae'' ([[cavalry]]) ''[[Turma]]e'' (troops) with [[Roman legion|centuries]] formed of [[infantry]], initially of 500 men each.<ref name=Bohec21>Y. Le Bohec, ''L'Arm\u00e9e Romaine'', Picard, 1989, {{ISBN|2-7084-0744-9}}</ref>\n\nIn order not to alienate the population of Rome, while conserving Republican civilian traditions, the Praetorians did not wear their armor while in the heart of the city. Instead they often wore a formal toga, which distinguished them from civilians but remained in a respectable civilian attire, the mark of a Roman citizen. Augustus, conscious of risking the only military force present in the city, often avoided concentrating them and imposed this dress code.\n\nFrom the reign of Tiberius, their camp was situated on the [[Quirinal]] Hill, outside Rome. In 26 AD, [[Sejanus]], Praetorian prefect, and the favorite of emperor [[Tiberius]], united the [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]] with nine Praetorian Cohorts, dispersed at that time throughout [[Italy]], in one large camp situated beyond the [[Servian Wall]], on the Esquiline Hill, the ''[[Castra Praetoria]]''.\n\nFor the 2nd century, calculations from lists of significant demobilisations suggest an increase in size to nearly 1,500 men per cohort (perhaps a doubling of 800 (since [[Vespasian]]), probably organized in 20 centuries) under [[Commodus]] in year (187\u2013188) or under [[Septimius Severus]] (193\u2013211), which matches the probable numbers of effectives for Urban Cohorts during the time of [[Cassius Dio]]. These figures suggest an overall size for the Guard of 4,500\u20136,000 men under [[Augustus]], 12,800 under [[Vitellius]], 7,200 under [[Vespasian]], 8,000 from [[Domitian]] until [[Commodus]] or [[Septimius Severus]], and 15,000 later on.<ref name=Rankov>Dr Boris Rankov, ''The Praetorian Guard'', Osprey Publishing, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-85532-361-2}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 2nd century, Italians made up 89% of the Praetorian Guard. Under [[Septimius Severus]], recruitment evolved to authorize the inclusion of legionaries of the Roman army, as well as of the battle hardened ''Army of the Danube''. Severus stationed his supporters with him in Rome, and the Praetorian Guards remained loyal to his choices.\n\n==== Praetorian Cavalry ====\nInitially each cohort included, as for a [[Roman legion]], a [[cavalry]] detachment; this should not be confused with the ''equites singulares Augusti'' who appeared under the emperor [[Trajan]]. The Praetorian could become a cavalryman (''Eques'') after almost five years service in the [[infantry]]. These Praetorians remained listed in their Centuries of origin, but operated in a ''[[turma]]'' of 30 men each commanded by an ''[[Optioequitum]]''.\n\nThere was probably one ''turma'' of cavalry for two centuries of infantry.<ref name=Rankov /> Hence, three ''turmae'' per cohorts of the ''Augustan period'', five per cohort in 100 CE\u2013200 CE, and ten per cohort after 200 CE, with a ''[[vexillum]]'' (flag) as emblem for each ''turma''.\n\n==== Speculatores Augusti ====\nThe ''[[speculatores]] Augusti'' were cavalrymen assigned to the same tasks as the ''[[Speculatores]]'' of the legions and the [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments|auxiliary units]] (messengers in charge of transmitting intelligence, and clandestine agents).\n\nAbout 300 in total (30 per cohort), they formed a unit under the orders of the senior [[Centurion]], the ''[[Trecenarius]]''. Selected for their impressive physique, they were used by the Emperor for [[clandestine operations]] and tasks such as arrests, imprisonment, and executions.\n\nOne of their roles was to accompany the emperor on his foreign campaign journeys (a role which would later be handled by the ''Singulares''/''equites singulares Augusti''). [[Claudius]] was in the habit of surrounding himself with ''Speculatores'' when attending dinners.\n\nThe close security protection detail of Galba, of [[Otho]] and the dynastic line of the Flavians appear to have been formed of ''[[Speculatores]]'' (who replaced the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] disbanded by [[Galba]]).\n\nFollowing the assassination of emperor [[Domitian]], his successor [[Nerva]] was placed under the protection of [[Trajan]], to counter possible revenge attempts and mutinies. Trajan was commander of the most important army of the time, that of the Army of Germania, and he nominated him as his heir. Accordingly, and following such an act, [[Trajan]], aiming to reinforce his security detail in relation to the ''Speculatores'' who had remained loyal to Domitian, replaced them as close protection security detail with the ''Singulares''/''equites singulares Augusti'' (modelled on the ''Singulares'' of a provincial governor, a post held by [[Trajan]]). The some 300 ''[[Speculatores]]'' were reassigned by [[Trajan]] to the corps of Praetorian cohorts.<ref name=Bohec21 />\n\nThey were distinguished by a special (but unknown) style of boots, the ''Speculatoria Caliga'' (according to [[Suetonius]]) and they received special honorific diplomas in bronze at demobilization. They had their own Equestrian instructors (''Exercitatores'').<ref name=Rankov />\n\n=== Service in the Praetorian Guard ===\n[[File:Q.PomponiusPoeninus.jpg|thumb|right200px| Funeral inscription of Quintus Pomponius Poeninus, soldier of the IV Praetorian Cohort<ref>Mus\u00e9e de [[C\u00e1ceres (Espagne)|C\u00e1ceres]]. ''Q(uintus) Pomponius Potentinus / Ser(gia) h(ic) s(itus) e(st) / C(aius) Pomponius Potentinus / mil(es) c(o)hor(tis) IIII praet(oriae) / test(amento) fieri iussit''.</ref>]]\n\nOriginally, the Praetorian Guard was recruited from the populations of central [[Italy]] ([[Etruria]], [[Umbria]] and [[Latium]] according to [[Tacitus]]). Recruits were between 15 and 32 years of age, compared to legionary recruits who ranged from 18 to 23 years of age. According to [[Cassius Dio]], during the first two centuries AD and before the reform of [[Septimius Severus]], the Praetorians were exclusively limited to [[Italy]], Spain (Roman province), [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Noricum]] (current [[Austria]]).\n\nUnder the reign of [[Vitellius]], and starting from [[Septimius Severus]], men were transferred from the [[Vigiles Urbanus|Urban Vigiles]], [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban cohorts]], and the various [[Roman legion|legions]]. This recent method and manner of recruitment at the corps of the legions became the normal procedure to recruit in the 3rd century after [[Septimius Severus]] dealt with the undisciplined Praetorians who assassinated [[Pertinax]] in 193, and replaced them with men from his own Danube legions.\n\nAt that time, the Praetorians represented the best soldiers from the legions (principally from Illyria). They were a group of elite of soldiers starting from the 3rd century, and not a category of socially privileged soldiers (such as the Italians at the time of [[Augustus]]). The Italians formed the base of the recruitment of the ''Legio II Parthica'', a new legion created and stationed in Italy.\n\nTo be admitted to the Guard, a man had to be in good physical condition, have a [[good moral character]], and come from a respectable family. In addition, he had to make use of all sorts of patronages available to him in order to obtain letters of recommendations from important leading figures in society. Once past the recruitment procedure he was designated as ''Probatus'', and assigned as a ''Miles'' (soldier) to one of the centuries of a cohort. After two years, if he attracted the attention of his superiors by influence or merit, he could attain the post of ''Immunis'' (similar to corporal), perhaps as a commis (junior chief) at general headquarters or as a technician. This promotion exempted him from daily chores. After another two years he could be promoted to ''Principalis'', with a double salary, in charge of delivering messages (''Tesserarius'') or as an assistant centurion (''Optio'') or standard bearer (''Signifer'') at the corps of the century; or, if literate and numerate, he could join the administrative staff of the prefect.\n\nOnly a few soldiers could attain the rank of ''Principalis''; however those that did, during the course of their service, were designated ''Evocati Augusti'' by the emperor. This designation allowed them to be promoted to technical administrative posts, or instructors in Rome, or to a century in a legion, and accordingly extend their career. Certain ''principalis'' could at the end of their career be promoted to [[Centurion]] in the Guard; this would be the peak of his career. Anyone ambitious for further promotion would need to transfer to a legion.\n\nThe [[Military tribune]]s (''Tribuni Militum'') at the head of the cohorts were [[Roman cavalry]]men. In contrast to many superior cadres of the Army, who originated from the Equestrian Order, these tribunes started their career in the ranks of the Guard and were promoted from the ranks in the hierarchy. Next after becoming [[Centurion]]s, they had to serve for a period of one year as superior centurions in one or several legions before achieving the status of ''[[Primus pilus]]'' (the highest ranked [[Centurion]] in a legion). Upon return to [[Rome]], they occupied successively the positions of Tribunes of the Vigiles, Tribune of the Urban Cohort and finally Tribune of the Guard.<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180>[[Paul Petit (historian)|Paul Petit]], ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Empire romain'', Seuil, 1974, {{ISBN|2020026775}}, p. 180</ref>\n\nOther leading paths towards the tribunate were possible, including service entirely made in the legions, attaining the rank of ''[[Primus pilus]]'' before departing to Rome. Nevertheless, all tribunes were combat veterans with extensive military experience.<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180 /> Each tribune served in Rome for one year, following which, a certain number of the men would retire.\n\nA few of them, ranking placement at the top of the hierarchy, could obtain a second term as ''Primus Pilus'' and advance towards the superior echelons of the equestrian career<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180 /> possibly becoming the [[Praetorian prefect]].\n\nThe majority of the prefects, however, were ordinary men of the equestrian rank by birth. The men who attained the command of the Guard following year 2 BC were [[equites]] with an elevated seniority, classifying right behind the prefect of Egypt. Starting from [[Vespasian]], whose son, [[Titus]] was himself a Praetorian prefect, they were ranked first.\n\n=== Equipment and traditions ===\nThe Praetorian Guard, like all legionnaires, disposed of various [[Roman military personal equipment|equipment]] to execute different missions. More particularly as bodyguard, escort or reserve military force, they housed adaptable equipment for each function.\n\nFor heavy packed combat infantry lines ([[Roman infantry tactics|Triplex Acies System]]), they mounted helmets, armor ([[Lorica segmentata]], [[Mail (armour)|Lorica hamata]], [[Lorica squamata]] specially in the 2nd and 3rd centuries), heavy colorful shields ([[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]), heavy javelins ([[Pilum|pila]]), and later even long spears and lighter javelins (hastas, lancea).\n\nPraetorian Guard helmets included tall [[Galea (helmet)|Galea]] with elaborate detail worked into the metal. Shields were ovoid and more robust compared with the regular rectangular shape sometimes used by the legions. Each legion had its own emblem displayed on its [[Scutum (shield)]] and the Praetorian Guard were probably the only unit to include additional insignia on their shields. Each cohort had their own version of Praetorian insignia. Praetorian Guard units could wear lion skin capes and their colours were so decorated with awards, that the men had difficulty in carrying them on long marches.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard colours included the winged [[Victoria (mythology)|goddess of victory]].\n\nFor escorts, the oval shields and lances replaced the scuta and pila. Missions in Rome at the heart of the city in principle were forbidden to soldiers, so they wore a toga.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard, like all legionaries, shared similar insignia, mainly on their shields. Praetorian Guard shields included [[Aquila (Roman)|wings]] and [[thunderbolt]]s, referring to the [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] form of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and also uniquely included Scorpions, [[Stars]] and [[Crescent]]s.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pr\u00e4torianer.jpg|A Praetorian soldier from the 2nd century AD \u2013 retrieved in [[Pozzuoli]] (1800).\nFile:CLAUDIUS - RIC I 25 - 792104.jpg|[[Claudius]], the [[Roman Emperor|4th Emperor]] of the [[Roman Empire]] AD 41\u201354.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Ancient Greece]]\n* [[Frumentarii]]\n* [[Kheshig]]\n* [[Praetorianism]]\n* [[Pushtigban]]\n* [[Scholae Palatinae]]\n* [[Varangian Guard]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References and further reading==\n* Sandra J.

During the era of the [[Roman Republic]], the Praetorians served as a small escort force for high-ranking officials such as senators or provincial governors like procurators, and also serving as bodyguards for high-ranking officers within the Roman legions. With the republic's transition into the [[Roman Empire]], however, the first emperor, [[Augustus]], founded the Guard as his personal security detail. Although they continued to serve in this capacity for roughly three centuries, the Guard became notable for its intrigue and interference in Roman politics, to the point of overthrowing emperors and proclaiming their successors. In 312, the Guard was disbanded by [[Constantine the Great]].\n\n== Under the Roman Republic ==\nPraetorians originated as guards of [[Roman general]]s during the [[Roman Republic]]. They are first recorded as bodyguards of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipio]] family around 275 BC. Generals with ''[[imperium]]'' (the right to command an army) were [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]]s or [[promagistrate]]s, accompanied at all times by their [[lictor]]s, who would act as close protection. [[Roman consul|Consul]]s and [[proconsul]]s had twelve lictors, whilst [[praetor]]s and [[propraetor]]s had six; enough to guard the general's tent in camp, but too few to be effective as a bodyguard in battle. There was no permanent bodyguard formation, so some military officers began to surround themselves with temporary units of hand-picked soldiers to ensure their security during battle. For example, during the [[Siege of Numantia]], [[Scipio Aemilianus]] formed a troop of 500 men to protect himself against [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]]s, which were often directed at commanders. This practice become more widespread in the [[Roman army of the late Republic|army of the late Republic]], as generals remained on campaign for longer periods. In camp, the bodyguard would sleep close to the commander, whose tent was known as the ''[[praetorium]]''. Accordingly, the picked guard became known as ''cohors praetoria''. In battle, these [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s would act as a final [[Military reserve|reserve]].\n\nAt the end of the year 40 BC, the [[second triumvirate|triumvirs]] [[Octavian]] and [[Mark Antony]] both operated praetorian units of hand-picked veterans. Octavian garrisoned his praetorians within the [[pomerium|sacred boundary of Rome]], the first time troops had been permanently stationed in the city. Antony commanded three cohorts in the [[Orient]] and in 32 BC, he issued coins in honor of his praetorians. According to Paul Orose,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Octavian commanded five cohorts at the [[Battle of Actium]]. Following his victory at Actium, Octavian merged his forces with those of his adversary in a symbolic reunification. When Octavian became Augustus, the first [[Roman emperor]], he retained the praetorians as his personal bodyguard force.\n\n== Under the empire ==\n[[File:Lens - Inauguration du Louvre-Lens le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2012, la Galerie du Temps, n\u00b0 058.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Praetorians Relief]] with an [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]] grasping a [[thunderbolt]] through its claws, in reference, to the [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' form of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].]]\nThe legionaries known as the Praetorian Guard were first hand-picked veterans of the Roman army who served as [[bodyguards]] to the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]. First established by Augustus, members of the Guard accompanied him on active campaign and served as [[secret police]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} protecting the civic administrations and rule of law imposed by the senate and the emperor. The Praetorian Guard was ultimately dissolved by Emperor [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century. They were distinct from the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] which provided close personal protection for the early Western Roman emperors.\n\nThey benefited from several advantages due their close proximity with the emperor: the Praetorians were the only ones admitted while bearing arms in the center of sacred [[Rome]] \u2013 the ''[[Pomerium]]''.\n\nTheir mandatory service was shorter in duration, for instance : 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions starting year 13 BC, then carried to, respectively, 16 to 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus.\n\nTheir pay was higher than that of a legionary. Under [[Nero]], the pay of a Praetorian was three and a half times that of a legionary, augmented by prime additions of ''[[donativum]]'', granted by each new emperor. This additional pay was the equivalent of several years of pay, and was often repeated at important events of the empire, or events that touched the imperial family: birthdays, births and marriages. Major monetary distributions or food subsidies renewed and compensated the fidelity of the Praetorians following each failed particular attempted plot (such as that of Messalina against Claudius in AD 48 or Piso against Nero in AD 65). The Praetorians received substantially higher pay<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman Economy \u2013 Prices in Ancient Rome|url=http://www.ancientcoins.biz/pages/economy/ |publisher=Ancientcoins.bis |accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> than other Roman soldiers in any of the legions, on a system known as ''sesquiplex stipendum'', or by pay-and-a-half. So if the legionaries received 250 [[Denarius|denarii]], the guards received 375 per annum (year). [[Domitian]] and [[Septimius Severus]] increased the ''stipendum'' (payment) to 1,500 denarii per year, distributed in January, May and September.\n\nFeared and dreaded by the population and by the [[Roman Senate]], the Praetorians received no sympathy from the Roman people. A famous poem by [[Juvenal]] recalls the nail left in his foot by the sandal of a Praetorian rushing by him. \"Praetorian\" has a pejorative sense in [[French language|French]], recalling the often troubling role of the ''Praetorian'' of antiquity.\n\n=== History ===\nIn [[ancient Rome]], ''[[praetor]]s'' were either civic or military leaders. The ''praetorianus'' were initially elite guards for military praetors, under the Republic.<ref>[http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-praetorian-guard 8 Things You May Not Know About the Praetorian Guard]</ref> As the Republic ended, the first emperor, Augustus, set up an elite guard of praetorianus to protect himself.\n\nThe early Praetorian Guard differed greatly from that in later times, which came to be a vital force in the power politics of Rome. While Augustus understood the need to have a protector in the maelstrom of Rome, he was careful to uphold the [[Principate|Republican veneer]] of his regime. Thus, he allowed only nine cohorts to be formed, each originally consisting of 500 men. He then increased them to 1,000 men each, but allowed three units to be kept on duty at any given time in the capital. A small number of detached cavalry units (''[[turma]]e'') of 30 men each were also organized. While they patrolled inconspicuously in the palace and major buildings, the others were stationed in the towns surrounding Rome. This system was not radically changed with the appointment by Augustus in 2 BC of two [[Praetorian prefect]]s, [[Quintus Ostorius Scapula]] and [[Publius Salvius Aper]], although organization and command were enhanced. Tacitus reports that the number of cohorts was increased to twelve from nine in AD 47. In AD 69 it was briefly increased to sixteen cohorts by [[Vitellius]], but [[Vespasian]] quickly reduced it again to nine.<ref>Bingham 1997, pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n==== Under the Julio-Claudian dynasty ====\nIn Rome, their principal duty was to mount the Guard at the house of Augustus on the Palatine, where the centuries and the [[turma]]e of the cohort in service mounted the guard outside the emperor's palace (the interior guard of the palace was mounted by the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]], often also referred to as ''[[Batavi (military unit)|Batavi]]'', and the ''[[Statores]]''<ref>In Rome, near the Emperor, they were designated as [[Statores Augusti]] (''Statores Praetorianorum'' starting from the 3rd century); they formed a ''[[Numerus (Roman military unit)|numerus]]'' assigned by the Praetorian prefect. This ''numerus'' was formed of five principal centuries which commanded the [[military police]]. At their head, there was a ''[[Curator Statorum]]'' and a ''[[Praefectus Statorum]]''.</ref> Augusti, a sort of [[military police]] which were found in the general staff headquarters of the Roman Army). Every afternoon, the ''[[tribunus cohortis]]'' would receive the password from the emperor personally. The command of this cohort was assumed directly by the emperor and not by the Praetorian prefect. After the construction of the Praetorian camp in 23 BC, there was another similar serving [[tribune]] placed in the Praetorian camp accordingly. Their functions included, among many, the escort of the emperor and the members of the imperial family, and if necessary to act as a sort of anti-riot police. Certain [[List of Roman and Byzantine Empresses|Empresses]] exclusively commanded their own [[Imperial Guard|Praetorian Guard]].\n\nAccording to Tacitus, in the year 23 BC, there were nine Praetorian cohorts (4500 men, the equivalent of a legion) to maintain peace in [[Italy]]; three were stationed in Rome, and the others, nearby.\n\nTheir mandatory service period was shorter than that of the legionaries: 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions in 13 BC: these were increased respectively to 16 and 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus, and their pay was higher than that of a legionary.\n\nAn inscription recently discovered suggests that, towards the end of the reign of [[Augustus]], the number of cohorts increased to 12 during a brief period.<ref name=Rankov /> This inscription referred to one man who was the tribune of two successive cohorts: the eleventh cohort, apparently at the end of the reign of Augustus, and the fourth at the beginning of the reign of [[Tiberius]]. According to Tacitus, there were only nine cohorts in 23 AD. The three urban cohorts, which were numbered consecutively after the Praetorian cohorts, were removed near the end of the reign of Augustus; it seemed probable that the last three Praetorian cohorts were simply renamed as [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]].\n\nThe first intervention of the Praetorians on a battlefield since the wars of the end of the Republic took place during the ''mutinies of [[Pannonia]]'' and the ''mutinies of [[Germania]]''. On the death of Augustus in AD 14, his successor Tiberius was confronted by mutinies in the two armies of the ''Rhine'' and ''Pannonia'', who were protesting about their conditions of service, in comparison with the Praetorians. The forces of Pannonia were dealt with by [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], son of Tiberius (not to be confused with [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], brother of Tiberius), accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian Cavalry, and [[Imperial German Bodyguard]]s. The mutiny in Germania was repressed by the nephew and designated heir of Tiberius, [[Germanicus]], who later led legions and detachments of the Guard in a two-year campaign in Germania, and succeeded in recovering two of the three legionary [[Aquila (Roman)|eagles]] which had been lost at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].\n\nIt was under [[Tiberius]] that Lucius Aelius Seianus ([[Sejanus]]) rose in power and was among the first prefects to exploit his position to pursue his own ambitions. He concentrated under his command all the Praetorian cohorts in the new camp. Sejanus held the title of prefect jointly with his father, under Augustus, but became sole prefect in AD 15. He used that position to render himself essential to the new emperor Tiberius, who was unable to persuade the Senate to share the responsibility of governing the Empire. Sejanus, however, alienated Drusus, son of Tiberius, and when the heir to the throne, [[Germanicus]], died in AD 19, he was worried that Drusus would become the new emperor. Accordingly, he poisoned Drusus with the help of the latter's wife, and then immediately launched a ruthless elimination program against all competitors, persuading Tiberius to make him his heir apparent. He almost succeeded, but his plot was discovered and revealed in AD 31 and he was subsequently killed. Emperor Tiberius used for this purpose the ''[[Cohortes urbanae]]'' which were not under the control of [[Sejanus]].\n\nIn AD 37 Caligula became emperor with the support of [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], Sejanus' successor as prefect of the Praetorian Guard. Under Caligula, whose reign lasted until AD 41, the overall strength of the Guard increased from 9 to 12 Praetorian cohorts.\n\n[[File:Proclaiming claudius emperor.png|thumb|left|250px|''Proclaiming Claudius Emperor'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], oil on canvas, 1867. According to one version of the story of Claudius' accession, members of the Praetorian Guard found him hiding behind a curtain in the aftermath of the assassination of Caligula in AD 41, and proclaimed him emperor.]]\n\nIn year 41, it was disgust and hostility of a praetorian tribune, named [[Cassius Chaerea]] \u2013 whom [[Caligula]] teased without mercy due to his squeaky voice \u2013 which led to the assassination of the emperor by officers of the guard. While the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] sacked all in a search to apprehend the murderers, the Senate proclaimed the restoration of a Republic. The Praetorians, who were pillaging the Palace, discovered [[Claudius]], uncle of [[Caligula]], hidden behind a curtain. Needing an emperor to justify their own existence, they brought him forth to the Praetorian camp and proclaimed him emperor. He is the first emperor proclaimed by the Praetorian Guard and compensated the guard with a prime bonus worth five years their salary. The Praetorians accompanied Emperor Claudius to Britain in 43 AD.\n\nWhen Claudius was poisoned, the Guard transferred their allegiance to [[Nero]] through the influence of his Praetorian prefect [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]], who exercised a beneficial influence on the new emperor during the first five years of his reign. Officers of the Guard, including one of the two successors of [[Sextus Afranius Burrus|Burrus]] as the Praetorian prefect, participated in [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso|Piso]]'s conspiracy in year 65. The other Praetorian prefect, [[Tigellinus]], headed the suppression of the conspiracy, and the Guard was compensated with a bonus of 500 denarii for each man.\n\n==== Year of the Four Emperors ====\n{{main|Year of the Four Emperors}}\nIn AD 69, the new colleague of Tigellinus, [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], managed to have the Praetorian Guard abandon [[Nero]] in favor of the contender [[Galba]]. [[Nymphidius Sabinus]] had promised 7500 [[denarius]] per man, but Galba refused to pay that amount because he stated \"It is my habit to recruit soldiers and not buy them\". This permitted his rival [[Otho]] to bribe 23 [[Speculatores]] of the Praetorian Guard to proclaim him emperor. Despite the opposition of the cohorts in service in the palace, Galba and his designated successor, the young Piso, were lynched on January 15.\n\nAfter supporting Otho against a third contender [[Vitellius]], the Praetorians were restrained following defeat and their centurions executed. They were replaced by 16 cohorts recruited from the legionnaires and auxiliaries loyal to Vitellius, almost 16,000 men. These ex-Praetorians then aided [[Vespasian]], the fourth Emperor, leading the attack against the Praetorian camp.\n\n==== Flavian dynasty ====\nUnder the Flavians, the Praetorians formed 9 new cohorts, of which [[Titus]], son of the emperor [[Vespasian]], became the prefect. [[Vespasian]] returned the effective strength of each unit to five hundred men. He also cancelled the guard service of the Praetorians at the entry to the emperor's palace, but retained guards within the palace itself.\n\nUnder Vespasian's second son, [[Domitian]], the number of cohorts was increased to 10, and the Praetorian Guard participated in fighting in [[Germania]] and on the [[Danube]] against the [[Dacians]]. It was in the course of these actions that the prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]] was defeated and killed in 86.\n\n==== Antonine dynasty ====\nFollowing assassination of [[Domitian]] in 96 the Praetorians demanded the execution of their prefect, [[Titus Petronius Secundus]], who had been implicated in the murder. The Guard supported [[Trajan]], commander of the Army of the Rhine, as new emperor.\n\nAt the death of [[Nerva]], at the beginning of 98, [[Trajan]] executed the remaining Praetorian prefect and his partisans. Trajan returned to Rome from the Rhine, probably accompanied by the new unit of ''[[equites singulares Augusti]]''. The Praetorian Guard had participated in the two [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars of Trajan]] (Dacian Wars 101\u2013102 and 105\u2013106). The Praetorian Guard served in the last [[Trajan's Parthian campaign|campaign of Trajan against the Parthians of 113\u2013117]].\n\nDuring the 2nd century, the Praetorian Guard accompanied [[Lucius Verus]] in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 161\u2013166|Oriental War Campaign of 161\u2013166 AD]], as well as accompanying [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] in his northern campaigns between 169\u2013175 and 178\u2013180. Two prefects were killed during these expeditions.\n\nWith the accession of [[Commodus]], in 180, the Praetorian Guard returned to Rome. [[Tigidius Perennis]] (AD 182\u2013185) and [[freedman]] [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander]] (AD 186\u2013190) exercised considerable influence on the emperor. [[Tigidius Perennis|Perennis]] was killed by a delegation of 1500 persons of [[Great Britain]] which came forth to complain about his interference in the affairs of the province (a delegation of [[Lanciarii]] of the 3 legions of Great Britain). Cleander abused his influence to nominate and dismiss prefects.\n\nIn 188, Cleander obtained the joint command of the Guard with the two prefects. Cleander ordered a massacre of civilians carried by the ''equites singulares Augusti'' which led to an arranged battle with the [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]].\n\n==== Severan dynasty ====\nCommodus fell victim to a conspiracy directed by his Praetorian prefect [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]] in 192. The new emperor [[Pertinax]], who took part in the conspiracy, paid the Praetorians a premium of 3,000 [[denarius|denarii]]; however he was assassinated three months later, on March 28 193, by a group of Guards. The Praetorians then put the empire up to auction and [[Didius Julianus]] bought the title of emperor. However the armies of the Danube chose instead the governor of [[Pannonia Superior]], [[Septimius Severus]], who besieged Rome and tricked the Praetorians when they came out unarmed. The Praetorian Guard was dissolved and replaced by men transferred from his own army.\n\nThe new Guard of Septimius Severus made their mark against his rival [[Clodius Albinus]] at the [[Battle of Lugdunum|Battle of Lyon]] in 197, and accompanied the emperor to the [[Orient]] from 197 to 202, then to [[Britannia]] from 208 until his death at [[York]] in 211.\n\n[[Caracalla]], son of [[Septimius Severus]], lost favour with his troops by assassinating his own brother and co-emperor, Geta, immediately after his succession. He also created problems by trying to recreate a Macedonian phalanx witnessed previously in the Roman Army. Finally, in 217, while on campaign in the [[Orient]], he was assassinated at the instigation of his prefect [[Macrinus]].\n\nAfter the elimination of the latter, the Praetorians opposed the new emperor [[Elagabalus]], priest of the oriental cult of Elagabal, and replaced him by his 13-year-old cousin [[Severus Alexander]] in 222.\n\nIn this period the position of [[Praetorian prefect]] in [[Italy]] came increasingly to resemble a general administrative post, and there was a tendency to appoint jurists such as [[Papinian]], who occupied the post from 203 until his elimination and execution at the ascent of Caracalla. Under [[Severus Alexander]] the [[Praetorian prefecture]] was held by the lawyer [[Ulpian]] until his assassination by the Praetorian Guard in the presence of the emperor himself.\n\n==== 3rd century ====\nIn the spring of 238, under [[Maximinus Thrax]], the bulk of the Praetorian Guard was employed on active service. Defended by only a small residual garrison, the Praetorian camp was attacked by a civilian crowd acting in support of [[Roman Senate|senators]] in revolt against the Gordian emperors. The failure of Maximinus Thrax to win the [[civil war]] against the contenders [[Gordian I]] and [[Gordian II]] led to his death at the hands of his own troops, including the Praetorians. The senatorial candidates for the throne, [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]], recalled the Praetorian Guard to Rome, only to find themselves under attack by the Praetorians. Both were killed on July 29 238 and [[Gordian III]] triumphed.\n\nAfter 238, literary and epigraphic sources dry up, and information on the Praetorian Guard becomes rare. In 249, the Praetorians assassinated [[Philippus II]], son of the emperor [[Philip the Arab]]. In 272, in the reign of the emperor [[Aurelian]], they took part in an expedition against [[Palmyra]]. In 284, Diocletian reduced the status of the Praetorians; they were no longer to be part of palace life, as Diocletian lived in [[Nicomedia]], some 60 miles (100&nbsp;km) from [[Byzantium]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Two new corps, the [[Jovians and Herculians|Ioviani and Herculiani]] (named after the gods Jove, or [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Hercules]], associated with the senior and junior emperor), replaced the Praetorians as the personal protectors of the emperors, a practice that remained intact with the [[Tetrarchy]]. In 297 they were in [[Africa]] with [[Maximian]]. By the time Diocletian retired on May 1, 305, their ''Castra Praetoria'' seems to have housed only a minor garrison of Rome.\n\n==== Dissolution ====\nDuring the early [[4th century]], ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' [[Flavius Valerius Severus]] attempted to disband the Praetorian Guard on the orders of [[Galerius]]. In response, the Praetorians turned to [[Maxentius]], the son of the retired emperor Maximian, and proclaimed him their emperor on 28 October 306. By 312, however, [[Constantine the Great]] marched on Rome with an army in order to eliminate Maxentius and gain control of the [[Western Roman Empire]], resulting in the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]. Ultimately, Constantine's army achieved a decisive victory against the Praetorians, whose emperor was killed during the fighting. With the death of Maxentius, Constantine definitively disbanded the remnants of the Praetorian Guard. The remaining soldiers were sent out to various corners of the empire, and the ''Castra Praetoria'' was dismantled in a grand gesture inaugurating a new age in Roman history and ending that of the Praetorians.\n\n=== Participation in wars ===\nWhile campaigning, the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman army. On the death of Augustus in 14 AD, his successor, Tiberius, was faced with mutinies among both the Rhine and [[Pannonian]] legions. According to [[Tacitus]], the Pannonian forces were dealt with by Tiberius' son [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]], accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian cavalry and some of the [[German bodyguard]]. The German mutiny was put down by Tiberius' nephew and adopted son [[Germanicus]], his intended heir, who then led the legions and detachments of the Guard in an invasion of Germany over the next two years. The Guard saw much action in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] in 69, fighting well for [[Otho]] at the first [[battle of Bedriacum]]. Under [[Domitian]] and [[Trajan]], the guard took part in wars from [[Dacia]] to [[Mesopotamia]], while with [[Marcus Aurelius]], years were spent on the Danubian frontier during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. Throughout the 3rd century, the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns.\n\n=== Political role ===\nPraetorian Cohorts intervened on numerous occasions in the struggle for the imperial succession. Lacking troops of its own, the Senate had no choice each time but to accept the choice of the Praetorians as well as that of the various legions. The new emperor was always proclaimed by the Praetorians before being ratified by the Senate and the legions stationed in the various provinces.\n\nAfter the death of Sejanus, who was sacrificed for the [[donativum|donative]] (imperial gift) promised by Tiberius, the Guards began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody game in the Empire. For the right price, or at will, they assassinated emperors, bullied their own prefects, or turned on the people of Rome. In 41, [[Caligula]] was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard, along with his wife and daughter. The Praetorians placed his uncle [[Claudius]] on the throne, daring the Senate to oppose their decision. In 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], after the emperor [[Galba]] failed to provide a donative for the Praetorians, they transferred their allegiance to [[Otho]] and assassinated the emperor. Otho acquiesced in the Praetorians' demands and granted them the right to appoint their own prefects, ensuring their loyalty. After defeating Otho, [[Vitellius]] disbanded the Guard and established a new Guard sixteen cohorts strong. [[Vespasian]] relied in the war against Vitellius upon the disgruntled cohorts the emperor had dismissed, and reduced the number of cohorts back to nine upon becoming emperor himself. As a further safeguard, he appointed his son, [[Titus]], as Praetorian prefect.<ref>Bingham 1997, pp. 118\u2013122.</ref>\n\nWhile the guard had the power to make or break emperors, it had no formal role in government administration, unlike the personnel of the palace, the Senate, and the bureaucracy. Often after an outrageous act of violence, revenge by the new ruler was forthcoming. In 193, [[Didius Julianus]] purchased the Empire from the Guard for a vast sum, when the Guard auctioned it off after killing [[Pertinax]]. Later that year [[Septimius Severus]] marched into Rome, disbanded the Guard and started a new formation from his own Pannonian legions. Unruly mobs in Rome often fought with the Praetorians in [[Maximinus Thrax]]'s reign in vicious street battles.\n\nIn 271, [[Aurelian]] sailed east to destroy the power of [[Palmyra]], Syria, with a force of legionary detachments, Praetorian cohorts, and other cavalry units, and easily defeated the Palmyrenes. This led to the orthodox view that [[Diocletian]] and his colleagues evolved the ''sacer comitatus'' (the field escort of the emperors). The ''sacer comitatus'' included field units that used a selection process and command structure modeled after the old Praetorian cohorts, but it was not of uniform composition and was much larger than a Praetorian cohort.\n\n=== Organization ===\n==== Leadership ====\n{{Main|Praetorian prefect|Praetorian prefecture}}\n\nStarting in the year 2 BC, the [[Praetorian prefect]] was the commanding officer of the Praetorian Guard (previously each cohort was independent and under the orders of a [[tribune]] of [[Equites|equestrian]] rank). This role (chief of all troops stationed in Rome), was in practice a key position of the Roman [[polity]].\n\nFrom [[Vespasian]] onwards the [[Praetorian prefecture]] was always held by an equestrian of the ''eques'' order. (''Equestrians'' were traditionally that class of citizens who could equip themselves to serve in the Roman Army on [[cavalry|horseback]]).\n\nFrom the year 2 BC, the cohorts were under the control of two prefectures; however cohorts continued to be organized independently, each commanded by a tribune. Tribunes had as immediate subordinates ordinary [[Centurion]]s, all of equal rank except for the ''[[Trecenarius]]'', the first and prime of all centurions of the Praetorian Cohorts, who commanded also the 300 ''[[speculatores]]'', and with the exception of his second, the ''[[Prince Castrorum]]''.<ref name=Bohec21 />\n\nFrom the second century the Praetorian prefect oversaw not only the Praetorian Cohorts but also the rest of the garrison of Rome, including the ''[[Cohortes urbanae]]'' (\"urban cohorts\") and the ''equites singulares Augusti'', but not the [[Vigiles|''Vigiles'' cohorts]].\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Praetorian Cohorts by the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] after he defeated them at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312, the role of the Praetorian prefect in the Empire became purely administrative, ruling large territories (''prefectures'') comprising Roman [[diocese]]s (geographical subdivisions of the [[Roman Empire]]) in the name of the Emperor.\n\n==== Size and composition ====\nThe Praetorian Cohorts were designated as ''Equitatae'' ([[cavalry]]) ''[[Turma]]e'' (troops) with [[Roman legion|centuries]] formed of [[infantry]], initially of 500 men each.<ref name=Bohec21>Y. Le Bohec, ''L'Arm\u00e9e Romaine'', Picard, 1989, {{ISBN|2-7084-0744-9}}</ref>\n\nIn order not to alienate the population of Rome, while conserving Republican civilian traditions, the Praetorians did not wear their armor while in the heart of the city. Instead they often wore a formal toga, which distinguished them from civilians but remained in a respectable civilian attire, the mark of a Roman citizen. Augustus, conscious of risking the only military force present in the city, often avoided concentrating them and imposed this dress code.\n\nFrom the reign of Tiberius, their camp was situated on the [[Quirinal]] Hill, outside Rome. In 26 AD, [[Sejanus]], Praetorian prefect, and the favorite of emperor [[Tiberius]], united the [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban Cohorts]] with nine Praetorian Cohorts, dispersed at that time throughout [[Italy]], in one large camp situated beyond the [[Servian Wall]], on the Esquiline Hill, the ''[[Castra Praetoria]]''.\n\nFor the 2nd century, calculations from lists of significant demobilisations suggest an increase in size to nearly 1,500 men per cohort (perhaps a doubling of 800 (since [[Vespasian]]), probably organized in 20 centuries) under [[Commodus]] in year (187\u2013188) or under [[Septimius Severus]] (193\u2013211), which matches the probable numbers of effectives for Urban Cohorts during the time of [[Cassius Dio]]. These figures suggest an overall size for the Guard of 4,500\u20136,000 men under [[Augustus]], 12,800 under [[Vitellius]], 7,200 under [[Vespasian]], 8,000 from [[Domitian]] until [[Commodus]] or [[Septimius Severus]], and 15,000 later on.<ref name=Rankov>Dr Boris Rankov, ''The Praetorian Guard'', Osprey Publishing, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-85532-361-2}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 2nd century, Italians made up 89% of the Praetorian Guard. Under [[Septimius Severus]], recruitment evolved to authorize the inclusion of legionaries of the Roman army, as well as of the battle hardened ''Army of the Danube''. Severus stationed his supporters with him in Rome, and the Praetorian Guards remained loyal to his choices.\n\n==== Praetorian Cavalry ====\nInitially each cohort included, as for a [[Roman legion]], a [[cavalry]] detachment; this should not be confused with the ''equites singulares Augusti'' who appeared under the emperor [[Trajan]]. The Praetorian could become a cavalryman (''Eques'') after almost five years service in the [[infantry]]. These Praetorians remained listed in their Centuries of origin, but operated in a ''[[turma]]'' of 30 men each commanded by an ''[[Optioequitum]]''.\n\nThere was probably one ''turma'' of cavalry for two centuries of infantry.<ref name=Rankov /> Hence, three ''turmae'' per cohorts of the ''Augustan period'', five per cohort in 100 CE\u2013200 CE, and ten per cohort after 200 CE, with a ''[[vexillum]]'' (flag) as emblem for each ''turma''.\n\n==== Speculatores Augusti ====\nThe ''[[speculatores]] Augusti'' were cavalrymen assigned to the same tasks as the ''[[Speculatores]]'' of the legions and the [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments|auxiliary units]] (messengers in charge of transmitting intelligence, and clandestine agents).\n\nAbout 300 in total (30 per cohort), they formed a unit under the orders of the senior [[Centurion]], the ''[[Trecenarius]]''. Selected for their impressive physique, they were used by the Emperor for [[clandestine operations]] and tasks such as arrests, imprisonment, and executions.\n\nOne of their roles was to accompany the emperor on his foreign campaign journeys (a role which would later be handled by the ''Singulares''/''equites singulares Augusti''). [[Claudius]] was in the habit of surrounding himself with ''Speculatores'' when attending dinners.\n\nThe close security protection detail of Galba, of [[Otho]] and the dynastic line of the Flavians appear to have been formed of ''[[Speculatores]]'' (who replaced the [[Imperial German Bodyguard]] disbanded by [[Galba]]).\n\nFollowing the assassination of emperor [[Domitian]], his successor [[Nerva]] was placed under the protection of [[Trajan]], to counter possible revenge attempts and mutinies. Trajan was commander of the most important army of the time, that of the Army of Germania, and he nominated him as his heir. Accordingly, and following such an act, [[Trajan]], aiming to reinforce his security detail in relation to the ''Speculatores'' who had remained loyal to Domitian, replaced them as close protection security detail with the ''Singulares''/''equites singulares Augusti'' (modelled on the ''Singulares'' of a provincial governor, a post held by [[Trajan]]). The some 300 ''[[Speculatores]]'' were reassigned by [[Trajan]] to the corps of Praetorian cohorts.<ref name=Bohec21 />\n\nThey were distinguished by a special (but unknown) style of boots, the ''Speculatoria Caliga'' (according to [[Suetonius]]) and they received special honorific diplomas in bronze at demobilization. They had their own Equestrian instructors (''Exercitatores'').<ref name=Rankov />\n\n=== Service in the Praetorian Guard ===\n[[File:Q.PomponiusPoeninus.jpg|thumb|right200px| Funeral inscription of Quintus Pomponius Poeninus, soldier of the IV Praetorian Cohort<ref>Mus\u00e9e de [[C\u00e1ceres (Espagne)|C\u00e1ceres]]. ''Q(uintus) Pomponius Potentinus / Ser(gia) h(ic) s(itus) e(st) / C(aius) Pomponius Potentinus / mil(es) c(o)hor(tis) IIII praet(oriae) / test(amento) fieri iussit''.</ref>]]\n\nOriginally, the Praetorian Guard was recruited from the populations of central [[Italy]] ([[Etruria]], [[Umbria]] and [[Latium]] according to [[Tacitus]]). Recruits were between 15 and 32 years of age, compared to legionary recruits who ranged from 18 to 23 years of age. According to [[Cassius Dio]], during the first two centuries AD and before the reform of [[Septimius Severus]], the Praetorians were exclusively limited to [[Italy]], Spain (Roman province), [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Noricum]] (current [[Austria]]).\n\nUnder the reign of [[Vitellius]], and starting from [[Septimius Severus]], men were transferred from the [[Vigiles Urbanus|Urban Vigiles]], [[Cohortes urbanae|Urban cohorts]], and the various [[Roman legion|legions]]. This recent method and manner of recruitment at the corps of the legions became the normal procedure to recruit in the 3rd century after [[Septimius Severus]] dealt with the undisciplined Praetorians who assassinated [[Pertinax]] in 193, and replaced them with men from his own Danube legions.\n\nAt that time, the Praetorians represented the best soldiers from the legions (principally from Illyria). They were a group of elite of soldiers starting from the 3rd century, and not a category of socially privileged soldiers (such as the Italians at the time of [[Augustus]]). The Italians formed the base of the recruitment of the ''Legio II Parthica'', a new legion created and stationed in Italy.\n\nTo be admitted to the Guard, a man had to be in good physical condition, have a [[good moral character]], and come from a respectable family. In addition, he had to make use of all sorts of patronages available to him in order to obtain letters of recommendations from important leading figures in society. Once past the recruitment procedure he was designated as ''Probatus'', and assigned as a ''Miles'' (soldier) to one of the centuries of a cohort. After two years, if he attracted the attention of his superiors by influence or merit, he could attain the post of ''Immunis'' (similar to corporal), perhaps as a commis (junior chief) at general headquarters or as a technician. This promotion exempted him from daily chores. After another two years he could be promoted to ''Principalis'', with a double salary, in charge of delivering messages (''Tesserarius'') or as an assistant centurion (''Optio'') or standard bearer (''Signifer'') at the corps of the century; or, if literate and numerate, he could join the administrative staff of the prefect.\n\nOnly a few soldiers could attain the rank of ''Principalis''; however those that did, during the course of their service, were designated ''Evocati Augusti'' by the emperor. This designation allowed them to be promoted to technical administrative posts, or instructors in Rome, or to a century in a legion, and accordingly extend their career. Certain ''principalis'' could at the end of their career be promoted to [[Centurion]] in the Guard; this would be the peak of his career. Anyone ambitious for further promotion would need to transfer to a legion.\n\nThe [[Military tribune]]s (''Tribuni Militum'') at the head of the cohorts were [[Roman cavalry]]men. In contrast to many superior cadres of the Army, who originated from the Equestrian Order, these tribunes started their career in the ranks of the Guard and were promoted from the ranks in the hierarchy. Next after becoming [[Centurion]]s, they had to serve for a period of one year as superior centurions in one or several legions before achieving the status of ''[[Primus pilus]]'' (the highest ranked [[Centurion]] in a legion). Upon return to [[Rome]], they occupied successively the positions of Tribunes of the Vigiles, Tribune of the Urban Cohort and finally Tribune of the Guard.<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180>[[Paul Petit (historian)|Paul Petit]], ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Empire romain'', Seuil, 1974, {{ISBN|2020026775}}, p. 180</ref>\n\nOther leading paths towards the tribunate were possible, including service entirely made in the legions, attaining the rank of ''[[Primus pilus]]'' before departing to Rome. Nevertheless, all tribunes were combat veterans with extensive military experience.<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180 /> Each tribune served in Rome for one year, following which, a certain number of the men would retire.\n\nA few of them, ranking placement at the top of the hierarchy, could obtain a second term as ''Primus Pilus'' and advance towards the superior echelons of the equestrian career<ref name=Rankov />{{,}}<ref name=Petit180 /> possibly becoming the [[Praetorian prefect]].\n\nThe majority of the prefects, however, were ordinary men of the equestrian rank by birth. The men who attained the command of the Guard following year 2 BC were [[equites]] with an elevated seniority, classifying right behind the prefect of Egypt. Starting from [[Vespasian]], whose son, [[Titus]] was himself a Praetorian prefect, they were ranked first.\n\n=== Equipment and traditions ===\nThe Praetorian Guard, like all legionnaires, disposed of various [[Roman military personal equipment|equipment]] to execute different missions. More particularly as bodyguard, escort or reserve military force, they housed adaptable equipment for each function.\n\nFor heavy packed combat infantry lines ([[Roman infantry tactics|Triplex Acies System]]), they mounted helmets, armor ([[Lorica segmentata]], [[Mail (armour)|Lorica hamata]], [[Lorica squamata]] specially in the 2nd and 3rd centuries), heavy colorful shields ([[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]), heavy javelins ([[Pilum|pila]]), and later even long spears and lighter javelins (hastas, lancea).\n\nPraetorian Guard helmets included tall [[Galea (helmet)|Galea]] with elaborate detail worked into the metal. Shields were ovoid and more robust compared with the regular rectangular shape sometimes used by the legions. Each legion had its own emblem displayed on its [[Scutum (shield)]] and the Praetorian Guard were probably the only unit to include additional insignia on their shields. Each cohort had their own version of Praetorian insignia. Praetorian Guard units could wear lion skin capes and their colours were so decorated with awards, that the men had difficulty in carrying them on long marches.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard colours included the winged [[Victoria (mythology)|goddess of victory]].\n\nFor escorts, the oval shields and lances replaced the scuta and pila. Missions in Rome at the heart of the city in principle were forbidden to soldiers, so they wore a toga.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard, like all legionaries, shared similar insignia, mainly on their shields. Praetorian Guard shields included [[Aquila (Roman)|wings]] and [[thunderbolt]]s, referring to the [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] form of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and also uniquely included Scorpions, [[Stars]] and [[Crescent]]s.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pr\u00e4torianer.jpg|A Praetorian soldier from the 2nd century AD \u2013 retrieved in [[Pozzuoli]] (1800).\nFile:CLAUDIUS - RIC I 25 - 792104.jpg|[[Claudius]], the [[Roman Emperor|4th Emperor]] of the [[Roman Empire]] AD 41\u201354.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Ancient Greece]]\n* [[Frumentarii]]\n* [[Kheshig]]\n* [[Praetorianism]]\n* [[Pushtigban]]\n* [[Scholae Palatinae]]\n* [[Varangian Guard]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References and further reading==\n* Sandra J.

''[[Video game terminology|Platforms]]'' in the sixth generation include consoles from four companies: the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]] (DC), [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2), [[Nintendo]] [[GameCube]] (GC), and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. This era began on November 27, 1998, with the Japanese release of the Dreamcast, which was joined by the PlayStation 2 on March 4, 2000, and the GameCube and Xbox on November 15, 2001. In April 2001, the Dreamcast was the first to be discontinued. The GameCube was next, in 2007, the Xbox on March 2, 2009, and the PlayStation 2 on January 4, 2013. Meanwhile, the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation of consoles]] started on November 22, 2005 with the launch of the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/04/playstation-2-manufacture-ends-years|title=PlayStation 2 manufacture ends after 12 years|date=January 4, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe major innovation of this generation was of full utilization of the [[internet]] to allow a fully online gaming experience.  While the prior generation had some systems with internet connectivity, such as the [[Apple Pippin]], these had little market penetration and thus had limited success in the area. Services such as Microsoft's [[Xbox Live]] became industry standard in this, and future, generations.  Another innovation of the Xbox was the first system to utilize an internal [[hard disk drive]] to store game data.  This caused many improvements to the gaming experience, including the ability to store program data (rather than just save game data) that allowed for faster load times, as well as the ability to download games directly from the internet rather than to purchase physical media such as a disk or cartridge.  Soon after its release other systems, like the Sony PlayStation 2, produced peripheral storage devices to allow similar capabilities, and by the next generation internal storage became industry standard.\n\n[[Sixth generation of video game consoles#Bits and system power|Bit ratings]] (i.e. \"64-bit\" or \"32-bit\" for the previous generation) for most consoles largely fell by the wayside during this era, with the notable exceptions being promotions for the Dreamcast<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT1Tbc_PD2k|title=Sega Dreamcast UK advert|first=|last=kesavva|date=June 22, 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> and PS2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/ects-the-truth-about-the-dreamcast/|title=ECTS: The Truth About the Dreamcast...|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> that advertised \"128-bit graphics\" at the start of the generation. The number of \"bits\" cited in this way in console names refers to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Word (computer architecture)|word size]], and had been used by hardware marketing departments as a \"show of power\" for many years. However, there is little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 or 64&nbsp;bits because, once this level is reached, performance depends on more varied factors, such as processor [[clock speed]], [[CPU bandwidth|bandwidth]], and [[Computer memory|memory size]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe '''sixth generation of handhelds''' began with the release of the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] by [[SNK]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. The Game Boy Advance was discontinued around in early 2010. The next generation of handheld consoles began in November 2004, with the North American introduction of the [[Nintendo DS]].\n\nThe last [[Dreamcast homebrew|''official'' Dreamcast games]] were released in 2002 (North America and Europe) and 2007 (Japan).

Its arsenal of franchises and history in the industry, though earning it a loyal fan base, failed to give it an advantage against the Xbox and PlayStation 2 which captured audiences seeking '[[Entertainment Software Rating Board|Mature]]' titles of which Nintendo had fewer. Nintendo also made little headway into online gaming (releasing a small handful of online-capable games, the most popular of which was ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', which was, in fact, a port of the Dreamcast game), instead emphasizing [[Game Boy Advance]] connectivity. As a result, the Nintendo GameCube failed to match the sales of its predecessor, the [[Nintendo 64]], but the console wasn't a financial failure. Nintendo did however rejuvenate its relationship with many developers,<ref name=\"Mark Reese\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/11/feature_remembering_the_gamecube|date=19 Nov 2011|title=Feature: Remembering the GameCube|last=Reese|first=Mark|website=www.nintendolife.com|access-date=11 Feb 2018}}</ref> often working in close collaboration with them to produce games based upon its franchises, in contrast to the past where it was frequently seen as bullying developers in the late 1980s, back when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was out on the market.

However, the Xbox attracted a large fanbase and strong third-party support in the United States and Europe and became a recognizable brand amongst the mainstream. The [[Xbox Live]] online service with its centralized model proved particularly successful, prompting Sony to boost the online capabilities of the PlayStation 2. Xbox Live also gave the Xbox an edge over the GameCube, which had a near-total lack of online games.

These, however, are less notable, never saw a worldwide release, and/or have sold particularly poorly, and are therefore listed as 'Other'.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Nuon-N2000-wController-L.jpg|link=File:Nuon-N2000-wController-L.jpg|The [[Nuon (DVD technology)|Nuon]] was a hybrid DVD player/gaming system released in 2000, that had a very small game library.\nFile:AtariFlashback.jpg|The [[Atari Flashback]], the \"plug and play\" version of the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 7800|7800]] Released in 2004.\nFile:V-Smile_Top.JPG|The [[V.Smile]] was a gaming system for education, created by [[VTech]]. Released in 2004\nFile:XaviX-XaviXPORT-Console-FL.jpg|The [[XaviX]] is the video gaming base console for the XaviX Interactive System, released by SSD COMPANY LIMITED in 2004.\n</gallery>\n\n==Bits and system power==\nBit ratings for consoles largely fell by the wayside after the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation]] (32/64-bit) era. The number of \"bits\" cited in console names referred to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Word (data type)|word]] size, but there was little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 bits; performance depended on other factors, such as [[central processing unit]] speed, [[graphics processing unit]] speed, [[channel capacity]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]] size, and memory speed, [[memory latency|latency]], and size.\n\nThe importance of the number of [[bit]]s in the modern console gaming market has thus decreased due to the use of components that process data in varying word sizes. Previously, console manufacturers advertised the \"''n''-bit talk\" to over-emphasize the hardware capabilities of their system. The Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2 were the last systems to use the term \"128-bit\" in their marketing to describe their capability.\n\nIt is not easy to compare the relative \"power\" of the different systems. Having a larger CPU word size does not necessarily make one console more powerful than another. Likewise, the operating frequency (clock rate, measured in terms of [[Hertz]]) of a system's CPU is not an accurate measure of performance either, except between systems of the same or similar architecture.\n\nThe Microsoft [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] uses a 32-bit (general purpose) [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] x86 architecture CPU, with an instruction set equal to that of the Coppermine core Mobile [[Celeron]], though it has less cache (128&nbsp;kB) than the PC equivalent. It has 64&nbsp;MB RAM (shared) and runs at 733&nbsp;MHz. Because the Pentium 3 introduced [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], the Xbox also had 128-bit SIMD capabilities. Its ''NV2A'' [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], which is very similar to the [[GeForce 3 Series]] of desktop GPUs, makes it the only console in its time with traditional vertex and pixel [[shader]]s.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/853/14 AnandTech.com: Hardware Behind the Consoles \u2013 Microsoft's Xbox vs. Sony PlayStation 2], November 21, 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[Nintendo GameCube]]'s [[IBM]] [[Gekko (microprocessor)|Gekko]] [[PowerPC]] CPU runs at 485&nbsp;MHz, while its \"Flipper\" graphics processor is comparable to the original [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] [[Radeon R100|Radeon]], and it has 43&nbsp;MB of non-unified memory (24&nbsp;MB of 1T-SRAM, 3&nbsp;MB embedded 1T-SRAM, and 16&nbsp;MB DRAM). The GameCube supports [[Dolby Pro Logic]] II.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/858/13 AnandTech.com: Hardware Behind the Consoles \u2013 Nintendo GameCube vs. Sony PlayStation 2 vs. Microsoft Xbox], December 7, 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[PlayStation 2]]'s CPU (known as the \"128-bit [[Emotion Engine]]\") has a 64-bit core with a 32-bit FPU\ncoupled to two 128 bit Vector Units, The hybrid R5900 CPU is based on [[MIPS architecture]]. The PS2 also has an internal 10 Channel DMA Bus which is fully 128 bits wide. Paths between the Emotion Engine, RAM and the Graphics synthesizer (GS) are also 128 bits wide. The PS2's unique hardware arrangement with no less than 10 processing units were difficult to come to grips with. Many developers struggled initially with programming the hardware. The PS2's Graphics Synthesizer (GS) has fast dedicated video memory, though it is limited in the amount of data it can hold, The 10 Channel 128 bit wide DMA bus could pump data to GS Memory as fast as the screen could update. Consequently, with the main memory being limited to 32MB, many of the PS2's games have reduced textures compared with versions for other consoles. It also does not have a hardware dedicated [[Transform, clipping, and lighting|transform and lighting]] unit like the ones found in the Xbox and GameCube GPUs.\n\nHowever the PS2's design allows a remarkable degree of flexibility and choice. For example, Program control and general arithmetic could be handled by the CPU, while the Vector Units 0 and 1, could provide parallel processing of physics, clipping and transform and lighting to the scene. The Vector units were noted to be so versatile that [[Shadow of the Colossus|Shadow of The Colossus]] used one of the vector units to do full Pixel shading for the fur of the Collossi.\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]] has a [[64-bit]] [[Double precision|double-precision]] [[superscalar]] [[SuperH]]-4 [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[Central processing unit]] core with a [[32-bit]] [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] unit using [[16-bit]] fixed-length instructions, a 64-bit data bus allowing a variable width of either 8, 16, 32 or 64-bits, and a 128-bit floating-point bus.<ref>[http://www.segatech.com/technical/cpu/index.html Technology Partner \u2013 Design Solutions from Hitachi Semiconductor (America) Inc.: SH7750 (SH-4 Series) MPU] (November/December 1997)</ref> The [[PowerVR]] 2DC CLX2 chipset uses a unique method of rendering a 3D scene called [[Tiled rendering|Tile]] Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR): while storing polygons in [[triangle strip]] format in memory, the display is split into tiles associated with a list of visibly overlapping triangles onto which, using a process similar to [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], rays are cast and a pixel is rendered from the triangle closest to the camera. After calculating the depths associated with each polygon for one tile row in 1 cycle, the whole tile is flushed to video memory before passing on to render the next tile. Once all information has been collated for the current [[Film frame|frame]], the tiles are rendered in turn to produce the final image.\n\n==Handheld systems==\n{{See also|Comparison of handheld game consoles}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Purple-FL.jpg|thumb|The [[Game Boy Advance]] was the best-selling handheld system.]]\nDuring the sixth generation era, the [[handheld game console]] market expanded with the introduction of new devices from many different manufacturers. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. Two redesigns of this system followed, the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] in 2003 and the [[Game Boy Micro]] in 2005. Also introduced were the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] by [[SNK]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. South Korean company [[Game Park]] introduced its [[GP32]] handheld in 2001, and with it came the dawn of [[Open-source software|open source]] handheld consoles. The Game Boy Advance line of handhelds has sold 81.51 million units worldwide as of September 30, 2010.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\nA major new addition to the market was the trend for corporations to include a large number of \"non-gaming\" features into their handheld consoles, including [[mobile phone|cell phones]], [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], portable movie players, and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like features. The handheld that started this trend was [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]], which was released in 2003 and doubled primarily as a mobile phone. It went through a redesign in 2004 and was renamed the [[N-Gage QD]]. A second handheld, the [[Tapwave Zodiac|Zodiac]] from Tapwave, was released in 2004; based on the [[Palm OS]], it offered specialized gaming-oriented video and sound capabilities, but it had an unwieldy development kit due to the underlying Palm OS foundation.\n\nA fairly uncommon handheld of the 6th generation was the vtech V.SMILE Pocket. A handheld version of their V.SMILE home console.\n\nWith more and more PDAs arriving during the previous generation, the difference between consumer electronics and traditional computing began to blur and cheap console technology grew as a result. It was said of PDAs that they were \"the computers of handheld gaming\" because of their multi-purpose capabilities and the increasingly powerful computer hardware that resided within them. This capability existed to move gaming beyond the last generation's 16-bit limitations; however, PDAs were still geared towards the typical businessman, and lacked new, affordable software franchises to compete with dedicated handheld gaming consoles.\n\n===Handheld comparison===\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5%\"| Name\n!style=\"width: 25%;\" |

The sixth generation was the first to help console and computer software grow closer together as well as outperform the arcade market in features, graphics and business.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The Dreamcast, which had an official Windows CE Development Kit to help porting games from PCs to Dreamcast, and the Xbox, which was made from off-the-shelf PC parts and hosted many PC ports, factored into this also.\n\n===Controversial games===\n{{main|Video game controversy}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}\nWhile the sixth generation was not the first to have its share of controversial games, this generation was noted to have extensive criticism by public figures of \"objectionable\" content in gaming such as sex, crime, violence, profanity, drug use, and social propaganda as well as topics of debate such as religion, politics and economics.\n\nThe sixth generation was also notable because it saw the continuation of lawmakers taking actions against the video game industry. The most famous were [[Rockstar Games]]' [[Manhunt (video game)|''Manhunt'']] and [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' games]] (''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'') facing lawsuits over alleged racial slurs and influencing minors to commit crimes, while ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' was briefly given an adult rating and removed from most stores over the availability of an abandoned sex mini-game using the [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy|Hot Coffee mod]].\n\nThe sixth generation also coincided with the [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City and [[the Pentagon]], which had a huge impact on the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]], including the [[video game industry]]; in the subsequent market climate, multiple games were edited in response to the sensitivity surrounding the event. Prior to its release, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' depicted [[Arsenal Gear|a submersible mobile fortress hijacked by terrorists]] destroying a good portion of [[Manhattan]] in view of the twin towers (this can be found in the \"Document of Metal Gear Solid 2\" making-of feature). Similarly, several undisclosed modifications were made in ''Grand Theft Auto III'', such as a change to the police cars' color scheme (the old scheme resembled that of [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s older blue and white design) and altered cover art (the European release featured the original artwork); Rockstar Games estimates that the changes amounted to 1% in changed content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/19981/grand-theft-auto-iii-your-questions-answered-part-two-911-the-gh.html|title=Rockstar Games|website=Rockstar Games|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref> The [[Dreamcast]] game ''[[Propeller Arena]]'' was never officially released, possibly due to a certain level which was visually very similar to the September 11 attacks.\n\n===Emulation and retro gaming===\n{{see also|Console emulator}}\nBecause of the increased computing power of video game consoles and the widespread usage of [[emulator]]s, the sixth generation saw the rise of console emulation and retro gaming on a vast scale. Many games for older systems were updated with superior graphics or sound and re-released for current consoles. Commonly emulated games included those released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (the PS2 can play PS1 games natively), and the [[Nintendo 64]].\n\nAlso during this generation, the computing power of handheld consoles became capable of supporting games made for some of the earliest gaming consoles and several companies released remakes of classic games for the handhelds. Nintendo introduced a line of NES and SNES games for its Game Boy Advance handheld, including remakes such as ''[[Final Fantasy I and II (compilations)|Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]''. Also, an increasing number of [[Types of Video-Game Development Parties|third-party developers]], including [[Midway Games]], [[Capcom]], [[Namco]], [[Atari]], and [[Sega]], released [[anthology]] collections of some of their old games. Additionally, many video games and video game series that were originally confined to Japan were released in North America and Europe for the first time.\n\n===Rise of online gaming===\n{{See also|SegaNet|Dreamarena|PS2 Online|Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter|Xbox Live}}\n[[Online game|Online gaming]], which in previous generations had been almost an exclusive domain of PC games, became more prominent in video game consoles during this generation. The [[Dreamcast]] initiated this change with its built in [[modem]], internet browsing software, and ability to play certain games online. The [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] also offered online gaming, though their approaches and commitment to it varied greatly. The Xbox offered an integrated service called [[Xbox Live]] that cost $50 per year and was only compatible with a [[Broadband|broadband internet connection]]. Its ability to connect gamers for online multi-player matches was a considerable factor in allowing the Xbox to gain a foothold in the western market, especially in the first-person shooter genre. The PlayStation 2 left its online gaming service up to each individual game publisher, and though it was free to use, it was not always an ideal experience, especially with games published by small developers. The ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs|SOCOM]]'' series was one of the most popular online competitive games for the PS2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://community.us.playstation.com/thread/4699021?tstart=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601223409/http://community.us.playstation.com/thread/4699021?tstart=0 |archivedate=2012-06-01 }}</ref> The GameCube did not offer online play for any of its first-party titles, with only Sega's ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' series and ''[[Homeland (video game)|Homeland]]'' making official use of the console's online capabilities. In addition, online capability was not out-of-the-box; an adapter was needed to hook the GameCube to the internet.\n\n===Mergers===\nMany game publishing companies with a long established history merged with their competitors: [[Microsoft]] bought second-party developer [[Rare (company)|Rare]] in 2002; [[Square (video game company)|Square]] merged with [[Enix]] to form [[Square Enix]] in 2003 and then later bought [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]; [[Sega]] merged with Sammy to form [[Sega Sammy Holdings]] in 2004; [[Konami]] bought a majority share of [[Hudson Soft]]; [[Namco]] merged with [[Bandai]] to form [[Bandai Namco Holdings]] in 2006.\n\n==Software==\n{{main|List of video game franchises}}\n\n===Milestone titles===\n* ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (PS2) by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] (now Square Enix) refined many elements found in its predecessors, adding a completely different battle system.

The title is perhaps best remembered for the excitement caused by its announcement trailer at E3 2004. It was released to widespread critical acclaim with an average of 96% on Metacritic.

''[[Video game terminology|Platforms]]'' in the sixth generation include consoles from four companies: the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]] (DC), [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2), [[Nintendo]] [[GameCube]] (GC), and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. This era began on November 27, 1998, with the Japanese release of the Dreamcast, which was joined by the PlayStation 2 on March 4, 2000, and the GameCube and Xbox on November 15, 2001. In April 2001, the Dreamcast was the first to be discontinued. The GameCube was next, in 2007, the Xbox on March 2, 2009, and the PlayStation 2 on January 4, 2013. Meanwhile, the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation of consoles]] started on November 22, 2005 with the launch of the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/04/playstation-2-manufacture-ends-years|title=PlayStation 2 manufacture ends after 12 years|date=January 4, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe major innovation of this generation was of full utilization of the [[internet]] to allow a fully online gaming experience.  While the prior generation had some systems with internet connectivity, such as the [[Apple Pippin]], these had little market penetration and thus had limited success in the area. Services such as Microsoft's [[XBox Live]] became industry standard in this, and future, generations.  Another innovation of the Xbox was the first system to utilize an internal [[hard disk drive]] to store game data.  This caused many improvements to the gaming experience, including the ability to store program data (rather than just save game data) that allowed for faster load times, as well as the ability to download games directly from the internet rather than to purchase physical media such as a disk or cartridge.  Soon after its release other systems, like the Sony PlayStation 2, produced peripheral storage devices to allow similar capabilities, and by the next generation internal storage became industry standard.\n\n[[Sixth generation of video game consoles#Bits and system power|Bit ratings]] (i.e. \"64-bit\" or \"32-bit\" for the previous generation) for most consoles largely fell by the wayside during this era, with the notable exceptions being promotions for the Dreamcast<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT1Tbc_PD2k|title=Sega Dreamcast UK advert|first=|last=kesavva|date=June 22, 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> and PS2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/ects-the-truth-about-the-dreamcast/|title=ECTS: The Truth About the Dreamcast...|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> that advertised \"128-bit graphics\" at the start of the generation. The number of \"bits\" cited in this way in console names refers to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Word (computer architecture)|word size]], and had been used by hardware marketing departments as a \"show of power\" for many years. However, there is little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 or 64&nbsp;bits because, once this level is reached, performance depends on more varied factors, such as processor [[clock speed]], [[CPU bandwidth|bandwidth]], and [[Computer memory|memory size]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe '''sixth generation of handhelds''' began with the release of the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] by [[SNK]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. The Game Boy Advance was discontinued around in early 2010. The next generation of handheld consoles began in November 2004, with the North American introduction of the [[Nintendo DS]].\n\nThe last [[Dreamcast homebrew|''official'' Dreamcast games]] were released in 2002 (North America and Europe) and 2007 (Japan).

With the announcements of the Xbox and GameCube in late 2000, Sega's console was considered by some to be outdated only two years after its release.

Its arsenal of franchises and history in the industry, though earning it a loyal fan base, failed to give it an advantage against the Xbox and PlayStation 2 which captured audiences seeking '[[Entertainment Software Rating Board|Mature]]' titles of which Nintendo had fewer. Nintendo also made little headway into online gaming (releasing a small handful of online-capable games, the most popular of which was ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', which was, in fact, a port of the Dreamcast game), instead emphasizing [[Game Boy Advance]] connectivity. As a result, the Nintendo GameCube failed to match the sales of its predecessor, the [[Nintendo 64]], but the console wasn't a financial failure. Nintendo did however rejuvenate its relationship with many developers,<ref name=\"Mark Reese\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/11/feature_remembering_the_gamecube|date=19 Nov 2011|title=Feature: Remembering the GameCube|last=Reese|first=Mark|website=www.nintendolife.com|access-date=11 Feb 2018}}</ref> often working in close collaboration with them to produce games based upon its franchises, in contrast to the past where it was frequently seen as bullying developers in the late 1980s, back when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was out on the market.

However, the Xbox attracted a large fanbase and strong third-party support in the United States and Europe and became a recognizable brand amongst the mainstream. The [[Xbox Live]] online service with its centralized model proved particularly successful, prompting Sony to boost the online capabilities of the PlayStation 2. Xbox Live also gave the Xbox an edge over the GameCube, which had a near-total lack of online games.

These, however, are less notable, never saw a worldwide release, and/or have sold particularly poorly, and are therefore listed as 'Other'.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Nuon-N2000-wController-L.jpg|link=File:Nuon-N2000-wController-L.jpg|The [[Nuon (DVD technology)|Nuon]] was a hybrid DVD player/gaming system released in 2000, that had a very small game library.\nFile:AtariFlashback.jpg|The [[Atari Flashback]], the \"plug and play\" version of the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 7800|7800]] Released in 2004.\nFile:V-Smile_Top.JPG|The [[V.Smile]] was a gaming system for education, created by [[VTech]]. Released in 2004\nFile:XaviX-XaviXPORT-Console-FL.jpg|The [[XaviX]] is the video gaming base console for the XaviX Interactive System, released by SSD COMPANY LIMITED in 2004.\n</gallery>\n\n==Bits and system power==\nBit ratings for consoles largely fell by the wayside after the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation]] (32/64-bit) era. The number of \"bits\" cited in console names referred to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Word (data type)|word]] size, but there was little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 bits; performance depended on other factors, such as [[central processing unit]] speed, [[graphics processing unit]] speed, [[channel capacity]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]] size, and memory speed, [[memory latency|latency]], and size.\n\nThe importance of the number of [[bit]]s in the modern console gaming market has thus decreased due to the use of components that process data in varying word sizes. Previously, console manufacturers advertised the \"''n''-bit talk\" to over-emphasize the hardware capabilities of their system. The Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2 were the last systems to use the term \"128-bit\" in their marketing to describe their capability.\n\nIt is not easy to compare the relative \"power\" of the different systems. Having a larger CPU word size does not necessarily make one console more powerful than another. Likewise, the operating frequency (clock rate, measured in terms of [[Hertz]]) of a system's CPU is not an accurate measure of performance either, except between systems of the same or similar architecture.\n\nThe Microsoft [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] uses a 32-bit (general purpose) [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] x86 architecture CPU, with an instruction set equal to that of the Coppermine core Mobile [[Celeron]], though it has less cache (128&nbsp;kB) than the PC equivalent. It has 64&nbsp;MB RAM (shared) and runs at 733&nbsp;MHz. Because the Pentium 3 introduced [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], the Xbox also had 128-bit SIMD capabilities. Its ''NV2A'' [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], which is very similar to the [[GeForce 3 Series]] of desktop GPUs, makes it the only console in its time with traditional vertex and pixel [[shader]]s.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/853/14 AnandTech.com: Hardware Behind the Consoles \u2013 Microsoft's Xbox vs. Sony PlayStation 2], November 21, 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[Nintendo GameCube]]'s [[IBM]] [[Gekko (microprocessor)|Gekko]] [[PowerPC]] CPU runs at 485&nbsp;MHz, while its \"Flipper\" graphics processor is comparable to the original [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] [[Radeon R100|Radeon]], and it has 43&nbsp;MB of non-unified memory (24&nbsp;MB of 1T-SRAM, 3&nbsp;MB embedded 1T-SRAM, and 16&nbsp;MB DRAM). The GameCube supports [[Dolby Pro Logic]] II.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/858/13 AnandTech.com: Hardware Behind the Consoles \u2013 Nintendo GameCube vs. Sony PlayStation 2 vs. Microsoft Xbox], December 7, 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[PlayStation 2]]'s CPU (known as the \"128-bit [[Emotion Engine]]\") has a 64-bit core with a 32-bit FPU\ncoupled to two 128 bit Vector Units, The hybrid R5900 CPU is based on [[MIPS architecture]]. The PS2 also has an internal 10 Channel DMA Bus which is fully 128 bits wide. Paths between the Emotion Engine, RAM and the Graphics synthesizer (GS) are also 128 bits wide. The PS2's unique hardware arrangement with no less than 10 processing units were difficult to come to grips with. Many developers struggled initially with programming the hardware. The PS2's Graphics Synthesizer (GS) has fast dedicated video memory, though it is limited in the amount of data it can hold, The 10 Channel 128 bit wide DMA bus could pump data to GS Memory as fast as the screen could update. Consequently, with the main memory being limited to 32MB, many of the PS2's games have reduced textures compared with versions for other consoles. It also does not have a hardware dedicated [[Transform, clipping, and lighting|transform and lighting]] unit like the ones found in the Xbox and GameCube GPUs.\n\nHowever the PS2's design allows a remarkable degree of flexibility and choice. For example, Program control and general arithmetic could be handled by the CPU, while the Vector Units 0 and 1, could provide parallel processing of physics, clipping and transform and lighting to the scene. The Vector units were noted to be so versatile that [[Shadow of the Colossus|Shadow of The Colossus]] used one of the vector units to do full Pixel shading for the fur of the Collossi.\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]] has a [[64-bit]] [[Double precision|double-precision]] [[superscalar]] [[SuperH]]-4 [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[Central processing unit]] core with a [[32-bit]] [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] unit using [[16-bit]] fixed-length instructions, a 64-bit data bus allowing a variable width of either 8, 16, 32 or 64-bits, and a 128-bit floating-point bus.<ref>[http://www.segatech.com/technical/cpu/index.html Technology Partner \u2013 Design Solutions from Hitachi Semiconductor (America) Inc.: SH7750 (SH-4 Series) MPU] (November/December 1997)</ref> The [[PowerVR]] 2DC CLX2 chipset uses a unique method of rendering a 3D scene called [[Tiled rendering|Tile]] Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR): while storing polygons in [[triangle strip]] format in memory, the display is split into tiles associated with a list of visibly overlapping triangles onto which, using a process similar to [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], rays are cast and a pixel is rendered from the triangle closest to the camera. After calculating the depths associated with each polygon for one tile row in 1 cycle, the whole tile is flushed to video memory before passing on to render the next tile. Once all information has been collated for the current [[Film frame|frame]], the tiles are rendered in turn to produce the final image.\n\n==Handheld systems==\n{{See also|Comparison of handheld game consoles}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Purple-FL.jpg|thumb|The [[Game Boy Advance]] was the best-selling handheld system.]]\nDuring the sixth generation era, the [[handheld game console]] market expanded with the introduction of new devices from many different manufacturers. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. Two redesigns of this system followed, the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] in 2003 and the [[Game Boy Micro]] in 2005. Also introduced were the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] by [[SNK]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. South Korean company [[Game Park]] introduced its [[GP32]] handheld in 2001, and with it came the dawn of [[Open-source software|open source]] handheld consoles. The Game Boy Advance line of handhelds has sold 81.51 million units worldwide as of September 30, 2010.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\nA major new addition to the market was the trend for corporations to include a large number of \"non-gaming\" features into their handheld consoles, including [[mobile phone|cell phones]], [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], portable movie players, and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like features. The handheld that started this trend was [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]], which was released in 2003 and doubled primarily as a mobile phone. It went through a redesign in 2004 and was renamed the [[N-Gage QD]]. A second handheld, the [[Tapwave Zodiac|Zodiac]] from Tapwave, was released in 2004; based on the [[Palm OS]], it offered specialized gaming-oriented video and sound capabilities, but it had an unwieldy development kit due to the underlying Palm OS foundation.\n\nA fairly uncommon handheld of the 6th generation was the vtech V.SMILE Pocket. A handheld version of their V.SMILE home console.\n\nWith more and more PDAs arriving during the previous generation, the difference between consumer electronics and traditional computing began to blur and cheap console technology grew as a result. It was said of PDAs that they were \"the computers of handheld gaming\" because of their multi-purpose capabilities and the increasingly powerful computer hardware that resided within them. This capability existed to move gaming beyond the last generation's 16-bit limitations; however, PDAs were still geared towards the typical businessman, and lacked new, affordable software franchises to compete with dedicated handheld gaming consoles.\n\n===Handheld comparison===\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5%\"| Name\n!style=\"width: 25%;\" |

The sixth generation was the first to help console and computer software grow closer together as well as outperform the arcade market in features, graphics and business.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The Dreamcast, which had an official Windows CE Development Kit to help porting games from PCs to Dreamcast, and the Xbox, which was made from off-the-shelf PC parts and hosted many PC ports, factored into this also.\n\n===Controversial games===\n{{main|Video game controversy}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}\nWhile the sixth generation was not the first to have its share of controversial games, this generation was noted to have extensive criticism by public figures of \"objectionable\" content in gaming such as sex, crime, violence, profanity, drug use, and social propaganda as well as topics of debate such as religion, politics and economics.\n\nThe sixth generation was also notable because it saw the continuation of lawmakers taking actions against the video game industry. The most famous were [[Rockstar Games]]' [[Manhunt (video game)|''Manhunt'']] and [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' games]] (''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'') facing lawsuits over alleged racial slurs and influencing minors to commit crimes, while ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' was briefly given an adult rating and removed from most stores over the availability of an abandoned sex mini-game using the [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy|Hot Coffee mod]].\n\nThe sixth generation also coincided with the [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City and [[the Pentagon]], which had a huge impact on the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]], including the [[video game industry]]; in the subsequent market climate, multiple games were edited in response to the sensitivity surrounding the event. Prior to its release, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' depicted [[Arsenal Gear|a submersible mobile fortress hijacked by terrorists]] destroying a good portion of [[Manhattan]] in view of the twin towers (this can be found in the \"Document of Metal Gear Solid 2\" making-of feature). Similarly, several undisclosed modifications were made in ''Grand Theft Auto III'', such as a change to the police cars' color scheme (the old scheme resembled that of [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s older blue and white design) and altered cover art (the European release featured the original artwork); Rockstar Games estimates that the changes amounted to 1% in changed content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/19981/grand-theft-auto-iii-your-questions-answered-part-two-911-the-gh.html|title=Rockstar Games|website=Rockstar Games|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref> The [[Dreamcast]] game ''[[Propeller Arena]]'' was never officially released, possibly due to a certain level which was visually very similar to the September 11 attacks.\n\n===Emulation and retro gaming===\n{{see also|Console emulator}}\nBecause of the increased computing power of video game consoles and the widespread usage of [[emulator]]s, the sixth generation saw the rise of console emulation and retro gaming on a vast scale. Many games for older systems were updated with superior graphics or sound and re-released for current consoles. Commonly emulated games included those released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (the PS2 can play PS1 games natively), and the [[Nintendo 64]].\n\nAlso during this generation, the computing power of handheld consoles became capable of supporting games made for some of the earliest gaming consoles and several companies released remakes of classic games for the handhelds. Nintendo introduced a line of NES and SNES games for its Game Boy Advance handheld, including remakes such as ''[[Final Fantasy I and II (compilations)|Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]''. Also, an increasing number of [[Types of Video-Game Development Parties|third-party developers]], including [[Midway Games]], [[Capcom]], [[Namco]], [[Atari]], and [[Sega]], released [[anthology]] collections of some of their old games. Additionally, many video games and video game series that were originally confined to Japan were released in North America and Europe for the first time.\n\n===Rise of online gaming===\n{{See also|SegaNet|Dreamarena|PS2 Online|Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter|Xbox Live}}\n[[Online game|Online gaming]], which in previous generations had been almost an exclusive domain of PC games, became more prominent in video game consoles during this generation. The [[Dreamcast]] initiated this change with its built in [[modem]], internet browsing software, and ability to play certain games online. The [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] also offered online gaming, though their approaches and commitment to it varied greatly. The Xbox offered an integrated service called [[Xbox Live]] that cost $50 per year and was only compatible with a [[Broadband|broadband internet connection]]. Its ability to connect gamers for online multi-player matches was a considerable factor in allowing the Xbox to gain a foothold in the western market, especially in the first-person shooter genre. The PlayStation 2 left its online gaming service up to each individual game publisher, and though it was free to use, it was not always an ideal experience, especially with games published by small developers. The ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs|SOCOM]]'' series was one of the most popular online competitive games for the PS2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://community.us.playstation.com/thread/4699021?tstart=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601223409/http://community.us.playstation.com/thread/4699021?tstart=0 |archivedate=2012-06-01 }}</ref> The GameCube did not offer online play for any of its first-party titles, with only Sega's ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' series and ''[[Homeland (video game)|Homeland]]'' making official use of the console's online capabilities. In addition, online capability was not out-of-the-box; an adapter was needed to hook the GameCube to the internet.\n\n===Mergers===\nMany game publishing companies with a long established history merged with their competitors: [[Microsoft]] bought second-party developer [[Rare (company)|Rare]] in 2002; [[Square (video game company)|Square]] merged with [[Enix]] to form [[Square Enix]] in 2003 and then later bought [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]; [[Sega]] merged with Sammy to form [[Sega Sammy Holdings]] in 2004; [[Konami]] bought a majority share of [[Hudson Soft]]; [[Namco]] merged with [[Bandai]] to form [[Bandai Namco Holdings]] in 2006.\n\n==Software==\n{{main|List of video game franchises}}\n\n===Milestone titles===\n* ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (PS2) by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] (now Square Enix) refined many elements found in its predecessors, adding a completely different battle system.

The title is perhaps best remembered for the excitement caused by its announcement trailer at E3 2004. It was released to widespread critical acclaim with an average of 96% on Metacritic.

The division is located on the west side of the [[Tamar River, Tasmania|Tamar River]]. It is named after the town of Rosevears which is located on the river banks near [[Exeter, Tasmania|Exeter]].\n\nThe electoral boundaries include the towns of [[Exter, Tasmania|Exeter]], [[Rowella, Tasmania|Rowella]], [[Sidmouth, Tasmania|Sidmouth]], [[Legana, Tasmania|Legana]], [[Bridgenorth, Tasmania|Bridgenorth]], [[Gravelly Beach, Tasmania|Gravelly Beach]], [[Greens Beach, Tasmania|Greens Beach]], [[Beaconsfield, Tasmania|Beaconsfield]], [[Glengarry, Tasmania|Glengarry]], [[Beauty Point, Tasmania|Beauty point]] and [[Clarence point, Tasmania|Clarence point]].
