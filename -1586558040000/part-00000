It is situated near to the site of [[Kafr Bir'im]] or '''Kafar Berem''', a medieval [[Maronite]] Christian village.  Today, it is located in Northern [[Israel]], 3 kilometers from the Lebanese border.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is often assumed to mean \"Son of the People,\" incorporating the [[Aramaic]] word ''bar'' \u05d1\u05e8, meaning \"son\" and the [[Hebrew]] word ''am'' \u05e2\u05dd meaning \"people\". However, if like at [[Shfar'am]], both elements are Hebrew, the name could derive from a literary Hebrew word \u05d1\u05e8 indicating cleanliness, purity, pristineness and wholesomeness - \"The wholesome people\" or \"wholesomeness of the people\".\n\n==History==\nBar'am was established in ancient times as a Jewish village. According to Jewish tradition, [[Pinchas ben Yair]] (2nd-century [[Common Era|AD]]) was buried in Kfar Bar'am.<ref>''Burial Places of the Fathers'', published by Yehuda Levi Nahum in book: ''\u1e62ohar la-\u1e25asifat ginzei teiman'' (Heb.

The architecture is similar to that of other synagogues in the Galilee built in the [[Talmud]]ic period. In 1522, Rabbi Moses Basula wrote that the synagogue belonged to [[Simeon bar Yochai]], who survived the Second Jewish War in 132-135 CE (the [[Bar-Kochba]] revolt). Archaeologists, however, have concluded that the building was built at least a century later. According to another tradition, the synagogue was built in honor of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and bore his name.<ref>''Burial Places of the Fathers'', published by Yehuda Levi Nahum in book: ''\u1e62ohar la-\u1e25asifat ginzei teima''n (Heb. '''\u05e6\u05d4\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d7\u05e9\u05d9\u05e4\u05ea \u05d2\u05e0\u05d6\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d9\u05de\u05df'''), Tel-Aviv 1986, p. 252 (Hebrew)</ref> Israeli archaeologist Lipa Sukenik (1889\u20131953), who was instrumental in establishing the Department of Archaeology at the [[Hebrew University]], excavated a relief in one of the synagogues in 1928, and dated the Bar\u2019am synagogue to the 3rd century CE.\n\nThe synagogue is made of basalt stone, standard for most buildings in the area. The six-column portico is unusual. The front entrance of the synagogue has three doorways that face [[Jerusalem]]. In front of the entrance are some of the (originally eight) columns with Attic bases which supported a porch. There is an inscription under the right window on the facade, which reads: \"Banahu Elazar bar Yodan\", which means \"Elazar bar Yodan built it\". Elazar bar Yodan is a [[Jewish Aramaic]] name.  The interior of the synagogue was divided by rows of columns into three aisles and an ambulatory.\n\nAn unusual feature in an ancient synagogue  is the presence of three-dimensional sculpture, a pair of stone lions. A similar pair of three-dimensional lions was found at [[Chorazin]].<ref>Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology, Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 190.</ref> A carved frieze features a winged victory and images of animals and, possibly, human figures.<ref>Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology, Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 92.</ref>\n\nThere was a second, smaller synagogue, but little of it was found. A lintel from this smaller synagogue is at the [[Louvre]].  The Hebrew inscription on the lintel reads, ''\"Peace be upon the place, and on all the places of Israel.\"<ref>Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology,  Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, Chapter 1, ''Building an Ancient Synagogue on the Delaware,'' pp. 12-21</ref>\n\n[[File:Maronite ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Maronite village]]\nIn 1901, publication of photos of the ancient synagogue led the Jewish Hospital of Philadelphia, (now the [[Albert Einstein Medical Center]],) to erect a synagogue, the [[Henry S.

It is situated near to the site of [[Kafr Bir'im]] or '''Kafar Berem''', a medieval [[Maronite]] Christian village.  Today, it is located in Northern [[Israel]], 3 kilometers from the Lebanese border.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is often assumed to mean \"Son of the People,\" incorporating the [[Aramaic]] word ''bar'' \u05d1\u05e8, meaning \"son\" and the [[Hebrew]] word ''am'' \u05e2\u05dd meaning \"people\". However, if like at [[Shfar'am]], both elements are Hebrew, the name could derive from a literary Hebrew word \u05d1\u05e8 indicating cleanliness, purity, pristineness and wholesomeness - \"The wholesome people\" or \"wholesomeness of the people\".\n\n==History==\nBar'am was established in ancient times as a Jewish village. According to Jewish tradition, [[Pinchas ben Yair]] (2nd-century [[Common Era|CE]]) was buried in Kfar Bar'am.<ref>''Burial Places of the Fathers'', published by Yehuda Levi Nahum in book: ''\u1e62ohar la-\u1e25asifat ginzei teiman'' (Heb.

The architecture is similar to that of other synagogues in the Galilee built in the [[Talmud]]ic period. In 1522, Rabbi Moses Basula wrote that the synagogue belonged to [[Simeon bar Yochai]], who survived the Second Jewish War in 132-135 CE (the [[Bar-Kochba]] revolt). Archaeologists, however, have concluded that the building was built at least a century later. According to another tradition, the synagogue was built in honor of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and bore his name.<ref>''Burial Places of the Fathers'', published by Yehuda Levi Nahum in book: ''\u1e62ohar la-\u1e25asifat ginzei teima''n (Heb. '''\u05e6\u05d4\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d7\u05e9\u05d9\u05e4\u05ea \u05d2\u05e0\u05d6\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d9\u05de\u05df'''), Tel-Aviv 1986, p. 252 (Hebrew)</ref> Israeli archaeologist Lipa Sukenik (1889\u20131953), who was instrumental in establishing the Department of Archaeology at the [[Hebrew University]], excavated a relief in one of the synagogues in 1928, and dated the Bar\u2019am synagogue to the 3rd century CE.\n\nThe synagogue is made of basalt stone, standard for most buildings in the area. The six-column portico is unusual. The front entrance of the synagogue has three doorways that face [[Jerusalem]]. In front of the entrance are some of the (originally eight) columns with Attic bases which supported a porch. There is an inscription under the right window on the facade, which reads: \"Banahu Elazar bar Yodan\", which means \"Elazar bar Yodan built it\". Elazar bar Yodan is a [[Jewish Aramaic]] name.  The interior of the synagogue was divided by rows of columns into three aisles and an ambulatory.\n\nAn unusual feature in an ancient synagogue  is the presence of three-dimensional sculpture, a pair of stone lions. A similar pair of three-dimensional lions was found at [[Chorazin]].<ref>Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology, Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 190.</ref> A carved frieze features a winged victory and images of animals and, possibly, human figures.<ref>Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology, Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 92.</ref>\n\nThere was a second, smaller synagogue, but little of it was found. A lintel from this smaller synagogue is at the [[Louvre]].  The Hebrew inscription on the lintel reads, ''\"Peace be upon the place, and on all the places of Israel.\"<ref>Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology,  Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, Chapter 1, ''Building an Ancient Synagogue on the Delaware,'' pp. 12-21</ref>\n\n[[File:Maronite ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Maronite village]]\nIn 1901, publication of photos of the ancient synagogue led the Jewish Hospital of Philadelphia, (now the [[Albert Einstein Medical Center]],) to erect a synagogue, the [[Henry S. Frank Memorial Synagogue]], inspired by Bar'am and other ancient Israeli synagogues.  The hospital's synagogue replicated the round arch of the door of the standing ruin and the lintel from the smaller synagogue that is now in the Louvre.<ref name=\"Steven Fine 2005, pp. 13-14\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ancient synagogues in Palestine|Ancient synagogues in the Palestine region]]\n**[[Ancient synagogues in Israel]]\n*[[Archaeology of Israel]]\n*[[Bar'am National Park]]\n*[[Oldest synagogues in the world]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071120011810/http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bazlov/israel/baram.html Bar'am synagogue (Talmudic period)]\n* [http://www.jewishmag.com/44mag/synagogues/synagogues.htm Ancient Synagogues in Bar'am and Capernaum ] article written by Jacqueline Schaalje, from Jewish Magazine, June 2001 Edition\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071225212558/http://israel4321.wordpress.com/2007/01/23/baram-national-park-an-ancient-synagogue-and-a-maronite-church/ Bar\u2019am National Park, an ancient synagogue and a Maronite church]\n* [http://www.archiprix.org/project_2007.php?id=1931 Coexistence - Kafar Berem]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} article written by Hanna F.
