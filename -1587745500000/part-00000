It is the [[List of cities in South Dakota|eighth-most populous city in South Dakota]]. Founded in 1880, it was selected as the state capital when the territory was admitted as a state. Pierre is the principal city of the [[Pierre micropolitan area|Pierre Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Hughes and [[Stanley County, South Dakota|Stanley]] counties.\n\n==History==\n[[File:South Dakota capital rival 1889 maps.jpg|thumb|upright=2.3|left|Huron (left) and Pierre (right) issued rival maps that claimed each as the best place voters should choose for the new state capital in 1890.]]\n\nThe city was founded in 1880 on the east bank of the [[Missouri River]] opposite [[Fort Pierre, South Dakota|Fort Pierre]], a former trading post that developed as a community. Pierre was designated as the state capital when South Dakota gained [[U.S. state|statehood]] on November 2, 1889.\n\n[[Huron, South Dakota|Huron]] challenged the city to be selected as the capital, but Pierre was selected because of its location in the geographic center of the state. Fort Pierre had developed earlier, with a permanent settlement since about 1817 around a fur trading post. Fort Pierre Chouteau, preceding the city, was named after [[Pierre Chouteau, Jr.]], a major American [[fur trader]] from [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], who was of colonial [[French people|French]] origin.\n\nDevelopment of Pierre was also influenced by construction of the [[Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad]], which runs east\u2013west through the city. It increased access to markets for regional products and improved transportation for passengers. The railroad crosses the Missouri River on the [[Chicago and North Western Railroad Bridge]].\n\nBut the capital city became relatively isolated in the post-World War II era of federally subsidized highway construction, as travelers and freight companies began to use automobiles and trucking. It is one of four state capitals that is not served by an interstate highway, and it is alone in not having access to an expressway. Railways still serve in the Plains states, however.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Pierre South Dakota.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of the [[Oahe Dam]], several miles north of Pierre, taken from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS)]]\n\nPierre is located at {{coord|44|22|21|N|100|19|12|W|type:city}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|13.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|13.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=June 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nPierre is sited on rough river bluffs above the east bank of the Missouri River, overlooking its expanse.

It is the [[List of cities in South Dakota|eighth-most populous city in South Dakota]]. Founded in 1880, it was selected as the state capital when the territory was admitted as a state. Pierre is the principal city of the [[Pierre micropolitan area|Pierre Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Hughes and [[Stanley County, South Dakota|Stanley]] counties.\n\n==History==\n[[File:South Dakota capital rival 1889 maps.jpg|thumb|upright=2.3|left|Huron (left) and Pierre (right) issued rival maps that claimed each as the best place voters should choose for the new state capital in 1890.]]\n\nThe city was founded in 1880 on the east bank of the [[Missouri River]] opposite [[Fort Pierre, South Dakota|Fort Pierre]], a former trading post that developed as a community. Pierre was designated as the state capital when South Dakota gained [[U.S. state|statehood]] on November 2, 1889.\n\n[[Huron, South Dakota|Huron]] challenged the city to be selected as the capital, but Pierre was selected because of its location in the geographic center of the state. Fort Pierre had developed earlier, with a permanent settlement since about 1817 around a fur trading post. Fort Pierre Chouteau, preceding the city, was named after [[Pierre Chouteau, Jr.]], a major American [[fur trader]] from [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], who was of colonial [[French people|French]] origin.\n\nDevelopment of Pierre was also influenced by construction of the [[Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad]], which runs east\u2013west through the city. It increased access to markets for regional products and improved transportation for passengers. The railroad crosses the Missouri River on the [[Chicago and North Western Railroad Bridge]].\n\nBut the capital city became relatively isolated in the post-World War II era of federally subsidized highway construction, as travelers and freight companies began to use automobiles and trucking. It is one of four state capitals that is not served by an interstate highway, and it is alone in not having access to an expressway. Railways still serve in the Plains states, however.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Pierre South Dakota.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of the [[Oahe Dam]], several miles north of Pierre, taken from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS)]]\n\nPierre is located at {{coord|44|22|21|N|100|19|12|W|type:city}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|13.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|13.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=June 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nPierre is sited on rough river bluffs above the east bank of the Missouri River, overlooking its expanse.

The earlier recording sessions have been attributed to [[post-production]] work for the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to [[Bradley Cooper]]'s ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', a remake of the [[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|1937 film of the same name]] in which she has top billing. The later recording sessions have mostly been attributed to further production for ''Chromatica''. Producer [[BloodPop]], who had co-produced every song on the standard edition of Gaga's previous studio album ''Joanne'' (2016), shared on various social media platforms that he and Gaga had been recording at the singer's Malibu estate with German electronic music producer [[Boys Noize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8356693/lady-gaga-boys-noize |title=Lady Gaga & Boys Noize Are Working Together in the Studio|last=Bein|first=Kat|date=April 19, 2018|accessdate=May 8, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420182625/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8356693/lady-gaga-boys-noize |archivedate=April 20, 2018|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> BloodPop continued to post similar updates through the entirety of 2019 and January 2020, indicating production had continued for nearly three years.

So I have a house where it's [[Frank Zappa|Frank Zappa's]] old [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen|studio]], it's a live room, it's a big studio, it's beautiful. And I would be upstairs on the porch, outside the kitchen, and Bloodpop would come up and he'd go, 'Okay, come on, that's enough, off the porch,' and I would cry and I would say, 'I'm miserable, I'm sad, I\u2019m depressed,' and he'd go, 'I know, and we're gonna go make some music now. And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that. These records got passed around to so many different people, there were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me.<ref name=\"Beats1\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' released in March 2020, Gaga talked at length about numerous topics, including the recording process for ''Chromatica'', and confirmed that BloodPop was the \"center\" and her \"nucleus\" of production while creating the album and that he had a hand in the creation of every track.<ref name=\"Paper1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]}}</ref> It was also confirmed in the same interview that Gaga worked with a wide array of producers and musicians, such as [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Tchami]], Benjamin Rice, and [[Rami Yacoub]], to create an album described as an \"[[electronic music|electronic]] [[tapestry]]\u201d by the interviewer.<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, she said, \"It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way. When they're inspired, they embroider things.\"<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> Gaga disclosed that she had collaborated with a \"fellow female pop star who [had similarly experienced] immense trauma while in the public eye\" and went into depth about the genesis of their song, which she describes as a \"celebration of all the tears\": \"I sat with her and we talked about our lives. It's two women having a conversation about how to keep going and how to be grateful for what you do.\"<ref name=\"Paper1\"/>\n\nOn April 23, 2020, BloodPop posted the tracklist on Instagram after Gaga did and identified producers and writers who worked on the album, including previously unnannouced [[Skrillex]], [[Madeon]], White Sea, Jacob Kasher, [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Justin Tranter]], [[Axwell]], [[Tom Norris (record producer)|Tom Norris]], Ely Rise, Benjamin Rice, Johannes Klahr, LIOHN and [[Madison Love]].

So we talked about that, and then I sort of went back and I said, 'OK, well, yeah, it's inclusivity but it's really a way of thinking,' you know, it's not just, 'Oh, Chromatica, we're being inclusive with all the colors, all the people,' and when I say, 'All the colors, all the people'  I mean way more than we could possibly fathom.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork2020\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn April 5, 2020, the album's official cover was revealed.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=ladygaga |number=1246905802952077312 |title=#Chromatica \u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udc932020 |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> It shows the singer with \"cotton candy pink\" hair, wearing a \"metallic bodysuit with spikes and studs sticking out of it\", \"a pair of platform boots with a tusk and a knife for its heels\" and a \"shoulder-to-fingertip sleeve covered in spikes\" on one of her hands.

So I have a house where it's [[Frank Zappa|Frank Zappa's]] old [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen|studio]], it's a live room, it's a big studio, it's beautiful. And I would be upstairs on the porch, outside the kitchen, and Bloodpop would come up and he'd go, 'Okay, come on, that's enough, off the porch,' and I would cry and I would say, 'I'm miserable, I'm sad, I\u2019m depressed,' and he'd go, 'I know, and we're gonna go make some music now. And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that. These records got passed around to so many different people, there were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me.<ref name=\"Beats1\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' released in March 2020, Gaga talked at length about numerous topics, including the recording process for ''Chromatica'', and confirmed that BloodPop was the \"center\" and her \"nucleus\" of production while creating the album and that he had a hand in the creation of every track.<ref name=\"Paper1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]}}</ref> It was also confirmed in the same interview that Gaga worked with a wide array of producers and musicians, such as [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Tchami]], Benjamin Rice, and [[Rami Yacoub]], to create an album described as an \"[[electronic music|electronic]] [[tapestry]]\u201d by the interviewer.<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, she said, \"It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way. When they're inspired, they embroider things.\"<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> Gaga disclosed that she had collaborated with a \"fellow female pop star who [had similarly experienced] immense trauma while in the public eye\" and went into depth about the genesis of their song, which she describes as a \"celebration of all the tears\": \"I sat with her and we talked about our lives. It's two women having a conversation about how to keep going and how to be grateful for what you do.\"<ref name=\"Paper1\"/>\n\nOn April 23, 2020, BloodPop posted the tracklist on Instagram after Gaga did and identified producers and writers who worked on the album, including previously unnannouced [[Skrillex]], [[Madeon]], White Sea, Jacob Kasher, [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Justin Tranter]], [[Axwell]], [[Tom Norris (record producer)|Tom Norris]], Ely Rise, Benjamin Rice, Johannes Klahr, LIOHN and [[Madison Love]].

So we talked about that, and then I sort of went back and I said, 'OK, well, yeah, it's inclusivity but it's really a way of thinking,' you know, it's not just, 'Oh, Chromatica, we're being inclusive with all the colors, all the people,' and when I say, 'All the colors, all the people'  I mean way more than we could possibly fathom.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork2020\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn April 5, 2020, the album's official cover was revealed.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=ladygaga |number=1246905802952077312 |title=#Chromatica \u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udc932020 |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> It shows the singer with \"cotton candy pink\" hair, wearing a \"metallic bodysuit with spikes and studs sticking out of it\", \"a pair of platform boots with a tusk and a knife for its heels\" and a \"shoulder-to-fingertip sleeve covered in spikes\" on one of her hands.

As houses began being built close to the refinery, the population there grew to the point that in 1921, this unincorporated area became the incorporated '''Village of Roxana'''.\n\nOriginally constructed on {{convert|336|acre|km2}}, the refinery now covers approx. {{convert|2200|acre|km2}} and is the largest in the Phillips 66 system.\n\nThe origin of the village's name is unknown. Local lore is that the name \"Roxana\" was chosen to honor a \"Queen Roxanne\" of the Netherlands, inasmuch as the village owed its very existence to state-owned [[Royal Dutch Shell]].  However, there has never been a Queen Roxanne of the Netherlands.  The Dutch monarch at the time was [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]. Starting with the formation of the Seattle-based American Gasoline Company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group also founded Roxana Petroleum Company in 1912 in [[Oklahoma]] to locate and produce [[crude oil]]. This was followed by the opening of refineries in [[New Orleans]] in 1916 and at Wood River in 1918.\n\nA [[Baptist]] church was organized in September 1921, and the land where the current First Baptist Church of Roxana now stands, at the corner of Tydeman Street and Central Avenue, was purchased in early 1922.  The first services were held there on December 3, 1922. J.A. Wilson served as the church's first pastor.<ref>[http://www.fbcroxana.org/history.html]</ref>\n\nA formal [[village hall]], called for by a vote for a \"Municipal Building\", was built on $36,000 worth of bonds<ref>{{cite web |title=ROXANA VILLAGE HALL HISTORY |url=http://www.roxana-il.org/html/history.html |website=Village of Roxana |accessdate=2019-09-08}}</ref> in 1938. It currently houses Roxana's Village President, Treasurer, Water Department, and Clerk's offices, the fire and police departments, the village board room, and a municipal gymnasium.<ref>[http://www.roxana-il.org/history.htm]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1940s, a large [[Art Deco]]-style theater was built at the northwest corner of Thomas Street and Central Avenue, at 400 N. Central Avenue.  To the south across Thomas Street used to sit Burbank School, built in 1936 (torn down in 2009), and at the southeast corner of the intersection lay Roxana Drug Store.\n\nSeating approximately 580 people, the theater was originally designed for [[vaudeville]] acts as well as movie showings.  In 1949, a [[tornado]] tore the roof off, but after repairs were made, the theater reopened.  In the late 1960s, it was closed for nearly two years before being sold in June 1968 from the estate of Albert Critchlow to Bloomer Amusement Co. of Belleville.  It was thereafter operated as \"BAC Cine\" for many years.  In 1992, the Cine was purchased by Kerasotes Theatres, Inc., of [[Springfield, Illinois]], which operated it until its closing in February 2002.<ref>[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=3322020&BRD=1719&PAG=461&dept_id=25271&rfi=6]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the theatre was purchased from Kerasotes and was donated to the Roxana [[Church of the Nazarene]], which is located just north of the theatre.  The church now operates the building as the Nazarene Community Center, where it is available for rental and group events.<ref>[http://www.roxananaz.com/?subpages/NCC-1.shtml]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoxana is located at {{coord|38|50|18|N|90|3|49|W|type:city}} (38.838397, -90.063653).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Roxana has a total area of {{convert|7.362|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|7.23|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 98.21%) is land and {{convert|0.132|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 1.79%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1766131\n  |title=G001 - Geographic Identifiers - 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-12-25\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213054233/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1766131\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 1139\n|1940= 1255\n|1950= 1911\n|1960= 2090\n|1970= 1882\n|1980= 1587\n|1990= 1562\n|2000= 1547\n|2010= 1542\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1450\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 1,547 people, 655 households, and 436 families residing in the village. The population density was 227.5 people per square mile (87.8/km\u00b2). There were 697 housing units at an average density of 102.5 per square mile (39.6/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the village was 98.51% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.13% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.26% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.26% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.39% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.45% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.65% of the population.\n\nThere were 655 households out of which 28.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.4% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.4% were non-families. 29.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.36 and the average family size was 2.92.\n\nIn the village, the age distribution of the population shows 23.4% under the age of 18, 8.1% from 18 to 24, 29.0% from 25 to 44, 23.0% from 45 to 64, and 16.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.8 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the village was $38,800, and the median income for a family was $45,500. Males had a median income of $40,078 versus $27,045 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the village was $20,511. About 2.5% of families and 3.8% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.0% of those under age 18 and 5.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\n== Education ==\nLocated within the village is [[Roxana High School]].  The school district is served by two elementary schools, though only one is located within the village limits of Roxana.  Central Elementary School is in Roxana, while South Roxana Elementary School is within [[South Roxana, Illinois|South Roxana]].  The former Burbank Elementary School, located at the corner of Thomas Street and Central Avenue, closed in 1984 and was demolished in 2009.\n\nNearby colleges and universities include [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], [[Principia College]], a four-year private college in [[Elsah, Illinois|Elsah]], and [[Lewis and Clark Community College]] in [[Godfrey, Illinois|Godfrey]]. The Dental School of [[Southern Illinois University]] is located close by in the city of [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]].\n\n== Roxana Park ==\nIn May 1934, a village ordinance was passed creating a Recreation Board that would develop a plan for activities and playground sites, establish a budget and employ a Supervisor to manage the operation.  In 1938, Village Hall was constructed which included a gymnasium for recreational activities.  The first meeting of the Village Board in the newly constructed Village Hall was held on Wednesday, February 1, 1939.  Village Hall, consisting of the gym, fire department, police department and other village offices, is located at the intersection of Central Avenue and West Third Street.\n\nIn 1947, land was purchased for the purpose of park and recreation facilities, and a [[softball]] diamond was constructed.  The park is located in the northeastern part of the village, to the north and east of Roxana High School.\n\nIn 1952, the Park District was incorporated, followed by the addition of a public [[swimming pool]] in 1957. Adjacent to the pool was a recreation area which included [[trampoline]]s, [[miniature golf]] and donkey cart rides.\n\nIn 1959, additional land was purchased, and a house was acquired from [[Shell Oil Company]] and moved to the property. This was the original meeting place of many community groups. When the house became too small to accommodate the needs of the people, the Rox-Arena was constructed in 1969.  For many years, Roxana Park Director Lyle Dona lived in this house within the park.\n\nIn the years following, [[picnic shelter]]s were added along with additional ball fields, concession stand, soccer field, playgrounds and bike/walking paths. The main park now is home to four [[baseball diamond]]s\u2014the High School Diamond, the Lighted Diamond, the South Diamond and the Picnic Diamond.\n\nIn 1993, Burbank Park was purchased from the school district. It now contains a baseball diamond, playground, picnic shelter, soccer field, and basketball court. It is the site of the annual Roxana Homecoming Festival held each May.\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Park District, a new pool house was constructed in 2002.\n\n==Transportation==\nRoxana is served by [[Amtrak]] in [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]], [[St. Louis Regional Airport]] (formerly known as Civic Memorial Airport) in [[Bethalto, Illinois|Bethalto]], and [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]].\n\nThe nearest interstate highway is [[Interstate 270 (Illinois\u2013Missouri)|Interstate 270]], approximately {{convert|6|mi|0}} to the south, although [[Illinois Route 255]] is a [[controlled access highway]], meeting federal interstate standards.  Easy access can be had to [[Interstate 55]], [[Interstate 70]] and [[Interstate 64]].\n\n[[Illinois Route 111]] (Central Avenue) is the main route through Roxana.  It is a four-lane, non-divided highway through the village, and boasts the only two stoplights in town (located at its intersections with Thomas Street and Tydeman Street).\n<!--Non-notable info:\nStarting at one end of town and proceeding from north to south, the cross streets, all of which run from east to west, of Roxana are: Rohm Place, Thomas Street, Elm Street, Walnut Street, Tydeman Street, First Street, Second Street, Third Street, Fourth Street, Fifth Street, Sixth Street, Seventh Street and Eighth Street.  Rohm Place, Elm Street and Walnut Street run only west of Maple Avenue; the others traverse the village from east to west.\n\nStarting at one end of town and proceeding from east to west, the streets of Roxana, all of which run from north to south, are:  Chaeffer Avenue, Doerr Avenue, Central Avenue, Reller Avenue, Maple Avenue, McCurdy Avenue, Clark Avenue, and Old Edwardsville Road.  Doerr runs only north of Tydeman, as does Reller.  Maple runs only north of Fourth Street.  McCurdy runs only south of Tydeman and north of Third Street.  Clark runs only north of the alley between Elm and Thomas Streets.  Chaeffer Avenue runs along the former [[Wood River Refinery|Shell Refinery]] fence along the east side of the village.  Old Edwardsville Road runs along the former '''Standard Refinery''' fence along the west side of the village. ...end comment-->\n\n[[Illinois Route 255]] was completed in 1998 and runs through the eastern portion of the village limits, east of the [[Wood River Refinery|Wood River refinery]].  Although the village has plans to develop the area near Route 255, this has not yet occurred.\n\n==Notable person==\n<!-- Note:\n\u00b7 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.

The church now operates the building as the Nazarene Community Center, where it is available for rental and group events.<ref>[http://www.roxananaz.com/?subpages/NCC-1.shtml]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoxana is located at {{coord|38|50|18|N|90|3|49|W|type:city}} (38.838397, -90.063653).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Roxana has a total area of {{convert|7.362|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|7.23|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 98.21%) is land and {{convert|0.132|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 1.79%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1766131\n  |title=G001 - Geographic Identifiers - 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-12-25\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213054233/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1766131\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 1139\n|1940= 1255\n|1950= 1911\n|1960= 2090\n|1970= 1882\n|1980= 1587\n|1990= 1562\n|2000= 1547\n|2010= 1542\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1450\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 1,547 people, 655 households, and 436 families residing in the village. The population density was 227.5 people per square mile (87.8/km\u00b2). There were 697 housing units at an average density of 102.5 per square mile (39.6/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the village was 98.51% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.13% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.26% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.26% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.39% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.45% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.65% of the population.\n\nThere were 655 households out of which 28.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.4% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.4% were non-families. 29.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.36 and the average family size was 2.92.\n\nIn the village, the age distribution of the population shows 23.4% under the age of 18, 8.1% from 18 to 24, 29.0% from 25 to 44, 23.0% from 45 to 64, and 16.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.8 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the village was $38,800, and the median income for a family was $45,500. Males had a median income of $40,078 versus $27,045 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the village was $20,511. About 2.5% of families and 3.8% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.0% of those under age 18 and 5.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\n== Education ==\nLocated within the village is [[Roxana High School]].  The school district is served by two elementary schools, though only one is located within the village limits of Roxana.  Central Elementary School is in Roxana, while South Roxana Elementary School is within [[South Roxana, Illinois|South Roxana]].  The former Burbank Elementary School, located at the corner of Thomas Street and Central Avenue, closed in 1984 and was demolished in 2009.\n\nNearby colleges and universities include [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], [[Principia College]], a four-year private college in [[Elsah, Illinois|Elsah]], and [[Lewis and Clark Community College]] in [[Godfrey, Illinois|Godfrey]]. The Dental School of [[Southern Illinois University]] is located close by in the city of [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]].\n\n== Roxana Park ==\nIn May 1934, a village ordinance was passed creating a Recreation Board that would develop a plan for activities and playground sites, establish a budget and employ a Supervisor to manage the operation.  In 1938, Village Hall was constructed which included a gymnasium for recreational activities.  The first meeting of the Village Board in the newly constructed Village Hall was held on Wednesday, February 1, 1939.  Village Hall, consisting of the gym, fire department, police department and other village offices, is located at the intersection of Central Avenue and West Third Street.\n\nIn 1947, land was purchased for the purpose of park and recreation facilities, and a [[softball]] diamond was constructed.  The park is located in the northeastern part of the village, to the north and east of Roxana High School.\n\nIn 1952, the Park District was incorporated, followed by the addition of a public [[swimming pool]] in 1957. Adjacent to the pool was a recreation area which included [[trampoline]]s, [[miniature golf]] and donkey cart rides.\n\nIn 1959, additional land was purchased, and a house was acquired from [[Shell Oil Company]] and moved to the property. This was the original meeting place of many community groups. When the house became too small to accommodate the needs of the people, the Rox-Arena was constructed in 1969.  For many years, Roxana Park Director Lyle Dona lived in this house within the park.\n\nIn the years following, [[picnic shelter]]s were added along with additional ball fields, concession stand, soccer field, playgrounds and bike/walking paths. The main park now is home to four [[baseball diamond]]s\u2014the High School Diamond, the Lighted Diamond, the South Diamond and the Picnic Diamond.\n\nIn 1993, Burbank Park was purchased from the school district. It now contains a baseball diamond, playground, picnic shelter, soccer field, and basketball court. It is the site of the annual Roxana Homecoming Festival held each May.\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Park District, a new pool house was constructed in 2002.\n\n==Transportation==\nRoxana is served by [[Amtrak]] in [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]], [[St. Louis Regional Airport]] (formerly known as Civic Memorial Airport) in [[Bethalto, Illinois|Bethalto]], and [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]].\n\nThe nearest interstate highway is [[Interstate 270 (Illinois\u2013Missouri)|Interstate 270]], approximately {{convert|6|mi|0}} to the south, although [[Illinois Route 255]] is a [[controlled access highway]], meeting federal interstate standards.  Easy access can be had to [[Interstate 55]], [[Interstate 70]] and [[Interstate 64]].\n\n[[Illinois Route 111]] (Central Avenue) is the main route through Roxana.  It is a four-lane, non-divided highway through the village, and boasts the only two stoplights in town (located at its intersections with Thomas Street and Tydeman Street).\n<!--Non-notable info:\nStarting at one end of town and proceeding from north to south, the cross streets, all of which run from east to west, of Roxana are: Rohm Place, Thomas Street, Elm Street, Walnut Street, Tydeman Street, First Street, Second Street, Third Street, Fourth Street, Fifth Street, Sixth Street, Seventh Street and Eighth Street.  Rohm Place, Elm Street and Walnut Street run only west of Maple Avenue; the others traverse the village from east to west.\n\nStarting at one end of town and proceeding from east to west, the streets of Roxana, all of which run from north to south, are:  Chaeffer Avenue, Doerr Avenue, Central Avenue, Reller Avenue, Maple Avenue, McCurdy Avenue, Clark Avenue, and Old Edwardsville Road.  Doerr runs only north of Tydeman, as does Reller.  Maple runs only north of Fourth Street.  McCurdy runs only south of Tydeman and north of Third Street.  Clark runs only north of the alley between Elm and Thomas Streets.  Chaeffer Avenue runs along the former [[Wood River Refinery|Shell Refinery]] fence along the east side of the village.  Old Edwardsville Road runs along the former '''Standard Refinery''' fence along the west side of the village. ...end comment-->\n\n[[Illinois Route 255]] was completed in 1998 and runs through the eastern portion of the village limits, east of the [[Wood River Refinery|Wood River refinery]].  Although the village has plans to develop the area near Route 255, this has not yet occurred.\n\n==Notable person==\n<!-- Note:\n\u00b7 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.
