It was released on 13 November 1987<!--date sourced in prose--> through [[Merciful Release]] and [[Warner Music Group|WEA]], with [[Elektra Records]] handling the US release. After the release of the band's debut album, ''[[First and Last and Always]]'' (1985), members [[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]] and [[Wayne Hussey]] departed the band, leading to the band's disbandment. As a result, band frontman [[Andrew Eldritch]] formed a side project, [[The Sisterhood (gothic rock band)|The Sisterhood]], and recorded new material with them. After his first album with the side project received poor sales and a negative reception, he went back to recording with the Sisters of Mercy, albeit still without Adams and Hussey. Sisterhood member [[Patricia Morrison]] became a part of the band as a result.\n\nEldritch wrote the songs of ''Floodland'' in [[Hamburg]]; the city's large amount of water influenced the album's title as well as its recurring lyrical theme of water. He then called upon Larry Alexander and [[Jim Steinman]] to produce the album with him. Recording sessions began in Manhattan, New York, during January 1987 and carried on throughout the first half of the year in various studios throughout England. Eldritch served as the vocalist and performed most of the instruments on all tracks, with Morrison performing bass on some tracks and the band's drum machine, \"Doktor Avalanche\", acting as the drum player. In contrast to ''First and Last and Always'', ''Floodland'' was done in a less conventional way, with the album being pieced together on computers using sequencers. The album musically incorporates gothic rock and [[dark wave]], while lyrically, Eldritch is cast as someone observing the world slowly deteriorating. Some of the events that inspired some of the album's songs include the [[Chernobyl disaster]], [[Cold War]], and the band's breakup.\n\nThe band chose not to embark on a tour to support the album, but despite this, ''Floodland'' and its singles had a positive commercial performance. The album debuted in the United Kingdom at number 9. Its pre-orders assured it silver certification status from the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] upon its release. In 1988, the album was certified gold by the BPI for selling 100,000 copies in the UK. The album also peaked within the top 40 in other European countries. The three singles released to support the album were \"[[This Corrosion]]\", \"[[Dominion (song)|Dominion]]\", and \"[[Lucretia My Reflection]]\". In the UK, \"This Corrosion\" peaked at number 7, \"Dominion\" peaked at number 13, and \"Lucretia My Reflection\" peaked at number 20. The song \"1959\" was also released as a radio single.\n\n==Background==\n===The original band's breakup===\n[[File:Andrew Eldritch.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Band frontman [[Andrew Eldritch]], pictured here in 2000]]\nAfter the release of the band's debut album ''[[First and Last and Always]]'' in March 1985, frontman Andrew Eldritch intended to record an [[ABBA]] cover as a single,<ref name=\"spex 1\">''Spex'', August 1985, p. 5</ref> and tried to hire Jim Steinman as a producer. Eldritch originally contacted him when the ABBA song [[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)|\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\"]] was in the band's setlist. Steinman was interested in producing the cover, but was too busy at that time. Shortly afterward, the Sisters of Mercy disbanded.<ref name=\"ruff\">Ruff, ''Spex'', January 1988</ref> The break-up occurred while the band prepared their second LP in October 1985, which was going to be titled ''Left on Mission and Revenge''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Andrew Eldritch interview |series=SkyTrax |network=Sky1 |date=1987}}</ref> Eldritch, who still intended to record the album as a solo artist, on the same day called bassist [[Patricia Morrison]], currently on a UK tour with her band Fur Bible supporting [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], and asked her to collaborate with him.<ref name=\"sutherland2\">Sutherland, ''Melody Maker'', June 1988, p. 14</ref>\n\nThe music press reported the break-up on 2 November 1985, announcing that \"the Sisters of Mercy were down to singer Andrew Eldritch and his faithful drum machine Doctor Avalanche this week after guitarist [[Wayne Hussey]] and bassist [[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]] left the band. Although this has scuppered recording plans for a new album this month, Andrew now intends to record the same album in the New Year and could well be using Wayne as a session guitarist. [...] Andrew has also approached former [[The Gun Club|Gun Club]] bassist Patricia Morrison\u2014now in Fur Bible\u2014to play on the album, but it's not yet known whether Andrew will continue with the name Sisters of Mercy.\"<ref>''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine 2 November 1985 (page 3)</ref> Eldritch had no intention to carry on under the old band's name, as members of the band who left to form [[The Mission (band)|the Mission]] had an agreement with him that the name \"the Sisters of Mercy\" would be used by no one after the break-up.<ref name=\"sutherland1\">Sutherland, ''Melody Maker'', September 1987</ref>\n\n===The Sisterhood===\nEldritch released the single \"Giving Ground\" on 20 January 1986 under the name \"[[the Sisterhood (gothic rock band)|the Sisterhood]]\", which featured vocals by his musician friend [[James Ray (rock musician)|James Ray]]. At the end of February 1986 the [[Merciful Release]] label announced the \"forthcoming Andrew Eldritch album which for some months has had the working title ''Left on Mission and Revenge''.\" This solo album which was finally titled ''Gift'' was released in July 1986, again under the Sisterhood moniker. It was recorded at [[Fairview Studios]] in [[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. Eldritch did not sing on the album for contractual reasons. Morrison collaborated with him for the first time, contributing a spoken passage on the track \"Jihad\". The album was a financial failure, received negative reviews from the music press, and, as a result, Eldritch lost his [[Publishing contract|publishing deal]] with RCA Music Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesistersofmercy.com/gen/regift.htm |title=Sisters \u2013 About Gift |website=[[The Sisters of Mercy]] (official website) |date= |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A Sisterhood 12\" EP titled ''This Corrosion'' was planned for release and would feature an American vocalist, whose identity was meant to be kept secret until release.<ref name=\"spencer-strickland\">Spencer; Strickland, ''Sounds'', February 1986</ref> It had been recorded at Fairview Studios with [[Alan Vega]] but remained unreleased.

The demos were mainly recorded with a [[Casio CZ synthesizers|Casio CZ-101]] synthesizer, acoustic guitars and a new drum machine. At the time, Eldritch was attempting to find a MIDI drum machine that featured a \"tighter snare drum\" sound at a modest price.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesistersofmercy.com/tech/doktors.htm |title=Sisters Tech - Doktor Avalanche |website=[[The Sisters of Mercy]] (official website) |access-date=29 September 2018}}</ref> With the exception of \"This Corrosion\", he recorded demo versions of all ''Floodland'' songs in 1986, which later began to appear on the bootleggers' market.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Sisters-Of-Mercy-Black-Dominion/release/1052539 |title=The Sisters of Mercy - Black Dominion (Vinyl, 12\", Unofficial Release) |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=14 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Sisters-Of-Mercy-Kill-The-Lights/release/1623834 |title=The Sisters of Mercy - Kill the Lights (Vinyl, LP, Unofficial Release, White Label) |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=14 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Eldritch, Morrison didn't contribute to the songwriting, saying that the album was practically a solo record. He insinuated that she suffered from writer's block and was unable to come up with many musical ideas, also adding that he \"couldn't even get her to pick up the bass in the first place.\"<ref name=\"bravo\">Riemann, ''Bravo'', September 1992, p. 28</ref> Merciful Release office manager Boyd Steemson also confirmed that her contributions were minimal.<ref name=\"classic-rock-2-61\">McIntyre, ''Classic Rock'', July 2007, p. 61</ref> Eldritch denied that his approach to songwriting had changed since the band split, saying that \"'This Corrosion' sounds like 'Temple of Love' II, '1959' sounds like 'Afterhours' part 2. I don't see any difference or any real change. I think I just carry on where I stopped.\"<ref name=\"niechziol\">Niechziol, ''ME/Sounds'', February 1988</ref> He licensed the publishing to SBK Songs Limited (now part of [[EMI|EMI Music Publishing]]).<ref name=\"album notes\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Floodland|others=[[The Sisters of Mercy]]|year=1987|type=album liner notes|publisher=[[Merciful Release]]; [[Warner Music Group|WEA]]}}</ref>\n\nThe starting point for the album was the song \"This Corrosion\", which was to be produced by Steinman. Eldritch had immediately thought of him when he came up with the idea for the song.<ref name=\"niechziol\"/> He stated that \"when we were trying to sell 'Corrosion' to Steinman, we told him it was like the high-point of a Borgia's disco evening and he went for it.\"<ref name=\"sutherland1\"/> He also used Steinman to get his record company to concede an appropriate recording budget. He figured that the company wouldn't grant money to use on choirs, but that they'd immediately do so if Steinman were to ask for it.<ref name=\"scanlon9\">Scanlon, ''Sounds'', December 1987, p. 9</ref> According to Steemson, Max Hole, the head of Warners' [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]], managed to get the band a budget of \u00a350,000 for the song.<ref name=\"classic-rock-2-61\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:JimSecondNight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jim Steinman]] served as a producer for \"[[Dominion (song)|Dominion / Mother Russia]]\" and \"[[This Corrosion]]\"]]\nThe recording of \"[[This Corrosion]]\" and \"[[Dominion (song)|Dominion / Mother Russia]]\" started in January 1987 in New York.<ref name=\"scanlon10\"/> Steinman and Eldritch used [[Avatar Studios|Power Station Studios]] in Manhattan, New York, where they worked with engineer Larry Alexander.<ref name=\"TapeOp\">{{Cite web |url=https://tapeop.com/interviews/95/larry-alexander-bonus/ |title=Larry Alexander (bonus): Diana Ross, Devo, Springsteen, Steely Dan |last=Crane |first=Larry |authorlink=Larry Crane (recording engineer) |date=May\u2013June 2013 |website=[[Tape Op]] |access-date=1 December 2018}}</ref> On both songs, Steinman used six background singers<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesistersofmercy.com/gen/faqnorm/faqnorm.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |website=[[The Sisters of Mercy]] (official website) |access-date=29 September 2018}}</ref> and 40 members of the New York Choral Society.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nychoral.org/index.php?/about/past-concerts-repertoire/ |title=Past Concerts |website=New York Choral Society (official website) |access-date=29 September 2018}}</ref> Eldritch recalled that he was unsure as to why so many vocalists sung all at once, but noted that it \"seemed like a good idea at the time\" and worked out well in the end.<ref>Andrew Eldritch TV interview (''Bingo'' programme, [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|BRT]] 26 February 1988)</ref> Steinman mainly focused on the production of the choral singings and did not contribute much to the actual composition and arrangements. This caused him to receive only partial production credit for \"Dominion / Mother Russia\".<ref name=\"ruff\"/>\n\nThe remainder of the album was recorded in England. Initially, Eldritch worked with an unknown producer, who he eventually fired.<ref name=\"niechziol\"/> He called Larry Alexander while in New York and hired him as a co-producer. They travelled to England, where they recorded at multiple studios. They spent time at [[Strawberry Studios]] in Manchester before transitioning to [[The Wool Hall]] in Bath. Recording was completed at [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]] in London.<ref name=\"TapeOp\"/> Roy Neave, an in-house engineer at Fairview Studios, engineered the sessions. Originally Eldritch intended to work with his colleague John Spence, who had worked with the Sisterhood in 1986, but he was committed to another project at the time and recommended Neave as his replacement.<ref>[http://www.myheartland.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=20821] information provided by John Spence (13 September 2010)</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Composition==\n===Music===\n[[Sputnikmusic]] staff reviewer \"ManosG\" described the music of ''Floodland'' as a mix of [[gothic rock]] and [[dark wave]].<ref name=\"sputnik\"/> In contrast to the previous album, ''[[First and Last and Always]]'', which had been recorded in a conventional way, ''Floodland'' was pieced together on a computer with the help of [[Music sequencer|sequencers]]. Eldritch worked on the recorded parts with a [[Turtle Beach Systems|Voyetra Sequencer Plus]], with a [[Yamaha Pro Audio|Yamaha SPX-90]] being used as an [[effects unit]] and the parts being saved on a [[Compaq Portable series|Compaq Portable 286]]. The guitars were played by Eldritch himself, apart from the solo on \"This Corrosion\" which was played by Steinman's friend Eddie Martinez.<ref name=\"ruff\"/> In the previous year, he had played the guitar solo on [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s US number one hit \"[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]\". Most of the bass on the album was not played on a bass guitar, but instead by Eldritch himself using synth bass. Though Patricia Morrison was brought in as a member to play the bass, she was only featured in some places; Eldritch later suggested that she did not appear at all on the album. In an interview, he commented on the issue of Morrison playing on ''Floodland'', saying \"that's an assumption which a lot of people make, [...] but obviously I question that assumption.\"<ref name=\"MTV\">Andrew Eldritch TV interview (''[[120 Minutes (UK TV series)|120 Minutes]]'' programme, MTV 28 January 1991)</ref> Morrison later stated that she did indeed play on the album, but Eldritch recorded over her parts at times.<ref>[http://www.myheartland.co.uk/viewtopic.php?p=476550&sid=ef0eaa129263d0a863692ca0d4064d41] Information provided by Patricia Morrison (13 June 2009)</ref> The drum sounds on the album were sampled together from various drum machines with an [[Music Production Center|Akai S900]]. The tom sound was from an [[Oberheim DMX]] which had been used on ''First and Last and Always''.

He attributed the recurrence of this theme to the amount of water within Hamburg, where he was writing these songs.<ref name=\"scanlon9\"/> Michael Bonner of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' viewed Eldritch as casting himself in a role where he is a \"jaded observer, watching cynically as he and the world slouch towards Armageddon,\" adding that the songs are bonded together by \"images of the apocalypse that straddle the gap between the personal and the political.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/>\n\nThe two-part opening track, \"Dominion / Mother Russia\", was inspired by \"[[Ozymandias]]\", a [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] sonnet about a tyrant whose legacy of conquest diminishes as time passes by, from which one line is lifted. Bonner noted that the song seemed to have been inspired by [[Cold War]] geopolitics as well. Eldritch commented on the song and how it was created, saying \"I made the mistake of getting caught in central Europe when [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] started sprinkling its residue over the land. It's part of my hate/hate relationship with America. I just had the idea of all them huddled in their mobile homes while Mother Russia rained down on them. [...] I suppose the song is really about the prostitution of Europe by the Americans.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/> \"Flood I\" and \"Flood II\" use the word \"flood\" as a metaphor for sex. Eldritch commented on the song, saying \"most people, if you think about it, only get wet under certain circumstances. [...] Water is something so mammoth, so a flood is emotionally very stimulating.\"<ref name=\"mico\"/> He called \"[[Lucretia My Reflection]]\" his \"Welcome on board, Patricia\" song, saying that he had always thought of her as a \"[[Lucrezia Borgia|Lucretia]]-type person.\"<ref name=\"mico\"/> The partially-autobiographical song \"1959\" takes it title from Eldritch's birth year. He thought of the song as regarding \"innocence\u2013inherited as opposed to environmental.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/>\n\n[[File:The mission wayne hussey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Wayne Hussey]]'s departure from the band and his \"clich\u00e9d lyrics\" served as the inspiration for the lyrics of \"This Corrosion\"]]\nThe centre piece of the album, \"This Corrosion\", goes back to the conflict between Eldritch and his former bandmates who were now in the Mission. The lyrics are a parody of \"clich\u00e9d, meaningless rock lyrics\" as Wayne Hussey especially wrote them. Eldritch noted that \"it is, of course, directed at somebody and it doesn't take a genius to work out who, although it'll probably take the person concerned some considerable time. [...] Nearly all of [the lyrics] should be thought of in quotation marks. It would be too confusing to print them all.\"<ref name=\"mico\">Mico, ''Melody Maker'', November 1987</ref> He also notes that the title is capitalized on the lyrics sheet because \"it's the title of somebody else's song. [...] Wayne used to withdraw himself with a book of song titles, select those which sounded best and piece together a song lyric from it. It didn't have to have any meaning, it just had to sound good.\"<ref name=\"ruff\"/>\n\n\"Driven Like the Snow\", like \"Nine While Nine\" on the band's [[First and Last and Always|previous album]], is about Eldritch's former girlfriend Claire Shearsby, even being noted as \"Nine While Nine Part 2\" by him. He thought of the song as a way to logically explain why the relationship had to fall apart.<ref name=\"mico\"/> On \"Never Land\", Eldritch commented that it imagines \"the entire population of the earth starting to travel from some indefinable point in space toward the earth at increasing speed. It would take an eternity to reach the earth\u2014by which time you'd be reasonably spiritualised\u2014and even when you reached the destination, you wouldn't actually hit the ground. You'd be going so fast you'd just go through and out the other side, where there is another eternity of nothingness. I just tried to write a song about these impressions.\"<ref name=\"mico\"/> The lyrics Eldritch referred to would be found on the full 12-minute version of the song, which was included in the ''Merciful Release'' box set.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/never-land-full-length-bonus-track-lyrics-sisters-of-mercy.html |title=Sisters of Mercy - Never Land (Full Length) (Bonus Track) Lyrics |website=[[Metrolyrics]] |access-date=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Promotion and release==\n\"This Corrosion\" was selected as the first single from the album, although Eldritch initially had pleaded for \"Dominion\".<ref name=\"scanlon9\"/> It was released on 18 September 1987. Each format (7\", 12\", CD and cassette) contained a different mix of the song. Eldritch originally wanted the long version on the single, but the record company desired for an edited version instead. The mix of the LP version is identical to that of the 12\" version, but lasts about 45 seconds longer. The cassette version was mixed by Steinman and differs from other single versions.<ref name=\"ruff\"/> The B-side of the single was \"Torch\", which Eldritch produced and played every instrument on. It had been written in 1985 for the aborted ''Left on Mission and Revenge'' album. The 12\" single added Eldritch's version of the [[The Sisterhood (gothic rock band)|Sisterhood]] song \"Colours\". WEA conceded a budget of over \u00a350,000 for the video.<ref name=\"wuste\">''ME/Sounds'', May 1988</ref> It was shot in a warehouse in [[Wapping]] and set in the ruins of a post-nuclear attack London and was directed by Stuart Orme. The band wanted to film in Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union, but at the same time, Russian record label [[Melodiya]] was in negotiations with the West regarding video rights, and filming there would have botched the negotiations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patriciamorrison.co.uk/Interview.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060932/http://www.patriciamorrison.co.uk/Interview.htm |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Patricia Morrison interview (official website, as on 22 January 2005)</ref>\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album |id=r18126 |label=\"The Sisters of Mercy: ''Floodland'' |first=Chris |last=True |accessdate=20 September 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|7|10}}<ref>Sleazegrinder, ''Classic Rock'', December 2006, p. 101</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>Coleman, ''Rolling Stone'', May 1988</ref>\n| rev4 = [[Sputnikmusic]]\n| rev4Score = 4/5<ref name=\"sputnik\">{{cite web|last= g|first=manos|title=Review: CD The Sisters of Mercy - Floodland Album|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/62216/The-Sisters-of-Mercy-Floodland/ |website=[[Sputnikmusic]] |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-01}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev5Score = C+<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=November 29, 1988|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgvts88-88.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide: Turkey Shoot|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n''Floodland'' was first released on 13 November 1987<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.post-punk.com/the-sisters-of-mercy-floodland/ |title=The Sisters of Mercy {{!}} Floodland |date=13 November 2015 |website=Post-Punk.com |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref> through [[Merciful Release]] and [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] in Europe.<ref name=\"album notes\"/> It later received a release in the United States on 11 January 1988 through [[Elektra Records]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=12&ti=1,12&SC=Title&SA=Floodland.&PID=dVm-NMJPDlpfdQcTKzPjZp0LcxwO&SEQ=20101007191102&SID=3 |title=Floodland |website=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=15 December 2019}}</ref> Morrison's name was not included in the album's credits, although she was pictured on the sleeve and she appeared under her real name Anne Rainone in the \"Thanks\" section of the inner sleeve. Morrison downplayed this fact in interviews, saying \"if you look at Sisters' records, the names for what people play usually aren't there. Andrew writes the songs so there's no reason for anyone else to be featured. I was well aware of that when the album came out but what I didn't realise was that it would confuse other people.

A cover of the [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]] song \"[[Emma (song)|Emma]]\" was recorded for the single in January 1988<ref name=\"Uncut\">Bonner, ''Uncut'', 2006</ref> at the Church Studios in London, with final overdubs and mixing completed at Master Rock Studios in Kilburn. Morrison provided the bass guitar for the track. Eldritch recorded vocals for the song several times, but regardless of the result, he felt that it didn't sound as good as his vocals from live performances. As a result, he and producer Hugh Jones hired the Kilburn National Theatre and the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio|Rolling Stones Mobile]] recording truck and played the track to him through the stage monitors, recording multiple performances with him singing on the stage.<ref>[http://www.myheartland.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=20867] information provided by Hugh Jones (21 September 2010)</ref> The other B-side tracks of the single, made from various \"Dominion\" segments, were prepared shortly before the \"Dominion\" video shoot.<ref>Tilton, ''Record Mirror'', February 1988</ref> \"Sandstorm\" consists of various sampled saxophone and keyboard parts from \"Dominion\", mixed to a moody short instrumental track which was used in the opening section of the video. \"Untitled\" is a slowed-down instrumental excerpt from \"Dominion\". The CD single contained \"Ozymandias\", which is \"Dominion\" played backwards. The video for \"Dominion\" was filmed in February 1988 in the [[Jordan]]ian city of [[Petra]]. After the commercial success of \"This Corrosion\", WEA had again conceded a budget of \u00a350,000 and enlisted director David Hogan, who shot the video in two days after four-and-a-half months of preparation.<ref name=\"wuste\"/><ref>A.

It was released on 13 November 1987<!--date sourced in prose--> through [[Merciful Release]] and [[Warner Music Group|WEA]], with [[Elektra Records]] handling the US release. After the release of the band's debut album, ''[[First and Last and Always]]'' (1985), members [[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]] and [[Wayne Hussey]] departed the band, leading to the band's disbandment. As a result, band frontman [[Andrew Eldritch]] formed a side project, [[The Sisterhood (gothic rock band)|The Sisterhood]], and recorded new material with them. After his first album with the side project received poor sales and a negative reception, he went back to recording with the Sisters of Mercy, albeit still without Adams and Hussey. Sisterhood member [[Patricia Morrison]] became a part of the band as a result.\n\nEldritch wrote the songs of ''Floodland'' in [[Hamburg]]; the city's large amount of water influenced the album's title as well as its recurring lyrical theme of water. He then called upon Larry Alexander and [[Jim Steinman]] to produce the album with him. Recording sessions began in Manhattan, New York, during January 1987 and carried on throughout the first half of the year in various studios throughout England. Eldritch served as the vocalist and performed most of the instruments on all tracks, with Morrison performing bass on some tracks and the band's drum machine, \"Doktor Avalanche\", acting as the drum player. In contrast to ''First and Last and Always'', ''Floodland'' was done in a less conventional way, with the album being pieced together on computers using sequencers. The album musically incorporates gothic rock and [[dark wave]], while lyrically, Eldritch is cast as someone observing the world slowly deteriorating. Some of the events that inspired some of the album's songs include the [[Chernobyl disaster]], [[Cold War]], and the band's breakup.\n\nThe band chose not to embark on a tour to support the album, but despite this, ''Floodland'' and its singles had a positive commercial performance. The album debuted in the United Kingdom at number 9. Its pre-orders assured it silver certification status from the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] upon its release. In 1988, the album was certified gold by the BPI for selling 100,000 copies in the UK. The album also peaked within the top 40 in other European countries. The three singles released to support the album were \"[[This Corrosion]]\", \"[[Dominion (song)|Dominion]]\", and \"[[Lucretia My Reflection]]\". In the UK, \"This Corrosion\" peaked at number 7, \"Dominion\" peaked at number 13, and \"Lucretia My Reflection\" peaked at number 20. The song \"1959\" was also released as a radio single.\n\n==Background==\n===The original band's breakup===\n[[File:Andrew Eldritch.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Band frontman [[Andrew Eldritch]], pictured here in 2000]]\nAfter the release of the band's debut album ''[[First and Last and Always]]'' in March 1985, frontman Andrew Eldritch intended to record an [[ABBA]] cover as a single,<ref name=\"spex 1\">''Spex'', August 1985, p. 5</ref> and tried to hire Jim Steinman as a producer. Eldritch originally contacted him when the ABBA song [[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)|\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\"]] was in the band's setlist. Steinman was interested in producing the cover, but was too busy at that time. Shortly afterward, the Sisters of Mercy disbanded.<ref name=\"ruff\">Ruff, ''Spex'', January 1988</ref> The break-up occurred while the band prepared their second LP in October 1985, which was going to be titled ''Left on Mission and Revenge''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Andrew Eldritch interview |series=SkyTrax |network=Sky1 |date=1987}}</ref> Eldritch, who still intended to record the album as a solo artist, on the same day called bassist [[Patricia Morrison]], currently on a UK tour with her band Fur Bible supporting [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], and asked her to collaborate with him.<ref name=\"sutherland2\">Sutherland, ''Melody Maker'', June 1988, p. 14</ref>\n\nThe music press reported the break-up on 2 November 1985, announcing that \"the Sisters of Mercy were down to singer Andrew Eldritch and his faithful drum machine Doctor Avalanche this week after guitarist [[Wayne Hussey]] and bassist [[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]] left the band.

At the end of February 1986 the [[Merciful Release]] label announced the \"forthcoming Andrew Eldritch album which for some months has had the working title ''Left on Mission and Revenge''.\" This solo album which was finally titled ''Gift'' was released in July 1986, again under the Sisterhood moniker. It was recorded at [[Fairview Studios]] in [[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. Eldritch did not sing on the album for contractual reasons. Morrison collaborated with him for the first time, contributing a spoken passage on the track \"Jihad\". The album was a financial failure, received negative reviews from the music press, and, as a result, Eldritch lost his [[Publishing contract|publishing deal]] with RCA Music Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesistersofmercy.com/gen/regift.htm |title=Sisters \u2013 About Gift |website=[[The Sisters of Mercy]] (official website) |date= |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A Sisterhood 12\" EP titled ''This Corrosion'' was planned for release and would feature an American vocalist, whose identity was meant to be kept secret until release.<ref name=\"spencer-strickland\">Spencer; Strickland, ''Sounds'', February 1986</ref> It had been recorded at Fairview Studios with [[Alan Vega]] but remained unreleased.

He insinuated that she suffered from writer's block and was unable to come up with many musical ideas, also adding that he \"couldn't even get her to pick up the bass in the first place.\"<ref name=\"bravo\">Riemann, ''Bravo'', September 1992, p. 28</ref> Merciful Release office manager Boyd Steemson also confirmed that her contributions were minimal.<ref name=\"classic-rock-2-61\">McIntyre, ''Classic Rock'', July 2007, p. 61</ref> Eldritch denied that his approach to songwriting had changed since the band split, saying that \"'This Corrosion' sounds like 'Temple of Love' II, '1959' sounds like 'Afterhours' part 2.

Initially, Eldritch worked with an unknown producer, who he eventually fired.<ref name=\"niechziol\"/> He called Larry Alexander while in New York and hired him as a co-producer. They travelled to England, where they recorded at multiple studios. They spent time at [[Strawberry Studios]] in Manchester before transitioning to [[The Wool Hall]] in Bath. Recording was completed at [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]] in London.<ref name=\"TapeOp\"/> Roy Neave, an in-house engineer at Fairview Studios, engineered the sessions. Originally Eldritch intended to work with his colleague John Spence, who had worked with the Sisterhood in 1986, but he was committed to another project at the time and recommended Neave as his replacement.<ref>[http://www.myheartland.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=20821] information provided by John Spence (13 September 2010)</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Composition==\n===Music===\n[[Sputnikmusic]] staff reviewer \"ManosG\" described the music of ''Floodland'' as a mix of [[gothic rock]] and [[dark wave]].<ref name=\"sputnik\"/> In contrast to the previous album, ''[[First and Last and Always]]'', which had been recorded in a conventional way, ''Floodland'' was pieced together on a computer with the help of [[Music sequencer|sequencers]]. Eldritch worked on the recorded parts with a [[Turtle Beach Systems|Voyetra Sequencer Plus]], with a [[Yamaha Pro Audio|Yamaha SPX-90]] being used as an [[effects unit]] and the parts being saved on a [[Compaq Portable series|Compaq Portable 286]]. The guitars were played by Eldritch himself, apart from the solo on \"This Corrosion\" which was played by Steinman's friend Eddie Martinez.<ref name=\"ruff\"/> In the previous year, he had played the guitar solo on [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s US number one hit \"[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]\". Most of the bass on the album was not played on a bass guitar, but instead by Eldritch himself using synth bass. Though Patricia Morrison was brought in as a member to play the bass, she was only featured in some places; Eldritch later suggested that she did not appear at all on the album. In an interview, he commented on the issue of Morrison playing on ''Floodland'', saying \"that's an assumption which a lot of people make, [...] but obviously I question that assumption.\"<ref name=\"MTV\">Andrew Eldritch TV interview (''[[120 Minutes (UK TV series)|120 Minutes]]'' programme, MTV 28 January 1991)</ref> Morrison later stated that she did indeed play on the album, but Eldritch recorded over her parts at times.<ref>[http://www.myheartland.co.uk/viewtopic.php?p=476550&sid=ef0eaa129263d0a863692ca0d4064d41] Information provided by Patricia Morrison (13 June 2009)</ref> The drum sounds on the album were sampled together from various drum machines with an [[Music Production Center|Akai S900]].

He attributed the recurrence of this theme to the amount of water within Hamburg, where he was writing these songs.<ref name=\"scanlon9\"/> Michael Bonner of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' viewed Eldritch as casting himself in a role where he is a \"jaded observer, watching cynically as he and the world slouch towards Armageddon,\" adding that the songs are bonded together by \"images of the apocalypse that straddle the gap between the personal and the political.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/>\n\nThe two-part opening track, \"Dominion / Mother Russia\", was inspired by \"[[Ozymandias]]\", a [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] sonnet about a tyrant whose legacy of conquest diminishes as time passes by, from which one line is lifted. Bonner noted that the song seemed to have been inspired by [[Cold War]] geopolitics as well. Eldritch commented on the song and how it was created, saying \"I made the mistake of getting caught in central Europe when [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] started sprinkling its residue over the land. It's part of my hate/hate relationship with America. I just had the idea of all them huddled in their mobile homes while Mother Russia rained down on them. [...] I suppose the song is really about the prostitution of Europe by the Americans.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/> \"Flood I\" and \"Flood II\" use the word \"flood\" as a metaphor for sex. Eldritch commented on the song, saying \"most people, if you think about it, only get wet under certain circumstances. [...] Water is something so mammoth, so a flood is emotionally very stimulating.\"<ref name=\"mico\"/> He called \"[[Lucretia My Reflection]]\" his \"Welcome on board, Patricia\" song, saying that he had always thought of her as a \"[[Lucrezia Borgia|Lucretia]]-type person.\"<ref name=\"mico\"/> The partially-autobiographical song \"1959\" takes it title from Eldritch's birth year. He thought of the song as regarding \"innocence\u2013inherited as opposed to environmental.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/>\n\n[[File:The mission wayne hussey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Wayne Hussey]]'s departure from the band and his \"clich\u00e9d lyrics\" served as the inspiration for the lyrics of \"This Corrosion\"]]\nThe centre piece of the album, \"This Corrosion\", goes back to the conflict between Eldritch and his former bandmates who were now in the Mission. The lyrics are a parody of \"clich\u00e9d, meaningless rock lyrics\" as Wayne Hussey especially wrote them. Eldritch noted that \"it is, of course, directed at somebody and it doesn't take a genius to work out who, although it'll probably take the person concerned some considerable time. [...] Nearly all of [the lyrics] should be thought of in quotation marks. It would be too confusing to print them all.\"<ref name=\"mico\">Mico, ''Melody Maker'', November 1987</ref> He also notes that the title is capitalized on the lyrics sheet because \"it's the title of somebody else's song. [...] Wayne used to withdraw himself with a book of song titles, select those which sounded best and piece together a song lyric from it. It didn't have to have any meaning, it just had to sound good.\"<ref name=\"ruff\"/>\n\n\"Driven Like the Snow\", like \"Nine While Nine\" on the band's [[First and Last and Always|previous album]], is about Eldritch's former girlfriend Claire Shearsby, even being noted as \"Nine While Nine Part 2\" by him. He thought of the song as a way to logically explain why the relationship had to fall apart.<ref name=\"mico\"/> On \"Never Land\", Eldritch commented that it imagines \"the entire population of the earth starting to travel from some indefinable point in space toward the earth at increasing speed. It would take an eternity to reach the earth\u2014by which time you'd be reasonably spiritualised\u2014and even when you reached the destination, you wouldn't actually hit the ground. You'd be going so fast you'd just go through and out the other side, where there is another eternity of nothingness. I just tried to write a song about these impressions.\"<ref name=\"mico\"/> The lyrics Eldritch referred to would be found on the full 12-minute version of the song, which was included in the ''Merciful Release'' box set.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/never-land-full-length-bonus-track-lyrics-sisters-of-mercy.html |title=Sisters of Mercy - Never Land (Full Length) (Bonus Track) Lyrics |website=[[Metrolyrics]] |access-date=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Promotion and release==\n\"This Corrosion\" was selected as the first single from the album, although Eldritch initially had pleaded for \"Dominion\".<ref name=\"scanlon9\"/> It was released on 18 September 1987. Each format (7\", 12\", CD and cassette) contained a different mix of the song. Eldritch originally wanted the long version on the single, but the record company desired for an edited version instead. The mix of the LP version is identical to that of the 12\" version, but lasts about 45 seconds longer. The cassette version was mixed by Steinman and differs from other single versions.<ref name=\"ruff\"/> The B-side of the single was \"Torch\", which Eldritch produced and played every instrument on. It had been written in 1985 for the aborted ''Left on Mission and Revenge'' album. The 12\" single added Eldritch's version of the [[The Sisterhood (gothic rock band)|Sisterhood]] song \"Colours\". WEA conceded a budget of over \u00a350,000 for the video.<ref name=\"wuste\">''ME/Sounds'', May 1988</ref> It was shot in a warehouse in [[Wapping]] and set in the ruins of a post-nuclear attack London and was directed by Stuart Orme.

Morrison provided the bass guitar for the track. Eldritch recorded vocals for the song several times, but regardless of the result, he felt that it didn't sound as good as his vocals from live performances. As a result, he and producer Hugh Jones hired the Kilburn National Theatre and the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio|Rolling Stones Mobile]] recording truck and played the track to him through the stage monitors, recording multiple performances with him singing on the stage.<ref>[http://www.myheartland.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=20867] information provided by Hugh Jones (21 September 2010)</ref> The other B-side tracks of the single, made from various \"Dominion\" segments, were prepared shortly before the \"Dominion\" video shoot.<ref>Tilton, ''Record Mirror'', February 1988</ref> \"Sandstorm\" consists of various sampled saxophone and keyboard parts from \"Dominion\", mixed to a moody short instrumental track which was used in the opening section of the video. \"Untitled\" is a slowed-down instrumental excerpt from \"Dominion\".
