Ho started posting fitness videos on YouTube in 2009 after she decided to move from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] for a full-time job as a fashion buyer.<ref

Boston.<ref name=Forbes2/><ref name=AFN/><ref name=Cramer/> The first video she uploaded to YouTube was called \"POP Pilates: Total Body Sculpt video\" and she had considerable trouble with its quality, audio, and editing.<ref name=Forbes2/> After she uploaded the video, she received a number of comments requesting more videos on specific workouts for different muscle groups such legs, thighs, and abs, but she didn't pay attention to these requests for months.<ref name=Forbes2/><ref name=Thatcher/>\n\nNine months after she moved to Boston to work as a fashion buyer, she decided to quit because she disliked it.<ref name=Forbes2/> She started teaching Pilates classes 12 times a week to pay for her food and rent.<ref name=Forbes2/> She found teaching Pilates this often physically

keeps her videos \"fun and playful.\"<ref name=Cramer/>\n\nShe was interviewed by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2012 as a woman who is rapidly becoming a star on YouTube along with several other women such as [[Issa Rae]] and [[Cassandra Bankson]].<ref name=Forbes2/> She has been described as an Internet personality<ref name=Steinfellner/> and as a poster child for Asian American entrepreneurial success on the Internet.<ref name=AFN/> At the 2014 [[Sundance Film Festival]], she led yogilates workout sessions at the YouTube lounge.<ref name=Thatcher/>\n\nIn 2012, she won ''Fitness Magazine's''

In this series, she introduced the concept of a \"YOLO Meal\" (YOLO is an acronym for \"You Only Live Once\").<ref name=Steinfellner/><ref name=Hauser/> A YOLO meal consists of what is considered traditionally unhealthy food such as pizza, french fries, and ice cream.<ref name=Steinfellner/> In her view, a healthy diet should include YOLO meals because a healthy diet is a lifestyle that a person can stick with.<ref name=Steinfellner/> YOLO meals are meals a person typically has with friends and they are planned, in her approach, to occur once a week and are surrounded the rest of the week by healthy meals.<ref name=Steinfellner/> Kit Steinkellner reported in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' that when she followed this approach she found that it increased her desire for both YOLO meals and healthy food.<ref name=Steinfellner/> Georgie Silvarole, writing for ''Fiterazzi Magazine'', extends Ho's concept of a YOLO meal to a YOLO day and explains that sometimes one needs a whole day off of a healthy diet.<ref name=Silvarole/>\n\n===Body image===\nWhen she first began to upload videos to YouTube and answering questions about fitness on her blog, she thought of herself only as only an instructor.<ref name=Forbes1/> It was at this time that she created a [[Printer-friendly|printable]] poster \"How to Get a [[Thigh gap|Thigh Gap]]\".<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Ho2/>\nAt that time, she had not thought much about the social-health implications of trying to achieve a thigh gap and she didn't think about her poster again until it appeared two years later in news segments about the latest unhealthy obsession of trying to achieve a thigh gap.<ref name=Forbes1/> After that incident, she realized that she is not just a fitness instructor but a role model in the fitness industry.<ref name=Forbes1/> She now views her role as extending beyond a fitness instructor to include helping people get healthier and feeling better about their bodies.<ref name=Forbes1/>\n\nIn 2014, after she had realized that she had become a role model in the fitness industry, she was looking for a [[bikini]] on Target's website when she noticed an image of a model with a [[photoshopped]] thigh gap.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Ho1/> She took some screen shots of the photoshopped model and blogged about them.<ref name=Forbes1/> The next morning she discovered that the Target model controversy was under discussion at a number of news media outlets such as [[ABC News]], [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]], and [[Good Morning America]].<ref name=Forbes1/> After her post drew widespread media attention,<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Bennett/> Target apologized for manipulating the photo.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=thighgap/> Ho has also warned that the \"bikini bridge\" may be the new \"thigh gap\" and that neither define beauty.<ref name=\"Miller.DN\"/>\n\nOn her view, working out can become a problem when the only goal is \"physical vanity\" and thereby attempting to develop a sense of self-worth by working out. Instead, she advocates finding joy in the act of working out and letting it become part of one's lifestyle.<ref name=Forbes1/>\n\nShe believes that social media, and in particular social fitness media, has an important role to play in helping people achieve their fitness and healthy lifestyle potential.<ref name=Forbes1/> This is especially true for people who lack the family and friends to provide that support.<ref name=Forbes1/>\n\nShe believes that YouTube has an important role to play in issues concerning body image.<ref name=Forbes1/> On her view, body image is shaped by the \"perfect\" images of women in magazines and movies and that when women and girls pursue these \"perfect\" body images, the result can sometimes be [[Eating disorder|eating]] and body image disorders.<ref name=Forbes1/> She believes that YouTube provides content creators with a platform to present girls and women as they really are, which she believes will encourage them to be more confident in who they are.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Hauser/>\n\nIn January 2016, Ho came out to say that she struggled with an eating disorder following the extreme training and calorie restriction she did in preparation for a bikini competition in 2012.<ref name=\"Blogilates-Bikini-2012\">{{cite web|last1=Ho|first1=Cassey|title=1 Month After the Bikini Competition \u2013 How Am I Doing?|url=http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2012/06/03/1-month-after-the-bikini-competition-how-am-i-doing/|website=Blogilates|publisher=Blogilates|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref> She said she was working out up to four hours a day while maintaining a 1,000 calorie diet in the lead up to the [[fitness and figure competition]], and that her mind felt cloudy during this period.

She is then presented with tools that allow her to \"[[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|photoshop]]\" her body into a socially perceived ideal body image.  However, when she looks into a mirror, she is dismayed by what she sees.<ref name=\"Lee.UW\"/><ref name=\"ABC.NEWS\"/><ref name=\"Olya.P\"/>  Ho's stated intent in creating this video was to respond to cyber-bullying with the goal \"...to show that cyber-bullying and mean comments really affect people, and to think before you say something. I hope that people do the exact opposite after seeing this video, which is enlighten everyone around them with positivity.\"<ref name=\"Olya.P\"/>\n\n==Personal==\nHo is [[Chinese American|Chinese]]-[[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]] and was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] but grew up in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/><ref name=Sirens/> Her parents are Bach Ho and Cuu Ho and she has a sister named Jackelyn, who is a yoga instructor.<ref name=Sirens/> When she was a teenager, she started a bakery with her mother called \"Cooplex Cookies & Candies,\" which lasted from 2001 to 2005.<ref name=Sirens/> She went to [[James Logan High School]].<ref name=Sirens/> In 2003, she was the winner of the Miss Teen [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] [[Beauty pageant|pageant]].<ref name=MissTeen/>  She went to [[Whittier College]]<ref name=whittier/> on a John Greenleaf Whittier full tuition scholarship with the career aim of becoming a doctor.<ref name=Bennett/> She graduated in 2009<ref name=Forbes2/> with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Biology.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/><ref name=Raine/><ref name=IDEA/>\n\nOn August 22, 2017, Ho announced her engagement to longtime boyfriend Sam Livits on her official Instagram page.

She asked her parents to buy the DVD and she became hooked on Pilates.<ref name=People/> Ho has also said that it was her \"childhood dream to become a fashion designer.\"<ref name=Witter/>\n\nShe told ''[[Asian Fortune]]'' that coming from an Asian culture, her parents expected her to choose a career as a doctor or lawyer.<ref name=AFN/> When she was 16, she told her father that she wanted to be a fashion designer and her father told her that she would fail, make no money, and have no friends.<ref name=Davis/> However, in August 2014, when she released her BodyPop line of clothes, Ho said that both of her parents are now supportive of her efforts.<ref name=Davis/> It was hard for her parents to accept her career path into social fitness on the Internet, but she said they came to accept it.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/> She found that when she started her ''Blogilates'' website she found that when it started to gain popularity, she couldn't keep up with creating content for it and she asked her parents to help with the logistics and management of her business.<ref name=Cramer/> Her mother now helps her with overseas shipments of her products and her father helps her with operations management as well as the logistics of running her businesses.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/>\n\nHer favorite fitness mantras are \"train insane or remain the same\" and \"train like a beast to look like a beauty.\"<ref name=Hauser/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=Steinfellner>\n{{cite news|last=Steinfellner|first=Kit|title=The Power of the YOLO Meal|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/food-riot/the-power-of-the-yolo-mea_b_4746674.html|accessdate=May 7, 2014|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 7, 2014}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name = staff.LE>\n{{cite news|last1=Benhamou|first1=Rebecca|title=Videos.

Ho started posting fitness videos on YouTube in 2009 after she decided to move from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] for a full-time job as a fashion buyer.<ref name=Forbes2/><ref name=AFN/>  She had been a part-time [[Pilates]] instructor<ref name=AFN/> and wanted to provide the students she was leaving with online fitness workouts after she moved to Boston.<ref name=Forbes2/><ref name=AFN/><ref name=Cramer/> The first video she uploaded to YouTube was called \"POP Pilates: Total Body Sculpt video\" and she had considerable trouble with its quality, audio, and editing.<ref name=Forbes2/> After she uploaded the video, she received a number of comments requesting more videos on specific workouts for different muscle groups such legs,

quit because she disliked it.<ref name=Forbes2/> She started teaching Pilates classes 12 times a week to pay for her food and rent.<ref name=Forbes2/> She found teaching Pilates this often physically

keeps her videos \"fun and playful.\"<ref name=Cramer/>\n\nShe was interviewed by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2012 as a woman who is rapidly becoming a star on YouTube along with several other women such as [[Issa Rae]] and [[Cassandra Bankson]].<ref name=Forbes2/> She has been described as an Internet personality<ref name=Steinfellner/> and as a poster child for Asian American entrepreneurial success on

In this series, she introduced the concept of a \"YOLO Meal\" (YOLO is an acronym for \"You Only Live Once\").<ref name=Steinfellner/><ref name=Hauser/> A YOLO meal consists of what is considered traditionally unhealthy food such as pizza, french fries, and ice cream.<ref name=Steinfellner/> In her view, a healthy diet should include YOLO meals because a healthy diet is a lifestyle that a person can stick with.<ref name=Steinfellner/> YOLO meals are meals a person typically has with friends and they are planned, in her approach, to occur once a week and are surrounded the rest of the week by healthy meals.<ref name=Steinfellner/> Kit Steinkellner reported in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' that when she followed this approach she found that it increased her desire for both YOLO meals and healthy food.<ref name=Steinfellner/> Georgie Silvarole, writing for ''Fiterazzi Magazine'', extends Ho's concept of a YOLO meal to a YOLO day and explains that sometimes one needs a whole day off of a healthy diet.<ref name=Silvarole/>\n\n===Body image===\nWhen she first began to upload videos to YouTube and answering questions about fitness on her blog, she thought of herself only as only an instructor.<ref name=Forbes1/> It was at this time that she created a [[Printer-friendly|printable]] poster \"How to Get a [[Thigh gap|Thigh Gap]]\".<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Ho2/>\nAt that time, she had not thought much about the social-health implications of trying to achieve a thigh gap and she didn't think about her poster again until it appeared two years later in news segments about the latest unhealthy obsession of trying to achieve a thigh gap.<ref name=Forbes1/> After that incident, she realized that she is not just a fitness instructor but a role model in the fitness industry.<ref name=Forbes1/> She now views her role as extending beyond a fitness instructor to include helping people get healthier and feeling better about their bodies.<ref name=Forbes1/>\n\nIn 2014, after she had realized that she had become a role model in the fitness industry, she was looking for a [[bikini]] on Target's website when she noticed an image of a model with a [[photoshopped]] thigh gap.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Ho1/> She took some screen shots of the photoshopped model and blogged about them.<ref name=Forbes1/> The next morning she discovered that the Target model controversy was under discussion at a number of news media outlets such as [[ABC News]], [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]], and [[Good Morning America]].<ref name=Forbes1/> After her post drew widespread media attention,<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Bennett/> Target apologized for manipulating the photo.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=thighgap/> Ho has also warned that the \"bikini bridge\" may be the new \"thigh gap\" and that neither define beauty.<ref name=\"Miller.DN\"/>\n\nOn her view, working out can become a problem when the only goal is \"physical vanity\" and thereby attempting to develop a sense of self-worth by working out. Instead, she advocates finding joy in the act of working out and letting it become part of one's lifestyle.<ref name=Forbes1/>\n\nShe believes that social media, and in particular social fitness media, has an important role to play in helping people achieve their fitness and healthy lifestyle potential.<ref name=Forbes1/> This is especially true for people who lack the family and friends to provide that support.<ref name=Forbes1/>\n\nShe believes that YouTube has an important role to play in issues concerning body image.<ref name=Forbes1/> On her view, body image is shaped by the \"perfect\" images of women in magazines and movies and that when women and girls pursue these \"perfect\" body images, the result can sometimes be [[Eating disorder|eating]] and body image disorders.<ref name=Forbes1/> She believes that YouTube provides content creators with a platform to present girls and women as they really are, which she believes will encourage them to be more confident in who they are.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Hauser/>\n\nIn January 2016, Ho came out to say that she struggled with an eating disorder following the extreme training and calorie restriction she did in preparation for a bikini competition in 2012.<ref name=\"Blogilates-Bikini-2012\">{{cite web|last1=Ho|first1=Cassey|title=1 Month After the Bikini Competition \u2013 How Am I Doing?|url=http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2012/06/03/1-month-after-the-bikini-competition-how-am-i-doing/|website=Blogilates|publisher=Blogilates|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref> She said she was working out up to four hours a day while maintaining a 1,000 calorie diet in the lead up to the [[fitness and figure competition]], and that her mind felt cloudy during this period.

She is then presented with tools that allow her to \"[[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|photoshop]]\" her body into a socially perceived ideal body image.  However, when she looks into a mirror, she is dismayed by what she sees.<ref name=\"Lee.UW\"/><ref name=\"ABC.NEWS\"/><ref name=\"Olya.P\"/>  Ho's stated intent in creating this video was to respond to cyber-bullying with the goal \"...to show that cyber-bullying and mean comments really affect people, and to think before you say something. I hope that people do the exact opposite after seeing this video, which is enlighten everyone around them with positivity.\"<ref name=\"Olya.P\"/>\n\n==Personal==\nHo is [[Chinese American|Chinese]]-[[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]] and was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] but grew up in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/><ref name=Sirens/> Her parents are Bach Ho and Cuu Ho and she has a sister named Jackelyn, who is a yoga instructor.<ref name=Sirens/> When she was a teenager, she started a bakery with her mother called \"Cooplex Cookies & Candies,\" which lasted from 2001 to 2005.<ref name=Sirens/> She went to [[James Logan High School]].<ref name=Sirens/> In 2003, she was the winner of the Miss Teen [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] [[Beauty pageant|pageant]].<ref name=MissTeen/>  She went to [[Whittier College]]<ref name=whittier/> on a John Greenleaf Whittier full tuition scholarship with the career aim of becoming a doctor.<ref name=Bennett/> She graduated in 2009<ref name=Forbes2/> with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Biology.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/><ref name=Raine/><ref name=IDEA/>\n\nOn August 22, 2017, Ho announced her engagement to longtime boyfriend Sam Livits on her official Instagram page.

She asked her parents to buy the DVD and she became hooked on Pilates.<ref name=People/> Ho has also said that it was her \"childhood dream to become a fashion designer.\"<ref name=Witter/>\n\nShe told ''[[Asian Fortune]]'' that coming from an Asian culture, her parents expected her to choose a career as a doctor or lawyer.<ref name=AFN/> When she was 16, she told her father that she wanted to be a fashion designer and her father told her that she would fail, make no money, and have no friends.<ref name=Davis/> However, in August 2014, when she released her BodyPop line of clothes, Ho said that both of her parents are now supportive of her efforts.<ref name=Davis/> It was hard for her parents to accept her career path into social fitness on the Internet, but she said they came to accept it.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/> She found that when she started her ''Blogilates'' website she found that when it started to gain popularity, she couldn't keep up with creating content for it and she asked her parents to help with the logistics and management of her business.<ref name=Cramer/> Her mother now helps her with overseas shipments of her products and her father helps her with operations management as well as the logistics of running her businesses.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/>\n\nHer favorite fitness mantras are \"train insane or remain the same\" and \"train like a beast to look like a beauty.\"<ref name=Hauser/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=Steinfellner>\n{{cite news|last=Steinfellner|first=Kit|title=The Power of the YOLO Meal|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/food-riot/the-power-of-the-yolo-mea_b_4746674.html|accessdate=May 7, 2014|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 7, 2014}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name = staff.LE>\n{{cite news|last1=Benhamou|first1=Rebecca|title=Videos.

In classical times, their origins were a mystery that challenged many; [[Plutarch]] and others thought them to be the result of lightning, warmth and water in the soil, while [[Juvenal]] thought thunder and rain to be instrumental in their origin. [[Cicero]] deemed them children of the earth, while [[Dioscorides]] thought they were tuberous roots.<ref name=\"Ramsbottom53\">{{cite book|title=Mushrooms & Toadstools|author=Ramsbottom J|publisher=Collins|year=1953|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Thracia]] in the [[Ancient Rome|Classical]] period identified three kinds of truffles: the {{lang|la|Tuber melanosporum}}, the {{lang|la|Tuber magnificanus}} and the {{lang|la|Tuber magnatum}}. The Romans, however, did not use these and instead used a variety of fungus called [[Terfeziaceae|Terfez]], also sometimes called a \"desert truffle.\" Terfez used in Rome came from [[Lesbos]], [[Carthage]], and especially [[Libya]], where the coastal climate was less dry in ancient times.<ref name=\"Ramsbottom53\"/> Their substance is pale, tinged with rose. Unlike truffles, terfez have little inherent flavour. The Romans used the terfez as a carrier of flavour, because the terfez tend to absorb surrounding flavours. Indeed, since [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] utilized many spices and flavourings, the terfez were appropriate in that context.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nTruffles were rarely used during the [[Middle Ages]]. Truffle hunting is mentioned by [[Bartolomeo Platina]], the papal historian, in 1481, when he recorded that the sows of [[Notza]] were without equal in hunting truffles, but they should be muzzled to prevent them from eating the prize.<ref name=\"benjamin95\">{{Citation |last=Benjamin |first=D.

They were imported seasonally from truffle grounds, where peasants had long enjoyed their secret.

In 1847, [[Auguste Rousseau]] of [[Carpentras]] (in [[Vaucluse]]) planted {{convert|7|ha|acre}} of oak trees (again from acorns found on the soil around truffle-producing oak trees), and he subsequently obtained large harvests of truffles. He received a prize at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 World's Fair]] in [[Paris]].<ref>Rousseau, \"Truffes obtenues par la culture de ch\u00eanes verts\" (Truffles obtained by the cultivation of green oaks) in:  ''Exposition universelle de 1855 : Rapports du jury mixte international'', volume 1 (Paris, France:  Imprimerie Imp\u00e9riale, 1856), [https://books.google.com/books?id=m1ZAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 173-174.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Truffle Market in Carpentras.jpg|thumb|left|Truffle market in [[Carpentras]]]]\nThese successful attempts were met with enthusiasm in southern France, which possessed the sweet limestone soils and dry, hot weather that truffles need to grow. In the late 19th century, an epidemic of [[phylloxera]] destroyed many of the vineyards in southern France. Another epidemic killed most of the [[silkworm]]s there, too, making the fields of [[mulberry]] trees useless. Thus, large tracts of land were set free for the cultivation of truffles. Thousands of truffle-producing trees were planted, and production reached peaks of hundreds of [[tonne]]s at the end of the 19th century. In 1890, there were {{convert|75000|ha|acre}} of truffle-producing trees.\n\nIn the 20th century, however, with the growing industrialization of France and the subsequent [[rural exodus]], many of these truffle fields ({{lang|fr|champs truffiers}} or {{lang|fr|truffi\u00e8res}}) returned to wilderness. The [[World War I|First World War]] also dealt a serious blow to the French countryside, killing 20% or more of the male working force. As a consequence, newly acquired techniques of {{lang|fr|trufficulture}} were lost. Also, between the two world wars, the truffle groves planted in the 19th century stopped being productive. (The average life cycle of a truffle-producing tree is 30 years.) Consequently, after 1945, the production of truffles plummeted, and the prices have risen dramatically. In 1900, truffles were used by most people, and on many occasions.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Today, they are a rare delicacy reserved for the rich, or used on very special occasions.\n\nIn the 1970s,{{when|date=December 2017}} new attempts for mass production of truffles were started to make up for the decline in wild truffles. Eighty percent of the truffles now produced in France come from specially planted truffle groves. Nonetheless, production has yet to recover its 1900s peaks. Local farmers are sometimes opposed to a return of mass production, which would possibly decrease the price of truffles (though it is commonly stated that demand is 10 times higher than supply). In exchange there are heavy investments in cultivated plantations underway in many parts of the world. Thanks to controlled irrigation, regular and resilient production is indeed possible.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bungten|first1=Ulf|last2=Egli|first2=Simon|last3=Schneider|first3=Loic|last4=Von Arx|first4=Georg|last5=Rigling|first5=Andreas|last6=Camarero|first6=Julio|last7=Sang\u00fcesa|first7=Gabriel|last8=Fischer|first8=Christine|last9=Oliach|first9=Daniel|last10=Bonet|first10=Jose-Antonio |last11=Colinas|first11=Carlos|last12=Tegel|first12=Willy|last13=Ruiz|first13=Jose|last14=Martinez|first14=Fernando|title=Long-term irrigation effects on Spanish holm oak growth and its black truffle symbiont|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment|date=2015|volume=202|pages=148\u2013159 |doi=10.1016/j.agee.2014.12.016 |hdl=10261/113281|url=https://repositori.udl.cat/bitstream/10459.1/65049/3/022489%20.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olivera|first1=Antoni|last2=Fischer|first2=Christine|last3=Bonet|first3=Jose-Antonio|last4=Martinez de Aragon|first4=Juan|last5=Oliach|first5=Daniel|last6=Colinas|first6=Carlos|title=Weed management and irrigation are key treatments in emerging black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) cultivation|journal=New Forests|date=2011|volume=42|issue=2|pages=227\u2013239|doi=10.1007/s11056-011-9249-9}}</ref> There are now truffle-growing areas in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]] and [[South Africa]].\n\nA critical phase of the cultivation is the quality control of the mycorrhizal plants.

The [[chemical ecology]] of truffle volatiles is complex, interacting with plants, insects and mammals, which contribute to [[spore]] dispersal. Depending on the truffle species, life cycle or location, they include:\n \n* [[Sulfur]] [[volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]], which occur in all truffle species, such as dimethyl mono- (DMS), di- (DMDS) and tri- (DMTS) sulfides, as well as 2-methyl-4,5-dihydrothiophene, characteristic of the white truffle ''T. borchii'' and [[2,4-Dithiapentane]] occurring in all species but mostly characteristic of the white truffle ''T. magnatum''. Some of the very aromatic white truffles are notably pungent, even irritating the eye when cut or sliced. \n* Metabolites of non-sulfur [[amino acid]] constituents (simple and branched chain [[hydrocarbons]]) such as [[ethylene]] (produced by mycelia of white truffles affecting root architecture of host tree), as well as 2-methylbutanal,  2-methylpropanal and [[2-phenylethanol]] (also common in baker's yeast).\n* [[Fatty acid]]-derived volatiles (C8-alcohols and [[aldehyde]]s with a characteristic fungal odor, such as [[1-octen-3-ol]]  and 2-octenal). The former is derived from [[linoleic acid]], and produced by mature white truffle ''T. borchii''.\n* [[Thiophene]] derivatives appear to be produced by bacterial symbionts living in the truffle body.

In classical times, their origins were a mystery that challenged many; [[Plutarch]] and others thought them to be the result of lightning, warmth and water in the soil, while [[Juvenal]] thought thunder and rain to be instrumental in their origin. [[Cicero]] deemed them children of the earth, while [[Dioscorides]] thought they were tuberous roots.<ref name=\"Ramsbottom53\">{{cite book|title=Mushrooms & Toadstools|author=Ramsbottom J|publisher=Collins|year=1953|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Thracia]] in the [[Ancient Rome|Classical]] period identified three kinds of truffles: the {{lang|la|Tuber melanosporum}}, the {{lang|la|Tuber magnificanus}} and the {{lang|la|Tuber magnatum}}. The Romans, however, did not use these and instead used a variety of fungus called [[Terfeziaceae|Terfez]], also sometimes called a \"desert truffle.\" Terfez used in Rome came from [[Lesbos]], [[Carthage]], and especially [[Libya]], where the coastal climate was less dry in ancient times.<ref name=\"Ramsbottom53\"/> Their substance is pale, tinged with rose. Unlike truffles, terfez have little inherent flavour. The Romans used the terfez as a carrier of flavour, because the terfez tend to absorb surrounding flavours. Indeed, since [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] utilized many spices and flavourings, the terfez were appropriate in that context.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nTruffles were rarely used during the [[Middle Ages]].

In the late 19th century, an epidemic of [[phylloxera]] destroyed many of the vineyards in southern France. Another epidemic killed most of the [[silkworm]]s there, too, making the fields of [[mulberry]] trees useless. Thus, large tracts of land were set free for the cultivation of truffles. Thousands of truffle-producing trees were planted, and production reached peaks of hundreds of [[tonne]]s at the end of the 19th century. In 1890, there were {{convert|75000|ha|acre}} of truffle-producing trees.\n\nIn the 20th century, however, with the growing industrialization of France and the subsequent [[rural exodus]], many of these truffle fields ({{lang|fr|champs truffiers}} or {{lang|fr|truffi\u00e8res}}) returned to wilderness. The [[World War I|First World War]] also dealt a serious blow to the French countryside, killing 20% or more of the male working force. As a consequence, newly acquired techniques of {{lang|fr|trufficulture}} were lost. Also, between the two world wars, the truffle groves planted in the 19th century stopped being productive. (The average life cycle of a truffle-producing tree is 30 years.) Consequently, after 1945, the production of truffles plummeted, and the prices have risen dramatically. In 1900, truffles were used by most people, and on many occasions.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Today, they are a rare delicacy reserved for the rich, or used on very special occasions.\n\nIn the 1970s,{{when|date=December 2017}} new attempts for mass production of truffles were started to make up for the decline in wild truffles. Eighty percent of the truffles now produced in France come from specially planted truffle groves. Nonetheless, production has yet to recover its 1900s peaks. Local farmers are sometimes opposed to a return of mass production, which would possibly decrease the price of truffles (though it is commonly stated that demand is 10 times higher than supply). In exchange there are heavy investments in cultivated plantations underway in many parts of the world. Thanks to controlled irrigation, regular and resilient production is indeed possible.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bungten|first1=Ulf|last2=Egli|first2=Simon|last3=Schneider|first3=Loic|last4=Von Arx|first4=Georg|last5=Rigling|first5=Andreas|last6=Camarero|first6=Julio|last7=Sang\u00fcesa|first7=Gabriel|last8=Fischer|first8=Christine|last9=Oliach|first9=Daniel|last10=Bonet|first10=Jose-Antonio |last11=Colinas|first11=Carlos|last12=Tegel|first12=Willy|last13=Ruiz|first13=Jose|last14=Martinez|first14=Fernando|title=Long-term irrigation effects on Spanish holm oak growth and its black truffle symbiont|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment|date=2015|volume=202|pages=148\u2013159 |doi=10.1016/j.agee.2014.12.016 |hdl=10261/113281|url=https://repositori.udl.cat/bitstream/10459.1/65049/3/022489%20.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olivera|first1=Antoni|last2=Fischer|first2=Christine|last3=Bonet|first3=Jose-Antonio|last4=Martinez de Aragon|first4=Juan|last5=Oliach|first5=Daniel|last6=Colinas|first6=Carlos|title=Weed management and irrigation are key treatments in emerging black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) cultivation|journal=New Forests|date=2011|volume=42|issue=2|pages=227\u2013239|doi=10.1007/s11056-011-9249-9}}</ref> There are now truffle-growing areas in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]] and [[South Africa]].\n\nA critical phase of the cultivation is the quality control of the mycorrhizal plants.

Some restaurants stamp out circular discs of truffle flesh and use the skins for sauces.\n\n=== Truffle oil ===\n{{Main|Truffle oil}}\n[[Truffle oil]] is used as a lower-cost and convenient substitute for truffles, to provide flavouring, or to enhance the flavour and aroma of truffles in cooking. Many \"truffle oils\", however, do not contain any truffles, while others will include pieces of one of the many inexpensive, unprized [[List of Tuber (fungus) species|truffle varietals]], which have no culinary value simply for show.<ref name=Patterson2007>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/dining/16truf.html |title=Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles |accessdate=2008-05-17 |author=Daniel Patterson |date= 16 May 2007 |newspaper=New York Times |quote=Most commercial truffle oils are concocted by mixing olive oil with one or more compounds like 2,4-dithiapentane }}</ref> The vast majority is oil which has been artificially flavoured using a synthetic agent such as [[2,4-dithiapentane]].<ref name=Patterson2007/>\n\n=== Truffle vodka ===\n{{Main|Truffle vodka}}\nBecause a greater variety of aromatic molecules in truffles are soluble in alcohol, it can be used to carry a more complex and accurate truffle flavour than oil without the need for synthetic flavourings.

The statue was intended to be respectful of her trials and to emphasize the mestizo (or mixed-blood) character of the nation.

She is understood in various and often conflicting aspects as the embodiment of treachery, the quintessential victim, or simply as symbolic mother of the new Mexican people.\n\nThe term ''[[malinchista]]'' refers to a disloyal compatriot, especially in Mexico.\n\nBecause of her controversial signification, a statue of La Malinche, Cort\u00e9s, and their son Mart\u00edn was removed soon after it was erected in Coyoacan, in the outskirts of Mexico City, in 1982. The statue was intended to be respectful of her trials and to emphasize the mestizo (or mixed-blood) character of the nation. However, student protests erupted: the protesters wanted no monument that presented La Malinche in a positive light, for in their minds she was too closely associated with domination by outsiders and with betrayal.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]] (2006).

Some see her as a founding figure of the Mexican nation, while others continue to see her as a traitor\u2014as may be assumed from a legend that she had a twin sister who went North, and from the pejorative [[nickname]] ''[[La Chingada]]'' associated with her twin.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nFeminist interventions into the figure of Malinche began in 1960s. The work of [[Rosario Castellanos]] was particularly significant; Chicanas began to refer to her as a \"mother\" as they adopted her as symbolism for duality and complex identity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castellanos |first=Rosario |title=Otra vez Sor Juana\" (\"Once Again Sor Juana\") |date=1963}}</ref> Castellanos's subsequent poem \"La Mallinche\" recast her not as a traitor but as a victim.<ref name=\"Romero2005\">{{cite book |author=Rolando Romero |title=Feminism, Nation and Myth: La Malinche |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfesWiXwkdQC&pg=PA28 |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Arte Publico Press |isbn=978-1-61192-042-0 |pages=28\u2013 }}</ref> Mexican feminists defended Malinche as a woman caught between cultures, forced to make complex decisions, who ultimately served as a mother of a new race.<ref name=\"CoerverPasztor2004\">{{cite book |author1=Don M.

It is argued, however, that without her help, Cort\u00e9s would not have been successful in conquering the Aztecs as quickly, giving the Aztec people enough time to adapt to new technology and methods of warfare. From that viewpoint, she is seen as one who betrayed the indigenous people by siding with the Spaniards. Recently a number of feminist Latinas have decried such a categorization as [[scapegoating]].{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=12}}\n\nPresident [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] commissioned a sculpture of Cort\u00e9s, Do\u00f1a Marina, and their son Mart\u00edn, which was placed in front of Cort\u00e9s's house in the [[Coyoacan]] section of Mexico City.  Once L\u00f3pez Portillo left office, the sculpture was removed to an obscure park in the capital.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-03-31-wr-223-story.html/ It is time to stop vilifying the \"Spanish father of Mexico\"], accessed 10 June 2019</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:La Malinche statue.jpg|right|thumb|La Malinche, as part of the ''Monumento al Mestizaje'' in Mexico City]]\n\n*A reference to La Malinche as Marina is made in the novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' by the Polish author [[Jan Potocki]], in which she is cursed for yielding her \"heart and her country to the hateful Cortez, chief of the sea-brigands.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Potocki |first=Jan |title=The Manuscript Found at Saragossa |year=1995 |publisher=Penguin Books |author2=trans.

In contrast, she is portrayed as a duplicitous traitor in [[Gary Jennings]]' novel ''[[Aztec (novel)|Aztec]]'' (1980). A novel published in 2006 by [[Laura Esquivel]] portrays the main character as a pawn of history who becomes ''Malinche''.\n*In 1949, choreographer Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n premiered the dance trio \"La Milanche\" to music by Norman Lloyd.

The series was originally produced in Japan, and then translated into English.\n*In the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, a starship, the USS ''Malinche'', was named for La Malinche, and appeared in the 1997 \"[[For the Uniform]]\" episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.

He uses her relation to Cort\u00e9s symbolically to represent Mexican culture as originating from rape and violation.\n*Malinal is a character in [[Graham Hancock]]'s series of novels ''War God: Nights of the Witch'' (2013) and ''War God: Return of the Plumed Serpent'' (2014), which is a fictional story describing the events related to the Hernan Cort\u00e9s' expedition to Mexico and the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire.\n*Malinche is a character in Edward Rickford's ''The Serpent and the Eagle'', referred to variously as ''Dona Marina'' and ''Malintze''.
