{"title_page": "Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz (conductor)", "text_new": "'''Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz''' (28 August 1929{{spaced ndash}}16 April 1973) was an internationally acclaimed [[Jewish]] [[Hungary|Hungarian]] orchestral and operatic [[conducting|conductor]] who, throughout his brief but distinguished career led many of the world's great orchestras, including the Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Francisco and Minnesota Orchestras in the United States, as well as the London Symphony, Vienna Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Israel Philharmonic, and L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. His orchestral repertoire numbered over 450 works from all periods, and was matched by a repertoire of some sixty operas ranging from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi|Verdi]], [[Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini|Puccini]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] to the more contemporary [[Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]], [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly|Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc|Poulenc]] and [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek|Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]. Kert\u00e9sz was part of a rich musical tradition that produced fellow [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[conducting|conductors]] [[Fritz Reiner]], [[Antal Dor\u00e1ti]], [[J\u00e1nos Ferencsik]], [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[George Szell]], [[J\u00e1nos F\u00fcrst]], [[Ferenc Fricsay]], and Sir [[Georg Solti]].\n\nThrough his gramophone recordings, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz has been rediscovered by a new and younger audience, and has increasingly come to be regarded as one of the greatest conductors of all time {{citation needed}}.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nKert\u00e9sz was born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], in 1929, the first child of Margit Muresian and Mikl\u00f3s Kert\u00e9sz. His sister, Vera, was born four years later. Mikl\u00f3s Kert\u00e9sz, born in [[Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny]], Hungary into a large [[Jew]]ish family, was the director of a leather-works and died of appendicitis in 1938. An energetic, intellectually gifted woman, Margit Muresian Kert\u00e9sz went to work to support her family. Despite strictures against women working professionally in Hungarian society during the first half of the twentieth century, Margit was steadily promoted until she ran the office where she was employed. At an early age Kert\u00e9sz showed a great affinity for music, and began [[violin]] lessons. \"When I was six and started music,\" he told a ''High Fidelity'' interviewer, \"it was 1935 and cruel things were going on in Europe ... I found my 'exile' in music, practicing the piano, the fiddle, and writing little compositions.\"<ref>\"Interview with Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz,\" ''High Fidelity Magazine'' 19, No. 12 (December 1969).</ref>\n\n===World War II and the Holocaust===\nWith the failure of Hungary's efforts to negotiate an armistice with the western Allies, German forces occupied Hungary on 19 March 1944. Aware of what was happening to [[Jew]]s throughout Europe, the family went into hiding. Most of Kert\u00e9sz's extended family were deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in July 1944 and did not survive the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].\n\nAt the insistence of his mother, and despite the wartime interruptions of air raids, deportations, starvation and invasions by both Germans and later, the Russians, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz continued his musical studies. By the time he was twelve, Kert\u00e9sz began to study the [[piano]] and composition in addition to the violin. The young Kert\u00e9sz, along with his sister, took advantage of Budapest's rich cultural life and attended symphonic or operatic performances almost every evening. It was at this time that Kert\u00e9sz decided to become a conductor. After the war, he resumed his formal studies and attended the K\u00f6lcsey-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] where, in 1947, he graduated with honors.\n\nThat same year, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz enrolled as a scholarship student at the Royal Academy of Music, now the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] in [[Budapest]], where he studied [[violin]], [[piano]] and [[Musical composition|composition]] with [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Leo Weiner]] and [[Rezs\u0151 K\u00f3kai]]. Developing his keen interest in [[conducting]], Kert\u00e9sz became a student of [[J\u00e1nos Ferencsik]] and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Somogyi. At the [[Music school|conservatory]], Kert\u00e9sz also met his wife, the lyric [[soprano]] Edith Gancs, whom he married in 1951. She later changed her name to [[Edith Kert\u00e9sz-Gabry]]. The gifted musical pair were part of a talented cohort of musicians. Musically, Kert\u00e9sz was most influenced by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Somogyi, [[Bruno Walter]] and [[Otto Klemperer]], then the director of the [[Budapest Opera]].\n\n==Career==\nOn 17 December 1948, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz made his debut as a conductor with an all-Mozart programme.\n\n===Budapest===\nFrom 1953 to 1955, Kert\u00e9sz was chosen as Chief Conductor or the Philharmonic Orchestra at [[Gy\u0151r]], a post that he held for two years. During this period he had the opportunity to develop a broad symphonic repertoire, leading the [[Budapest]] Opera Orchestra from 1955 to 1957, and working as an Assistant Professor of Conducting at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. After the upheaval of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], and with a young family in tow, Kert\u00e9sz left [[Hungary]]. Offered a fellowship to the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] in [[Rome]], Kert\u00e9sz studied with [[Fernando Previtali]] while his wife, Edith Kert\u00e9sz-Gabry sang at the [[Theater Bremen|Bremen Opera]]. Kert\u00e9sz graduated with distinction, and was given the highest award of the Accademia, the \"Premio d'Atri.\"  Moreover, Previtali chose Kert\u00e9sz for his \"Corso di Perfezionamento\" for two successive seasons, during which Kert\u00e9sz conducted the Santa Cecilia Orchestra forty times.\n\nAfter completing his studies in Rome, Kert\u00e9sz was engaged as a guest conductor of the [[Hamburger Symphoniker|Hamburg Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Hamburg]] State Opera. Guest conducting there, as well as in [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Hanover]], he electrified German audiences with his masterful direction of ''[[Fidelio]]'' and ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]''.\n\n===Augsburg Opera===\nIn March 1960, Kert\u00e9sz was invited to become General Music Director of the [[Augsburg]] Opera\u2014a post especially created for him. There he conducted performances of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail|The Abduction from the Seraglio]]'', ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', and ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', earning himself a reputation as one of the finest interpreters of Mozart's work. With exhilarating performances of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Don Carlos]]'', ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', ''[[Arabella]]'', and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', Kert\u00e9sz also proved himself a master of the finest of Italian Romantic operas. Invited to the [[Salzburg Festival]], he conducted ''The Abduction from the Seraglio'' in 1961, and ''The Magic Flute'' in 1963. During this time, Kert\u00e9sz also gave the first of many performances at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]], [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[San Francisco Opera]], [[North German Radio Symphony Orchestra]], [[Hamburg Symphony]], [[Munich Philharmonic]], [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Festival dei Due Mondi]] in [[Spoleto]] where he conducted Prokofiev's ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'', and with [[Arthur Rubinstein]] in [[Paris]].\n\nKert\u00e9sz also made his earliest recordings, including Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 2]] and [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 4]]. Having already recorded for EMI/Columbia records, Kert\u00e9sz now signed an exclusive contract with Decca/London for whom he began to make dozens of prize-winning recordings. Already at this early stage in his career, Kert\u00e9sz's interpretations of Brahms and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k were highly regarded for their transparent textures and unmannered phrasing. In stark contrast to [[Herbert von Karajan]] and [[George Szell]], Kert\u00e9sz's music-making featured an unforced manner even when employing the fastest of tempi. Other elements that made a Kert\u00e9sz performance notable was the elasticity of tempi while adhering to the structural coherence of a given musical work. His British debut was with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1960. Kert\u00e9sz made his U.S. debut during the 1961-62 season, also beginning an association with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra whom he guest-conducted at [[Tel Aviv]]'s Mann Auditorium in March 1962. Eventually, Kert\u00e9sz conducted over 378 compositions with the Israel Philharmonic over an eleven-year period.\n\nWithin just four years, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz had established a lasting international reputation as a conductor.\n\n===Cologne Opera===\nIn 1964, Kert\u00e9sz received an appointment as the General Music Director of the [[Cologne Opera]] where he conducted the first German performance of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Billy Budd (opera)|Billy Budd]]'' and Verdi's ''[[Stiffelio]]'', as well as the [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] operas ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', ''Cos\u00ec fan tutte'' and ''The Magic Flute''.\n\nWhile he established a good rapport with the often critical Cologne audience, they were sometimes unhappy with his often fast tempi. His 1970 ''[[Aida]]'', with [[Martina Arroyo]] in the title role, with one interval and some cuts, lasted under three hours.\n\n===London Symphony Orchestra===\nRetaining his previous position as Director of the [[Cologne Opera]], he also became Principal Conductor of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] from 1965 to 1968, and made guest appearances at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]]. During his three years as Principal Conductor of the LSO, Kert\u00e9sz gave superbly stylish, imaginative and deft performances. He was acclaimed for recordings with the ensemble of the nine [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] [[Symphony|symphonies]], which included the first complete recording of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Symphony No. 1]].<ref>Ray Minshull, ''Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Symphony No. 1'' (liner notes from the Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz recording).</ref>\n\nDuring this period in Kert\u00e9sz's career, in 1966, he also recorded ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' with [[Christa Ludwig]] singing the role of Judith and [[Walter Berry (bass-baritone)|Walter Berry]] in the title role. Kert\u00e9sz's interpretation of Bart\u00f3k's difficult, brooding work is considered by many to be the benchmark performance of the opera; \"the playing of the London Symphony Orchestra, and Kert\u00e9sz's instinctive shaping of the drama . . . has never been surpassed.\"<ref>Andrew Clements, \"Bart\u00f3k: Bluebeard's Castle,\" ''The Guardian'' (Friday, 2 March 2001).</ref>\n\nKert\u00e9sz was a frequent guest conductor of the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Vienna Philharmonic]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], and numerous other orchestras. He was appointed Principal Conductor of the [[Bamberg Symphony]] in 1973. The [[Cleveland Orchestra]] unsuccessfully bid for his appointment as musical director the year before. The orchestra players voted 96 to 2 to request the board to favour Kert\u00e9sz as the replacement of [[George Szell]]. In Chicago, he conducted his first performance at the Ravinia Festival in July 1967; he was the Festival's principal conductor from 1970 to 1972.\n\n==Death==\nOn 16 April 1973, while on a concert tour, Kert\u00e9sz [[drowning|drowned]] while swimming off the coast of [[Israel]] at [[Herzliya]].<ref>\"Obituary for Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz,\" ''The Musical Times'' 114, No. 1564 (1973), p. 632.</ref> He had been recording what would become a legendary version of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]'', as well as the complete Brahms symphonies. After his untimely death, and in tribute to him, the Vienna Philharmonic finished recording the ''Haydn Variations''.\n\nKert\u00e9sz was survived by his wife, operatic soprano Edith Kert\u00e9sz-Gabry, his children, G\u00e1bor, P\u00e9ter, and Kathrin, his mother, Margit Muresian Kert\u00e9sz Halmos, and his sister, the graphic artist Vera Kert\u00e9sz.\n\n==International orchestras==\nIstv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz served as principal and or guest conductor under the following orchestras:\n[[Bamberg Symphony Orchestra]], [[Berlin Philharmonic]], [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], [[Cleveland Orchestra]], [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] (Amsterdam), Detroit Symphony Orchestra, G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra ([[Cologne, Germany|Cologne]]), [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], Japan Philharmonic Orchestra ([[Tokyo]]), [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], [[Minnesota Orchestra]], [[Philharmonia|New Philharmonia Orchestra]] (London), [[Munich Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[New York Philharmonic]], [[Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks]] (Munich), Orquestre Nacional ([[Madrid]]), Orchestre Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision ([[Paris]]), [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]] ([[Geneva]]), [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]], Radio Symphony Orchestra (Berlin), Opera Orchestra of Santa Cecila (Rome), [[San Francisco Symphony]], Symphonie Orchester des Norddeutschen Rundfunks ([[Hamburg]]), [[Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra]], Tonhalle-Orchester (Z\u00fcrich), [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\n==Discography==\nHis many recordings include the first complete recording of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]''.<ref>see:<br />[[Library of Congress]], Online Catalog <br /> [https://portal.d-nb.de/opac.htm?query=Kertesz%2C+Istvan&method=simpleSearch Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Deutsches Musikarchiv] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723000059/https://portal.d-nb.de/opac.htm?query=Kertesz,+Istvan&method=simpleSearch |date=2011-07-23 }} <br />[http://aleph18.onb.ac.at/F/L62TU2HMAI2RLGT3K9F4DIKUICV74G7GSSKEUG8YUX7HSVSEAE-60895?func=find-b&find_code=WRD&adjacent=N&request=Kertesz%2C+Istvan \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek Katalog der Musiksammlung] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531194917/http://aleph18.onb.ac.at/F/L62TU2HMAI2RLGT3K9F4DIKUICV74G7GSSKEUG8YUX7HSVSEAE-60895?func=find-b&find_code=WRD&adjacent=N&request=Kertesz,+Istvan |date=2011-05-31 }}</ref> He was also the first to record the complete [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] symphonies and his interpretations of them are still considered classics of their kind. Pianists [[Clifford Curzon]], [[Hans Richter-Haaser]], [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] and [[Julius Katchen]] each made fine records with Kert\u00e9sz, among which the Mozart concertos are particularly inspired. With his renditions of [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly|Kod\u00e1ly]]'s big orchestral works, and given his precise yet passionate conducting style, Kert\u00e9sz was particularly well-suited to get the full orchestral swoop and swoon endemic to ''Psalmus Hungaricus'' and the ''Peacock Variations''. The sonority Kert\u00e9sz managed to elicit from the [[London Symphony Orchestra|LSO]] was expertly executed. Little wonder that [[Barry Tuckwell]], the principal [[French horn|hornist]] of the LSO, spoke of the \u00e9lan and enthusiasm Kert\u00e9sz could coax out of the orchestra, many of whose members Tuckwell regarded as \"old codgers not bloody likely to dance to any youngster's tune.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n*[[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]], ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' ([[Christa Ludwig|Ludwig]], [[Walter Berry (opera singer)|Berry]]), London Symphony Orchestra (1965), [[Decca Records|DECCA]] SET 311\n*Bart\u00f3k, [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bart\u00f3k)|Piano Concerto No. 3]] in E, Sz. 119 ([[Julius Katchen|Katchen]]), London Symphony Orchestra (1965), [[Decca Records|DECCA]] SXL 6209\n*[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 3]] in C minor, Op. 37, Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, OPERA EPK 3269\n*Beethoven, ''[[Coriolan Overture]]'', Op. 62, Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, ARIOLA/Bacc.

His orchestral repertoire numbered over 450 works from all periods, and was matched by a repertoire of some sixty operas ranging from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi|Verdi]], [[Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini|Puccini]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] to the more contemporary [[Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]], [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly|Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc|Poulenc]] and [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek|Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]. Kert\u00e9sz was part of a rich musical tradition that produced fellow [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[conducting|conductors]] [[Fritz Reiner]], [[Antal Dor\u00e1ti]], [[J\u00e1nos Ferencsik]], [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[George Szell]], [[J\u00e1nos F\u00fcrst]], [[Ferenc Fricsay]], and Sir [[Georg Solti]].\n\nThrough his gramophone recordings, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz has been rediscovered by a new and younger audience, and has increasingly come to be regarded as one of the greatest conductors of all time.{{citation needed}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nKert\u00e9sz was born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], in 1929, the first child of Margit Muresian and Mikl\u00f3s Kert\u00e9sz. His sister, Vera, was born four years later. Mikl\u00f3s Kert\u00e9sz, born in [[Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny]], Hungary into a large [[Jew]]ish family, was the director of a leather-works and died of appendicitis in 1938. An energetic, intellectually gifted woman, Margit Muresian Kert\u00e9sz went to work to support her family. Despite strictures against women working professionally in Hungarian society during the first half of the twentieth century, Margit was steadily promoted until she ran the office where she was employed. At an early age Kert\u00e9sz showed a great affinity for music, and began [[violin]] lessons. \"When I was six and started music,\" he told a ''High Fidelity'' interviewer, \"it was 1935 and cruel things were going on in Europe ... I found my 'exile' in music, practicing the piano, the fiddle, and writing little compositions.\"<ref>\"Interview with Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz,\" ''High Fidelity Magazine'' 19, No. 12 (December 1969).</ref>\n\n===World War II and the Holocaust===\nWith the failure of Hungary's efforts to negotiate an armistice with the western Allies, German forces occupied Hungary on 19 March 1944. Aware of what was happening to [[Jew]]s throughout Europe, the family went into hiding. Most of Kert\u00e9sz's extended family were deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in July 1944 and did not survive the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].\n\nAt the insistence of his mother, and despite the wartime interruptions of air raids, deportations, starvation and invasions by both Germans and later, the Russians, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz continued his musical studies. By the time he was twelve, Kert\u00e9sz began to study the [[piano]] and composition in addition to the violin. The young Kert\u00e9sz, along with his sister, took advantage of Budapest's rich cultural life and attended symphonic or operatic performances almost every evening. It was at this time that Kert\u00e9sz decided to become a conductor. After the war, he resumed his formal studies and attended the K\u00f6lcsey-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] where, in 1947, he graduated with honors.\n\nThat same year, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz enrolled as a scholarship student at the Royal Academy of Music, now the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] in [[Budapest]], where he studied [[violin]], [[piano]] and [[Musical composition|composition]] with [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Leo Weiner]] and [[Rezs\u0151 K\u00f3kai]]. Developing his keen interest in [[conducting]], Kert\u00e9sz became a student of [[J\u00e1nos Ferencsik]] and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Somogyi. At the [[Music school|conservatory]], Kert\u00e9sz also met his wife, the lyric [[soprano]] Edith Gancs, whom he married in 1951. She later changed her name to [[Edith Kert\u00e9sz-Gabry]]. The gifted musical pair were part of a talented cohort of musicians. Musically, Kert\u00e9sz was most influenced by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Somogyi, [[Bruno Walter]] and [[Otto Klemperer]], then the director of the [[Budapest Opera]].\n\n==Career==\nOn 17 December 1948, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz made his debut as a conductor with an all-Mozart programme.\n\n===Budapest===\nFrom 1953 to 1955, Kert\u00e9sz was chosen as Chief Conductor or the Philharmonic Orchestra at [[Gy\u0151r]], a post that he held for two years. During this period he had the opportunity to develop a broad symphonic repertoire, leading the [[Budapest]] Opera Orchestra from 1955 to 1957, and working as an Assistant Professor of Conducting at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. After the upheaval of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], and with a young family in tow, Kert\u00e9sz left [[Hungary]]. Offered a fellowship to the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] in [[Rome]], Kert\u00e9sz studied with [[Fernando Previtali]] while his wife, Edith Kert\u00e9sz-Gabry sang at the [[Theater Bremen|Bremen Opera]]. Kert\u00e9sz graduated with distinction, and was given the highest award of the Accademia, the \"Premio d'Atri.\"  Moreover, Previtali chose Kert\u00e9sz for his \"Corso di Perfezionamento\" for two successive seasons, during which Kert\u00e9sz conducted the Santa Cecilia Orchestra forty times.\n\nAfter completing his studies in Rome, Kert\u00e9sz was engaged as a guest conductor of the [[Hamburger Symphoniker|Hamburg Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Hamburg]] State Opera. Guest conducting there, as well as in [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Hanover]], he electrified German audiences with his masterful direction of ''[[Fidelio]]'' and ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]''.\n\n===Augsburg Opera===\nIn March 1960, Kert\u00e9sz was invited to become General Music Director of the [[Augsburg]] Opera\u2014a post especially created for him. There he conducted performances of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail|The Abduction from the Seraglio]]'', ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', and ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', earning himself a reputation as one of the finest interpreters of Mozart's work. With exhilarating performances of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Don Carlos]]'', ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', ''[[Arabella]]'', and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', Kert\u00e9sz also proved himself a master of the finest of Italian Romantic operas. Invited to the [[Salzburg Festival]], he conducted ''The Abduction from the Seraglio'' in 1961, and ''The Magic Flute'' in 1963. During this time, Kert\u00e9sz also gave the first of many performances at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]], [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[San Francisco Opera]], [[North German Radio Symphony Orchestra]], [[Hamburg Symphony]], [[Munich Philharmonic]], [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Festival dei Due Mondi]] in [[Spoleto]] where he conducted Prokofiev's ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'', and with [[Arthur Rubinstein]] in [[Paris]].\n\nKert\u00e9sz also made his earliest recordings, including Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 2]] and [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 4]]. Having already recorded for EMI/Columbia records, Kert\u00e9sz now signed an exclusive contract with Decca/London for whom he began to make dozens of prize-winning recordings. Already at this early stage in his career, Kert\u00e9sz's interpretations of Brahms and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k were highly regarded for their transparent textures and unmannered phrasing. In stark contrast to [[Herbert von Karajan]] and [[George Szell]], Kert\u00e9sz's music-making featured an unforced manner even when employing the fastest of tempi. Other elements that made a Kert\u00e9sz performance notable was the elasticity of tempi while adhering to the structural coherence of a given musical work. His British debut was with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1960. Kert\u00e9sz made his U.S. debut during the 1961-62 season, also beginning an association with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra whom he guest-conducted at [[Tel Aviv]]'s Mann Auditorium in March 1962. Eventually, Kert\u00e9sz conducted over 378 compositions with the Israel Philharmonic over an eleven-year period.\n\nWithin just four years, Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz had established a lasting international reputation as a conductor.\n\n===Cologne Opera===\nIn 1964, Kert\u00e9sz received an appointment as the General Music Director of the [[Cologne Opera]] where he conducted the first German performance of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Billy Budd (opera)|Billy Budd]]'' and Verdi's ''[[Stiffelio]]'', as well as the [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] operas ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', ''Cos\u00ec fan tutte'' and ''The Magic Flute''.\n\nWhile he established a good rapport with the often critical Cologne audience, they were sometimes unhappy with his often fast tempi. His 1970 ''[[Aida]]'', with [[Martina Arroyo]] in the title role, with one interval and some cuts, lasted under three hours.\n\n===London Symphony Orchestra===\nRetaining his previous position as Director of the [[Cologne Opera]], he also became Principal Conductor of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] from 1965 to 1968, and made guest appearances at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]]. During his three years as Principal Conductor of the LSO, Kert\u00e9sz gave superbly stylish, imaginative and deft performances. He was acclaimed for recordings with the ensemble of the nine [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] [[Symphony|symphonies]], which included the first complete recording of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Symphony No. 1]].<ref>Ray Minshull, ''Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Symphony No. 1'' (liner notes from the Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz recording).</ref>\n\nDuring this period in Kert\u00e9sz's career, in 1966, he also recorded ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' with [[Christa Ludwig]] singing the role of Judith and [[Walter Berry (bass-baritone)|Walter Berry]] in the title role. Kert\u00e9sz's interpretation of Bart\u00f3k's difficult, brooding work is considered by many to be the benchmark performance of the opera; \"the playing of the London Symphony Orchestra, and Kert\u00e9sz's instinctive shaping of the drama . . . has never been surpassed.\"<ref>Andrew Clements, \"Bart\u00f3k: Bluebeard's Castle,\" ''The Guardian'' (Friday, 2 March 2001).</ref>\n\nKert\u00e9sz was a frequent guest conductor of the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Vienna Philharmonic]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], and numerous other orchestras. He was appointed Principal Conductor of the [[Bamberg Symphony]] in 1973. The [[Cleveland Orchestra]] unsuccessfully bid for his appointment as musical director the year before. The orchestra players voted 96 to 2 to request the board to favour Kert\u00e9sz as the replacement of [[George Szell]]. In Chicago, he conducted his first performance at the Ravinia Festival in July 1967; he was the Festival's principal conductor from 1970 to 1972.\n\n==Death==\nOn 16 April 1973, while on a concert tour, Kert\u00e9sz [[drowning|drowned]] while swimming off the coast of [[Israel]] at [[Herzliya]].<ref>\"Obituary for Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz,\" ''The Musical Times'' 114, No. 1564 (1973), p. 632.</ref> He had been recording what would become a legendary version of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]'', as well as the complete Brahms symphonies. After his untimely death, and in tribute to him, the Vienna Philharmonic finished recording the ''Haydn Variations''.\n\nKert\u00e9sz was survived by his wife, operatic soprano Edith Kert\u00e9sz-Gabry, his children, G\u00e1bor, P\u00e9ter, and Kathrin, his mother, Margit Muresian Kert\u00e9sz Halmos, and his sister, the graphic artist Vera Kert\u00e9sz.\n\n==International orchestras==\nIstv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz served as principal and or guest conductor under the following orchestras:\n[[Bamberg Symphony Orchestra]], [[Berlin Philharmonic]], [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], [[Cleveland Orchestra]], [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] (Amsterdam), Detroit Symphony Orchestra, G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra ([[Cologne, Germany|Cologne]]), [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], Japan Philharmonic Orchestra ([[Tokyo]]), [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], [[Minnesota Orchestra]], [[Philharmonia|New Philharmonia Orchestra]] (London), [[Munich Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[New York Philharmonic]], [[Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks]] (Munich), Orquestre Nacional ([[Madrid]]), Orchestre Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision ([[Paris]]), [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]] ([[Geneva]]), [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]], Radio Symphony Orchestra (Berlin), Opera Orchestra of Santa Cecila (Rome), [[San Francisco Symphony]], Symphonie Orchester des Norddeutschen Rundfunks ([[Hamburg]]), [[Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra]], Tonhalle-Orchester (Z\u00fcrich), [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\n==Discography==\nHis many recordings include the first complete recording of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]''.<ref>see:<br />[[Library of Congress]], Online Catalog <br /> [https://portal.d-nb.de/opac.htm?query=Kertesz%2C+Istvan&method=simpleSearch Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Deutsches Musikarchiv] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723000059/https://portal.d-nb.de/opac.htm?query=Kertesz,+Istvan&method=simpleSearch |date=2011-07-23 }} <br />[http://aleph18.onb.ac.at/F/L62TU2HMAI2RLGT3K9F4DIKUICV74G7GSSKEUG8YUX7HSVSEAE-60895?func=find-b&find_code=WRD&adjacent=N&request=Kertesz%2C+Istvan \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek Katalog der Musiksammlung] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531194917/http://aleph18.onb.ac.at/F/L62TU2HMAI2RLGT3K9F4DIKUICV74G7GSSKEUG8YUX7HSVSEAE-60895?func=find-b&find_code=WRD&adjacent=N&request=Kertesz,+Istvan |date=2011-05-31 }}</ref> He was also the first to record the complete [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] symphonies and his interpretations of them are still considered classics of their kind. Pianists [[Clifford Curzon]], [[Hans Richter-Haaser]], [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] and [[Julius Katchen]] each made fine records with Kert\u00e9sz, among which the Mozart concertos are particularly inspired. With his renditions of [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly|Kod\u00e1ly]]'s big orchestral works, and given his precise yet passionate conducting style, Kert\u00e9sz was particularly well-suited to get the full orchestral swoop and swoon endemic to ''Psalmus Hungaricus'' and the ''Peacock Variations''.

Its rosy red color is only apparent during eclipses. The chromosphere sits just above the [[photosphere]] and below the [[solar transition region]]. The layer of the chromosphere atop the photosphere is homogeneous. A forest of hairy-appearing [[Spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] rise from the homogeneous layer, some of which extend 10,000&nbsp;km into the corona above.\n\nThe density of the chromosphere is only 10<sup>\u22124</sup> times that of the [[photosphere]], the layer beneath, and 10<sup>\u22128</sup> times that of the [[atmosphere]] of [[Earth]] at sea level. This makes the chromosphere normally invisible and it can be seen only during a [[total eclipse]], where its reddish color is revealed.

In particular, one of its strongest [[Spectral lines|lines]] is the ''H''<sub>\u03b1</sub> at a [[wavelength]] of 656.3&nbsp;nm; this line is emitted by a [[hydrogen atom]] whenever its [[electron]] makes a transition from the ''n''=3 to the ''n''=2 [[energy level]]. A [[wavelength]] of 656.3&nbsp;nm is in the red part of the [[spectrum]], which causes the chromosphere to have its characteristic reddish colour.\n\nBy analysing the [[spectrum]] of the chromosphere, it was found that the [[temperature]] of this layer of the [[Sun|solar]] atmosphere increases with increasing height in the chromosphere itself. The temperature at the top of [[photosphere]] is only about 4,400&nbsp;K, while at the top of chromosphere, some 2,000&nbsp;km higher, it reaches 25,000&nbsp;K.<ref name=\"Freedman\" /><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbolok/sun_worldbook.html\n |title=World Book at NASA \u2013 Sun\n}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> This is however the opposite of what we find in the [[photosphere]], where the [[temperature]] drops with increasing height.\nIt is not yet fully understood what phenomenon causes the [[temperature]] of the chromosphere to paradoxically increase further from the [[Sun]]'s interior. However, it seems likely to be explained, partially or totally, by [[magnetic reconnection]].\n\n==Features==\nMany interesting phenomena can be observed in the chromosphere, which is very complex and dynamic:\n* Filaments (and prominences, which are filaments viewed from the side) underlie many [[coronal mass ejection]]s and hence are important to the prediction of [[space weather]]. ''[[Solar prominence]]s'' rise up through the chromosphere from the photosphere, sometimes reaching altitudes of 150,000&nbsp;km. These gigantic plumes of gas are the most spectacular of solar phenomena, aside from the less frequent [[solar flare]]s.\n* The most common feature is the presence of [[Spicule (solar physics)|spicule]]s, long thin fingers of luminous gas which appear like the blades of a huge field of fiery [[Poaceae|grass]] growing upwards from the photosphere below. Spicules rise to the top of the chromosphere and then sink back down again over the course of about 10 minutes. Similarly, there are horizontal wisps of gas called ''fibrils'', which last about twice as long as spicules.\n* Images taken in typical chromospheric lines show the presence of brighter cells, usually called as ''network'', while the surrounding darker regions are named ''internetwork''. They look similar to [[granule (solar physics)|granules]] commonly observed on the [[photosphere]] due to the heat [[convection]]. \n* Periodic oscillations have been found since the first observations with the instrument SUMER on board [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] with a frequency from 3 mHz to 10 mHz, corresponding to a characteristic periodic time of three minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Carlsson, M. |author2=Judge, P. |author3=Wilhelm, K. |title= SUMER Observations Confirm the Dynamic Nature of the Quiet Solar Outer Atmosphere: The Internetwork Chromosphere | journal= The Astrophysical Journal| year= 1997 | volume= 486|issue=1 |page= L63 | bibcode = 1997ApJ...486L..63C | doi = 10.1086/310836 |arxiv = astro-ph/9706226 }}</ref> Oscillations of the radial component of the plasma velocity are typical of the high chromosphere.

The current name is due to [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]], who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to [[SN 1054|a bright supernova]] recorded by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in 1054, the [[nebula]] was observed later by English astronomer [[John Bevis]] in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.\n\nAt an [[apparent magnitude]] of 8.4, comparable to that of [[Titan (moon)|Saturn's moon Titan]], it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using [[binoculars]] under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the  [[Perseus Arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, at a distance of about {{convert|6500|ly|kpc|lk=on|order=flip}} from Earth. It has a diameter of {{convert|11|ly|pc|order=flip}}, corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7&nbsp;[[arcminute]]s, and is expanding at a rate of about {{convert|1500|km/s|mi/s}}, or 0.5% of the [[speed of light]].\n\nAt the center of the nebula lies the [[Crab Pulsar]], a [[pulsar|neutron star]] {{convert|28|-|30|km|mi}} across with a spin rate of 30.2&nbsp;times per second, which emits pulses of [[radiation]] from [[gamma ray]]s to [[radio wave]]s. At [[X-ray]] and gamma ray [[photon energy|energies]] above 30 [[keV]], the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 [[electron volt|TeV]]. The nebula's radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that [[Occultation|occult]] it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's [[solar corona|corona]] was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula's radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.\n\n==Observational history==\n[[File:The Crab Nebula M1 Goran Nilsson & The Liverpool Telescope.jpg|thumb|[[H-alpha|HaRGB]] image of the Crab Nebula from the [[Liverpool Telescope]], exposures totalling 1.4 hours.]]\n{{further|SN 1054}}\nModern understanding that the Crab Nebula was created by a supernova traces back to 1921, when [[Carl Otto Lampland]] announced he had seen changes in its structure.<ref name=lampland/> This eventually led to the conclusion that the creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright [[SN 1054]] supernova recorded by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in AD 1054.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bc.ub.leidenuniv.nl/bc/tentoonstelling/Jan_Oort/object7.htm#7 |title=A short biography of Jan Hendrik Oort: 7.

The current name is due to [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]], who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to [[SN 1054|a bright supernova]] recorded by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in 1054, the [[nebula]] was observed later by English astronomer [[John Bevis]] in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.\n\nAt an [[apparent magnitude]] of 8.4, comparable to that of [[Titan (moon)|Saturn's moon Titan]], it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using [[binoculars]] under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the  [[Perseus Arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, at a distance of about {{convert|6500|ly|kpc|lk=on|order=flip}} from Earth. It has a diameter of {{convert|11|ly|pc|order=flip}}, corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7&nbsp;[[arcminute]]s, and is expanding at a rate of about {{convert|1500|km/s|mi/s}}, or 0.5% of the [[speed of light]].\n\nAt the center of the nebula lies the [[Crab Pulsar]], a [[pulsar|neutron star]] {{convert|28|-|30|km|mi}} across with a spin rate of 30.2&nbsp;times per second, which emits pulses of [[radiation]] from [[gamma ray]]s to [[radio wave]]s. At [[X-ray]] and gamma ray [[photon energy|energies]] above 30 [[keV]], the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 [[electron volt|TeV]]. The nebula's radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that [[Occultation|occult]] it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's [[corona]] was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula's radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.\n\n==Observational history==\n[[File:The Crab Nebula M1 Goran Nilsson & The Liverpool Telescope.jpg|thumb|[[H-alpha|HaRGB]] image of the Crab Nebula from the [[Liverpool Telescope]], exposures totalling 1.4 hours.]]\n{{further|SN 1054}}\nModern understanding that the Crab Nebula was created by a supernova traces back to 1921, when [[Carl Otto Lampland]] announced he had seen changes in its structure.<ref name=lampland/> This eventually led to the conclusion that the creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright [[SN 1054]] supernova recorded by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in AD 1054.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bc.ub.leidenuniv.nl/bc/tentoonstelling/Jan_Oort/object7.htm#7 |title=A short biography of Jan Hendrik Oort: 7.

Estimates range from about {{solar mass|1\u20135}}, with {{solar mass|2\u20133}} being the generally accepted value.<ref name=\"Davidsonetal1985\" /> The neutron star mass is estimated to be between {{solar mass|1.4 and 2}}.\n\nThe predominant theory to account for the missing mass of the Crab Nebula is that a substantial proportion of the mass of the progenitor was carried away before the supernova explosion in a fast [[stellar wind]], a phenomenon commonly seen in [[Wolf\u2013Rayet star]]s. However, this would have created a shell around the nebula. Although attempts have been made at several wavelengths to observe a shell, none has yet been found.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Frail |first=D. A. |last2=Kassim |first2=N. E. |last3=Cornwell |first3=T.

This means that the Moon\u2014and occasionally, planets\u2014can [[Astronomical transit|transit]] or [[occultation|occult]] the nebula. Although the Sun does not transit the nebula, its [[corona]] passes in front of it. These transits and occultations can be used to analyse both the nebula and the object passing in front of it, by observing how radiation from the nebula is altered by the transiting body.\n\n===Lunar===\nLunar transits have been used to map X-ray emissions from the nebula. Before the launch of X-ray-observing satellites, such as the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], X-ray observations generally had quite low [[angular resolution]], but when the Moon passes in front of the nebula, its position is very accurately known, and so the variations in the nebula's brightness can be used to create maps of X-ray emission.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Palmieri |first=T.

Its transit on 4 January 2003 ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) was the first since 31 December 1295 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]); another will not occur until 5 August 2267. Researchers used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to observe Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] as it crossed the nebula, and found that Titan's X-ray 'shadow' was larger than its solid surface, due to absorption of X-rays in its atmosphere.
