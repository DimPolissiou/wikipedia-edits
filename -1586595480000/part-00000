He attended the \u00c9cole Municipale de Dessin in Marseille from 1842 to 1846, and continued his artistic training in [[Paris]], where he studied under [[Paul Delaroche]] at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]]. In Paris he made copies after the Old Masters in the [[Louvre]], and admired the oil sketches of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]].<ref name=\"T314\">Turner 2000, p. 314.</ref> In 1855 he met [[Narcisse Diaz]], a member of the [[Barbizon school]], and the two often painted together in the [[Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau Forest]]. Monticelli frequently adopted Diaz's practice of introducing nudes or elegantly costumed figures into his landscapes.<ref name=\"T314\" />\n\nHe developed a highly individual [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style of painting, in which richly colored, dappled, textured and glazed surfaces produce a scintillating effect. He painted courtly subjects inspired by [[Antoine Watteau]]; he also painted still lifes, portraits, and [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] subjects that owe much to the example of Delacroix.\n\nAfter 1870, Monticelli returned to Marseille, where he would live in poverty despite a prolific output, selling his paintings for small sums. An unworldly man, he dedicated himself singlemindedly to his art.\n\nThe young [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] befriended Monticelli in the 1860s, and the influence of the older painter's work can be seen in C\u00e9zanne's work of that decade. Between 1878 and 1884 the two artists often painted landscapes together, once spending a month roaming the [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] countryside. Although Monticelli experimented briefly around 1870 with a treatment of light reflecting the discoveries of the Impressionists, he found the objectivity of this approach uncongenial.\n\nConfronted with criticism of his style of painting Monticelli himself remarked, \"I paint for thirty years from now\".<ref>in: \"Monticelli\" by [[Gustave Coquiot]], 1925 Albin Michel ed Paris</ref>  His work reached its greatest spontaneity in the decade before his death in 1886.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:1875 Monticelli Anstreicher an einer Hauswand anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright|''A Painter at Work on a House Wall'', 1875, [[St\u00e4del]]]]\n[[File:Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli 2 (Palais Longchamp, Marseille, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, France).jpg|thumb|upright|''Monument \u00e0 Monticelli'' in the [[Palais Longchamp]] Marseille]]\n\nMore than a century after his death, Monticelli's art is still subject to controversy.\n\nIn its painterly freedom Monticelli's work prefigures that of [[Vincent van Gogh]], who greatly admired his work after seeing it in Paris when he arrived there in 1886. Van Gogh immediately adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, and later remarked, \"I sometimes think I am really continuing that man.\"<ref>''Impressionism'' 1973, p. 45.</ref> In 1890, Van Gogh and his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] were instrumental in publishing the first book about Monticelli.<ref name=\"T314\" />\n\nMonticelli's reputation grew after his death. Among his collectors was [[Oscar Wilde]] who, after going to prison in 1895, wrote of his bankruptcy in a letter to [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], \"De Profundis\": \"That all my charming things were to be sold: my Burne-Jones drawings: my [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] drawings: my Monticelli: my Simeon Solomons: my china: my Library...\"\n\nOthers have expressed disregard of Monticelli's work. In a statement published in 2005 in [[The Guardian]], [[Sir Timothy Clifford]], director general of the [[National Galleries of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]], even chose Monticelli's ''A Garden Fete'' as the worst painting in Britain, and commented, \"We have been bequested eight paintings by Monticelli, each one more hideous than the last. In my 21 years here, none has been hung because I think Monticelli produces screamingly awful art. I call this one a Fete Worse Than Death.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/0,8542,1552438,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111060109/http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/gallery/0%2C8542%2C1552438%2C00.html|url-status=dead|title=Ten of the worst index &#124; &#124; guardian.co.uk Arts|archivedate=Jan 11, 2006|website=www.theguardian.com|accessdate=Apr 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bigaj |first1=Eve |title=Misunderstood Genius |url=https://medium.com/@insensified/misunderstood-genius-3831e8fc944a |website=Eve Bigaj |accessdate=24 September 2018 |date=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nA monument honoring Monticelli, designed in 1909 by the sculptor [[Auguste Carli]], is installed in the [[Palais Longchamp]] Marseille.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nFrom September 2008 till January 2009, an exhibition entitled \"Van Gogh and Monticelli\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandpalais.fr/fr/evenement/van-gogh-et-monticelli-centre-de-la-vieille-charite-marseille|title=Van Gogh et Monticelli Centre de la vieille charit\u00e9, Marseille|website=www.grandpalais.fr|accessdate=Apr 11, 2020}}</ref> took place in Marseille's ''Centre de la Vieille Charit\u00e9'', highlighting Monticelli's influence on Van Gogh's work.\n\nFrom April 25 till September 27, 2015, an exhibition entitled \"Van Gogh and Co.

Between 1878 and 1884 the two artists often painted landscapes together, once spending a month roaming the [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] countryside. Although Monticelli experimented briefly around 1870 with a treatment of light reflecting the discoveries of the Impressionists, he found the objectivity of this approach uncongenial.\n\nConfronted with criticism of his style of painting Monticelli himself remarked, \"I paint for thirty years from now\".<ref>in: \"Monticelli\" by [[Gustave Coquiot]], 1925 Albin Michel ed Paris</ref>  His work reached its greatest spontaneity in the decade before his death in 1886.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:1875 Monticelli Anstreicher an einer Hauswand anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright|''A Painter at Work on a House Wall'', 1875, [[St\u00e4del]]]]\n[[File:Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli 2 (Palais Longchamp, Marseille, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, France).jpg|thumb|upright|''Monument \u00e0 Monticelli'' in the [[Palais Longchamp]] Marseille]]\n\nMore than a century after his death, Monticelli's art is still subject to controversy.\n\nIn its painterly freedom Monticelli's work prefigures that of [[Vincent van Gogh]], who greatly admired his work after seeing it in Paris when he arrived there in 1886. Van Gogh immediately adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, and later remarked, \"I sometimes think I am really continuing that man.\"<ref>''Impressionism'' 1973, p. 45.</ref> In 1890, Van Gogh and his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] were instrumental in publishing the first book about Monticelli.<ref name=\"T314\" />\n\nMonticelli's reputation grew after his death. Among his collectors was [[Oscar Wilde]] who, after going to prison in 1895, wrote of his bankruptcy in a letter to [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], \"De Profundis\": \"That all my charming things were to be sold: my Burne-Jones drawings: my [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] drawings: my Monticelli: my Simeon Solomons: my china: my Library...\"\n\nOthers have expressed disregard of Monticelli's work. In a statement published in 2005 in [[The Guardian]], [[Sir Timothy Clifford]], director general of the [[National Galleries of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]], even chose Monticelli's ''A Garden Fete'' as the worst painting in Britain, and commented, \"We have been bequested eight paintings by Monticelli, each one more hideous than the last. In my 21 years here, none has been hung because I think Monticelli produces screamingly awful art. I call this one a Fete Worse Than Death.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/0,8542,1552438,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111060109/http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/gallery/0%2C8542%2C1552438%2C00.html|deadurl=y|title=Ten of the worst index &#124; &#124; guardian.co.uk Arts|archivedate=Jan 11, 2006|website=www.theguardian.com|accessdate=Apr 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bigaj |first1=Eve |title=Misunderstood Genius |url=https://medium.com/@insensified/misunderstood-genius-3831e8fc944a |website=Eve Bigaj |accessdate=24 September 2018 |date=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nA monument honoring Monticelli, designed in 1909 by the sculptor [[Auguste Carli]], is installed in the [[Palais Longchamp]] Marseille.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nFrom September 2008 till January 2009, an exhibition entitled \"Van Gogh and Monticelli\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandpalais.fr/fr/evenement/van-gogh-et-monticelli-centre-de-la-vieille-charite-marseille|title=Van Gogh et Monticelli Centre de la vieille charit\u00e9, Marseille|website=www.grandpalais.fr|accessdate=Apr 11, 2020}}</ref> took place in Marseille's ''Centre de la Vieille Charit\u00e9'', highlighting Monticelli's influence on Van Gogh's work.\n\nFrom April 25 till September 27, 2015, an exhibition entitled \"Van Gogh and Co.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the famous \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884.

Habr Awal Commanders carried out many successful operations that led to the decisive victory of the group and to the downfall of the Siad Barre regime.\n\nIn western Somaliland, this group was prominently represented in the 99 division of the [[Somali National Movement]] which was founded in [[Gabiley]] with the majority of the divisions troops consisting of militia fighters hailing from the Jibril Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal that dominates the [[Gabiley]] region. The 99 division was Commanded by General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) of the Jibril Abokor who successfully conquered [[Awdal]] region and completely erased the presence of [[Somali National Army]] forces within [[Gabiley]] and [[Awdal]] and forced the local [[Gadabursi]] inhabitants of [[Awdal]] to pledge loyalty to [[Somaliland]]. As commander of the 99 division, General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) also established a [[Somali National Movement]] military base in [[Zeila]] where the [[Somali National Movement|SNM]] occupied the Awdal region for 4 years and successfully defeated attempts by USF militia forces loyal to [[Djibouti]] who tried to take advantage of the fall of Siad Barre's [[Military Junta]] in 1991 and annex the city of [[Zeila]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=lAyeNqKK7bQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=jibril+abokor+militia#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Hassan Ali Jama, Who cares about Somalia |isbn= 9783899300758 |last1= Jama |first1= Hassan Ali |year= 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn central Somaliland, [[Muse Bihi Abdi]] and his Hussein Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal successfully liberated [[Hargeisa]] from the brutal communist regime and played a preeminent role for the SNM where they liberated [[Hargeisa]], and [[Faraweyne]].

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the famous \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884.
