Craddock grew up to become a notorious [[highwayman]] and robber who terrorized [[England]] in the 19th century under the name \"Gentleman Jim,\" after a prophecy from a gypsy said he would be a highwayman. He encountered the [[ghost]]s of other highwaymen and [[Dick Turpin]] left him a horse. He journeyed to the [[United States]] and encounters the [[gunslinger]]s [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]] and [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]]. The hot-headed Nighthawk lynched Craddock after wrongly assuming that he sexually assaulted Cinnamon, but Craddock somehow eludes death to rise again as a ghost.\n\nThe Gentleman Ghost learns he must wander the earth until the [[spirit]] of his killer moves on to the next [[plane (metaphysics)|plane of existence]]. Unfortunately, Nighthawk and Cinnamon turn out to be the [[reincarnation]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian royalty Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara: their [[soul]]s (due to their exposure to the [[Thanagar]]ian [[Nth metal]]) can never truly pass on. Both are eventually resurrected as [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]], and the Gentleman Ghost becomes their recurring nemesis during the 1940s.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Gentleman Ghost | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 137 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Craddock has over the decades menaced other heroes, including [[Batman]], [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[The New Teen Titans]], [[Max Mercury]] and [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]], but the [[vengeful ghost]] always returns to his main foes, the Hawks, sometimes as a foe and sometimes as a friend.\n\nGentleman Ghost has clashed with [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] on different occasions. In ''JSA Classified'', issues 5-7, the Gentleman Ghost is a member of the [[Injustice Society]]. In ''[[Villains United]]'' #1, he joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].\n\nHis origin is explored and altered in the pages of ''JSA'' #82-87 (2006). The [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] son of an abusive father and a poor mother, young Jim Craddock soon slips into a life of crime, making contacts with the supernatural. After a [[Romani people|gypsy]] prophesizes that he will be able to transcend death and return to life fighting and killing his enemies on English soil, his villainous career is put to an end when he is captured and sentenced to death by hanging after he is tricked by a woman he is trying to seduce who summons Redcoats. Returning as a ghost, he battles the JSA, hoping for the prophecy to come true.\n\nThe Ghost is briefly seen in the \"[[Infinite Crisis]]\" storyline, during the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]]' attack on Metropolis and its dozens of superpowered and human defenders. Afterwards, the Ghost becomes involved in a fight with [[Alan Scott]], which leaves Scott in a coma.\n\nWhen the rightful time arrives, the Ghost gains the additional power of summoning vengeful ghosts from his enemies' (the JSA) past, like someone Scott killed with an electrical accident, although this is a fake, and other highwaymen. His plan is foiled by [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]], who, as a [[virginity|virgin]] girl, is impervious to ghostly attacks, an army of ghostly nobles who attack his army, and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], surprisingly a descendant of the Royal House of England, who decapitates him. Vanquished, he disappears.\n\nGentleman Ghost is seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].\n\n===The New 52===\nIn [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Gentleman Ghost is still a thief but no longer a ghost.<ref name=\"Gotham By Midnight Annual #1\">''Gotham By Midnight Annual'' #1</ref> In his first appearance, he steals the Mortis Orb, which has the power to resurrect the dead.<ref>''Savage Hawkman'' #5</ref> Hawkman deduces that Gentleman Ghost is Jim Craddock and Gentleman Ghost confirms it. Gentleman Ghost tells Hawkman he invited him here because the Nth metal drew him to the Mortis Orb. Then, he tells Hawkman he will take him to the orb, but Hawkman refuses, so Gentleman Ghost sends more apparitions after him, Hawkman escapes the building. Then, Gentleman Ghost appears again, saying that the warlock's spell rendered the orb inert years ago, but the Nth Metal broke the spell causing the orb to regain its power. Gentleman Ghost takes the orb, saying that he will use it to transcend death and resurrect himself through the life-force of every man, woman, and child nearby. Then, he disappears and the [[Zombie]]s attacking Hawkman fall apart.<ref>''Savage Hawkman'' #6</ref> Gentleman Ghost begins fully harnessing the orb\u2019s power, creating a portal from which Julius Gates comes out. Gates (demanding the orb) grabs Craddock, while Hawkman takes the orb from him. The portal vanishes with Craddock and Gates inside causing them both to disappear along with the apparitions and zombies. Hawkman drops the Mortis Orb somewhere in Antarctica to keep it from falling into the wrong hands again.<ref>''Savage Hawkman'' #7</ref>\n\nSometime later, Craddock took up residence in a New Hampshire called Duskhaven which he operated out of while he robbed wealthy socialites of Gotham. When the Midnight Shift apprehended him, he revealed his new origins. Some time in the past, Craddock had been a philanderer and drew the ire of a witch, who cursed him, granting his abilities but forcing him to commit criminal acts. He believed the curse would be lifted once the witch died, but it was not, and he found himself to be immortal.<ref name=\"Gotham By Midnight Annual #1\"/>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[Image:Injustice society.jpg|thumb|150px|Gentleman Ghost in the [[Injustice Society]]. Art by [[Joe Bennett (penciller)|Joe Bennett]].]]\nOriginally, the Gentleman Ghost seemed to rely on devices to simulate a ghostly existence; the original 1940s stories left the question of his nature open to speculation. Later, however, he is [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned into a true ghost and his abilities altered to follow suit. As a ghost, Craddock has several abilities. He can become intangible and pass effortlessly through solid material. He can become completely invisible. In fact, the appearance of his head as a floating hat and monocle is actually him rendering his decayed face invisible. He has been shown as being able to teleport as short a distance as a few rooms or as far as across states. Gentleman Ghost can also summon spectral weapons including a cane that shoots spectral fire, and flintlock pistols. When passing through Craddock's ghostly form, people will sometimes experience an intense feeling of cold. Since this does not happen every time, it would seem that he can control this effect. Craddock can apparently track psionic energy and travel across dimensions as he did when he followed an astral tether from the Wizard to Johnny Sorrow. On certain occasions most of the manifestations of his abilities like teleportation and phasing are accompanied by a purple glow of spectral energy or transparent mist (possibly courtesy of different pencilers). Around the time of his prophesied return to life, he gains the power to summon and control the spirits of the dead due to his mother's spirit spending centuries recruiting them to help her son. It is unknown if he can still call upon them.\n\nThe Gentleman Ghost is apparently unable to touch or be touched by virgins. This is confirmed by his inability to do harm to both [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]] and [[Jakeem Thunder]]. However, he can pick up a real weapon and be able to hurt them, as when he brandished the Cosmic Rod.\n\nAs a supernatural being, Gentleman Ghost cannot be killed and is very hard to hurt. However, those with royal blood can physically harm him and, when unaware, energy hitting him causes pain.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Gentleman Ghost appears in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', voiced by an uncredited [[Alan Oppenheimer]]. This version is referred to only as \"Gentleman Jim Craddock\" instead of \"Gentleman Ghost\". In the episode \"Ghost\", a man casts a spell to bring Gentleman Ghost to the living so that he can take revenge on [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] for imprisoning his spirit. He uses his powers to turn U.N. representatives into ghosts and later turns Superman and Wonder Woman into ghosts. The curse is eventually broken, after which the Super Friends used the mystical Rods of [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] to send Gentleman Ghost back to his grave, never to return.\n* Gentleman Ghost was briefly considered to be featured in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.

In this version, \"Gentleman\" Jim Craddock was an infamous [[highwayman]] in 19th-century London who tried to obtain immortality by offering 10 souls to the demon [[Asteroth]] in exchange. However, he was stopped by the combined efforts of [[Sherlock Holmes]], the demon [[Etrigan]] and a time-displaced [[Batman]]. After being hung for his crimes, Craddock rose as Gentleman Ghost, swearing revenge on Batman (the demon stated that only \"his soul\" would not leave the earthly plane). Centuries later, he sought revenge by trying to kill Batman in several ways. However, Batman could defend himself with Nth metal.\n\n===Film===\n* Gentleman Ghost appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2016/12/12/new-lego-batman-movie-tv-spot-features-gentlemen-ghost-calendar-/|title=LEGO Batman Movie TV Spot with Gentleman Ghost, Calendar Man, and Condiment King|website=DC|accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> He is among the villains that assist the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in his attacks on Gotham City.\n* Gentleman Ghost appears in the direct-to-video film ''[[Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans]]'', voiced by [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]].\n\n===Video games===\n* Gentleman Ghost also appears as a villain in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold \u2013 The Videogame]]'', voiced again by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]].

[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 71-lap race from a third-position start. [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] of the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team finished in second and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]'s [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was third.\n\n[[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] of the [[McLaren]] team took [[pole position]] by recording the fastest lap in qualifying. He led on the first lap of the race before Michael Schumacher passed him at the start of lap two. Thereafter, Michael Schumacher opened up a 17.6 second lead before his first of two [[pit stop]]s for fuel and tyres on lap 20. He retook the lead after H\u00e4kkinen retired with a loss of engine oil pressure ten laps later. [[David Coulthard]] in the other McLaren gained on Michael Schumacher in the final 12 laps as the latter slowed to manage an [[oil pressure]] problem. He was not close enough to make a pass for the win and Michael Schumacher took his second consecutive victory of the season, his third in Brazil and the 37th of his career.\n\nAfter the race, Coulthard was disqualified from second place due to an illegal front wing endplate. McLaren filed an appeal to the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]'s International Court of Appeal, which was rejected. The disqualification advanced every driver behind Coulthard by a single position. The result extended Michael Schumacher's lead atop the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] to 12 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]]. Fisichella moved from fifth to second as [[Rubens Barrichello]] in the second Ferrari fell to third after not finishing the race. Ferrari further increased their lead in the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]] to 18 points as Benetton advanced to second with fifteen races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, July 3, 2018 SkySat (cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace]] ''(pictured in 2018)'', where the race was held.]]\nThe 2000 [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] was the second of the 17 motor races in the [[2000 Formula One World Championship]] and the 29th overall edition of the event.

[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 71-lap race from a third-position start. [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] of the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team finished in second and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]'s [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was third.\n\n[[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] of the [[McLaren]] team took [[pole position]] by recording the fastest lap in qualifying. He led on the first lap of the race before Michael Schumacher passed him at the start of lap two. Thereafter, Michael Schumacher opened up a 17.6 second lead before his first of two [[pit stop]]s for fuel and tyres on lap 20. He retook the lead after H\u00e4kkinen retired with a loss of engine oil pressure ten laps later. [[David Coulthard]] in the other McLaren gained on Michael Schumacher in the final 12 laps as the latter slowed to manage an [[oil pressure]] problem. He was not close enough to make a pass for the win and Michael Schumacher took his second consecutive victory of the season, his third in Brazil and the 37th of his career.\n\nAfter the race, Coulthard was disqualified from second place due to an illegal front wing endplate. McLaren filed an appeal to the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]'s International Court of Appeal, which was rejected. The disqualification advanced every driver behind Coulthard by a single position. The result extended Michael Schumacher's lead atop the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] to 12 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]]. Fisichella moved from fifth to second as [[Rubens Barrichello]] in the second Ferrari fell to third after not finishing the race. Ferrari further increased their lead in the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]] to 18 points as Benetton advanced to second with fifteen races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, July 3, 2018 SkySat (cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace]] ''(pictured in 2018)'', where the race was held.]]\nThe 2000 [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] was the second of the 17 motor races in the [[2000 Formula One World Championship]] and the 29th overall edition of the event.
