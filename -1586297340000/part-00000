Despite having been left incomplete during the medieval period, Cologne Cathedral eventually became unified as \"a masterpiece of exceptional intrinsic value\" and \"a powerful testimony to the strength and persistence of Christian belief in medieval and modern Europe\".<ref name=UNESCO />\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cologne Cathedral Altarpiece of Magi by Stephan Lochner.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Rectangular central section of an altarpiece in the International Gothic style, showing the Three Kings adoring the Christ Child.

The earliest may have been for grain storage and possibly was succeeded by a [[Roman temple]] built by [[Mercurius Augustus]]. From the 4th century on, however, the site was occupied by Christian buildings, including a square edifice known as the \"oldest cathedral\" that was commissioned by [[Maternus of Cologne|Maternus]], the first bishop of Cologne. A free-standing [[baptistery]] dating back to the 7th century was located at the east end of the present cathedral but was demolished in the 9th century to build the second cathedral. During excavations of the present cathedral, graves were discovered in the location of the oldest portion of the building; including that of a boy that was richly adorned with [[grave goods]] and another of a woman, popularly thought to be [[Wisigard]]. Both graves are thought to be from the 6th century. Only ruins of the baptistery and the octagonal [[baptismal font]] remain today.{{Citation needed|reason=No source given to back new addition re graves|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe second church, called the \"Old Cathedral\", was completed in 818. It was destroyed by fire on 30 April 1248, during demolition work to prepare for a new cathedral.\n\n=== Medieval beginning ===\n\nIn 1164, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Rainald of Dassel]], acquired the relics of the [[Three Kings]] which the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], had taken from the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]], Milan, Italy. (Parts of the relics have since been returned to Milan.) The relics have great religious significance and drew pilgrims from all over [[Christendom]]. It was important to church officials that they be properly housed, and thus began a building program in the new style of [[Gothic architecture]], based in particular on the French cathedral of [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe [[foundation stone]] was laid on 15 August 1248, by Archbishop [[Konrad von Hochstaden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/the-cologne-cathedral.html |title=The Cologne Cathedral |publisher=Cologne.de |accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> The eastern arm was completed under the direction of [[Master Gerhard]], was consecrated in 1322 and sealed off by a temporary wall so it could be used as the work continued. Eighty-four [[misericord]]s in the choir date from this building phase.\n\nIn the mid 14th century work on the west front commenced under Master Michael. This work ceased in 1473, leaving the south tower complete to the belfry level and crowned with a huge crane that remained in place as a landmark of the Cologne skyline for 400 years.<ref>Wim Swaan{{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref> Some work proceeded intermittently on the structure of the [[nave]] between the west front and the eastern arm, but during the 16th century this also stopped.<ref>Wim Swaan{{page needed|date=January 2015}} gives the latest date as 1560, but a date of 1520 is considered more probable by other scholars.</ref>\n\n=== 19th century completion ===\nWith the 19th century [[German Romanticism|romantic enthusiasm]] for the [[Middle Ages]], and spurred by the discovery of the original plan for the fa\u00e7ade, it was decided, with the commitment of the Protestant [[Prussia]]n Court, to complete the cathedral. It was achieved by civic effort; the ''[[Central-Dombauverein]]'', founded in 1842, raised two-thirds of the enormous costs, while the Prussian state supplied the remaining third.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}<!--The actual cost in the contemporary local currency needs to be referenced.--> The state saw this as a way to improve its relations with the large number of Catholic subjects it had gained in 1815, but especially after 1871, it was regarded as a project to symbolize German nationhood.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gilley|first=Sheridan|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=LvvzlLf9dFEC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=prussia+rebuilding+cologne+cathedral&source=bl&ots=i709d8FF59&sig=ACfU3U3f8Luw7rd2DdGhSCoKgkIKFat8kw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY1cmD4NboAhWtzIUKHSS9CPg4FBDoATABegQICBAn#v=onepage&q=prussia%20rebuilding%20cologne%20cathedral&f=false|title=The Cambridge History of Christianity: Volume 8, World Christianities C.1815-c.1914|last2=Stanley|first2=Brian|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-521-81456-0|location=|pages=114|language=en}}</ref> \n\nWork resumed in 1842 to the original design of the surviving medieval plans and drawings, but utilizing more modern construction techniques, including iron roof girders. The nave was completed and the towers were added. The bells were installed in the 1870s.

Badly damaged, it nevertheless remained standing in an otherwise completely flattened city. The twin spires were an easily recognizable navigational landmark for Allied aircraft bombing.\n\nOn 6 March 1945, an area west of the cathedral (Marzellenstrasse/Trankgasse) was the site of intense combat between American tanks of the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] and a [[Panther Tank|Panther Ausf. A]] of [[Panzer brigade]] 106 Feldherrnhalle. The Panther successfully knocked out a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]], killing three men, before it was destroyed by a [[M26 Pershing|T26E3 Pershing]] hours later. Footage of that battle survives. The destroyed Panther was later put on display at the base of the cathedral for the remainder of the war in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shootout at Cologne Cathedral |url=http://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2014/07/shootout-at-cologne-cathedral.html |website=WWII Filminspector |accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nRepairs of the war damage were completed in 1956. An emergency repair to the base of the northwest tower, carried out in 1944 using poor-quality brick taken from a nearby ruined building, remained visible as a reminder of the war until 2005, when it was decided to restore the section to its original appearance.\n\nRepair and maintenance work is constantly being carried out in one or another section of the building, which is rarely completely free of scaffolding, as wind, rain, and pollution slowly eat away at the stones. The ''Dombauh\u00fctte'', established to build the cathedral and keep it in repair, is said{{by whom?|date=August 2019}} to employ the best stonemasons in the Rhineland.

The plan is in the shape of a [[Latin Cross]], as is usual with Gothic cathedrals. It has two aisles on either side, which help to support one of the very highest Gothic vaults in the world, being nearly as tall as that of the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], much of which collapsed. Externally the outward thrust of the vault is taken by [[flying buttress]]es in the French manner. The eastern end has a single ambulatory, the second aisle resolving into a ''[[chevet]]'' of seven radiating chapels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nInternally, the medieval choir is more varied and less mechanical in its details than the 19th-century building. It presents a French style arrangement of very tall [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]], a delicate narrow [[triforium]] gallery lit by windows and with detailed tracery merging with that of the windows above. The [[clerestory]] windows are tall and retain some old figurative glass in the lower sections. The whole is united by the tall shafts that sweep unbroken from the floor to their capitals at the spring of the vault. The vault is of plain quadripartite arrangement.\n\nThe choir retains a great many of its original fittings, including the carved stalls, which is made the more surprising by the fact that French Revolutionary troops had desecrated the building. A large stone statue of [[St Christopher]] looks down towards the place where the earlier entrance to the cathedral was, before its completion in the late 19th century.\n\nThe nave has many 19th century stained glass windows. A set of five on the south side, called the ''Bayernfenster'', were a gift from [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], and strongly represent the painterly German style of that date.\n\nExternally, particularly from a distance, the building is dominated by its huge spires, which are entirely Germanic in character, being openwork like those of [[Ulm Minster|Ulm]], [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Vienna]], [[Strasbourg cathedral|Strasbourg]] and [[Regensburg Cathedral]]s.<ref>Wim Swaan,{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Banister Fletcher{{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" widths=\"270px\">\nFile:Cologne cathedral aerial (25326253726).jpg|A \"Bird's eye view\" shows the cruciform plan\nFile:Cologne cathedrale vue sud.jpg|The cathedral from the south\nFile:Koelner-dom-spire.jpg|The exterior of one of the spires\nFile:Cathedral main entrance.jpg|The main entrance shows the 19th century decoration\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"250px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg|The flying buttresses and pinnacles of the Medieval east end\nFile:Koelner Dom Innenraum.jpg|The [[nave]] looking east\nFile:Cologne Cathedral interior.JPG|Interior of the Medieval east end, showing the extreme height\nFile:Koelner dom neue orgel.jpg|This \"swallows' nest\" organ was built into the gallery in 1998, to celebrate the cathedral's 750 years\n</gallery>\n\n== Dimensions ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = Jahrbuch MZK Band 03 - Gew\u00f6lbesystem - Fig 75 Chordurchschnitt des Domes zu C\u00f6ln - S\u00fcdseite.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = 19th century cross-section, south elevation of the choir\n | image2    = Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png\n | width2    = 255\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Groundplan\n }}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:12em\"|External length||align=\"right\"| {{convert|144.58|m|ft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|External width||align=\"right\"| {{convert|86.25|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Width of west fa\u00e7ade||align=\"right\"| {{convert|61.54|m|ft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Width of [[transept]] fa\u00e7ade||align=\"right\"| {{convert|39.95|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Width of [[nave]] (with aisles, interior)||align=\"right\"| {{convert|45.19|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of southern tower||align=\"right\"| {{convert|157.31|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of northern tower||align=\"right\"| {{convert|157.38|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of ridge turret||align=\"right\"| {{convert|109.00|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of transept fa\u00e7ades||align=\"right\"| {{convert|69.95|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of roof ridge||align=\"right\"| {{convert|61.10|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Inner height of nave||align=\"right\"| {{convert|43.35|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Building area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|7914|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Window surface area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|10000|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Roof surface area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|12000|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Gross volume without buttresses||align=\"right\"| {{convert|407000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|}\n\n== Treasures{{anchor | Treasures of Cologne Cathedral}} ==\nOne of the treasures of the cathedral is the High Altar, which was installed in 1322. It is constructed of black marble, with a solid slab {{convert|15|ft|m}} long forming the top. The front and sides are overlaid with white marble niches into which are set figures, with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] at the centre.<ref>Holladay, Joan. ''Iconography of the High Altar in Cologne Cathedral'', (1989){{full citation needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe most celebrated work of art in the cathedral is the ''[[Shrine of the Three Kings]]'', commissioned by Philip von Heinsberg, archbishop of Cologne from 1167 to 1191 and created by Nicholas of Verdun, begun in 1190. It is traditionally believed to hold the remains of the [[Three Wise Men]], whose relics were acquired by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] at the conquest of Milan in 1164.   The shrine takes the form a large [[reliquary]] in the shape of a basilican church, made of bronze and silver, gilded and ornamented with architectonic details, figurative sculpture, enamels and gemstones.  The shrine was opened in 1864 and was found to contain bones and garments.\n\nNear the [[sacristy]] is the ''[[Gero Crucifix|Gero-Kreuz]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistory.upenn.edu/smr04/101910/Slide11.18.jpg|title=Art History|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]}}</ref> a large crucifix carved in oak and with traces of paint and gilding.

The altar of the patron saints of Cologne with an altarpiece by the [[International Gothic]] painter [[Stefan Lochner]] is in the ''Marienkapelle'' (\"St. Mary's Chapel\"). Other works of art are in the Cathedral Treasury. The altar also houses the relics of [[Saint Irmgardis]].\n\nEmbedded in the interior wall are a pair of [[Stele|stone tablets]] on which are carved the provisions formulated by Archbishop Englebert II (1262\u201367) under which Jews were permitted to reside in Cologne.<ref>[[Salo Wittmayer Baron|Baron, Salo Wittmayer]].

Cathedral organists have included [[Josef Zimmermann]], [[Clemens Ganz]] (1985\u20132001) and [[Winfried B\u00f6nig]] (2001).\n\n=== Bells ===\n[[File:CologneCathedralBell02.jpg|thumb|[[St. Petersglocke|''Petersglocke'']]; a person stands to the right of bell clapper]]\n\nThe cathedral has eleven church bells, four of which are medieval. The first was the 3.8-tonne ''Dreik\u00f6nigsglocke'' (\"Bell of the Three Kings\"), cast in 1418, installed in 1437, and recast in 1880. Two of the other bells, the ''Pretiosa'' (10.5&nbsp;tonnes; at that time the largest bell in the [[Western world]]) and the ''Speciosa'' (5.6&nbsp;tonnes) were installed in 1448 and remain in place today.\n\nDuring the 19th century, as the building neared completion, there was a desire to extend the number of bells. This was facilitated by Kaiser Wilhelm I who gave [[French Bronze|French bronze]] cannon, captured in 1870\u201371, for this purpose. The 22 pieces of artillery were displayed outside the Cathedral on 11 May 1872. Andreas Hamm in [[Frankenthal]] used them to cast a bell of over 27,000 kilos on 19 August 1873. The tone was not harmonious and another attempt was made on 13 November 1873. The Central Cathedral Association, which had agreed to take over the costs, did not want this bell either. Another attempt took place on 3 October 1874. The colossal bell was shipped to Cologne and on 13 May 1875, installed in the Cathedral. This ''Kaiserglocke'' was eventually melted in 1918 to support the German war effort. The Kaiserglocke was the largest free-swinging bell in history.\n\nThe 24-tonne ''[[St. Petersglocke]]'' (\"Bell of St. Peter\", \"''{{lang|ksh|Decke Pitter}}''\" in the [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch language]] or in common parlance known as \"''Dicker Pitter''\"), was cast in 1922 and was the largest free-swinging bell in the world, until a new bell was cast in Innsbruck for the People's Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest in Romania.<ref>The [[World Peace Bell]] in [[Newport, Kentucky]] is larger, but turns around its [[center of mass]] rather than its top.</ref>\n\n==== Bells of the ridge turret ====\n* Mettglocke \u2013 280 kilograms\n* Wandlungsglocke \u2013 425 kilograms\n* Angelusglocke \u2013 763 kilograms\n\n==== Bells of the main bell cage in the south spire ====\n* Aveglocke \u2013 830 kilograms\n* Kapitelsglocke \u2013 1.4 tonnes\n* Josephglocke \u2013 2.2 tonnes\n* Ursulaglocke \u2013 2.5 tonnes\n* Dreik\u00f6nigsglocke \u2013 3.8 tonnes\n* Speciosa \u2013 5.6 tonnes\n* Pretiosa \u2013 10.5 tonnes\n* St. Petersglocke, Great Bell of Germany \u2013 24 tonnes\n\n== See also == \n[[File:Kolnerdom-december2015.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1|(video) Cologne Cathedral in 2014]]\n* [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches]]\n* [[Gero Cross]]\n* [[Gothic architecture]]\n* [[Gothic Revival architecture]]\n* [[List of buildings and structures]]\n* [[List of highest church naves]]\n*[[List of cathedrals in Germany]]\n* [[Medievalism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Swaan, Wim and Christopher Brooke, ''The Gothic Cathedral'', Omega Books (1969), {{ISBN|0-907853-48-X}}\n* Fletcher, Banister, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.\n* Hubbard, Howard, ''Masterpieces of Western Sculpture'', Thames and Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-23278-4}}\n* Wolff, Arnold, ''Cologne Cathedral.

The earliest may have been for grain storage and possibly was succeeded by a [[Roman temple]] built by [[Mercurius Augustus]]. From the 4th century on, however, the site was occupied by Christian buildings, including a square edifice known as the \"oldest cathedral\" that was commissioned by [[Maternus of Cologne|Maternus]], the first bishop of Cologne. A free-standing [[baptistery]] dating back to the 7th century was located at the east end of the present cathedral but was demolished in the 9th century to build the second cathedral. During excavations of the present cathedral, graves were discovered in the location of the oldest portion of the building; including that of a boy that was richly adorned with [[grave goods]] and another of a woman, popularly thought to be [[Wisigard]]. Both graves are thought to be from the 6th century. Only ruins of the baptistery and the octagonal [[baptismal font]] remain today.{{Citation needed|reason=No source given to back new addition re graves|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe second church, called the \"Old Cathedral\", was completed in 818. It was destroyed by fire on 30 April 1248, during demolition work to prepare for a new cathedral.\n\n=== Medieval beginning ===\n\nIn 1164, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Rainald of Dassel]], acquired the relics of the [[Three Kings]] which the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], had taken from the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]], Milan, Italy. (Parts of the relics have since been returned to Milan.) The relics have great religious significance and drew pilgrims from all over [[Christendom]]. It was important to church officials that they be properly housed, and thus began a building program in the new style of [[Gothic architecture]], based in particular on the French cathedral of [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe [[foundation stone]] was laid on 15 August 1248, by Archbishop [[Konrad von Hochstaden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/the-cologne-cathedral.html |title=The Cologne Cathedral |publisher=Cologne.de |accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> The eastern arm was completed under the direction of [[Master Gerhard]], was consecrated in 1322 and sealed off by a temporary wall so it could be used as the work continued.

The twin spires were an easily recognizable navigational landmark for Allied aircraft bombing.\n\nOn 6 March 1945, an area west of the cathedral (Marzellenstrasse/Trankgasse) was the site of intense combat between American tanks of the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] and a [[Panther Tank|Panther Ausf.

The Panther successfully knocked out a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]], killing three men, before it was destroyed by a [[M26 Pershing|T26E3 Pershing]] hours later. Footage of that battle survives.

The plan is in the shape of a [[Latin Cross]], as is usual with Gothic cathedrals. It has two aisles on either side, which help to support one of the very highest Gothic vaults in the world, being nearly as tall as that of the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], much of which collapsed. Externally the outward thrust of the vault is taken by [[flying buttress]]es in the French manner. The eastern end has a single ambulatory, the second aisle resolving into a ''[[chevet]]'' of seven radiating chapels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nInternally, the medieval choir is more varied and less mechanical in its details than the 19th-century building. It presents a French style arrangement of very tall [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]], a delicate narrow [[triforium]] gallery lit by windows and with detailed tracery merging with that of the windows above. The [[clerestory]] windows are tall and retain some old figurative glass in the lower sections. The whole is united by the tall shafts that sweep unbroken from the floor to their capitals at the spring of the vault. The vault is of plain quadripartite arrangement.\n\nThe choir retains a great many of its original fittings, including the carved stalls, which is made the more surprising by the fact that French Revolutionary troops had desecrated the building. A large stone statue of [[St Christopher]] looks down towards the place where the earlier entrance to the cathedral was, before its completion in the late 19th century.\n\nThe nave has many 19th century stained glass windows. A set of five on the south side, called the ''Bayernfenster'', were a gift from [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], and strongly represent the painterly German style of that date.\n\nExternally, particularly from a distance, the building is dominated by its huge spires, which are entirely Germanic in character, being openwork like those of [[Ulm Minster|Ulm]], [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Vienna]], [[Strasbourg cathedral|Strasbourg]] and [[Regensburg Cathedral]]s.<ref>Wim Swaan,{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Banister Fletcher{{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" widths=\"270px\">\nFile:Cologne cathedral aerial (25326253726).jpg|A \"Bird's eye view\" shows the cruciform plan\nFile:Cologne cathedrale vue sud.jpg|The cathedral from the south\nFile:Koelner-dom-spire.jpg|The exterior of one of the spires\nFile:Cathedral main entrance.jpg|The main entrance shows the 19th century decoration\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"250px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg|The flying buttresses and pinnacles of the Medieval east end\nFile:Koelner Dom Innenraum.jpg|The [[nave]] looking east\nFile:Cologne Cathedral interior.JPG|Interior of the Medieval east end, showing the extreme height\nFile:Koelner dom neue orgel.jpg|This \"swallows' nest\" organ was built into the gallery in 1998, to celebrate the cathedral's 750 years\n</gallery>\n\n== Dimensions ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = Jahrbuch MZK Band 03 - Gew\u00f6lbesystem - Fig 75 Chordurchschnitt des Domes zu C\u00f6ln - S\u00fcdseite.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = 19th century cross-section, south elevation of the choir\n | image2    = Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png\n | width2    = 255\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Groundplan\n }}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:12em\"|External length||align=\"right\"| {{convert|144.58|m|ft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|External width||align=\"right\"| {{convert|86.25|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Width of west fa\u00e7ade||align=\"right\"| {{convert|61.54|m|ft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Width of [[transept]] fa\u00e7ade||align=\"right\"| {{convert|39.95|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Width of [[nave]] (with aisles, interior)||align=\"right\"| {{convert|45.19|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of southern tower||align=\"right\"| {{convert|157.31|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of northern tower||align=\"right\"| {{convert|157.38|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of ridge turret||align=\"right\"| {{convert|109.00|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of transept fa\u00e7ades||align=\"right\"| {{convert|69.95|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Height of roof ridge||align=\"right\"| {{convert|61.10|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Inner height of nave||align=\"right\"| {{convert|43.35|m|ft|abbr=on}}  </tr>\n|Building area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|7914|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Window surface area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|10000|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Roof surface area||align=\"right\"| {{convert|12000|m\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|Gross volume without buttresses||align=\"right\"| {{convert|407000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} </tr>\n|}\n\n== Treasures{{anchor | Treasures of Cologne Cathedral}} ==\nOne of the treasures of the cathedral is the High Altar, which was installed in 1322.

It is traditionally believed to hold the remains of the [[Three Wise Men]], whose relics were acquired by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] at the conquest of Milan in 1164.   The shrine takes the form a large [[reliquary]] in the shape of a basilican church, made of bronze and silver, gilded and ornamented with architectonic details, figurative sculpture, enamels and gemstones.  The shrine was opened in 1864 and was found to contain bones and garments.\n\nNear the [[sacristy]] is the ''[[Gero Crucifix|Gero-Kreuz]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistory.upenn.edu/smr04/101910/Slide11.18.jpg|title=Art History|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]}}</ref> a large crucifix carved in oak and with traces of paint and gilding.

The first was the 3.8-tonne ''Dreik\u00f6nigsglocke'' (\"Bell of the Three Kings\"), cast in 1418, installed in 1437, and recast in 1880. Two of the other bells, the ''Pretiosa'' (10.5&nbsp;tonnes; at that time the largest bell in the [[Western world]]) and the ''Speciosa'' (5.6&nbsp;tonnes) were installed in 1448 and remain in place today.\n\nDuring the 19th century, as the building neared completion, there was a desire to extend the number of bells. This was facilitated by Kaiser Wilhelm I who gave [[French Bronze|French bronze]] cannon, captured in 1870\u201371, for this purpose. The 22 pieces of artillery were displayed outside the Cathedral on 11 May 1872. Andreas Hamm in [[Frankenthal]] used them to cast a bell of over 27,000 kilos on 19 August 1873. The tone was not harmonious and another attempt was made on 13 November 1873. The Central Cathedral Association, which had agreed to take over the costs, did not want this bell either. Another attempt took place on 3 October 1874. The colossal bell was shipped to Cologne and on 13 May 1875, installed in the Cathedral. This ''Kaiserglocke'' was eventually melted in 1918 to support the German war effort. The Kaiserglocke was the largest free-swinging bell in history.\n\nThe 24-tonne ''[[St. Petersglocke]]'' (\"Bell of St. Peter\", \"''{{lang|ksh|Decke Pitter}}''\" in the [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch language]] or in common parlance known as \"''Dicker Pitter''\"), was cast in 1922 and was the largest free-swinging bell in the world, until a new bell was cast in Innsbruck for the People's Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest in Romania.<ref>The [[World Peace Bell]] in [[Newport, Kentucky]] is larger, but turns around its [[center of mass]] rather than its top.</ref>\n\n==== Bells of the ridge turret ====\n* Mettglocke \u2013 280 kilograms\n* Wandlungsglocke \u2013 425 kilograms\n* Angelusglocke \u2013 763 kilograms\n\n==== Bells of the main bell cage in the south spire ====\n* Aveglocke \u2013 830 kilograms\n* Kapitelsglocke \u2013 1.4 tonnes\n* Josephglocke \u2013 2.2 tonnes\n* Ursulaglocke \u2013 2.5 tonnes\n* Dreik\u00f6nigsglocke \u2013 3.8 tonnes\n* Speciosa \u2013 5.6 tonnes\n* Pretiosa \u2013 10.5 tonnes\n* St. Petersglocke, Great Bell of Germany \u2013 24 tonnes\n\n== See also == \n[[File:Kolnerdom-december2015.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1|(video) Cologne Cathedral in 2014]]\n* [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches]]\n* [[Gero Cross]]\n* [[Gothic architecture]]\n* [[Gothic Revival architecture]]\n* [[List of buildings and structures]]\n* [[List of highest church naves]]\n*[[List of cathedrals in Germany]]\n* [[Medievalism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Swaan, Wim and Christopher Brooke, ''The Gothic Cathedral'', Omega Books (1969), {{ISBN|0-907853-48-X}}\n* Fletcher, Banister, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.\n* Hubbard, Howard, ''Masterpieces of Western Sculpture'', Thames and Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-23278-4}}\n* Wolff, Arnold, ''Cologne Cathedral.

Although popular legend credits [[Pope Gregory I]] with inventing Gregorian chant, scholars believe that it arose from a later [[Carolingian]] synthesis of [[Roman chant]] and [[Gallican chant]].\n\nGregorian chants were organized initially into four, then eight, and finally 12 [[musical mode|modes]]. Typical melodic features include a characteristic [[Ambitus (music)|ambitus]], and also characteristic intervallic patterns relative to a referential [[Final (music)|mode final]], [[incipit]]s and [[cadence (music)|cadences]], the use of [[reciting tone]]s at a particular distance from the final, around which the other notes of the melody revolve, and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called [[centonization]] to create families of related chants. The scale patterns are organized against a background pattern formed of conjunct and disjunct [[tetrachord]]s, producing a larger pitch system called the [[Gamut (music)|gamut]]. The chants can be sung by using six-[[Note (music)|note]] patterns called [[hexachord]]s. Gregorian melodies are traditionally written using [[neume]]s, an early form of [[musical notation]] from which the modern [[staff (music)|four-line and five-line staff]] developed.<ref>Development of notation styles is discussed at [http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory2.htm Dolmetsch online], accessed 4&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006</ref> Multi-voice elaborations of Gregorian chant, known as [[organum]], were an early stage in the development of Western [[polyphony]].\n\nGregorian chant was traditionally sung by [[choir]]s of men and boys in churches, or by men and women of [[religious order]]s in their chapels. It is the music of the [[Roman Rite]], performed in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the monastic [[Canonical hours|Office]]. Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, [[Ambrosian chant]] still continues in use in Milan, and there are musicologists exploring both that and the [[Mozarabic chant]] of Christian Spain. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship.<ref name=Catholic>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/v8.html The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Second Vatican Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121220134142/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/v8.html |date=20 December 2012 }}; [[Pope Benedict XVI]]: [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=44963 Catholic World News 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006] both accessed 5&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006</ref> During the 20th century, Gregorian chant underwent a musicological and popular resurgence. Coco is cool\n\n==History==\n\n===Development of earlier plainchant===\nSinging has been part of the Christian [[liturgy]] since the earliest days of the Church. Until the mid-1990s, it was widely accepted that the [[psalms|psalmody]] of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Jewish]] worship significantly influenced and contributed to [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] ritual and chant. This view is no longer generally accepted by scholars, due to analysis that shows that most early Christian hymns did not have Psalms for texts, and that the Psalms were not sung in [[synagogue]]s for centuries after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Destruction of the Second Temple]] in AD&nbsp;70.<ref>David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 484\u20135.</ref> However, early Christian rites did incorporate elements of Jewish worship that survived in later chant tradition. [[Canonical hours]] have their roots in Jewish prayer hours. \"[[Amen]]\" and \"[[alleluia]]\" come from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and the threefold \"[[sanctus]]\" derives from the threefold \"kadosh\" of the [[Kedushah]].<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 34.</ref>\n\nThe [[New Testament]] mentions singing hymns during the [[Last Supper]]: \"When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the [[Mount of Olives]]\" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26.30|NT}}). Other ancient witnesses such as [[Pope Clement I]], [[Tertullian]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]], and [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] confirm the practice,<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 74.</ref> although in poetic or obscure ways that shed little light on how music sounded during this period.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 484\u20137 and James McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 72.</ref> The 3rd-century Greek \"[[Oxyrhynchus hymn]]\" survived with musical notation, but the connection between this hymn and the plainchant tradition is uncertain.<ref>McKinnon, James W.: \"Christian Church, music of the early\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 11&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/ (subscription access)]</ref>\n\nMusical elements that would later be used in the Roman Rite began to appear in the 3rd century. The ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', attributed to the theologian [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], attests the singing of [[Hallel]] psalms with Alleluia as the refrain in early Christian [[agape feast|''agape'' feasts]].<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 486.</ref> Chants of the Office, sung during the canonical hours, have their roots in the early 4th century, when desert monks following [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]] introduced the practice of continuous psalmody, singing the complete cycle of 150 psalms each week. Around 375, [[antiphon]]al psalmody became popular in the Christian East; in 386, [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]] introduced this practice to the West. In the fifth century, a singing school, the Schola Cantorum, was founded at Rome to provide training in church musicianship.<ref>Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', pp. 28</ref>\n\nScholars are still debating how plainchant developed during the 5th through the 9th centuries, as information from this period is scarce. Around 410, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] described the [[responsory|responsorial]] singing of a [[Gradual]] psalm at Mass. At c. 520, [[Benedict of Nursia]] established what is called the rule of St. Benedict, in which the protocol of the Divine Office for monastic use was laid down. Around 678, Roman chant was taught at [[York]].<ref>James McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 320.</ref> Distinctive regional traditions of Western plainchant arose during this period, notably in the British Isles ([[Celtic chant]]), Spain (Mozarabic), Gaul (Gallican), and Italy ([[Old Roman chant|Old Roman]], Ambrosian and [[Beneventan chant|Beneventan]]). These traditions may have evolved from a hypothetical year-round repertory of 5th-century plainchant after the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed.\n\n[[Johannes Hymonides|John the Deacon]], biographer (c. 872) of [[Pope Gregory I]], modestly claimed that the saint \"compiled a patchwork antiphonary\",<ref name=Bewerunge>{{harvnb|Bewerunge|1913}}</ref> unsurprisingly, given his considerable work with liturgical development. He reorganized the Schola Cantorum and established a more uniform standard in church services, gathering chants from among the regional traditions as widely as he could manage. Of those, he retained what he could, revised where necessary, and assigned particular chants to the various services.<ref>Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', pp. 28\u20139</ref> According to [[Donald Jay Grout]], his goal was to organize the bodies of chants from diverse traditions into a uniform and orderly whole for use by the entire western region of the Church.<ref>Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', p. 30</ref> His renowned love for music was recorded only 34 years after his death; the epitaph of Honorius testified that comparison to Gregory was already considered the highest praise for a music-loving pope.<ref name=Bewerunge /> While later legends magnified his real achievements, these significant steps may account for why his name came to be attached to Gregorian chant.\n\n===Origins of mature plainchant===\n[[File:Gregory I - Antiphonary of Hartker of Sankt Gallen.jpg|thumb|right| A dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]] sitting on [[Pope Gregory I]]'s shoulder symbolizes Divine Inspiration]]\nThe Gregorian repertory was further systematized for use in the [[Roman Rite]], and scholars weigh the relative influences of Roman and [[Carolingian]] practices upon the development of plainchant. The late 8th century saw a steadily increasing influence of the Carolingian monarchs over the popes. During a visit to Gaul in 752\u2013753, [[Pope Stephen II]] celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] using Roman chant. According to [[Charlemagne]], his father [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] abolished the local [[Gallican Rite]]s in favor of the Roman use, in order to strengthen ties with Rome.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 79.</ref> Thirty years later (785\u2013786), at Charlemagne's request, [[Pope Adrian I]] sent a papal [[sacramentary]] with Roman chants to the Carolingian court. According to [[James McKinnon]], over a brief period in the 8th century, a project overseen by [[Chrodegang of Metz]] in the favorable atmosphere of the Carolingian monarchs, also compiled the core liturgy of the Roman Mass and promoted its use in [[Franks|Francia]] and throughout Gaul.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Grove Music Online]]|last=Kenneth|first=Levy|display-authors=etal|chapter=Plainchant, \u00a72: History to the 10th century|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Willi Apel]] and Robert Snow assert a scholarly consensus that Gregorian chant developed around 750 from a synthesis of Roman and Gallican chants, and was commissioned by the Carolingian rulers in France. Andreas Pfisterer and Peter Jeffery have shown that older melodic essentials from Roman chant are clear in the synthesized chant repertory. There were other developments as well. Chants were modified, influenced by local styles and Gallican chant, and fitted into the theory of the ancient Greek [[octoechos]] system of modes in a manner that created what later came to be known as the western system of the eight [[musical mode|church modes]]. The Metz project also invented an innovative [[musical notation]], using freeform [[neume]]s to show the shape of a remembered melody.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Grier | first1 = J | year = 2003 | title = Ademar de Chabannes, Carolingian Musical Practices, and Nota Romana | url = | journal = Journal of the American Musicological Society | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 43\u201398 | doi = 10.1525/jams.2003.56.1.43 }}</ref> This notation was further developed over time, culminating in the introduction of [[Staff (music)|staff]] lines (attributed to [[Guido d'Arezzo]]) in the early 11th century, what we know today as plainchant notation. The whole body of Frankish-Roman Carolingian chant, augmented with new chants to complete the liturgical year, coalesced into a single body of chant that was called \"Gregorian.\"\n\nThe changes made in the new system of chants were so significant that they have led some scholars to speculate that it was named in honor of the contemporary [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 114.</ref> Nevertheless, the lore surrounding [[Pope Gregory I]] was sufficient to culminate in his portrayal as the actual author of Gregorian Chant. He was often depicted as receiving the dictation of plainchant from a dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]], thus giving Gregorian chant the stamp of being divinely inspired. Scholars agree that the melodic content of much Gregorian Chant did not exist in that form in Gregory I's day. In addition, it is known definitively that the familiar neumatic system for notating plainchant had not been established in his time.<ref>Taruskin, Richard ''The Oxford History of Western Music, Volume I \u2013 Music from the earliest notations to the 16th century'' Chapter 1, the curtain goes up, page 6. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010)</ref> Nevertheless, Gregory's authorship is popularly accepted by some as fact to this day.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Dissemination and hegemony===\nGregorian chant appeared in a remarkably uniform state across Europe within a short time. [[Charlemagne]], once elevated to [[Holy Roman Emperor]], aggressively spread Gregorian chant throughout his empire to consolidate religious and secular power, requiring the clergy to use the new repertory on pain of death.<ref>David Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 10.</ref> From English and German sources, Gregorian chant spread north to [[Scandinavia]], [[Iceland]] and [[Finland]].<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 604.</ref> In 885, [[Pope Stephen V]] banned the [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]] liturgy, leading to the ascendancy of Gregorian chant in Eastern Catholic lands including [[Poland]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].\n\nThe other plainchant repertories of the Christian West faced severe competition from the new Gregorian chant. Charlemagne continued his father's policy of favoring the Roman Rite over the local Gallican traditions. By the 9th century the Gallican rite and chant had effectively been eliminated, although not without local resistance.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 80.</ref> The Gregorian chant of the [[Sarum Rite]] displaced [[Celtic chant]]. Gregorian coexisted with Beneventan chant for over a century before Beneventan chant was abolished by papal decree (1058). Mozarabic chant survived the influx of the [[Visigoths]] and [[Moors]], but not the Roman-backed prelates newly installed in Spain during the [[Reconquista]]. Restricted to a handful of dedicated chapels, modern Mozarabic chant is highly Gregorianized and bears no musical resemblance to its original form. Ambrosian chant alone survived to the present day, preserved in [[Milan]] due to the musical reputation and ecclesiastical authority of [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]].\n\nGregorian chant eventually replaced the local chant tradition of Rome itself, which is now known as Old Roman chant. In the 10th century, virtually no musical manuscripts were being notated in Italy. Instead, Roman Popes imported Gregorian chant from (German) Holy Roman Emperors during the 10th and 11th centuries. For example, the [[Credo]] was added to the [[Roman Rite]] at the behest of the Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] in 1014.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 47.</ref> Reinforced by the legend of Pope Gregory, Gregorian chant was taken to be the authentic, original chant of Rome, a misconception that continues to this day. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had supplanted or marginalized all the other Western plainchant traditions.\n\nLater sources of these other chant traditions show an increasing Gregorian influence, such as occasional efforts to categorize their chants into the Gregorian [[musical mode|modes]]. Similarly, the Gregorian repertory incorporated elements of these lost plainchant traditions, which can be identified by careful stylistic and historical analysis. For example, the ''[[Improperia]]'' of [[Good Friday]] are believed to be a remnant of the Gallican repertory.<ref>Carl Parrish, \"A Treasury of Early Music\" pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\n===Early sources and later revisions===\n[[File:Ad te levavi trimmed.jpg|thumb|right|Two plainchants from the Mass Proper, written in adiastematic neumes, from {{ill|Codex Sangallensis 359|de|italic=yes}}]]\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Gradual chant - Universi qui te expectant.ogg|title=''Universi qui te expectant'', Gradual for the Mass (first Sunday of Advent)|description=This chant corresponds to the second one on the manuscript folio above beneath the large rubric ''Responsorium Graduale''; by [[Schola Antiqua of Chicago]].}}\nThe first extant sources with musical notation were written around 930 (Graduale Laon). Before this, plainchant had been transmitted orally. Most scholars of Gregorian chant agree that the development of music notation assisted the dissemination of chant across Europe. The earlier notated manuscripts are primarily from [[Regensburg]] in Germany, [[Abbey of Saint Gall|St. Gall]] in Switzerland, [[Laon]] and [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|St. Martial]] in France.\n\nGregorian chant has in its long history been subjected to a series of redactions to bring it up to changing contemporary tastes and practice. The more recent redaction undertaken in the Benedictine Abbey of St. Pierre, Solesmes, has turned into a huge undertaking to restore the allegedly corrupted chant to a hypothetical \"original\" state. Early Gregorian chant was revised to conform to the theoretical structure of the [[musical mode|modes]]. In 1562\u201363, the [[Council of Trent]] banned most [[sequence (poetry)|sequences]]. Guidette's ''Directorium chori'', published in 1582, and the ''Editio medicea'', published in 1614, drastically revised what was perceived as corrupt and flawed \"barbarism\" by making the chants conform to contemporary aesthetic standards.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 288\u2013289.</ref> In 1811, the French musicologist [[Alexandre-\u00c9tienne Choron]], as part of a conservative backlash following the liberal Catholic orders' inefficacy during the [[French Revolution]], called for returning to the \"purer\" Gregorian chant of Rome over French corruptions.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 622.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, early liturgical and musical manuscripts were unearthed and edited. Earlier, Dom [[Prosper Gu\u00e9ranger]] revived the monastic tradition in Solesmes. Re-establishing the Divine Office was among his priorities, but no proper chantbooks existed. Many monks were sent out to libraries throughout Europe to find relevant Chant manuscripts. In 1871, however, the old Medicea edition was reprinted ([[Pustet]], Regensburg) which [[Pope Pius IX]] declared the only official version. In their firm belief that they were on the right way, Solesmes increased its efforts. In 1889, after decades of research, the monks of [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]] released the first book in a planned series, the Pal\u00e9ographie Musicale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/palographiemusic15macq|title=Pal\u00e9ographie musicale : fac-simil\u00e9s phototypiques des principaux manuscrits de chant gr\u00e9gorien, ambrosien, mozarabe, gallican|work=Internet Archive}}</ref> The incentive of its publication was to demonstrate the corruption of the 'Medicea' by presenting photographed notations originating from a great variety of manuscripts of one single chant, which Solesmes called forth as witnesses to assert their own reforms.\n\nThe monks of Solesmes brought in their heaviest artillery in this battle, as indeed the academically sound 'Paleo' was intended to be a war-tank, meant to abolish once and for all the corrupted Pustet edition. On the evidence of congruence throughout various manuscripts (which were duly published in [[facsimile]] editions with ample editorial introductions) Solesmes was able to work out a practical reconstruction. This reconstructed chant was academically praised, but rejected by Rome until 1903, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] died. His successor, [[Pope Pius X]], promptly accepted the Solesmes chant \u2013 now compiled as the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'' \u2013 as authoritative. In 1904, the Vatican edition of the Solesmes chant was commissioned. Serious academic debates arose, primarily owing to stylistic liberties taken by the Solesmes editors to impose their controversial interpretation of rhythm. The Solesmes editions insert [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] marks and note-lengthening ''episema'' and ''mora'' marks not found in the original sources.\n\nConversely, they omit significative letters found in the original sources, which give instructions for rhythm and articulation such as speeding up or slowing down. These editorial practices have placed the historical authenticity of the Solesmes interpretation in doubt.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 624\u2013627.</ref> Ever since restoration of Chant was taken up in Solesmes, there have been lengthy discussions of exactly what course was to be taken. Some favored a strict academic rigour and wanted to postpone publications, while others concentrated on practical matters and wanted to supplant the corrupted tradition as soon as possible. Roughly a century later, there still exists a breach between a strict musicological approach and the practical needs of church choirs. Thus the performance tradition officially promulgated since the onset of the Solesmes restoration is substantially at odds with musicological evidence.\n\nIn his [[motu proprio]] ''[[Tra le sollecitudini]]'', Pius X mandated the use of Gregorian chant, encouraging the faithful to sing the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], although he reserved the singing of the [[proper (liturgy)|Propers]] for males. While this custom is maintained in [[traditionalist Catholic]] communities (most of which allow all-female scholas as well, though), the Catholic Church no longer persists with this ban. [[Vatican II]] officially allowed worshipers to substitute other music, particularly sacred polyphony, in place of Gregorian chant, although it did reaffirm that Gregorian chant was still the official music of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and the music most suitable for worship in the Roman Liturgy.<ref name=Catholic/>\n\n==Musical form==\n\n===Melodic types===\nGregorian chant is, as 'chant' implies, vocal music. The text, the phrases, words and eventually the syllables, can be sung in various ways. The most straightforward is recitation on the same tone, which is called \"syllabic\" as each syllable is sung to a single tone. Likewise, simple chants are often syllabic throughout with only a few instances where two or more notes are sung on one syllable. \"Neumatic\" chants are more embellished and [[ligature (music)|ligatures]], a connected group of notes, written as a single compound neume, abound in the text. [[Melisma]]tic chants are the most ornate chants in which elaborate melodies are sung on long sustained vowels as in the Alleluia, ranging from five or six notes per syllable to over sixty in the more prolix melismata.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' pp. 85\u201388.</ref>\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day.ogg|title=Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day|description=Example of liturgical recitative in Gregorian chant}}\nGregorian chants fall into two broad categories of melody: [[recitative]]s and free melodies.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 203</ref> The simplest kind of melody is the liturgical recitative. Recitative melodies are dominated by a single pitch, called the ''[[reciting tone]]''. Other pitches appear in melodic formulae for [[incipit]]s, partial [[cadence (music)|cadences]], and full cadences. These chants are primarily syllabic. For example, the [[Collect]] for [[Easter]] consists of 127 syllables sung to 131 pitches, with 108 of these pitches being the reciting note A and the other 23 pitches flexing down to G.<ref>Hoppin, ''Anthology of Medieval Music'' p. 11.</ref> Liturgical recitatives are commonly found in the [[Accentus Ecclesiasticus|accentus]] chants of the liturgy, such as the intonations of the Collect, [[Epistle]], and [[Gospel]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and in the direct [[psalmody]] of the [[Canonical hours|Office]].\n\nPsalmodic chants, which intone [[psalms]], include both recitatives and free melodies. Psalmodic chants include ''direct psalmody'', ''antiphonal chants'', and ''responsorial chants''.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 81.</ref> In direct psalmody, psalm verses are sung without refrains to simple, formulaic tones. Most psalmodic chants are antiphonal and responsorial, sung to free melodies of varying complexity.\n\n[[File:Evora06.jpg|thumb|Antiphonary with Gregorian chants]]\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Loquetur Dominus.ogg|title=''Loquetur Dominus'', Introit for Week XXXIV of Ordinary Time|description=Example of antiphonal psalmody in Gregorian chant\n|filename2=De profundis.ogg|title2=''De profundis'', tract for the Requiem Mass|description2=Example of responsorial psalmody in Gregorian chant}}\nAntiphonal chants such as the [[Introit]], and [[Communion (chant)|Communion]] originally referred to chants in which two choirs sang in alternation, one choir singing verses of a psalm, the other singing a refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''. Over time, the verses were reduced in number, usually to just one psalm verse and the [[doxology]], or even omitted entirely. Antiphonal chants reflect their ancient origins as elaborate recitatives through the reciting tones in their melodies. Ordinary chants, such as the [[Kyrie]] and [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]], are not considered antiphonal chants, although they are often performed in antiphonal style.\n\nResponsorial chants such as the [[Gradual]], [[Alleluia]], [[Offertory]], and the Office Responsories originally consisted of a refrain called a ''respond'' sung by a choir, alternating with psalm verses sung by a soloist. [[Responsory|Responsorial]] chants are often composed of an amalgamation of various stock musical phrases, pieced together in a practice called ''[[centonization]]''. Tracts are melismatic settings of psalm verses and use frequent recurring cadences and they are strongly centonized.\n\nGregorian chant evolved to fulfill various functions in the Roman Catholic liturgy. Broadly speaking, liturgical recitatives are used for texts intoned by deacons or priests. Antiphonal chants accompany liturgical actions: the entrance of the officiant, the collection of offerings, and the distribution of sanctified bread and wine. Responsorial chants expand on readings and lessons.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 123.</ref>\n\nThe non-psalmodic chants, including the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], [[Sequence (poetry)|sequences]], and [[hymn]]s, were originally intended for congregational singing.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 131.</ref> The structure of their texts largely defines their musical style. In sequences, the same melodic phrase is repeated in each couplet. The strophic texts of hymns use the same syllabic melody for each stanza.\n\n===Modality===\n{{Main|Musical mode}}\nEarly plainchant, like much of Western music, is believed to have been distinguished by the use of the [[diatonic scale]]. Modal theory, which postdates the composition of the core chant repertory, arises from a synthesis of two very different traditions: the speculative tradition of numerical ratios and species inherited from ancient Greece and a second tradition rooted in the practical art of cantus. The earliest writings that deal with both theory and practice include the [[Musica enchiriadis|Enchiriadis]] group of treatises, which circulated in the late ninth century and possibly have their roots in an earlier, oral tradition. In contrast to the ancient Greek system of tetrachords (a collection of four continuous notes) that descend by two tones and a semitone, the Enchiriadis writings base their tone-system on a tetrachord that corresponds to the four finals of chant, D, E, F, and G. The disjunct tetrachords in the Enchiriadis system have been the subject of much speculation, because they do not correspond to the diatonic framework that became the standard Medieval scale (for example, there is a high F#, a note not recognized by later Medieval writers). A diatonic scale with a chromatically alterable b/b-flat was first described by [[Hucbald]], who adopted the tetrachord of the finals (D, E, F, G) and constructed the rest of the system following the model of the Greek Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems. These were the first steps in forging a theoretical tradition that corresponded to chant.\n\nAround 1025, [[Guido d'Arezzo]] revolutionized Western music with the development of the ''gamut'', in which pitches in the singing range were organized into overlapping [[hexachord]]s. Hexachords could be built on C (the natural hexachord, C-D-E^F-G-A), F (the soft hexachord, using a B-flat, F-G-A^Bb-C-D), or G (the hard hexachord, using a B-natural, G-A-B^C-D-E). The B-flat was an integral part of the system of hexachords rather than an [[accidental (music)|accidental]]. The use of notes outside of this collection was described as [[musica ficta]].\n\nGregorian chant was categorized into eight [[musical mode|modes]], influenced by the eightfold division of Byzantine chants called the ''[[oktoechos]]''.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 11.</ref> Each mode is distinguished by its ''final'', ''dominant'', and ''ambitus''. The ''final'' is the ending note, which is usually an important note in the overall structure of the melody. The ''dominant'' is a secondary pitch that usually serves as a [[reciting tone]] in the melody. ''[[Ambitus (music)|Ambitus]]'' refers to the range of pitches used in the melody. Melodies whose final is in the middle of the ambitus, or which have only a limited ambitus, are categorized as ''plagal'', while melodies whose final is in the lower end of the ambitus and have a range of over five or six notes are categorized as ''authentic''. Although corresponding plagal and authentic modes have the same final, they have different dominants.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' pp. 64\u20135.</ref> The existent pseudo-Greek names of the modes, rarely used in medieval times, derive from a misunderstanding of the Ancient Greek modes; the prefix \"[[wikt:hypo-|hypo-]]\" (under, Gr.) indicates a plagal mode, where the melody moves below the final. In contemporary Latin manuscripts the modes are simply called Protus authentus /plagalis, Deuterus, Tritus and Tetrardus: the 1st mode, authentic or plagal, the 2nd mode etc. In the Roman Chantbooks the modes are indicated by Roman numerals.\n\n:Modes 1 and 2 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on D, sometimes called [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and [[Hypodorian mode|Hypodorian]].\n:Modes 3 and 4 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on E, sometimes called [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]] and [[Hypophrygian mode|Hypophrygian]].\n:Modes 5 and 6 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on F, sometimes called [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] and [[Hypolydian mode|Hypolydian]].\n:Modes 7 and 8 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on G, sometimes called [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] and [[Hypomixolydian mode|Hypomixolydian]].\n\nAlthough the modes with melodies ending on A, B, and C are sometimes referred to as [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]], [[Locrian mode|Locrian]], and [[Ionian mode|Ionian]], these are not considered distinct modes and are treated as [[Transposition (music)|transpositions]] of whichever mode uses the same set of hexachords. The actual pitch of the Gregorian chant is not fixed, so the piece can be sung in whichever range is most comfortable.\n\nCertain classes of Gregorian chant have a separate musical formula for each mode, allowing one section of the chant to transition smoothly into the next section, such as the [[psalm verse]]s that are sung between the repetition of antiphons, or the Gloria Patri. Thus we find models for the recitation of psalmverses, Alleluia and Gloria Patri for all eight modes.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 82.</ref>\n\nNot every Gregorian chant fits neatly into Guido's hexachords or into the system of eight modes. For example, there are chants \u2014 especially from German sources \u2013 whose [[neume]]s suggest a warbling of pitches between the notes E and F, outside the hexachord system, or in other words, employing a form of chromatism.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 22.</ref> Early Gregorian chant, like Ambrosian and Old Roman chant, whose melodies are most closely related to Gregorian, did not use the modal system.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 166\u201378, and Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 454.</ref> The great need for a system of organizing chants lies in the need to link antiphons with standard tones, as in for example, the psalmody at the Office. Using Psalm Tone i with an antiphon in Mode 1 makes for a smooth transition between the end of the antiphon and the intonation of the tone, and the ending of the tone can then be chosen to provide a smooth transition back to the antiphon. As the modal system gained acceptance, Gregorian chants were edited to conform to the modes, especially during 12th-century [[Cistercian]] reforms. Finals were altered, melodic ranges reduced, melismata trimmed, B-flats eliminated, and repeated words removed.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 608\u201310.</ref> Despite these attempts to impose modal consistency, some chants \u2014 notably Communions \u2014 defy simple modal assignment. For example, in four medieval manuscripts, the Communion ''Circuibo'' was transcribed using a different mode in each.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 171\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Musical idiom===\nSeveral features besides modality contribute to the musical idiom of Gregorian chant, giving it a distinctive musical flavor. Melodic motion is primarily [[steps and skips|stepwise]]. Skips of a third are common, and larger skips far more common than in other plainchant repertories such as Ambrosian chant or Beneventan chant. Gregorian melodies are more likely to traverse a seventh than a full octave, so that melodies rarely travel from D up to the D an octave higher, but often travel from D to the C a seventh higher, using such patterns as D-F-G-A-C.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 256\u20137.</ref> Gregorian melodies often explore chains of pitches, such as F-A-C, around which the other notes of the chant gravitate.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 21.</ref> Within each mode, certain incipits and cadences are preferred, which the modal theory alone does not explain. Chants often display complex internal structures that combine and repeat musical subphrases. This occurs notably in the [[Offertory|Offertories]]; in chants with shorter, repeating texts such as the [[Kyrie]] and [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; and in longer chants with clear textual divisions such as the Great Responsories, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], and the [[Credo]].<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 258\u20139.</ref>\n\nChants sometimes fall into melodically related groups. The musical phrases [[centonization|centonized]] to create [[Gradual]]s and [[Tract (liturgy)|Tracts]] follow a musical \"grammar\" of sorts. Certain phrases are used only at the beginnings of chants, or only at the end, or only in certain combinations, creating musical families of chants such as the ''[[Iustus ut palma]]'' family of Graduals.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 344\u201363.</ref> Several [[Introit]]s in mode 3, including ''Loquetur Dominus'' above, exhibit melodic similarities. Mode III (E authentic) chants have C as a dominant, so C is the expected reciting tone. These mode III Introits, however, use both G and C as reciting tones, and often begin with a decorated leap from G to C to establish this tonality.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 110\u2013113.</ref> Similar examples exist throughout the repertory.\n\n===Notation===\n[[File:Neume2.jpg|thumb|Offertory ''Iubilate deo universa terra'' in unheightened neume]]\n\nThe earliest notated sources of Gregorian chant (written ca. 950) used symbols called ''[[neume]]s'' (Gr. sign, of the hand) to indicate tone-movements and relative duration within each syllable. A sort of musical stenography that seems to focus on gestures and tone-movements but not the specific pitches of individual notes, nor the relative starting pitches of each neume. Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this was obviously not necessary. The neumatic manuscripts display great sophistication and precision in notation and a wealth of graphic signs to indicate the musical gesture and proper pronunciation of the text.\nScholars postulate that this practice may have been derived from [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures, the [[ekphonetic]] notation of [[Byzantine chant]], punctuation marks, or diacritical accents.<ref>Levy, Kenneth: \"Plainchant\", ''Grove Music Online'', ed. L. Macy (Accessed 20&nbsp;January&nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.40099.2.3#music.40099.2.3 (subscription access)]</ref> Later adaptations and innovations included the use of a dry-scratched line or an inked line or two lines, marked C or F showing the relative pitches between neumes. Consistent relative heightening first developed in the Aquitaine region, particularly at [[Saint Martial|St. Martial de Limoges]], in the first half of the eleventh century. Many German-speaking areas, however, continued to use unpitched neumes into the twelfth century. Additional symbols developed, such as the ''custos'', placed at the end of a system to show the next pitch. Other symbols indicated changes in articulation, duration, or tempo, such as a letter \"t\" to indicate a [[tenuto]]. Another form of early notation used a system of letters corresponding to different pitches, much as [[Shaker music]] is notated.\n\n[[File:gregorian chant.gif|frame|''Liber usualis'' in square notation (excerpt from the ''Kyrie eleison (Orbis factor)'')]]\nBy the 13th century, the neumes of Gregorian chant were usually written in ''square notation'' on a four-line staff with a clef, as in the ''Graduale Aboense'' pictured above. In square notation, small groups of ascending notes on a syllable are shown as stacked squares, read from bottom to top, while descending notes are written with diamonds read from left to right. When a syllable has a large number of notes, a series of smaller such groups of neumes are written in succession, read from left to right. The oriscus, quilisma, and liquescent neumes indicate special vocal treatments, that have been largely neglected due to uncertainty as to how to sing them. Since the 1970s, with the influential insights of Dom [[Eug\u00e8ne Cardine]] (see below under 'rhythm'), ornamental neumes have received more attention from both researchers and performers.\nB-flat is indicated by a \"b-mollum\" (Lat. soft), a rounded undercaste 'b' placed to the left of the entire neume in which the note occurs, as shown in the \"Kyrie\" to the right. When necessary, a \"b-durum\" (Lat. hard), written squarely, indicates B-natural and serves to cancel the b-mollum. This system of square notation is standard in modern chantbooks.\n\n==Performance==\n\n===Texture===\nGregorian chant was originally used for singing the [[Canonical hours|Office]] (by male and female religious) and for singing the parts of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] pertaining to the lay faithful (male and female), the celebrant (priest, always male) and the choir (composed of male ordained clergy, except in convents). Outside the larger cities, the number of available clergy dropped, and lay men started singing these parts. The choir was considered an official liturgical duty reserved to clergy, so women were not allowed to sing in the ''[[Schola Cantorum (disambiguation)|Schola Cantorum]]'' or other choirs except in [[convent]]s where women were permitted to sing the Office and the parts of the Mass pertaining to the choir as a function of their consecrated life.<ref>Carol Neuls-Bates, ''Women in Music'' p. 3.</ref>\n\nChant was normally sung in unison. Later innovations included ''[[Trope (music)|tropes]]'', which is a new text sung to the same melodic phrases in a melismatic chant (repeating an entire Alleluia-melody on a new text for instance, or repeating a full phrase with a new text that comments on the previously sung text) and various forms of ''[[organum]]'', (improvised) harmonic embellishment of chant melodies focusing on octaves, fifths, fourths, and, later, thirds. Neither tropes nor organum, however, belong to the chant repertory proper. The main exception to this is the sequence, whose origins lay in troping the extended [[melisma]] of [[Alleluia]] chants known as the [[jubilus]], but the sequences, like the tropes, were later officially suppressed. The [[Council of Trent]] struck sequences from the Gregorian corpus, except those for [[Easter]], [[Pentecost]], [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] and [[All Souls' Day]].\n\nNot much is known about the particular vocal stylings or performance practices used for Gregorian chant in the Middle Ages. On occasion, the clergy was urged to have their singers perform with more restraint and piety. This suggests that virtuosic performances occurred, contrary to the modern stereotype of Gregorian chant as slow-moving mood music. This tension between musicality and piety goes far back; [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] himself criticized the practice of promoting clerics based on their charming singing rather than their preaching.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 504.</ref> However, [[Odo of Cluny]], a renowned monastic reformer, praised the intellectual and musical virtuosity to be found in chant:\n\n{{quote|For in these [Offertories and Communions] there are the most varied kinds of ascent, descent, repeat..., delight for the ''cognoscenti'', difficulty for the beginners, and an admirable organization... that widely differs from other chants; they are not so much made according to the rules of music... but rather evince the authority and validity... of music.<ref>Apel, p. 312.</ref>}}\n\nTrue antiphonal performance by two alternating choruses still occurs, as in certain German monasteries. However, antiphonal chants are generally performed in responsorial style by a solo cantor alternating with a chorus. This practice appears to have begun in the Middle Ages.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 197.</ref> Another medieval innovation had the solo cantor sing the opening words of responsorial chants, with the full chorus finishing the end of the opening phrase. This innovation allowed the soloist to fix the pitch of the chant for the chorus and to cue the choral entrance.\n\n===Rhythm===\nGiven the oral teaching tradition of Gregorian chant, modern reconstruction of intended rhythm from the written notation of Gregorian chant has always been a source of debate among modern scholars. To complicate matters further, many ornamental neumes used in the earliest manuscripts pose difficulties on the interpretation of rhythm. Certain neumes such as the ''pressus'', pes quassus, strophic neumes may indicate repeated notes, lengthening by repercussion, in some cases with added ornaments. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, most chant was sung with an approximately equal duration allotted to each note, although [[Jerome of Moravia]] cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened.<ref>Hiley, \"Chant\", ''Performance Practice: Music before 1600'' p. 44. \"The performance of chant in equal note lengths from the 13th century onwards is well supported by contemporary statements.\"</ref>\n\nWhile the standard repertory of Gregorian Chant was partly being supplanted with new forms of polyphony, the earlier melo-rhythmic refinements of monophonic chant seem to fall into disuse. Later redactions such as the ''Editio medicaea'' of 1614 rewrote chant so that melismata, with their melodic accent, fell on accented syllables.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 289.</ref> This aesthetic held sway until the re-examination of chant in the late 19th century by such scholars as Wagner, [[Joseph Pothier|Pothier]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Mocquereau|Mocquereau]], who fell into two camps.\n\nOne school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, advocated imposing rhythmic meters on chants, although they disagreed on how that should be done. An opposing interpretation, represented by Pothier and Mocquereau, supported a free rhythm of equal note values, although some notes are lengthened for textual emphasis or musical effect. The modern Solesmes editions of Gregorian chant follow this interpretation. Mocquereau divided melodies into two- and three-note phrases, each beginning with an ''ictus'', akin to a beat, notated in chantbooks as a small vertical mark. These basic melodic units combined into larger phrases through a complex system expressed by [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 127.</ref> This approach prevailed during the twentieth century, propagated by [[Justine Ward]]'s program of music education for children, until the liturgical role of chant was diminished after the liturgical reforms of [[Paul VI]], and new scholarship \"essentially discredited\" Mocquereau's rhythmic theories.<ref>Dyer, Joseph: \"Roman Catholic Church Music\", Section VI.1, [http://www.grovemusic.com/ Grove Music Online] ed. L. Macy (Accessed 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006), (subscription access)</ref>\n\nCommon modern practice favors performing Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, largely for aesthetic reasons.<ref>William P. Mahrt, \"Chant\", ''A Performer's Guide to Medieval Music'' p. 18.</ref> The text determines the accent while the melodic contour determines the [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]]. The note lengthenings recommended by the Solesmes school remain influential, though not prescriptive.\n\nDom Eugene Cardine, (1905\u20131988) monk from Solesmes, published his 'Semiologie Gregorienne' in 1970 in which he clearly explains the musical significance of the neumes of the early chant manuscripts. Cardine shows the great diversity of neumes and graphic variations of the basic shape of a particular neume, which can not be expressed in the square notation. This variety in notation must have served a practical purpose and therefore a musical significance. Nine years later, the ''Graduale Triplex'' was published, in which the Roman Gradual, containing all the chants for Mass in a Year's cycle, appeared with the neumes of the two most important manuscripts copied under and over the 4-line staff of the square notation. The ''Graduale Triplex'' made widely accessible the original notation of Sankt Gallen and Laon (compiled after 930 AD) in a single chantbook and was a huge step forward. Dom Cardine had many students who have each in their own way continued their semiological studies, some of whom also started experimenting in applying the newly understood principles in performance practice.\n\nThe studies of Cardine and his students (Godehard Joppich, Luigi Augustoni, Johannes B. G\u00f6schl, Marie-No\u00ebl Colette, Rupert Fischer, Marie-Claire Billecocq, [[Alexander M. Schweitzer]] to name a few) have clearly demonstrated that rhythm in Gregorian chant as notated in the 10th century rhythmic manuscripts (notably Sankt Gallen and Laon) manifest such rhythmic diversity and melodic \u2013 rhythmic ornamentations for which there is hardly a living performance tradition in the Western world. Contemporary groups that endeavour to sing according to the manuscript traditions have evolved after 1975. Some practising researchers favour a closer look at non Western (liturgical) traditions, in such cultures where the tradition of modal monophony was never abandoned.\n\nAnother group with different views are the mensuralists or the proportionalists, who maintain that rhythm has to be interpreted proportionately, where shorts are exactly half the longs. This school of interpretation claims the support of historical authorities such as St Augustine, Remigius, Guido and Aribo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calumcille.com/griogair/9A14.html |title=The symbolism of chant rhythm |publisher=Calumcille.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315074741/http://www.calumcille.com/griogair/9A14.html |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df= }}</ref> This view is advocated by John Blackley and his 'Schola Antiqua New York'.\n\nRecent research in the Netherlands by Dr. Dirk van Kampen has indicated that the authentic rhythm of Gregorian chant in the 10th century includes both proportional elements and elements that are in agreement with semiology.<ref>Dirk van Kampen (1994). ''Het oorspronkelijke ritme van het Gregoriaans: Een 'semiologisch-mensuralistische' studie''. Landsmeer, {{ISBN|90-900742-8-7}}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Kampen | first1 = Dirk | year = 2005 | title = Uitgangspunten voor de ritmiek van Gregoriaans | url = | journal = Tijdschrift voor Gregoriaans | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 89\u201394 }}</ref> Starting with the expectation that the rhythm of Gregorian chant (and thus the duration of the individual notes) anyway adds to the expressivity of the sacred Latin texts, several word-related variables were studied for their relationship with several neume-related variables, exploring these relationships in a sample of introit chants using such statistical methods as correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis.\n\nBeside the length of the syllables (measured in tenths of seconds), each text syllable was evaluated in terms of its position within the word to which it belongs, defining such variables as \"the syllable has or has not the main accent\", \"the syllable is or is not at the end of a word\", etc., and in terms of the particular sounds produced (for instance, the syllable contains the vowel \"i\"). The various neume elements were evaluated by attaching different duration values to them, both in terms of semiological propositions (nuanced durations according to the manner of neume writing in Chris Hakkennes' ''Graduale Lagal''<ref>Chris Hakkennes (1984). ''Graduale Lagal''. Den Haag: Stichting Centrum voor de Kerkzang.</ref>), and in terms of fixed duration values that were based on mensuralistic notions, however with ratios between short and long notes ranging from 1 : 1, via 1 : 1.2, 1 : 1.4, etc. to 1 : 3. To distinguish short and long notes, tables were consulted that were established by Van Kampen in an unpublished comparative study regarding the neume notations according to Sankt Gallen and Laon codices. With some exceptions, these tables confirm the short vs. long distinctions in Cardine's 'Semiologie Gregorienne'.\n\nThe lengths of the neumes were given values by adding up the duration values for the separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed in relation to the total duration of the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (''R'') between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (''R'' is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.\n\nThe distinction between the first two rules and the latter rule can also be found in early treatises on music, introducing the terms ''metrum'' and ''rhythmus''.<ref>Peter Wagner (1916).

Reese (1940). ''Music in the Middle Ages''. New York: Norton & Comp., p. 166.</ref> the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences between the individual notes of a neume).\n\nDuring the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries in France, the system of rhythmic notation became standardized, with printers and editors of chant books employing only four rhythmic values. Recent research by Christopher Holman indicates that chants whose texts are in a regular meter could even be altered to be performed in [[Time signature]]<nowiki/>s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holman|first=Christopher|date=November 2017|title=Rhythm and metre in French Classical plainchant|url=https://academic.oup.com/em/article-abstract/45/4/657/4781684|journal=Early Music|volume=45, vol. 4|pages=657\u2013664|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Melodic restitution===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}\nRecent developments involve an intensifying of the semiological approach according to Dom Cardine, which also gave a new impetus to the research into melodic variants in various manuscripts of chant. On the basis of this ongoing research it has become obvious that the Graduale and other chantbooks contain many melodic errors, some very consistently, (the mis-interpretation of third and eighth mode) necessitating a new edition of the Graduale according to state-of-the-art [[melodic restitution]]s. Since the 1970 a melodic restitution group of AISCGre (International Society for the Study of Gregorian Chant) has worked on an \"editio magis critica\" as requested by the 2. Vatican Council Constitution \"Sacrosanctum Concilium\". As a response to this need and following the Holy See's invitation to edit a more critical edition, in 2011 the first volume \"De Dominicis et Festis\" of the ''Graduale Novum Editio Magis Critica Iuxta SC 117'' was published by Libreria Editrice Vatican and ConBrio Verlagsgesellschaft, Regensburg.\n\nIn this approach the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry a wealth of melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison between the two groups has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the ''Graduale Triplex''. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Sankt Gallen.\n\nReferring to these manuscripts, he called his own transcription Gradual Lagal. Furthermore, while making the transcription, he cross-checked with the melodic manuscripts to correct modal errors or other melodic errors found in the Graduale Romanum. His intention was to provide a corrected melody in rhythmic notation but above all \u2013 he was also a choirmaster \u2013 suited for practical use, therefore a simplex, integrated notation. Although fully admitting the importance of Hakkennes' melodic revisions, the rhythmical solution suggested in the ''Graduale Lagal'' was actually found by Van Kampen (see above) to be rather modestly related to the text of the chant.\n\n==Liturgical functions==\nGregorian chant is sung in the Office during the [[canonical hours]] and in the liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Texts known as ''[[Accentus Ecclesiasticus|accentus]]'' are intoned by bishops, priests, and deacons, mostly on a single [[reciting tone]] with simple melodic formulae at certain places in each sentence. More complex chants are sung by trained soloists and choirs. The [[Graduale Romanum]] contains the proper chants of the Mass (i.e., Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Offertory, Communion) and the complete [[Kyriale]] (the collection of Mass Ordinary settings).  The ''[[Liber usualis]]'' contains the chants for the [[Graduale Romanum]] and the most commonly used Office chants.\n\n===Proper chants of the Mass===\nThe Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Sequence, Offertory and Communion chants are part of the [[Proper (liturgy)|Proper]] of the Mass. \"Proprium Missae\" in Latin refers to the chants of the Mass that have their proper individual texts for each Sunday throughout the annual cycle, as opposed to 'Ordinarium Missae' which have fixed texts (but various melodies) (Kyrie, Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei).\n\n[[Introit]]s cover the procession of the officiants. Introits are antiphonal chants, typically consisting of an antiphon, a psalm verse, a repeat of the antiphon, an intonation of the Gloria Patri [[Doxology]], and a final repeat of the antiphon. [[Reciting tone]]s often dominate their melodic structures.\n\n[[Gradual]]s are responsorial chants that follow the reading of the [[Epistle]]. Graduals usually result from ''[[centonization]]''; stock musical phrases are assembled like a patchwork to create the full melody of the chant, creating families of musically related melodies. Graduals are accompanied by an elaborate Verse, so that it actually consists in two different parts, A B. Often the first part is sung again, creating a 'rondeau' A B A. At least the verse, if not the complete gradual, is for the solo cantor and are in elaborate, ornate style with long, wide-ranged melismata.\n\nThe [[Alleluia]] is known for the ''[[jubilus]]'', an extended joyful melisma on the last vowel of 'Alleluia'. The Alleluia is also in two parts, the alleluia proper and the psalmverse, by which the Alleluia is identified (Alleluia V. Pascha nostrum). The last melisma of the verse is the same as the jubilus attached to the Alleluia. Alleluias are not sung during penitential times, such as [[Lent]]. Instead, a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] is chanted, usually with texts from the Psalms. Tracts, like Graduals, are highly centonized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Sequence (poetry)|Sequences]] are sung poems based on couplets. Although many sequences are not part of the liturgy and thus not part of the Gregorian repertory proper, Gregorian sequences include such well-known chants as ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'' and ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]''. According to [[Notker Balbulus]], an early sequence writer, their origins lie in the addition of words to the long melismata of the jubilus of Alleluia chants.<ref>Richard Crocker, ''The Early Medieval Sequence'' pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n[[Offertory|Offertories]] are sung during the offering of Eucharistic bread and wine. Offertories once had highly prolix melodies in their verses, but the use of verses in Gregorian Offertories disappeared around the 12th century. These verses however, are among the most ornate and elaborated in the whole chant repertoire. Offertories are in form closest to Responsories, which are likewise accompanied by at least one Verse and the opening sections of both Off. and Resp. are partly repeated after the verse(s). This last section is therefore called the 'repetenda' and is in performance the last melodic line of the chant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Communion (chant)|Communions]] are sung during the distribution of the [[eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]]. In presentation the Communio is similar to the Introitus, an antiphon with a series of psalm verses. Communion melodies are often tonally ambiguous and do not fit into a single [[musical mode]] which has led to the same communio being classed in different modes in different manuscripts or editions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Ordinary chants of the Mass===\nThe Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei use the same text in every service of the Mass. Because they follow the regular invariable \"order\" of the Mass, these chants are called \"[[Ordinary of the Mass|Ordinary]]\".\n\nThe [[Kyrie]] consists of a threefold repetition of \"Kyrie eleison\" (\"Lord, have mercy\"), a threefold repetition of \"Christe eleison\" (\"Christ have mercy\"), followed by another threefold repetition of \"Kyrie eleison.\" In older chants, \"Kyrie eleison imas\" (\"Lord, have mercy on us\") can be found. The Kyrie is distinguished by its use of the [[Hellenistic Greek|Greek language]] instead of Latin. Because of the textual repetition, various musical repeat structures occur in these chants. The following, Kyrie ad. lib. VI as transmitted in a Cambrai manuscript, uses the form ABA CDC EFE', with shifts in [[tessitura]] between sections. The E' section, on the final \"Kyrie eleison\", itself has an aa'b structure, contributing to the sense of climax.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 153.</ref>\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Kyrie 55, Vatican ad lib. VI, Cambrai.ogg|title=Kyrie 55, Vatican ad lib. VI, from Cambrai, Bibl. Mun. 61, fo.155v, as transcribed by David Hiley|description=Example of musical repeat structures in Gregorian chant}}\nThe [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] recites the Greater [[Doxology]], and the [[Credo]] intones the [[Nicene Creed]]. Because of the length of these texts, these chants often break into musical subsections corresponding with textual breaks. Because the Credo was the last Ordinary chant to be added to the Mass, there are relatively few Credo melodies in the Gregorian corpus.\n\nThe [[Sanctus]] and the [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]], like the Kyrie, also contain repeated texts, which their musical structures often exploit.\n\nTechnically, the [[Ite missa est]] and the [[Benedicamus Domino]], which conclude the Mass, belong to the Ordinary. They have their own Gregorian melodies, but because they are short and simple, and have rarely been the subject of later musical composition, they are often omitted in discussion.\n\n[[File:Salve Regina.png|thumb|left|Plainchant notation for the solemn setting of the [[Salve Regina]]; a simple setting is used more commonly.]]\n\n===Chants of the Office===\nGregorian chant is sung in the [[canonical hours]] of the [[monastic]] Office, primarily in antiphons used to sing the [[Psalms]], in the Great [[Responsory|Responsories]] of [[Matins]], and the Short Responsories of the Lesser Hours and [[Compline]]. The psalm antiphons of the Office tend to be short and simple, especially compared to the complex Great Responsories.\n\nAt the close of the Office, one of four ''[[Marian antiphon]]s'' is sung. These songs, ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'' (see top of article), ''Ave Regina caelorum'', ''Regina caeli laetare'', and ''Salve, Regina'', are relatively late chants, dating to the 11th century, and considerably more complex than most Office antiphons. [[Willi Apel]] has described these four songs as \"among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages.\"<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 404.</ref>\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Alma Redemptoris Mater.ogg|title=Alma Redemptoris Mater|description=Marian antiphon sung at Compline and Lauds between the First Sunday of Advent and Candlemas|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n==Influence==\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance music===\nGregorian chant had a significant impact on the development of [[medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]]. Modern staff notation developed directly from Gregorian neumes. The square notation that had been devised for plainchant was borrowed and adapted for other kinds of music. Certain groupings of neumes were used to indicate repeating rhythms called [[rhythmic mode]]s. Rounded noteheads increasingly replaced the older squares and lozenges in the 15th and 16th centuries, although chantbooks conservatively maintained the square notation. By the 16th century, the fifth line added to the [[staff (music)|musical staff]] had become standard. The [[bass clef]] and the [[Flat (music)|flat]], [[Natural sign|natural]], and [[sharp (music)|sharp]] accidentals derived directly from Gregorian notation.<ref>Chew, Geoffrey and Richard Rastall: \"Notation\", ''Grove Music Online'', ed. L. Macy (Accessed 27&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006) (subscription access)]</ref>\n\nGregorian melodies provided musical material and served as models for tropes and [[liturgical drama]]s. Vernacular hymns such as \"[[Christ ist erstanden]]\" and \"[[Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist]]\" adapted original Gregorian melodies to translated texts. Secular tunes such as the popular Renaissance \"[[In Nomine]]\" were based on Gregorian melodies. Beginning with the improvised harmonizations of Gregorian chant known as [[organum]], Gregorian chants became a driving force in medieval and Renaissance [[polyphony]]. Often, a Gregorian chant (sometimes in modified form) would be used as a ''[[cantus firmus]]'', so that the consecutive notes of the chant determined the harmonic progression. The Marian antiphons, especially ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'', were frequently arranged by Renaissance composers. The use of chant as a cantus firmus was the predominant practice until the [[Baroque]] period, when the stronger harmonic progressions made possible by an independent bass line became standard.\n\nThe Catholic Church later allowed polyphonic arrangements to replace the Gregorian chant of the Ordinary of the Mass. This is why the Mass as a compositional form, as set by composers like [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], features a Kyrie but not an Introit. The Propers may also be replaced by choral settings on certain solemn occasions. Among the composers who most frequently wrote polyphonic settings of the Propers were [[William Byrd]] and [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]. These polyphonic arrangements usually incorporate elements of the original chant.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alternatim]]\n* [[Anglican chant]]\n* [[Cecilian Movement]]\n* [[Damien Poisblaud]]\n* [[Paul Jausions]]\n* [[Schola Antiqua, Madrid|Schola Antiqua]]\n* [[Semiology (Gregorian Chant)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{col div|colwidth=45em}}\n* ''Graduale Triplex'' (1979).

Gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, with later additions and redactions. Although popular legend credits [[Pope Gregory I]] with inventing Gregorian chant, scholars believe that it arose from a later [[Carolingian]] synthesis of [[Roman chant]] and [[Gallican chant]].\n\nGregorian chants were organized initially into four, then eight, and finally 12 [[musical mode|modes]]. Typical melodic features include a characteristic [[Ambitus (music)|ambitus]], and also characteristic intervallic patterns relative to a referential [[Final (music)|mode final]], [[incipit]]s and [[cadence (music)|cadences]], the use of [[reciting tone]]s at a particular distance from the final, around which the other notes of the melody revolve, and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called [[centonization]] to create families of related chants. The scale patterns are organized against a background pattern formed of conjunct and disjunct [[tetrachord]]s, producing a larger pitch system called the [[Gamut (music)|gamut]]. The chants can be sung by using six-[[Note (music)|note]] patterns called [[hexachord]]s. Gregorian melodies are traditionally written using [[neume]]s, an early form of [[musical notation]] from which the modern [[staff (music)|four-line and five-line staff]] developed.<ref>Development of notation styles is discussed at [http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory2.htm Dolmetsch online], accessed 4&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006</ref> Multi-voice elaborations of Gregorian chant, known as [[organum]], were an early stage in the development of Western [[polyphony]].\n\nGregorian chant was traditionally sung by [[choir]]s of men and boys in churches, or by men and women of [[religious order]]s in their chapels. It is the music of the [[Roman Rite]], performed in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the monastic [[Canonical hours|Office]]. Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, [[Ambrosian chant]] still continues in use in Milan, and there are musicologists exploring both that and the [[Mozarabic chant]] of Christian Spain. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship.<ref name=Catholic>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/v8.html The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Second Vatican Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121220134142/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/v8.html |date=20 December 2012 }}; [[Pope Benedict XVI]]: [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=44963 Catholic World News 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006] both accessed 5&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006</ref> During the 20th century, Gregorian chant underwent a musicological and popular resurgence.\n\n==History==\n\n===Development of earlier plainchant===\nSinging has been part of the Christian [[liturgy]] since the earliest days of the Church. Until the mid-1990s, it was widely accepted that the [[psalms|psalmody]] of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Jewish]] worship significantly influenced and contributed to [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] ritual and chant. This view is no longer generally accepted by scholars, due to analysis that shows that most early Christian hymns did not have Psalms for texts, and that the Psalms were not sung in [[synagogue]]s for centuries after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Destruction of the Second Temple]] in AD&nbsp;70.<ref>David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 484\u20135.</ref> However, early Christian rites did incorporate elements of Jewish worship that survived in later chant tradition. [[Canonical hours]] have their roots in Jewish prayer hours. \"[[Amen]]\" and \"[[alleluia]]\" come from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and the threefold \"[[sanctus]]\" derives from the threefold \"kadosh\" of the [[Kedushah]].<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 34.</ref>\n\nThe [[New Testament]] mentions singing hymns during the [[Last Supper]]: \"When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the [[Mount of Olives]]\" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26.30|NT}}). Other ancient witnesses such as [[Pope Clement I]], [[Tertullian]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]], and [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] confirm the practice,<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 74.</ref> although in poetic or obscure ways that shed little light on how music sounded during this period.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 484\u20137 and James McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 72.</ref> The 3rd-century Greek \"[[Oxyrhynchus hymn]]\" survived with musical notation, but the connection between this hymn and the plainchant tradition is uncertain.<ref>McKinnon, James W.: \"Christian Church, music of the early\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 11&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/ (subscription access)]</ref>\n\nMusical elements that would later be used in the Roman Rite began to appear in the 3rd century. The ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', attributed to the theologian [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], attests the singing of [[Hallel]] psalms with Alleluia as the refrain in early Christian [[agape feast|''agape'' feasts]].<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 486.</ref> Chants of the Office, sung during the canonical hours, have their roots in the early 4th century, when desert monks following [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]] introduced the practice of continuous psalmody, singing the complete cycle of 150 psalms each week. Around 375, [[antiphon]]al psalmody became popular in the Christian East; in 386, [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]] introduced this practice to the West. In the fifth century, a singing school, the Schola Cantorum, was founded at Rome to provide training in church musicianship.<ref>Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', pp. 28</ref>\n\nScholars are still debating how plainchant developed during the 5th through the 9th centuries, as information from this period is scarce. Around 410, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] described the [[responsory|responsorial]] singing of a [[Gradual]] psalm at Mass. At c. 520, [[Benedict of Nursia]] established what is called the rule of St. Benedict, in which the protocol of the Divine Office for monastic use was laid down. Around 678, Roman chant was taught at [[York]].<ref>James McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 320.</ref> Distinctive regional traditions of Western plainchant arose during this period, notably in the British Isles ([[Celtic chant]]), Spain (Mozarabic), Gaul (Gallican), and Italy ([[Old Roman chant|Old Roman]], Ambrosian and [[Beneventan chant|Beneventan]]). These traditions may have evolved from a hypothetical year-round repertory of 5th-century plainchant after the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed.\n\n[[Johannes Hymonides|John the Deacon]], biographer (c. 872) of [[Pope Gregory I]], modestly claimed that the saint \"compiled a patchwork antiphonary\",<ref name=Bewerunge>{{harvnb|Bewerunge|1913}}</ref> unsurprisingly, given his considerable work with liturgical development. He reorganized the Schola Cantorum and established a more uniform standard in church services, gathering chants from among the regional traditions as widely as he could manage. Of those, he retained what he could, revised where necessary, and assigned particular chants to the various services.<ref>Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', pp. 28\u20139</ref> According to [[Donald Jay Grout]], his goal was to organize the bodies of chants from diverse traditions into a uniform and orderly whole for use by the entire western region of the Church.<ref>Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', p. 30</ref> His renowned love for music was recorded only 34 years after his death; the epitaph of Honorius testified that comparison to Gregory was already considered the highest praise for a music-loving pope.<ref name=Bewerunge /> While later legends magnified his real achievements, these significant steps may account for why his name came to be attached to Gregorian chant.\n\n===Origins of mature plainchant===\n[[File:Gregory I - Antiphonary of Hartker of Sankt Gallen.jpg|thumb|right| A dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]] sitting on [[Pope Gregory I]]'s shoulder symbolizes Divine Inspiration]]\nThe Gregorian repertory was further systematized for use in the [[Roman Rite]], and scholars weigh the relative influences of Roman and [[Carolingian]] practices upon the development of plainchant. The late 8th century saw a steadily increasing influence of the Carolingian monarchs over the popes. During a visit to Gaul in 752\u2013753, [[Pope Stephen II]] celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] using Roman chant. According to [[Charlemagne]], his father [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] abolished the local [[Gallican Rite]]s in favor of the Roman use, in order to strengthen ties with Rome.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 79.</ref> Thirty years later (785\u2013786), at Charlemagne's request, [[Pope Adrian I]] sent a papal [[sacramentary]] with Roman chants to the Carolingian court. According to [[James McKinnon]], over a brief period in the 8th century, a project overseen by [[Chrodegang of Metz]] in the favorable atmosphere of the Carolingian monarchs, also compiled the core liturgy of the Roman Mass and promoted its use in [[Franks|Francia]] and throughout Gaul.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Grove Music Online]]|last=Kenneth|first=Levy|display-authors=etal|chapter=Plainchant, \u00a72: History to the 10th century|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Willi Apel]] and Robert Snow assert a scholarly consensus that Gregorian chant developed around 750 from a synthesis of Roman and Gallican chants, and was commissioned by the Carolingian rulers in France. Andreas Pfisterer and Peter Jeffery have shown that older melodic essentials from Roman chant are clear in the synthesized chant repertory. There were other developments as well. Chants were modified, influenced by local styles and Gallican chant, and fitted into the theory of the ancient Greek [[octoechos]] system of modes in a manner that created what later came to be known as the western system of the eight [[musical mode|church modes]]. The Metz project also invented an innovative [[musical notation]], using freeform [[neume]]s to show the shape of a remembered melody.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Grier | first1 = J | year = 2003 | title = Ademar de Chabannes, Carolingian Musical Practices, and Nota Romana | url = | journal = Journal of the American Musicological Society | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 43\u201398 | doi = 10.1525/jams.2003.56.1.43 }}</ref> This notation was further developed over time, culminating in the introduction of [[Staff (music)|staff]] lines (attributed to [[Guido d'Arezzo]]) in the early 11th century, what we know today as plainchant notation. The whole body of Frankish-Roman Carolingian chant, augmented with new chants to complete the liturgical year, coalesced into a single body of chant that was called \"Gregorian.\"\n\nThe changes made in the new system of chants were so significant that they have led some scholars to speculate that it was named in honor of the contemporary [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 114.</ref> Nevertheless, the lore surrounding [[Pope Gregory I]] was sufficient to culminate in his portrayal as the actual author of Gregorian Chant. He was often depicted as receiving the dictation of plainchant from a dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]], thus giving Gregorian chant the stamp of being divinely inspired. Scholars agree that the melodic content of much Gregorian Chant did not exist in that form in Gregory I's day. In addition, it is known definitively that the familiar neumatic system for notating plainchant had not been established in his time.<ref>Taruskin, Richard ''The Oxford History of Western Music, Volume I \u2013 Music from the earliest notations to the 16th century'' Chapter 1, the curtain goes up, page 6. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010)</ref> Nevertheless, Gregory's authorship is popularly accepted by some as fact to this day.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Dissemination and hegemony===\nGregorian chant appeared in a remarkably uniform state across Europe within a short time. [[Charlemagne]], once elevated to [[Holy Roman Emperor]], aggressively spread Gregorian chant throughout his empire to consolidate religious and secular power, requiring the clergy to use the new repertory on pain of death.<ref>David Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 10.</ref> From English and German sources, Gregorian chant spread north to [[Scandinavia]], [[Iceland]] and [[Finland]].<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 604.</ref> In 885, [[Pope Stephen V]] banned the [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]] liturgy, leading to the ascendancy of Gregorian chant in Eastern Catholic lands including [[Poland]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].\n\nThe other plainchant repertories of the Christian West faced severe competition from the new Gregorian chant. Charlemagne continued his father's policy of favoring the Roman Rite over the local Gallican traditions. By the 9th century the Gallican rite and chant had effectively been eliminated, although not without local resistance.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 80.</ref> The Gregorian chant of the [[Sarum Rite]] displaced [[Celtic chant]]. Gregorian coexisted with Beneventan chant for over a century before Beneventan chant was abolished by papal decree (1058). Mozarabic chant survived the influx of the [[Visigoths]] and [[Moors]], but not the Roman-backed prelates newly installed in Spain during the [[Reconquista]]. Restricted to a handful of dedicated chapels, modern Mozarabic chant is highly Gregorianized and bears no musical resemblance to its original form. Ambrosian chant alone survived to the present day, preserved in [[Milan]] due to the musical reputation and ecclesiastical authority of [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]].\n\nGregorian chant eventually replaced the local chant tradition of Rome itself, which is now known as Old Roman chant. In the 10th century, virtually no musical manuscripts were being notated in Italy. Instead, Roman Popes imported Gregorian chant from (German) Holy Roman Emperors during the 10th and 11th centuries. For example, the [[Credo]] was added to the [[Roman Rite]] at the behest of the Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] in 1014.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 47.</ref> Reinforced by the legend of Pope Gregory, Gregorian chant was taken to be the authentic, original chant of Rome, a misconception that continues to this day. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had supplanted or marginalized all the other Western plainchant traditions.\n\nLater sources of these other chant traditions show an increasing Gregorian influence, such as occasional efforts to categorize their chants into the Gregorian [[musical mode|modes]]. Similarly, the Gregorian repertory incorporated elements of these lost plainchant traditions, which can be identified by careful stylistic and historical analysis. For example, the ''[[Improperia]]'' of [[Good Friday]] are believed to be a remnant of the Gallican repertory.<ref>Carl Parrish, \"A Treasury of Early Music\" pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\n===Early sources and later revisions===\n[[File:Ad te levavi trimmed.jpg|thumb|right|Two plainchants from the Mass Proper, written in adiastematic neumes, from {{ill|Codex Sangallensis 359|de|italic=yes}}]]\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Gradual chant - Universi qui te expectant.ogg|title=''Universi qui te expectant'', Gradual for the Mass (first Sunday of Advent)|description=This chant corresponds to the second one on the manuscript folio above beneath the large rubric ''Responsorium Graduale''; by [[Schola Antiqua of Chicago]].}}\nThe first extant sources with musical notation were written around 930 (Graduale Laon). Before this, plainchant had been transmitted orally. Most scholars of Gregorian chant agree that the development of music notation assisted the dissemination of chant across Europe. The earlier notated manuscripts are primarily from [[Regensburg]] in Germany, [[Abbey of Saint Gall|St. Gall]] in Switzerland, [[Laon]] and [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|St. Martial]] in France.\n\nGregorian chant has in its long history been subjected to a series of redactions to bring it up to changing contemporary tastes and practice. The more recent redaction undertaken in the Benedictine Abbey of St. Pierre, Solesmes, has turned into a huge undertaking to restore the allegedly corrupted chant to a hypothetical \"original\" state. Early Gregorian chant was revised to conform to the theoretical structure of the [[musical mode|modes]]. In 1562\u201363, the [[Council of Trent]] banned most [[sequence (poetry)|sequences]]. Guidette's ''Directorium chori'', published in 1582, and the ''Editio medicea'', published in 1614, drastically revised what was perceived as corrupt and flawed \"barbarism\" by making the chants conform to contemporary aesthetic standards.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 288\u2013289.</ref> In 1811, the French musicologist [[Alexandre-\u00c9tienne Choron]], as part of a conservative backlash following the liberal Catholic orders' inefficacy during the [[French Revolution]], called for returning to the \"purer\" Gregorian chant of Rome over French corruptions.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 622.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, early liturgical and musical manuscripts were unearthed and edited. Earlier, Dom [[Prosper Gu\u00e9ranger]] revived the monastic tradition in Solesmes. Re-establishing the Divine Office was among his priorities, but no proper chantbooks existed. Many monks were sent out to libraries throughout Europe to find relevant Chant manuscripts. In 1871, however, the old Medicea edition was reprinted ([[Pustet]], Regensburg) which [[Pope Pius IX]] declared the only official version. In their firm belief that they were on the right way, Solesmes increased its efforts. In 1889, after decades of research, the monks of [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]] released the first book in a planned series, the Pal\u00e9ographie Musicale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/palographiemusic15macq|title=Pal\u00e9ographie musicale : fac-simil\u00e9s phototypiques des principaux manuscrits de chant gr\u00e9gorien, ambrosien, mozarabe, gallican|work=Internet Archive}}</ref> The incentive of its publication was to demonstrate the corruption of the 'Medicea' by presenting photographed notations originating from a great variety of manuscripts of one single chant, which Solesmes called forth as witnesses to assert their own reforms.\n\nThe monks of Solesmes brought in their heaviest artillery in this battle, as indeed the academically sound 'Paleo' was intended to be a war-tank, meant to abolish once and for all the corrupted Pustet edition. On the evidence of congruence throughout various manuscripts (which were duly published in [[facsimile]] editions with ample editorial introductions) Solesmes was able to work out a practical reconstruction. This reconstructed chant was academically praised, but rejected by Rome until 1903, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] died. His successor, [[Pope Pius X]], promptly accepted the Solesmes chant \u2013 now compiled as the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'' \u2013 as authoritative. In 1904, the Vatican edition of the Solesmes chant was commissioned. Serious academic debates arose, primarily owing to stylistic liberties taken by the Solesmes editors to impose their controversial interpretation of rhythm. The Solesmes editions insert [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] marks and note-lengthening ''episema'' and ''mora'' marks not found in the original sources.\n\nConversely, they omit significative letters found in the original sources, which give instructions for rhythm and articulation such as speeding up or slowing down. These editorial practices have placed the historical authenticity of the Solesmes interpretation in doubt.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 624\u2013627.</ref> Ever since restoration of Chant was taken up in Solesmes, there have been lengthy discussions of exactly what course was to be taken. Some favored a strict academic rigour and wanted to postpone publications, while others concentrated on practical matters and wanted to supplant the corrupted tradition as soon as possible. Roughly a century later, there still exists a breach between a strict musicological approach and the practical needs of church choirs. Thus the performance tradition officially promulgated since the onset of the Solesmes restoration is substantially at odds with musicological evidence.\n\nIn his [[motu proprio]] ''[[Tra le sollecitudini]]'', Pius X mandated the use of Gregorian chant, encouraging the faithful to sing the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], although he reserved the singing of the [[proper (liturgy)|Propers]] for males. While this custom is maintained in [[traditionalist Catholic]] communities (most of which allow all-female scholas as well, though), the Catholic Church no longer persists with this ban. [[Vatican II]] officially allowed worshipers to substitute other music, particularly sacred polyphony, in place of Gregorian chant, although it did reaffirm that Gregorian chant was still the official music of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and the music most suitable for worship in the Roman Liturgy.<ref name=Catholic/>\n\n==Musical form==\n\n===Melodic types===\nGregorian chant is, as 'chant' implies, vocal music. The text, the phrases, words and eventually the syllables, can be sung in various ways. The most straightforward is recitation on the same tone, which is called \"syllabic\" as each syllable is sung to a single tone. Likewise, simple chants are often syllabic throughout with only a few instances where two or more notes are sung on one syllable. \"Neumatic\" chants are more embellished and [[ligature (music)|ligatures]], a connected group of notes, written as a single compound neume, abound in the text. [[Melisma]]tic chants are the most ornate chants in which elaborate melodies are sung on long sustained vowels as in the Alleluia, ranging from five or six notes per syllable to over sixty in the more prolix melismata.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' pp. 85\u201388.</ref>\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day.ogg|title=Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day|description=Example of liturgical recitative in Gregorian chant}}\nGregorian chants fall into two broad categories of melody: [[recitative]]s and free melodies.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 203</ref> The simplest kind of melody is the liturgical recitative. Recitative melodies are dominated by a single pitch, called the ''[[reciting tone]]''. Other pitches appear in melodic formulae for [[incipit]]s, partial [[cadence (music)|cadences]], and full cadences. These chants are primarily syllabic. For example, the [[Collect]] for [[Easter]] consists of 127 syllables sung to 131 pitches, with 108 of these pitches being the reciting note A and the other 23 pitches flexing down to G.<ref>Hoppin, ''Anthology of Medieval Music'' p. 11.</ref> Liturgical recitatives are commonly found in the [[Accentus Ecclesiasticus|accentus]] chants of the liturgy, such as the intonations of the Collect, [[Epistle]], and [[Gospel]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and in the direct [[psalmody]] of the [[Canonical hours|Office]].\n\nPsalmodic chants, which intone [[psalms]], include both recitatives and free melodies. Psalmodic chants include ''direct psalmody'', ''antiphonal chants'', and ''responsorial chants''.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 81.</ref> In direct psalmody, psalm verses are sung without refrains to simple, formulaic tones. Most psalmodic chants are antiphonal and responsorial, sung to free melodies of varying complexity.\n\n[[File:Evora06.jpg|thumb|Antiphonary with Gregorian chants]]\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Loquetur Dominus.ogg|title=''Loquetur Dominus'', Introit for Week XXXIV of Ordinary Time|description=Example of antiphonal psalmody in Gregorian chant\n|filename2=De profundis.ogg|title2=''De profundis'', tract for the Requiem Mass|description2=Example of responsorial psalmody in Gregorian chant}}\nAntiphonal chants such as the [[Introit]], and [[Communion (chant)|Communion]] originally referred to chants in which two choirs sang in alternation, one choir singing verses of a psalm, the other singing a refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''. Over time, the verses were reduced in number, usually to just one psalm verse and the [[doxology]], or even omitted entirely. Antiphonal chants reflect their ancient origins as elaborate recitatives through the reciting tones in their melodies. Ordinary chants, such as the [[Kyrie]] and [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]], are not considered antiphonal chants, although they are often performed in antiphonal style.\n\nResponsorial chants such as the [[Gradual]], [[Alleluia]], [[Offertory]], and the Office Responsories originally consisted of a refrain called a ''respond'' sung by a choir, alternating with psalm verses sung by a soloist. [[Responsory|Responsorial]] chants are often composed of an amalgamation of various stock musical phrases, pieced together in a practice called ''[[centonization]]''. Tracts are melismatic settings of psalm verses and use frequent recurring cadences and they are strongly centonized.\n\nGregorian chant evolved to fulfill various functions in the Roman Catholic liturgy. Broadly speaking, liturgical recitatives are used for texts intoned by deacons or priests. Antiphonal chants accompany liturgical actions: the entrance of the officiant, the collection of offerings, and the distribution of sanctified bread and wine. Responsorial chants expand on readings and lessons.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 123.</ref>\n\nThe non-psalmodic chants, including the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], [[Sequence (poetry)|sequences]], and [[hymn]]s, were originally intended for congregational singing.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 131.</ref> The structure of their texts largely defines their musical style. In sequences, the same melodic phrase is repeated in each couplet. The strophic texts of hymns use the same syllabic melody for each stanza.\n\n===Modality===\n{{Main|Musical mode}}\nEarly plainchant, like much of Western music, is believed to have been distinguished by the use of the [[diatonic scale]]. Modal theory, which postdates the composition of the core chant repertory, arises from a synthesis of two very different traditions: the speculative tradition of numerical ratios and species inherited from ancient Greece and a second tradition rooted in the practical art of cantus. The earliest writings that deal with both theory and practice include the [[Musica enchiriadis|Enchiriadis]] group of treatises, which circulated in the late ninth century and possibly have their roots in an earlier, oral tradition. In contrast to the ancient Greek system of tetrachords (a collection of four continuous notes) that descend by two tones and a semitone, the Enchiriadis writings base their tone-system on a tetrachord that corresponds to the four finals of chant, D, E, F, and G. The disjunct tetrachords in the Enchiriadis system have been the subject of much speculation, because they do not correspond to the diatonic framework that became the standard Medieval scale (for example, there is a high F#, a note not recognized by later Medieval writers). A diatonic scale with a chromatically alterable b/b-flat was first described by [[Hucbald]], who adopted the tetrachord of the finals (D, E, F, G) and constructed the rest of the system following the model of the Greek Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems. These were the first steps in forging a theoretical tradition that corresponded to chant.\n\nAround 1025, [[Guido d'Arezzo]] revolutionized Western music with the development of the ''gamut'', in which pitches in the singing range were organized into overlapping [[hexachord]]s. Hexachords could be built on C (the natural hexachord, C-D-E^F-G-A), F (the soft hexachord, using a B-flat, F-G-A^Bb-C-D), or G (the hard hexachord, using a B-natural, G-A-B^C-D-E). The B-flat was an integral part of the system of hexachords rather than an [[accidental (music)|accidental]]. The use of notes outside of this collection was described as [[musica ficta]].\n\nGregorian chant was categorized into eight [[musical mode|modes]], influenced by the eightfold division of Byzantine chants called the ''[[oktoechos]]''.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 11.</ref> Each mode is distinguished by its ''final'', ''dominant'', and ''ambitus''. The ''final'' is the ending note, which is usually an important note in the overall structure of the melody. The ''dominant'' is a secondary pitch that usually serves as a [[reciting tone]] in the melody. ''[[Ambitus (music)|Ambitus]]'' refers to the range of pitches used in the melody. Melodies whose final is in the middle of the ambitus, or which have only a limited ambitus, are categorized as ''plagal'', while melodies whose final is in the lower end of the ambitus and have a range of over five or six notes are categorized as ''authentic''. Although corresponding plagal and authentic modes have the same final, they have different dominants.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' pp. 64\u20135.</ref> The existent pseudo-Greek names of the modes, rarely used in medieval times, derive from a misunderstanding of the Ancient Greek modes; the prefix \"[[wikt:hypo-|hypo-]]\" (under, Gr.) indicates a plagal mode, where the melody moves below the final. In contemporary Latin manuscripts the modes are simply called Protus authentus /plagalis, Deuterus, Tritus and Tetrardus: the 1st mode, authentic or plagal, the 2nd mode etc. In the Roman Chantbooks the modes are indicated by Roman numerals.\n\n:Modes 1 and 2 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on D, sometimes called [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and [[Hypodorian mode|Hypodorian]].\n:Modes 3 and 4 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on E, sometimes called [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]] and [[Hypophrygian mode|Hypophrygian]].\n:Modes 5 and 6 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on F, sometimes called [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] and [[Hypolydian mode|Hypolydian]].\n:Modes 7 and 8 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on G, sometimes called [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] and [[Hypomixolydian mode|Hypomixolydian]].\n\nAlthough the modes with melodies ending on A, B, and C are sometimes referred to as [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]], [[Locrian mode|Locrian]], and [[Ionian mode|Ionian]], these are not considered distinct modes and are treated as [[Transposition (music)|transpositions]] of whichever mode uses the same set of hexachords. The actual pitch of the Gregorian chant is not fixed, so the piece can be sung in whichever range is most comfortable.\n\nCertain classes of Gregorian chant have a separate musical formula for each mode, allowing one section of the chant to transition smoothly into the next section, such as the [[psalm verse]]s that are sung between the repetition of antiphons, or the Gloria Patri. Thus we find models for the recitation of psalmverses, Alleluia and Gloria Patri for all eight modes.<ref>Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 82.</ref>\n\nNot every Gregorian chant fits neatly into Guido's hexachords or into the system of eight modes. For example, there are chants \u2014 especially from German sources \u2013 whose [[neume]]s suggest a warbling of pitches between the notes E and F, outside the hexachord system, or in other words, employing a form of chromatism.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 22.</ref> Early Gregorian chant, like Ambrosian and Old Roman chant, whose melodies are most closely related to Gregorian, did not use the modal system.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 166\u201378, and Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 454.</ref> The great need for a system of organizing chants lies in the need to link antiphons with standard tones, as in for example, the psalmody at the Office. Using Psalm Tone i with an antiphon in Mode 1 makes for a smooth transition between the end of the antiphon and the intonation of the tone, and the ending of the tone can then be chosen to provide a smooth transition back to the antiphon. As the modal system gained acceptance, Gregorian chants were edited to conform to the modes, especially during 12th-century [[Cistercian]] reforms. Finals were altered, melodic ranges reduced, melismata trimmed, B-flats eliminated, and repeated words removed.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 608\u201310.</ref> Despite these attempts to impose modal consistency, some chants \u2014 notably Communions \u2014 defy simple modal assignment. For example, in four medieval manuscripts, the Communion ''Circuibo'' was transcribed using a different mode in each.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 171\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Musical idiom===\nSeveral features besides modality contribute to the musical idiom of Gregorian chant, giving it a distinctive musical flavor. Melodic motion is primarily [[steps and skips|stepwise]]. Skips of a third are common, and larger skips far more common than in other plainchant repertories such as Ambrosian chant or Beneventan chant. Gregorian melodies are more likely to traverse a seventh than a full octave, so that melodies rarely travel from D up to the D an octave higher, but often travel from D to the C a seventh higher, using such patterns as D-F-G-A-C.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 256\u20137.</ref> Gregorian melodies often explore chains of pitches, such as F-A-C, around which the other notes of the chant gravitate.<ref>Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 21.</ref> Within each mode, certain incipits and cadences are preferred, which the modal theory alone does not explain. Chants often display complex internal structures that combine and repeat musical subphrases. This occurs notably in the [[Offertory|Offertories]]; in chants with shorter, repeating texts such as the [[Kyrie]] and [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; and in longer chants with clear textual divisions such as the Great Responsories, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], and the [[Credo]].<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 258\u20139.</ref>\n\nChants sometimes fall into melodically related groups. The musical phrases [[centonization|centonized]] to create [[Gradual]]s and [[Tract (liturgy)|Tracts]] follow a musical \"grammar\" of sorts. Certain phrases are used only at the beginnings of chants, or only at the end, or only in certain combinations, creating musical families of chants such as the ''[[Iustus ut palma]]'' family of Graduals.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 344\u201363.</ref> Several [[Introit]]s in mode 3, including ''Loquetur Dominus'' above, exhibit melodic similarities. Mode III (E authentic) chants have C as a dominant, so C is the expected reciting tone. These mode III Introits, however, use both G and C as reciting tones, and often begin with a decorated leap from G to C to establish this tonality.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 110\u2013113.</ref> Similar examples exist throughout the repertory.\n\n===Notation===\n[[File:Neume2.jpg|thumb|Offertory ''Iubilate deo universa terra'' in unheightened neume]]\n\nThe earliest notated sources of Gregorian chant (written ca. 950) used symbols called ''[[neume]]s'' (Gr. sign, of the hand) to indicate tone-movements and relative duration within each syllable. A sort of musical stenography that seems to focus on gestures and tone-movements but not the specific pitches of individual notes, nor the relative starting pitches of each neume. Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this was obviously not necessary. The neumatic manuscripts display great sophistication and precision in notation and a wealth of graphic signs to indicate the musical gesture and proper pronunciation of the text.\nScholars postulate that this practice may have been derived from [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures, the [[ekphonetic]] notation of [[Byzantine chant]], punctuation marks, or diacritical accents.<ref>Levy, Kenneth: \"Plainchant\", ''Grove Music Online'', ed. L. Macy (Accessed 20&nbsp;January&nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.40099.2.3#music.40099.2.3 (subscription access)]</ref> Later adaptations and innovations included the use of a dry-scratched line or an inked line or two lines, marked C or F showing the relative pitches between neumes. Consistent relative heightening first developed in the Aquitaine region, particularly at [[Saint Martial|St. Martial de Limoges]], in the first half of the eleventh century. Many German-speaking areas, however, continued to use unpitched neumes into the twelfth century. Additional symbols developed, such as the ''custos'', placed at the end of a system to show the next pitch. Other symbols indicated changes in articulation, duration, or tempo, such as a letter \"t\" to indicate a [[tenuto]]. Another form of early notation used a system of letters corresponding to different pitches, much as [[Shaker music]] is notated.\n\n[[File:gregorian chant.gif|frame|''Liber usualis'' in square notation (excerpt from the ''Kyrie eleison (Orbis factor)'')]]\nBy the 13th century, the neumes of Gregorian chant were usually written in ''square notation'' on a four-line staff with a clef, as in the ''Graduale Aboense'' pictured above. In square notation, small groups of ascending notes on a syllable are shown as stacked squares, read from bottom to top, while descending notes are written with diamonds read from left to right. When a syllable has a large number of notes, a series of smaller such groups of neumes are written in succession, read from left to right. The oriscus, quilisma, and liquescent neumes indicate special vocal treatments, that have been largely neglected due to uncertainty as to how to sing them. Since the 1970s, with the influential insights of Dom [[Eug\u00e8ne Cardine]] (see below under 'rhythm'), ornamental neumes have received more attention from both researchers and performers.\nB-flat is indicated by a \"b-mollum\" (Lat. soft), a rounded undercaste 'b' placed to the left of the entire neume in which the note occurs, as shown in the \"Kyrie\" to the right. When necessary, a \"b-durum\" (Lat. hard), written squarely, indicates B-natural and serves to cancel the b-mollum. This system of square notation is standard in modern chantbooks.\n\n==Performance==\n\n===Texture===\nGregorian chant was originally used for singing the [[Canonical hours|Office]] (by male and female religious) and for singing the parts of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] pertaining to the lay faithful (male and female), the celebrant (priest, always male) and the choir (composed of male ordained clergy, except in convents). Outside the larger cities, the number of available clergy dropped, and lay men started singing these parts. The choir was considered an official liturgical duty reserved to clergy, so women were not allowed to sing in the ''[[Schola Cantorum (disambiguation)|Schola Cantorum]]'' or other choirs except in [[convent]]s where women were permitted to sing the Office and the parts of the Mass pertaining to the choir as a function of their consecrated life.<ref>Carol Neuls-Bates, ''Women in Music'' p. 3.</ref>\n\nChant was normally sung in unison. Later innovations included ''[[Trope (music)|tropes]]'', which is a new text sung to the same melodic phrases in a melismatic chant (repeating an entire Alleluia-melody on a new text for instance, or repeating a full phrase with a new text that comments on the previously sung text) and various forms of ''[[organum]]'', (improvised) harmonic embellishment of chant melodies focusing on octaves, fifths, fourths, and, later, thirds. Neither tropes nor organum, however, belong to the chant repertory proper. The main exception to this is the sequence, whose origins lay in troping the extended [[melisma]] of [[Alleluia]] chants known as the [[jubilus]], but the sequences, like the tropes, were later officially suppressed. The [[Council of Trent]] struck sequences from the Gregorian corpus, except those for [[Easter]], [[Pentecost]], [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] and [[All Souls' Day]].\n\nNot much is known about the particular vocal stylings or performance practices used for Gregorian chant in the Middle Ages. On occasion, the clergy was urged to have their singers perform with more restraint and piety. This suggests that virtuosic performances occurred, contrary to the modern stereotype of Gregorian chant as slow-moving mood music. This tension between musicality and piety goes far back; [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] himself criticized the practice of promoting clerics based on their charming singing rather than their preaching.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 504.</ref> However, [[Odo of Cluny]], a renowned monastic reformer, praised the intellectual and musical virtuosity to be found in chant:\n\n{{quote|For in these [Offertories and Communions] there are the most varied kinds of ascent, descent, repeat..., delight for the ''cognoscenti'', difficulty for the beginners, and an admirable organization... that widely differs from other chants; they are not so much made according to the rules of music... but rather evince the authority and validity... of music.<ref>Apel, p. 312.</ref>}}\n\nTrue antiphonal performance by two alternating choruses still occurs, as in certain German monasteries. However, antiphonal chants are generally performed in responsorial style by a solo cantor alternating with a chorus. This practice appears to have begun in the Middle Ages.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 197.</ref> Another medieval innovation had the solo cantor sing the opening words of responsorial chants, with the full chorus finishing the end of the opening phrase. This innovation allowed the soloist to fix the pitch of the chant for the chorus and to cue the choral entrance.\n\n===Rhythm===\nGiven the oral teaching tradition of Gregorian chant, modern reconstruction of intended rhythm from the written notation of Gregorian chant has always been a source of debate among modern scholars. To complicate matters further, many ornamental neumes used in the earliest manuscripts pose difficulties on the interpretation of rhythm. Certain neumes such as the ''pressus'', pes quassus, strophic neumes may indicate repeated notes, lengthening by repercussion, in some cases with added ornaments. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, most chant was sung with an approximately equal duration allotted to each note, although [[Jerome of Moravia]] cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened.<ref>Hiley, \"Chant\", ''Performance Practice: Music before 1600'' p. 44. \"The performance of chant in equal note lengths from the 13th century onwards is well supported by contemporary statements.\"</ref>\n\nWhile the standard repertory of Gregorian Chant was partly being supplanted with new forms of polyphony, the earlier melo-rhythmic refinements of monophonic chant seem to fall into disuse. Later redactions such as the ''Editio medicaea'' of 1614 rewrote chant so that melismata, with their melodic accent, fell on accented syllables.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 289.</ref> This aesthetic held sway until the re-examination of chant in the late 19th century by such scholars as Wagner, [[Joseph Pothier|Pothier]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Mocquereau|Mocquereau]], who fell into two camps.\n\nOne school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, advocated imposing rhythmic meters on chants, although they disagreed on how that should be done. An opposing interpretation, represented by Pothier and Mocquereau, supported a free rhythm of equal note values, although some notes are lengthened for textual emphasis or musical effect. The modern Solesmes editions of Gregorian chant follow this interpretation. Mocquereau divided melodies into two- and three-note phrases, each beginning with an ''ictus'', akin to a beat, notated in chantbooks as a small vertical mark. These basic melodic units combined into larger phrases through a complex system expressed by [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures.<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 127.</ref> This approach prevailed during the twentieth century, propagated by [[Justine Ward]]'s program of music education for children, until the liturgical role of chant was diminished after the liturgical reforms of [[Paul VI]], and new scholarship \"essentially discredited\" Mocquereau's rhythmic theories.<ref>Dyer, Joseph: \"Roman Catholic Church Music\", Section VI.1, [http://www.grovemusic.com/ Grove Music Online] ed. L. Macy (Accessed 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006), (subscription access)</ref>\n\nCommon modern practice favors performing Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, largely for aesthetic reasons.<ref>William P. Mahrt, \"Chant\", ''A Performer's Guide to Medieval Music'' p. 18.</ref> The text determines the accent while the melodic contour determines the [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]]. The note lengthenings recommended by the Solesmes school remain influential, though not prescriptive.\n\nDom Eugene Cardine, (1905\u20131988) monk from Solesmes, published his 'Semiologie Gregorienne' in 1970 in which he clearly explains the musical significance of the neumes of the early chant manuscripts. Cardine shows the great diversity of neumes and graphic variations of the basic shape of a particular neume, which can not be expressed in the square notation. This variety in notation must have served a practical purpose and therefore a musical significance. Nine years later, the ''Graduale Triplex'' was published, in which the Roman Gradual, containing all the chants for Mass in a Year's cycle, appeared with the neumes of the two most important manuscripts copied under and over the 4-line staff of the square notation. The ''Graduale Triplex'' made widely accessible the original notation of Sankt Gallen and Laon (compiled after 930 AD) in a single chantbook and was a huge step forward. Dom Cardine had many students who have each in their own way continued their semiological studies, some of whom also started experimenting in applying the newly understood principles in performance practice.\n\nThe studies of Cardine and his students (Godehard Joppich, Luigi Augustoni, Johannes B. G\u00f6schl, Marie-No\u00ebl Colette, Rupert Fischer, Marie-Claire Billecocq, [[Alexander M. Schweitzer]] to name a few) have clearly demonstrated that rhythm in Gregorian chant as notated in the 10th century rhythmic manuscripts (notably Sankt Gallen and Laon) manifest such rhythmic diversity and melodic \u2013 rhythmic ornamentations for which there is hardly a living performance tradition in the Western world. Contemporary groups that endeavour to sing according to the manuscript traditions have evolved after 1975. Some practising researchers favour a closer look at non Western (liturgical) traditions, in such cultures where the tradition of modal monophony was never abandoned.\n\nAnother group with different views are the mensuralists or the proportionalists, who maintain that rhythm has to be interpreted proportionately, where shorts are exactly half the longs. This school of interpretation claims the support of historical authorities such as St Augustine, Remigius, Guido and Aribo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calumcille.com/griogair/9A14.html |title=The symbolism of chant rhythm |publisher=Calumcille.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315074741/http://www.calumcille.com/griogair/9A14.html |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df= }}</ref> This view is advocated by John Blackley and his 'Schola Antiqua New York'.\n\nRecent research in the Netherlands by Dr. Dirk van Kampen has indicated that the authentic rhythm of Gregorian chant in the 10th century includes both proportional elements and elements that are in agreement with semiology.<ref>Dirk van Kampen (1994). ''Het oorspronkelijke ritme van het Gregoriaans: Een 'semiologisch-mensuralistische' studie''. Landsmeer, {{ISBN|90-900742-8-7}}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Kampen | first1 = Dirk | year = 2005 | title = Uitgangspunten voor de ritmiek van Gregoriaans | url = | journal = Tijdschrift voor Gregoriaans | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 89\u201394 }}</ref> Starting with the expectation that the rhythm of Gregorian chant (and thus the duration of the individual notes) anyway adds to the expressivity of the sacred Latin texts, several word-related variables were studied for their relationship with several neume-related variables, exploring these relationships in a sample of introit chants using such statistical methods as correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis.\n\nBeside the length of the syllables (measured in tenths of seconds), each text syllable was evaluated in terms of its position within the word to which it belongs, defining such variables as \"the syllable has or has not the main accent\", \"the syllable is or is not at the end of a word\", etc., and in terms of the particular sounds produced (for instance, the syllable contains the vowel \"i\"). The various neume elements were evaluated by attaching different duration values to them, both in terms of semiological propositions (nuanced durations according to the manner of neume writing in Chris Hakkennes' ''Graduale Lagal''<ref>Chris Hakkennes (1984). ''Graduale Lagal''. Den Haag: Stichting Centrum voor de Kerkzang.</ref>), and in terms of fixed duration values that were based on mensuralistic notions, however with ratios between short and long notes ranging from 1 : 1, via 1 : 1.2, 1 : 1.4, etc. to 1 : 3. To distinguish short and long notes, tables were consulted that were established by Van Kampen in an unpublished comparative study regarding the neume notations according to Sankt Gallen and Laon codices. With some exceptions, these tables confirm the short vs. long distinctions in Cardine's 'Semiologie Gregorienne'.\n\nThe lengths of the neumes were given values by adding up the duration values for the separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed in relation to the total duration of the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (''R'') between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (''R'' is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.\n\nThe distinction between the first two rules and the latter rule can also be found in early treatises on music, introducing the terms ''metrum'' and ''rhythmus''.<ref>Peter Wagner (1916).

New York: Norton & Comp., p. 166.</ref> the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences between the individual notes of a neume).\n\nDuring the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries in France, the system of rhythmic notation became standardized, with printers and editors of chant books employing only four rhythmic values. Recent research by Christopher Holman indicates that chants whose texts are in a regular meter could even be altered to be performed in [[Time signature]]<nowiki/>s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holman|first=Christopher|date=November 2017|title=Rhythm and metre in French Classical plainchant|url=https://academic.oup.com/em/article-abstract/45/4/657/4781684|journal=Early Music|volume=45, vol. 4|pages=657\u2013664|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Melodic restitution===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}\nRecent developments involve an intensifying of the semiological approach according to Dom Cardine, which also gave a new impetus to the research into melodic variants in various manuscripts of chant. On the basis of this ongoing research it has become obvious that the Graduale and other chantbooks contain many melodic errors, some very consistently, (the mis-interpretation of third and eighth mode) necessitating a new edition of the Graduale according to state-of-the-art [[melodic restitution]]s. Since the 1970 a melodic restitution group of AISCGre (International Society for the Study of Gregorian Chant) has worked on an \"editio magis critica\" as requested by the 2. Vatican Council Constitution \"Sacrosanctum Concilium\". As a response to this need and following the Holy See's invitation to edit a more critical edition, in 2011 the first volume \"De Dominicis et Festis\" of the ''Graduale Novum Editio Magis Critica Iuxta SC 117'' was published by Libreria Editrice Vatican and ConBrio Verlagsgesellschaft, Regensburg.\n\nIn this approach the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry a wealth of melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison between the two groups has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the ''Graduale Triplex''. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Sankt Gallen.\n\nReferring to these manuscripts, he called his own transcription Gradual Lagal. Furthermore, while making the transcription, he cross-checked with the melodic manuscripts to correct modal errors or other melodic errors found in the Graduale Romanum. His intention was to provide a corrected melody in rhythmic notation but above all \u2013 he was also a choirmaster \u2013 suited for practical use, therefore a simplex, integrated notation. Although fully admitting the importance of Hakkennes' melodic revisions, the rhythmical solution suggested in the ''Graduale Lagal'' was actually found by Van Kampen (see above) to be rather modestly related to the text of the chant.\n\n==Liturgical functions==\nGregorian chant is sung in the Office during the [[canonical hours]] and in the liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Texts known as ''[[Accentus Ecclesiasticus|accentus]]'' are intoned by bishops, priests, and deacons, mostly on a single [[reciting tone]] with simple melodic formulae at certain places in each sentence. More complex chants are sung by trained soloists and choirs. The [[Graduale Romanum]] contains the proper chants of the Mass (i.e., Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Offertory, Communion) and the complete [[Kyriale]] (the collection of Mass Ordinary settings).  The ''[[Liber usualis]]'' contains the chants for the [[Graduale Romanum]] and the most commonly used Office chants.\n\n===Proper chants of the Mass===\nThe Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Sequence, Offertory and Communion chants are part of the [[Proper (liturgy)|Proper]] of the Mass. \"Proprium Missae\" in Latin refers to the chants of the Mass that have their proper individual texts for each Sunday throughout the annual cycle, as opposed to 'Ordinarium Missae' which have fixed texts (but various melodies) (Kyrie, Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei).\n\n[[Introit]]s cover the procession of the officiants. Introits are antiphonal chants, typically consisting of an antiphon, a psalm verse, a repeat of the antiphon, an intonation of the Gloria Patri [[Doxology]], and a final repeat of the antiphon. [[Reciting tone]]s often dominate their melodic structures.\n\n[[Gradual]]s are responsorial chants that follow the reading of the [[Epistle]]. Graduals usually result from ''[[centonization]]''; stock musical phrases are assembled like a patchwork to create the full melody of the chant, creating families of musically related melodies. Graduals are accompanied by an elaborate Verse, so that it actually consists in two different parts, A B. Often the first part is sung again, creating a 'rondeau' A B A. At least the verse, if not the complete gradual, is for the solo cantor and are in elaborate, ornate style with long, wide-ranged melismata.\n\nThe [[Alleluia]] is known for the ''[[jubilus]]'', an extended joyful melisma on the last vowel of 'Alleluia'. The Alleluia is also in two parts, the alleluia proper and the psalmverse, by which the Alleluia is identified (Alleluia V. Pascha nostrum). The last melisma of the verse is the same as the jubilus attached to the Alleluia. Alleluias are not sung during penitential times, such as [[Lent]]. Instead, a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] is chanted, usually with texts from the Psalms. Tracts, like Graduals, are highly centonized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Sequence (poetry)|Sequences]] are sung poems based on couplets. Although many sequences are not part of the liturgy and thus not part of the Gregorian repertory proper, Gregorian sequences include such well-known chants as ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'' and ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]''. According to [[Notker Balbulus]], an early sequence writer, their origins lie in the addition of words to the long melismata of the jubilus of Alleluia chants.<ref>Richard Crocker, ''The Early Medieval Sequence'' pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n[[Offertory|Offertories]] are sung during the offering of Eucharistic bread and wine. Offertories once had highly prolix melodies in their verses, but the use of verses in Gregorian Offertories disappeared around the 12th century. These verses however, are among the most ornate and elaborated in the whole chant repertoire. Offertories are in form closest to Responsories, which are likewise accompanied by at least one Verse and the opening sections of both Off. and Resp. are partly repeated after the verse(s). This last section is therefore called the 'repetenda' and is in performance the last melodic line of the chant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Communion (chant)|Communions]] are sung during the distribution of the [[eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]]. In presentation the Communio is similar to the Introitus, an antiphon with a series of psalm verses. Communion melodies are often tonally ambiguous and do not fit into a single [[musical mode]] which has led to the same communio being classed in different modes in different manuscripts or editions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Ordinary chants of the Mass===\nThe Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei use the same text in every service of the Mass. Because they follow the regular invariable \"order\" of the Mass, these chants are called \"[[Ordinary of the Mass|Ordinary]]\".\n\nThe [[Kyrie]] consists of a threefold repetition of \"Kyrie eleison\" (\"Lord, have mercy\"), a threefold repetition of \"Christe eleison\" (\"Christ have mercy\"), followed by another threefold repetition of \"Kyrie eleison.\" In older chants, \"Kyrie eleison imas\" (\"Lord, have mercy on us\") can be found. The Kyrie is distinguished by its use of the [[Hellenistic Greek|Greek language]] instead of Latin. Because of the textual repetition, various musical repeat structures occur in these chants. The following, Kyrie ad. lib. VI as transmitted in a Cambrai manuscript, uses the form ABA CDC EFE', with shifts in [[tessitura]] between sections. The E' section, on the final \"Kyrie eleison\", itself has an aa'b structure, contributing to the sense of climax.<ref>Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 153.</ref>\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Kyrie 55, Vatican ad lib. VI, Cambrai.ogg|title=Kyrie 55, Vatican ad lib. VI, from Cambrai, Bibl. Mun. 61, fo.155v, as transcribed by David Hiley|description=Example of musical repeat structures in Gregorian chant}}\nThe [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] recites the Greater [[Doxology]], and the [[Credo]] intones the [[Nicene Creed]]. Because of the length of these texts, these chants often break into musical subsections corresponding with textual breaks. Because the Credo was the last Ordinary chant to be added to the Mass, there are relatively few Credo melodies in the Gregorian corpus.\n\nThe [[Sanctus]] and the [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]], like the Kyrie, also contain repeated texts, which their musical structures often exploit.\n\nTechnically, the [[Ite missa est]] and the [[Benedicamus Domino]], which conclude the Mass, belong to the Ordinary. They have their own Gregorian melodies, but because they are short and simple, and have rarely been the subject of later musical composition, they are often omitted in discussion.\n\n[[File:Salve Regina.png|thumb|left|Plainchant notation for the solemn setting of the [[Salve Regina]]; a simple setting is used more commonly.]]\n\n===Chants of the Office===\nGregorian chant is sung in the [[canonical hours]] of the [[monastic]] Office, primarily in antiphons used to sing the [[Psalms]], in the Great [[Responsory|Responsories]] of [[Matins]], and the Short Responsories of the Lesser Hours and [[Compline]]. The psalm antiphons of the Office tend to be short and simple, especially compared to the complex Great Responsories.\n\nAt the close of the Office, one of four ''[[Marian antiphon]]s'' is sung. These songs, ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'' (see top of article), ''Ave Regina caelorum'', ''Regina caeli laetare'', and ''Salve, Regina'', are relatively late chants, dating to the 11th century, and considerably more complex than most Office antiphons. [[Willi Apel]] has described these four songs as \"among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages.\"<ref>Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 404.</ref>\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Alma Redemptoris Mater.ogg|title=Alma Redemptoris Mater|description=Marian antiphon sung at Compline and Lauds between the First Sunday of Advent and Candlemas|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n==Influence==\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance music===\nGregorian chant had a significant impact on the development of [[medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]]. Modern staff notation developed directly from Gregorian neumes. The square notation that had been devised for plainchant was borrowed and adapted for other kinds of music. Certain groupings of neumes were used to indicate repeating rhythms called [[rhythmic mode]]s. Rounded noteheads increasingly replaced the older squares and lozenges in the 15th and 16th centuries, although chantbooks conservatively maintained the square notation. By the 16th century, the fifth line added to the [[staff (music)|musical staff]] had become standard. The [[bass clef]] and the [[Flat (music)|flat]], [[Natural sign|natural]], and [[sharp (music)|sharp]] accidentals derived directly from Gregorian notation.<ref>Chew, Geoffrey and Richard Rastall: \"Notation\", ''Grove Music Online'', ed. L. Macy (Accessed 27&nbsp;June&nbsp;2006) (subscription access)]</ref>\n\nGregorian melodies provided musical material and served as models for tropes and [[liturgical drama]]s. Vernacular hymns such as \"[[Christ ist erstanden]]\" and \"[[Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist]]\" adapted original Gregorian melodies to translated texts. Secular tunes such as the popular Renaissance \"[[In Nomine]]\" were based on Gregorian melodies. Beginning with the improvised harmonizations of Gregorian chant known as [[organum]], Gregorian chants became a driving force in medieval and Renaissance [[polyphony]]. Often, a Gregorian chant (sometimes in modified form) would be used as a ''[[cantus firmus]]'', so that the consecutive notes of the chant determined the harmonic progression. The Marian antiphons, especially ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'', were frequently arranged by Renaissance composers. The use of chant as a cantus firmus was the predominant practice until the [[Baroque]] period, when the stronger harmonic progressions made possible by an independent bass line became standard.\n\nThe Catholic Church later allowed polyphonic arrangements to replace the Gregorian chant of the Ordinary of the Mass. This is why the Mass as a compositional form, as set by composers like [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], features a Kyrie but not an Introit. The Propers may also be replaced by choral settings on certain solemn occasions. Among the composers who most frequently wrote polyphonic settings of the Propers were [[William Byrd]] and [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]. These polyphonic arrangements usually incorporate elements of the original chant.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alternatim]]\n* [[Anglican chant]]\n* [[Cecilian Movement]]\n* [[Damien Poisblaud]]\n* [[Paul Jausions]]\n* [[Schola Antiqua, Madrid|Schola Antiqua]]\n* [[Semiology (Gregorian Chant)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{col div|colwidth=45em}}\n* ''Graduale Triplex'' (1979).

Copenhagen]]. He is also a full international for the [[Denmark national football team]] and was chosen to represent his country at [[UEFA Euro 2004]], the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early years===\nStarting his career at the youth teams of [[Hvidovre IF]], he moved youth setup of multiple Danish champions [[Br\u00f8ndby IF]]. When he was no longer seen as a long-term prospect for the Br\u00f8ndby goalkeeping position, he left Br\u00f8ndby in the winter 1999, to rejoin Hvidovre. Andersen made his senior debut for [[Hvidovre IF]] in the lower league [[Danish 1st Division]], and was recognized as a big talent.\n\n===AB===\nIn March 2002, Hvidovre owner, and professional goalkeeper, [[Peter Schmeichel]] chose to end his engagement in the club. Hvidovre actively sought to off-load Andersen, one of only two professional players in the squad. He was initially wanted by a number of clubs in [[Football in England|English football]], including Schmeichel's club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], the club of Danish international goalkeeper [[Thomas S\u00f8rensen]]. Sunderland opted to buy [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] goalkeeper [[Thomas Myhre]] instead, and no other foreign offers materialized. Andersen moved to [[Akademisk Boldklub]] (AB) in the top-flight [[Danish Superliga]] championship in August 2002.\n\n===Charlton Athletic===\nHe moved abroad to join English club [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in a [[Danish krone|DKK]] 8 million [[transfer deal]] in June 2004.<ref name=\"brondbyswitch\">Charlton Athletic (29 November 2006).

Due to an injury sustained by first choice goalkeeper [[Dean Kiely]], Andersen started the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005\u201306 season]] in the team. Charlton's poor mid-season form saw him dropped in favour of Kiely at first, then Thomas Myhre, who established himself as first choice as Charlton turned their season around. Andersen was reinstated into the lineup for the last two games of the season, when Myhre suffered an injury. In the 2006 summer [[transfer window]], Andersen looked ready to join [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on a season-long [[loan (football)|loan deal]],<ref name=BBC1>BBC.co.uk (31 August 2006).

It would be four-and-a-half years before he got his second cap. He was selected as a backup goalkeeper for the Danish national team squad at the 2004 European Championship, where Thomas S\u00f8rensen was preferred as the starting goalkeeper in every game. While playing for Br\u00f8ndby, Andersen got his second cap in September 2008, and replaced the injured Thomas S\u00f8rensen for three games in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]].

Copenhagen]]. He is also a full international for the [[Denmark national football team]] and was chosen to represent his country at [[UEFA Euro 2004]], the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early years===\nStarting his career at the youth teams of [[Hvidovre IF]], he moved youth setup of multiple Danish champions [[Br\u00f8ndby IF]]. When he was no longer seen as a long-term prospect for the Br\u00f8ndby goalkeeping position, he left Br\u00f8ndby in the winter 1999, to rejoin Hvidovre. Andersen made his senior debut for [[Hvidovre IF]] in the lower league [[Danish 1st Division]], and was recognized as a big talent.\n\n===AB===\nIn March 2002, Hvidovre owner, and professional goalkeeper, [[Peter Schmeichel]] chose to end his engagement in the club. Hvidovre actively sought to off-load Andersen, one of only two professional players in the squad. He was initially wanted by a number of clubs in [[Football in England|English football]], including Schmeichel's club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], the club of Danish international goalkeeper [[Thomas S\u00f8rensen]]. Sunderland opted to buy [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] goalkeeper [[Thomas Myhre]] instead, and no other foreign offers materialized. Andersen moved to [[Akademisk Boldklub]] (AB) in the top-flight [[Danish Superliga]] championship in August 2002.\n\n===Charlton Athletic===\nHe moved abroad to join English club [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in a [[Danish krone|DKK]] 8 million [[transfer deal]] in June 2004.<ref name=\"brondbyswitch\">Charlton Athletic (29 November 2006).

Charlton's poor mid-season form saw him dropped in favour of Kiely at first, then Thomas Myhre, who established himself as first choice as Charlton turned their season around. Andersen was reinstated into the lineup for the last two games of the season, when Myhre suffered an injury. In the 2006 summer [[transfer window]], Andersen looked ready to join [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on a season-long [[loan (football)|loan deal]],<ref name=BBC1>BBC.co.uk (31 August 2006).

It would be four-and-a-half years before he got his second cap. He was selected as a backup goalkeeper for the Danish national team squad at the 2004 European Championship, where Thomas S\u00f8rensen was preferred as the starting goalkeeper in every game. While playing for Br\u00f8ndby, Andersen got his second cap in September 2008, and replaced the injured Thomas S\u00f8rensen for three games in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]].

He challenged once for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] heavyweight title in 1998. He retired with a record of 37 wins (24 by knockout), 6 losses, and 1 draw.\n\n==Professional career==\nFischer made his professional debut in July 1995, a draw. He soon amassed a record of 11-0-1 and captured the German International Heavyweight title, before facing then 17\u20130 fellow German Kim Weber in October 1996, in a battle for Fischer's international German as well as the vacant Germany BDB Heavyweight title. Fischer lost via unanimous decision.\n\nFischer would bounce back however, winning his next 10 fights to amass a 21\u20131\u20131 record. He was then awarded a title shot for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO heavyweight]] title in September 1998 against then-champion [[Herbie Hide]]. Fischer lost via a late-round TKO.\n\nFischer won his next four before facing Kim Weber in a rematch for the German International (BDB) Heavyweight title, winning via majority decision. Fischer was then set to fight [[Timo Hoffmann]] for both Fischer's title and Hoffman's Germany BDB Heavyweight title in May 2000. Fischer lost via unanimous decision. After also dropping his next fight to 9-0 Rene Monse for the vacant International BDB title, Fischer would go 11\u20132 in his last 13 fights, the pair of losses being in bouts for the Germany BDB Heavyweight titles in 2003 and 2004.

is a German former [[professional boxer]]. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] he competed at the [[Boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]]. He challenged once for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] heavyweight title in 1998. He retired with a record of 37 wins (24 by knockout), 6 losses, and 1 draw.\n\n==Professional career==\nFischer made his professional debut in July 1995, a draw. He soon amassed a record of 11-0-1 and captured the German International Heavyweight title, before facing then 17\u20130 fellow German Kim Weber in October 1996, in a battle for Fischer's international German as well as the vacant Germany BDB Heavyweight title. Fischer lost via unanimous decision.\n\nFischer would bounce back however, winning his next 10 fights to amass a 21\u20131\u20131 record. He was then awarded a title shot for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO heavyweight]] title in September 1998 against then-champion [[Herbie Hide]]. Fischer lost via a late-round TKO.\n\nFischer won his next four before facing Kim Weber in a rematch for the German International (BDB) Heavyweight title, winning via majority decision. Fischer was then set to fight [[Timo Hoffmann]] for both Fischer's title and Hoffman's Germany BDB Heavyweight title in May 2000. Fischer lost via unanimous decision. After also dropping his next fight to 9-0 Rene Monse for the vacant International BDB title, Fischer would go 11\u20132 in his last 13 fights, the pair of losses being in bouts for the Germany BDB Heavyweight titles in 2003 and 2004. Fischer retired in 2009.\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|ko-wins=24\n|ko-losses=1\n|dec-wins=13\n|dec-losses=5\n|draws=1\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"
