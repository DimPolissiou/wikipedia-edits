It was originally isolated from [[cotton]] as a [[pathogen]] causing [[stigmatomycosis]] by [[Sydney Francis Ashby|Ashby]] and [[William Nowell|Nowell]] in 1926. This disease affects the development of [[hair cell]]s in cotton bolls and can be transmitted to citrus fruits, which thereupon dry out and collapse (dry rot disease). In the first part of the 20th century, {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} and two other fungi causing stigmatomycosis ({{btname|[[Eremothecium coryli]]}}, {{btname|[[Aureobasidium pullulans]]}}) made it virtually impossible to grow cotton in certain regions of the subtropics, causing severe economical losses.

This made it an interesting organism for industries, where genetically modified strains are still used to produce this [[vitamin]].\n\n=={{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} as a model organism==\nA few years ago, {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} became recognized as an attractive [[model organism|model]] to study the growth of long and [[multinucleate]] fungal cells ([[hypha]]e) because of its small [[genome]], [[Ploidy|haploid]] [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], and efficient [[gene targeting]] methods. It is generally assumed that a better understanding of filamentous fungal growth will greatly stimulate the development of novel [[fungicide]]s. Its use as a [[model organism]] is particularly promising because of the high level of [[Gene orders|gene order]] conservation ([[synteny]]) between the [[genome]]s of {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} and the yeast {{btname|[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]}}.\n\n==Genome==\nThe complete [[sequencing]] and [[annotation]] of the entire {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} genome, as published in 2004, was initiated when a significant degree of [[gene]] [[synteny]] was observed in preliminary studies in comparison to the genome of budding yeast, {{btname|Saccharomyces cerevisiae}}. This not only helped to improve gene annotation of {{btname|S.&nbsp;cerevisiae}}, but also allowed the [[Ancestral reconstruction|reconstruction]] of the [[evolutionary]] history of both organisms. {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} and {{btname|S.&nbsp;cerevisiae}} originated from a common [[ancestor]] which carried about 5000&nbsp;genes. [[Genetic divergence|Divergence]] of these two close relatives started some 100&nbsp;million years ago. One branch of evolution involving up to 100&nbsp;viable [[genome rearrangement]]s ([[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]] and [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]]), a few million [[base pair]] changes, and a limited number of gene [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Gene duplication|duplications]] and additions lead to modern {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} with its 4718&nbsp;protein-coding genes and 9.2&nbsp;million base pairs (smallest genome of a free-living eukaryote yet characterized) spread over seven [[chromosomes]]. The genome of {{btname|S.&nbsp;cerevisiae}} underwent a more eventful evolution, which includes a whole-genome duplication.\n\nDespite the long evolutionary history of the two organisms and fundamentally different ways of growth and development, the complete synteny map of both genomes reveals 95% of {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} genes are [[Homology (biology)|orthologs]] of {{btname|S.&nbsp;cerevisiae}} genes, and 90% map within blocks of synteny (syntenic [[Homology (biology)|homologs]]).\n\n==Growth, development and morphology==\n[[Image:A gossypii Dev.png|thumb|left|300px| Development from a spore to a mature mycelium in {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} (kindly provided by Dr.&nbsp;Philipp Knechtle)<br />\na) Ungerminated spore <br />\nb) Isotropic growth phase in the germ bubble <br />\nc) Unipolar germling <br />\nd) Emergence of a second germ tube <br />\ne) Emergence of lateral branches and septum generation <br />\nf) Apical branching in mature hypha]]\nThe {{btname|E.&nbsp;gossypii}} [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] starts with the only known phase of [[Isotropy|isotropic]] growth in [[wild type]]: [[germination]] of the [[Ploidy|haploid]] [[spore]] to form a germ bubble. This is followed by [[Apical membrane|apical]] growth, extending two germ tubes in succession on opposing sites of the germ bubble. More axes of polarity are established with [[wiktionary:lateral|lateral]] branch formation in young [[mycelium]]. Maturation is characterized by apical branching (tip splitting) and a dramatic increase of growth speed (up to 200&nbsp;\u03bcm/h at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C), which enables it to cover an 8&nbsp;cm [[Petri dish]] of [[Growth medium|full medium]] in about seven days. [[Sporulation]] is thought to be induced by [[nutrient]] deprivation, leading to contraction at the [[Septum|septa]], [[cytokinesis]] and subsequent abscission of [[Sporangium|sporangia]] which contain up to eight [[Ploidy|haploid]] spores.

It is considered the worst [[flood]] in the city's history since 1557. With the combined effort of Italian and foreign volunteers alike, or ''angeli del fango'' (\"Mud Angels\"), many of these fine works have been restored. New methods in [[Art conservation|conservation]] were devised and [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]] laboratories established. However, even decades later, much work remains to be done.\n\n== Overview ==\nLocated in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Central Italy]], the [[Arno]] river is approximately {{convert|240|km|mi}} long.  It flows from the Mount Falterona hills of the [[Apennine Mountains]] to the [[Ligurian Sea]], just {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} west of [[Pisa]].

The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the [[orography]] of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via de Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the [[floodplain]] with great force.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Florence Floods: 4 November 1966 | journal=The Geographical Journal | date=June 1967 | volume=133 | issue=2 | pages=277\u20139}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline of events ==\n[[File:1966 Arno Florence flood 2008.JPG|thumb|Square in Florence with a white [[high water mark]] of the 1966 flood.

City officials and citizens were unprepared for the storm and the widespread devastation that it caused. There were virtually no emergency measures in place, at least partially because Florence is located in an area where the frequency of flooding is relatively low. In fact, approximately 90% of the city's population were completely unaware of the imminent disaster.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nResidents were set to celebrate their country's World War I victory over [[Austria]] on 4 November, [[Armed Forces Day#Italy|Armed Forces Day]]. In commemoration, businesses were closed and many of their employees were out of town for the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, with the exception of a number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen.\n\n5,000 families were left homeless by the storm, and 6,000 stores were forced out of business.  Approximately 600,000 tons of mud, rubble and sewage severely damaged or destroyed numerous collections of books, manuscripts and fine art. In fact, it is estimated that between 3 and 4 million books and manuscripts were damaged, as well as 14,000 movable works of art.<ref name=\"Clarkson, Christopher 2003\" />\n\nArtist [[Marco Sassone]], in a 1969 interview, recalled the impact of the flood on Florence's residents: \"The only thing you could do was watch and be helpless.

Art historian and professor Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti assembled a committee with [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor Piero Bargellini]] as chairman to raise awareness of the needs of Florence's art and academic institutions. Members included prominent figures from around the world, representatives of their own respective institutions.\n\nA number of other international committees were formed with the intention of sponsoring various institutions in Florence:\n* The Franco-Italian Committee aided the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena di Pazzi in Borgo Pinti.\n* The U.S. Committee to Rescue Italian Art, composed of 25 sub-committees and chaired by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], assisted in restoring frescoes around the city.\n* The Viennese armory was responsible for restoring the arms and armor of the [[Bargello]] Museum.\n* A Dutch committee sponsored the Buonarroti House Museum.\n* A group of Germans repaired the musical instruments of the Bardini Museum.\nThe work of and contributions made by these committees were supervised by a central committee in Rome.\n\nAdditional funding came from various governments, [[UNESCO]], and the International Committee for the Assistance of Museums, Works of Art, Libraries and Archives, among others.  The city of [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland), twinned with Florence, sent practical help for the citizens in the form of double-decker buses to temporarily replace those which had been lost in the floods.  When these eventually returned home, they operated with the international 'GB' registration plate still affixed to the rear; each also carried a small plaque presented by the Florentine transport authorities indicating their gratitude for the gesture made by the people of Edinburgh.\n\nCharity auctions were also organised. In a show of support for the Florentine art community, [[Pablo Picasso]] had one of his paintings, ''Recumbent Woman Reading'', auctioned off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, [[Pietro Annigoni]] and [[Luciano Guarnieri]] donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour [[lithographs]] (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings.\n\nFlorentine native [[Franco Zeffirelli]] produced the short documentary ''[[Florence: Days of Destruction]]'' to raise awareness of the flood. Released a month after the disaster, it reputedly raised more than $20 million for reconstruction efforts.<ref name='NGA'>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art \u2013 Videos and Podcasts, December 2011 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=29 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201205345/http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |archivedate=1 December 2012 }}</ref> The film was narrated in English and Italian by actor [[Richard Burton]].<ref name='DukeLib'>{{cite web| url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/preservation/2012/02/15/florence-days-of-destruction-a-film-by-franco-zeffirelli/|title=Preservation Underground \u2013 Florence: Days of Destruction (A Film by Franco Zeffirelli)|publisher=Duke University Library|accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile many institutions from around the world financially compensated employees who travelled to Italy and aided in the restoration of Florence, many others volunteered their services for absolutely no pay.

Thirty years earlier, he was a professor who lent his assistance in preserving the priceless artifacts of Florence. The Angels cleaned the city of refuse, mud and oil, and retrieved works of art, books and other materials from flooded rooms; experts from around the world volunteered their time and knowledge in the conservation of the aforementioned materials.\n\nIn a 1996 interview, Primicerio offered three principal reasons as to why the Mud Angels felt compelled to help: a concern for future generations, a feeling of international unity and a pervasive sense of solidarity.<ref>{{cite interview|first=Mario |last=Primicerio |url=http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |title=We are really delighted to invite the Mud Angels to Florence: Interview with Mario Primicerio, the Mayor of Florence |year=1996 |accessdate=21 February 2007  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217085124/http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|What we were doing was dictated by the desire to give back the traces of the history of the past to future generations, so that it could be used for the spiritual growth of people who perhaps had yet to be born...it was the international community that worked to try to save Florence, this unique patrimony which belonged to the whole world.|Mario Primicerio|Speciale Alluvione}}\n\n===The \"Flood Ladies\"===\nThe [[Flood Ladies]] were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artists Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.\n\n== Conservation measures ==\nMany experts in the field of conservation, such as [[Peter Waters]], utilised their knowledge in restoring the works of art and literature ravaged by the flood. Staff from the Central Institute of Restoration and Institute of Book Pathology, for example, volunteered their time, efforts, and expertise in this enormous undertaking. New concepts, such as \"phased conservation\", and methods in conservation, such as mass deacidification, were conceived during this period after the flood ravaged the city of Florence.<ref name=\"channel4.com\">{{cite web | title = Cities and Disaster: The Florence Flood of 1966 | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| accessdate =5 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070517215628/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| archivedate= 17 May 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Books and records===\nPriorities were established during the process of conserving damaged books and records, the most critical of which became the retrieval of materials from flooded rooms. After they were rescued, books and records were typically washed and disinfected. In certain cases, [[Bookbinding|bindings]] were cut and sheets treated individually.  Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as [[kiln|tobacco kilns]] and [[granaries]]. In some circumstances, large numbers of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books.\n\nOne or both of two drying techniques was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying with the aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the [[humidity]] level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately.  Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a [[clothes line]].\n\nFearing the spread of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], workers completed these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, the items were then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. [[Library catalog|Card catalogs]] and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early [[Printing press|presses]], [[photocopying]], or copying by hand.<ref name=\"Clarkson, Christopher 2003\" /><ref name=\"Batini 1967\" />\n<ref name=\"The Florentine Flood Disaster\">{{cite journal | title=The Florentine Flood Disaster | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=April 1967 | volume=109 | issue=769 | pages=192\u20134}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Libraries and Archives of Florence | journal=Times Literary Supplement | date=1 December 1966| first=Nicolai | last=Rubinstein | page=1133 }}</ref><ref>{{cite video | url = http://data.scl.utah.edu/fmi/xsl/stream/details.xsl?-recid=354&a::v=1O9iEOa749 | title = The Restoration of Books: Florence 1968 | medium = DVD | publisher = Royal College of Art | location = London | date = 1968 | accessdate = 27 February 2007  }}{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====The National Library Centers of Florence: a case study====\nInitially the transportation of large numbers of books to other institutes (to repair and rebind) was considered, but decided against on logistical grounds. Within six months of the flood, the National Library of Florence had 144 workers on hand: three binders, eight binder trainees, two librarians, forty-two workmen, eighty-one student volunteers and eight other library staff members.\n\nTogether they devised a logical and efficient method of book repair, involving nine separate and clearly defined steps:\n\n* Books were selected for treatment. The details of work to be done were recorded on a formatted card that accompanied its respective book throughout its treatment. Once work was completed, the card was permanently filed. A universal language utilising symbols, created with [[foreign worker]]s in mind, was employed in the formatting of this card.  Symbols were assigned to key phrases that communicated the condition of each book and how its repair was to be conducted, such as:\n** historically important \u2013 only to be dealt with by experts\n** incomplete\n** medium mud\n** rebind\n** collation part missing\n* The book was photographed.\n* The book's collation was verified and its covers removed and stored in a marked case (if they were to be used in a new binding).\n* If necessary, the book was carefully taken apart to wash it in warm water and disinfect it with Topane ([[pentachlorophenol]]).\n* In certain cases, the leaves of the book were [[mass deacidification|deacidified]] and buffered.\n* The text-block was pressed.\n* The text-block was dried in specially designed cabinets.\n* Sections of the book were then reconstructed and the text-blocks collated.\n* Finally, each book was wrapped in a paper sheet that had been impregnated with an antimicrobial substance, then they were set aside for any later repair or rebinding. The binding was completed in the main reading room of the library, which had been converted (temporarily) for this purpose.\n\nThis methodical nine-part system enabled workers to process between seventy and a hundred books a day.<ref name=\"Clarkson, Christopher 2003\" />\n\nAfter the Florence flood, the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale was not allowed to put books back into the lower levels.<ref>Lenzuni, Anna. \"Coping with Disaster\".

M\u00fcnchen: Saur, 1987.</ref>\n\n===Paintings===\nMany panel paintings were critically damaged as a result of water saturating their wood, causing the glue and [[gesso]], which compose the priming layer, to dissolve. Consequently, the paintings' colours dissolved as well. In addition, the moisture caused paintings to buckle and crack or develop blisters, and the paint to chip and fall.  Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying [[rice paper]] to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. [[Nystatin]], an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing. Treatment facilities were established at locations such as the Boboli Garden Lemon-House, where over two hundred of these panel paintings were restored.\n\nSimilar measures were necessary to conserve canvas paintings. First, an original canvas was relined and gauze applied to the painted surface, which was then ironed. This process is referred to as the ''rintelatura'', or \"new canvas\" method. Relatively minor surface work was often completed with a variety of solvents and/or types of [[resin]].\n\n===Frescoes===\n[[Fresco]]es demanded more complicated treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave a layer of residual salt on the surface of the wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant [[efflorescence]] obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached.\n\nFuel oil, which coated many painted works of art, was removed by using Japanese tissue paper to apply a solvent, which dissolved the tar. An [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], such as [[talcum powder]], was then distributed on the tissue paper.\n\n===Sculpture and other objects===\nIt became imperative to clean sculpture immediately, before it fully absorbed the oil. Flaking sculpture was sprayed with a [[silicate]] mixture, while wooden pieces were treated with [[insecticides]] and toxic gases to kill insects and prevent future infestation. [[Weapon]]ry, like firearms and swords, were taken apart, cleaned with [[Kerosene|paraffin]], and finally lubricated to prevent future rusting.\n\n[[Bronze]] objects were kept in dehumidification chambers for a few weeks and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed \"depth cleaning\", which entailed the use of small drills and vacuuming. Similar measures were taken with gold.  Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation.<ref name=\"Batini 1967\" /><ref name=\"The Florentine Flood Disaster\" />\n\n===Effect on preservation and conservation awareness===\nThe disastrous results of the flood established an international awareness of the need for preservation and conservation education and facilities.  In the United States, for example, it is no coincidence that the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] was passed in 1966.<ref>{{cite book | last=Stipe | first=Robert and Antoinette J.

In terms of geographic interest, distinctions among the regions are no longer drawn. Membership in the National Trust for Historic Preservation grew from 10,700 in 1966 to 185,000 in 1986. More than 35 university graduate professional and technical courses directly related to historic preservation were created in the interim. It would be reasonable to estimate that more than 54,000 jobs were created in the administrative aspect of preservation alone.|Robert E. Stipe and Antoinette J. Lee}}\n\n===Work outstanding===\nA significant amount of restorative work remains to be done in Florence.  Due to a lack of awareness, funding, and manpower, a great number of works of art and books lie in storage, dirty and damaged.  Christopher Clarkson, noted conservator, called attention to this problem in a 2007 letter, stating that the National Library still has a \"warehouse\" full of books to be repaired and bound; many others need cleaning or reassembling.  According to a 1993 report, approximately 25% of the 80,000 items belonging to the Magliabecchi and Palatino collections had not been fully restored in the nearly thirty years since the flood.  The number of conservators that work at the library presently is only about a tenth of the amount that worked there immediately after the flood.<ref name=\"channel4.com\"/>\n\n==Environmental measures==\n\nRegional officials in Tuscany are responsible for organizing a massive project, the purpose of which is to not only protect the area from future flooding but to maintain high water quality and effectively utilize water resources.\n\nWork commenced in 1984, with the construction of the Bilancino Dam, near Florence.  The Sieve tributary and spillway at [[Pontedera]] are among other developments.  The national government has funded a majority of these various subprojects, with the city of Florence being the primary recipient of the money.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bilancino Dam, A Reservoir for Florence | url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm | accessdate =1 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041221224245/http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm |archivedate = 21 December 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[1966 Venice flood]]\n* [[Architectural conservation]]\n* [[Byron Gallery]]; New York based art gallery that hosted a benefit for flood victims in 1967.\n* [[Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage]]\n* [[Historic preservation]]\n* [[History of Florence]]\n* [[History of Italy]]\n* [[Natural disaster]]\n* [[Peter Waters]]\n* [[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | first = Kathrine Kressman | last = Taylor | title = Diary of Florence in Flood | place = New York | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 1969 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|1966 Flood of Florence}}\n* [http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/ealluvho.htm Speciale Alluvione] Images of the flood and interviews with notable figures regarding its impact\n* [http://www.florence-flood.com The Florence Flood] News, archives, and photos for the Florence flood of 1966\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071105043643/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html Cities and Disaster: The Florence Flood of 1966] A summary of events surrounding the flood.\n*[https://www.sba.unifi.it/p1628.html?newlang=eng CEDAF Documentation Center on Florence Floods.]  \n \n[[Category:Floods in Italy]]\n[[Category:1966 in Italy|Flood of the River Arno, 1966]]\n[[Category:Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration of paintings]]\n[[Category:1966 floods]]\n[[Category:November 1966 events]]\n[[Category:20th century in Florence]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\nThe '''1966 flood of the Arno''' ({{lang-it|Alluvione di Firenze del 4 novembre 1966}}) in [[Florence]] killed 101 people and damaged or destroyed millions of masterpieces of art and rare books. It is considered the worst [[flood]] in the city's history since 1557. With the combined effort of Italian and foreign volunteers alike, or ''angeli del fango'' (\"Mud Angels\"), many of these fine works have been restored. New methods in [[Art conservation|conservation]] were devised and [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]] laboratories established.

The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the [[orography]] of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via de Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the [[floodplain]] with great force.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Florence Floods: 4 November 1966 | journal=The Geographical Journal | date=June 1967 | volume=133 | issue=2 | pages=277\u20139}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline of events ==\n[[File:1966 Arno Florence flood 2008.JPG|thumb|Square in Florence with a white [[high water mark]] of the 1966 flood.

City officials and citizens were unprepared for the storm and the widespread devastation that it caused. There were virtually no emergency measures in place, at least partially because Florence is located in an area where the frequency of flooding is relatively low. In fact, approximately 90% of the city's population were completely unaware of the imminent disaster.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nResidents were set to celebrate their country's World War I victory over [[Austria]] on 4 November, [[Armed Forces Day#Italy|Armed Forces Day]]. In commemoration, businesses were closed and many of their employees were out of town for the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, with the exception of a number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen.\n\n5,000 families were left homeless by the storm, and 6,000 stores were forced out of business.  Approximately 600,000 tons of mud, rubble and sewage severely damaged or destroyed numerous collections of books, manuscripts and fine art. In fact, it is estimated that between 3 and 4 million books and manuscripts were damaged, as well as 14,000 movable works of art.<ref name=\"Clarkson, Christopher 2003\" />\n\nArtist [[Marco Sassone]], in a 1969 interview, recalled the impact of the flood on Florence's residents: \"The only thing you could do was watch and be helpless.

Art historian and professor Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti assembled a committee with [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor Piero Bargellini]] as chairman to raise awareness of the needs of Florence's art and academic institutions. Members included prominent figures from around the world, representatives of their own respective institutions.\n\nA number of other international committees were formed with the intention of sponsoring various institutions in Florence:\n* The Franco-Italian Committee aided the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena di Pazzi in Borgo Pinti.\n* The U.S. Committee to Rescue Italian Art, composed of 25 sub-committees and chaired by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], assisted in restoring frescoes around the city.\n* The Viennese armory was responsible for restoring the arms and armor of the [[Bargello]] Museum.\n* A Dutch committee sponsored the Buonarroti House Museum.\n* A group of Germans repaired the musical instruments of the Bardini Museum.\nThe work of and contributions made by these committees were supervised by a central committee in Rome.\n\nAdditional funding came from various governments, [[UNESCO]], and the International Committee for the Assistance of Museums, Works of Art, Libraries and Archives, among others.  The city of [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland), twinned with Florence, sent practical help for the citizens in the form of double-decker buses to temporarily replace those which had been lost in the floods.  When these eventually returned home, they operated with the international 'GB' registration plate still affixed to the rear; each also carried a small plaque presented by the Florentine transport authorities indicating their gratitude for the gesture made by the people of Edinburgh.\n\nCharity auctions were also organised. In a show of support for the Florentine art community, [[Pablo Picasso]] had one of his paintings, ''Recumbent Woman Reading'', auctioned off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, [[Pietro Annigoni]] and [[Luciano Guarnieri]] donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour [[lithographs]] (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings.\n\nFlorentine native [[Franco Zeffirelli]] produced the short documentary ''[[Florence: Days of Destruction]]'' to raise awareness of the flood. Released a month after the disaster, it reputedly raised more than $20 million for reconstruction efforts.<ref name='NGA'>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art \u2013 Videos and Podcasts, December 2011 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=29 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201205345/http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |archivedate=1 December 2012 }}</ref> The film was narrated in English and Italian by actor [[Richard Burton]].<ref name='DukeLib'>{{cite web| url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/preservation/2012/02/15/florence-days-of-destruction-a-film-by-franco-zeffirelli/|title=Preservation Underground \u2013 Florence: Days of Destruction (A Film by Franco Zeffirelli)|publisher=Duke University Library|accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile many institutions from around the world financially compensated employees who travelled to Italy and aided in the restoration of Florence, many others volunteered their services for absolutely no pay. Collectively, these people have been fondly referred to as \"Mud Angels\", due to their commitment to working in such deplorable conditions.<ref name=\"Batini 1967\">{{cite book | last=Batini | first=Giorgio | title=4 November 1966: The River Arno in the Museums of Florence:Galleries, Monuments, Churches, Libraries, Archives and Masterpieces Damaged by the Flood | year=1967 | publisher=Bonechi | location=Florence}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Thorough flood... | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=November 1986 | volume=128 | issue=1004 | page=779}}</ref>\n\n===The \"Mud Angels\"===\n[[List of mayors of Florence|Mario Primicerio]], the mayor of Florence from 1995 to 1999, helped celebrate the Mud Angels' (''angeli del fango'') efforts during an anniversary celebration in 1996. Thirty years earlier, he was a professor who lent his assistance in preserving the priceless artifacts of Florence. The Angels cleaned the city of refuse, mud and oil, and retrieved works of art, books and other materials from flooded rooms; experts from around the world volunteered their time and knowledge in the conservation of the aforementioned materials.\n\nIn a 1996 interview, Primicerio offered three principal reasons as to why the Mud Angels felt compelled to help: a concern for future generations, a feeling of international unity and a pervasive sense of solidarity.<ref>{{cite interview|first=Mario |last=Primicerio |url=http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |title=We are really delighted to invite the Mud Angels to Florence: Interview with Mario Primicerio, the Mayor of Florence |year=1996 |accessdate=21 February 2007  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217085124/http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|What we were doing was dictated by the desire to give back the traces of the history of the past to future generations, so that it could be used for the spiritual growth of people who perhaps had yet to be born...it was the international community that worked to try to save Florence, this unique patrimony which belonged to the whole world.|Mario Primicerio|Speciale Alluvione}}\n\n===The \"Flood Ladies\"===\nThe [[Flood Ladies]] were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artists Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.\n\n== Conservation measures ==\nMany experts in the field of conservation, such as [[Peter Waters]], utilised their knowledge in restoring the works of art and literature ravaged by the flood. Staff from the Central Institute of Restoration and Institute of Book Pathology, for example, volunteered their time, efforts, and expertise in this enormous undertaking. New concepts, such as \"phased conservation\", and methods in conservation, such as mass deacidification, were conceived during this period after the flood ravaged the city of Florence.<ref name=\"channel4.com\">{{cite web | title = Cities and Disaster: The Florence Flood of 1966 | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| accessdate =5 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070517215628/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| archivedate= 17 May 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Books and records===\nPriorities were established during the process of conserving damaged books and records, the most critical of which became the retrieval of materials from flooded rooms. After they were rescued, books and records were typically washed and disinfected. In certain cases, [[Bookbinding|bindings]] were cut and sheets treated individually.  Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as [[kiln|tobacco kilns]] and [[granaries]]. In some circumstances, large numbers of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books.\n\nOne or both of two drying techniques was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying with the aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the [[humidity]] level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately.  Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a [[clothes line]].\n\nFearing the spread of [[mold]], workers completed these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, the items were then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. [[Library catalog|Card catalogs]] and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early [[Printing press|presses]], [[photocopying]], or copying by hand.<ref name=\"Clarkson, Christopher 2003\" /><ref name=\"Batini 1967\" />\n<ref name=\"The Florentine Flood Disaster\">{{cite journal | title=The Florentine Flood Disaster | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=April 1967 | volume=109 | issue=769 | pages=192\u20134}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Libraries and Archives of Florence | journal=Times Literary Supplement | date=1 December 1966| first=Nicolai | last=Rubinstein | page=1133 }}</ref><ref>{{cite video | url = http://data.scl.utah.edu/fmi/xsl/stream/details.xsl?-recid=354&a::v=1O9iEOa749 | title = The Restoration of Books: Florence 1968 | medium = DVD | publisher = Royal College of Art | location = London | date = 1968 | accessdate = 27 February 2007  }}{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====The National Library Centers of Florence: a case study====\nInitially the transportation of large numbers of books to other institutes (to repair and rebind) was considered, but decided against on logistical grounds. Within six months of the flood, the National Library of Florence had 144 workers on hand: three binders, eight binder trainees, two librarians, forty-two workmen, eighty-one student volunteers and eight other library staff members.\n\nTogether they devised a logical and efficient method of book repair, involving nine separate and clearly defined steps:\n\n* Books were selected for treatment. The details of work to be done were recorded on a formatted card that accompanied its respective book throughout its treatment. Once work was completed, the card was permanently filed. A universal language utilising symbols, created with [[foreign worker]]s in mind, was employed in the formatting of this card.  Symbols were assigned to key phrases that communicated the condition of each book and how its repair was to be conducted, such as:\n** historically important \u2013 only to be dealt with by experts\n** incomplete\n** medium mud\n** rebind\n** collation part missing\n* The book was photographed.\n* The book's collation was verified and its covers removed and stored in a marked case (if they were to be used in a new binding).\n* If necessary, the book was carefully taken apart to wash it in warm water and disinfect it with Topane ([[pentachlorophenol]]).\n* In certain cases, the leaves of the book were [[mass deacidification|deacidified]] and buffered.\n* The text-block was pressed.\n* The text-block was dried in specially designed cabinets.\n* Sections of the book were then reconstructed and the text-blocks collated.\n* Finally, each book was wrapped in a paper sheet that had been impregnated with an antimicrobial substance, then they were set aside for any later repair or rebinding. The binding was completed in the main reading room of the library, which had been converted (temporarily) for this purpose.\n\nThis methodical nine-part system enabled workers to process between seventy and a hundred books a day.<ref name=\"Clarkson, Christopher 2003\" />\n\nAfter the Florence flood, the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale was not allowed to put books back into the lower levels.<ref>Lenzuni, Anna. \"Coping with Disaster\". Preservation of library materials: conference held at the National Library of Austria, Vienna, 7\u201310 April 1986. Ed. Merrily A. Smith. IFLA publications, 40\u201341. M\u00fcnchen: Saur, 1987.</ref>\n\n===Paintings===\nMany panel paintings were critically damaged as a result of water saturating their wood, causing the glue and [[gesso]], which compose the priming layer, to dissolve. Consequently, the paintings' colours dissolved as well. In addition, the moisture caused paintings to buckle and crack or develop blisters, and the paint to chip and fall.  Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying [[rice paper]] to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. [[Nystatin]], an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing. Treatment facilities were established at locations such as the Boboli Garden Lemon-House, where over two hundred of these panel paintings were restored.\n\nSimilar measures were necessary to conserve canvas paintings. First, an original canvas was relined and gauze applied to the painted surface, which was then ironed. This process is referred to as the ''rintelatura'', or \"new canvas\" method. Relatively minor surface work was often completed with a variety of solvents and/or types of [[resin]].\n\n===Frescoes===\n[[Fresco]]es demanded more complicated treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave a layer of residual salt on the surface of the wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant [[efflorescence]] obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached.\n\nFuel oil, which coated many painted works of art, was removed by using Japanese tissue paper to apply a solvent, which dissolved the tar. An [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], such as [[talcum powder]], was then distributed on the tissue paper.\n\n===Sculpture and other objects===\nIt became imperative to clean sculpture immediately, before it fully absorbed the oil. Flaking sculpture was sprayed with a [[silicate]] mixture, while wooden pieces were treated with [[insecticides]] and toxic gases to kill insects and prevent future infestation. [[Weapon]]ry, like firearms and swords, were taken apart, cleaned with [[Kerosene|paraffin]], and finally lubricated to prevent future rusting.\n\n[[Bronze]] objects were kept in dehumidification chambers for a few weeks and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed \"depth cleaning\", which entailed the use of small drills and vacuuming. Similar measures were taken with gold.  Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation.<ref name=\"Batini 1967\" /><ref name=\"The Florentine Flood Disaster\" />\n\n===Effect on preservation and conservation awareness===\nThe disastrous results of the flood established an international awareness of the need for preservation and conservation education and facilities.  In the United States, for example, it is no coincidence that the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] was passed in 1966.<ref>{{cite book | last=Stipe | first=Robert and Antoinette J. Lee | url=http://www.emich.edu/public/geo/history.html#preservationact | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970105203342/http://www.emich.edu/public/geo/history.html#preservationact | url-status=dead | archive-date=5 January 1997 | title=The American Mosaic: Preserving A Nation's Heritage | year=1987 | publisher=U.S. Committee, International Council on Monuments and Sites | location=Washington, D.C. | accessdate=4 April 2007  }}</ref> During the next twenty years:\n{{Quotation|2,000 to 3,000 preservation organizations actively engaged in public education, advocacy, preservation and restoration projects of various kinds, many of them operating revolving funds. In terms of geographic interest, distinctions among the regions are no longer drawn. Membership in the National Trust for Historic Preservation grew from 10,700 in 1966 to 185,000 in 1986. More than 35 university graduate professional and technical courses directly related to historic preservation were created in the interim. It would be reasonable to estimate that more than 54,000 jobs were created in the administrative aspect of preservation alone.|Robert E. Stipe and Antoinette J. Lee}}\n\n===Work outstanding===\nA significant amount of restorative work remains to be done in Florence.  Due to a lack of awareness, funding, and manpower, a great number of works of art and books lie in storage, dirty and damaged.  Christopher Clarkson, noted conservator, called attention to this problem in a 2007 letter, stating that the National Library still has a \"warehouse\" full of books to be repaired and bound; many others need cleaning or reassembling.  According to a 1993 report, approximately 25% of the 80,000 items belonging to the Magliabecchi and Palatino collections had not been fully restored in the nearly thirty years since the flood.  The number of conservators that work at the library presently is only about a tenth of the amount that worked there immediately after the flood.<ref name=\"channel4.com\"/>\n\n==Environmental measures==\n\nRegional officials in Tuscany are responsible for organizing a massive project, the purpose of which is to not only protect the area from future flooding but to maintain high water quality and effectively utilize water resources.\n\nWork commenced in 1984, with the construction of the Bilancino Dam, near Florence.  The Sieve tributary and spillway at [[Pontedera]] are among other developments.  The national government has funded a majority of these various subprojects, with the city of Florence being the primary recipient of the money.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bilancino Dam, A Reservoir for Florence | url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm | accessdate =1 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041221224245/http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm |archivedate = 21 December 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[1966 Venice flood]]\n* [[Architectural conservation]]\n* [[Byron Gallery]]; New York based art gallery that hosted a benefit for flood victims in 1967.\n* [[Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage]]\n* [[Historic preservation]]\n* [[History of Florence]]\n* [[History of Italy]]\n* [[Natural disaster]]\n* [[Peter Waters]]\n* [[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | first = Kathrine Kressman | last = Taylor | title = Diary of Florence in Flood | place = New York | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 1969 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|1966 Flood of Florence}}\n* [http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/ealluvho.htm Speciale Alluvione] Images of the flood and interviews with notable figures regarding its impact\n* [http://www.florence-flood.com The Florence Flood] News, archives, and photos for the Florence flood of 1966\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071105043643/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html Cities and Disaster: The Florence Flood of 1966] A summary of events surrounding the flood.\n*[https://www.sba.unifi.it/p1628.html?newlang=eng CEDAF Documentation Center on Florence Floods.]  \n \n[[Category:Floods in Italy]]\n[[Category:1966 in Italy|Flood of the River Arno, 1966]]\n[[Category:Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration of paintings]]\n[[Category:1966 floods]]\n[[Category:November 1966 events]]\n[[Category:20th century in Florence]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_flood_of_the_Arno"}

Due to this difference, leather painting techniques are generally not used on items that can or must bend nor on items that receive friction, such as belts and wallets because under these conditions, the paint may crack or wear off. However, latex paints can be used to paint such flexible leather items. In the main though, a flat piece of leather, backed with a stiff board is ideal and common, though three-dimensional forms are possible so long as the painted surface remains secured.\n\n[[Acrylic paint]] is a common medium, often painted on [[tooled]] leather pictures, backed with wood or cardboard, and then framed.  Unlike photographs, leather paintings are displayed without a glass cover, to prevent [[Mold (fungus)|mould]].\n\n===Carving===\n{{main|Leather carving}}\n\nLeather carving entails using metal implements to compress moistened [[leather]] in such a way as to give a three-dimensional effect.  The surface of the leather is not intended to be cut through, as would be done in [[filigree]].\n\nThe main tools used to \"carve\" leather include: [[swivel knife]], [[veiner]], [[beveler]], [[pear shader]], [[seeder]], various sculpting implements, and background tools. The swivel knife is held with one finger providing downward pressure un a stirrup like top and drawn along the leather to outline patterns.  The other tools are [[Leather punch|punch]]-type implements struck with a wooden, nylon, metal or [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] [[mallet]].  The object is to add further definition, texture and depth to the cut lines made by the swivel knife and the areas around the cut lines.\n\nIn the United States and Mexico, the western floral style, known as \"Sheridan Style\", of carving leather predominates.  Usually, these are stylized pictures of acanthis or roses although, increasingly, modern leather artists are redefining and expanding the potential of the materials. By far the most preeminent carver in the United States was [[Al Stohlman]].  His patterns and methods have been embraced by many hobbyists, scout troops, reenacters, and craftsmen.\n\n===Stamping===\n[[Image:Stamping on Leather.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Examples of geometric stamping on leather.]]\n\nLeather stamping involves the use of shaped implements (stamps) to create an imprint onto a [[leather]] surface, often by striking the stamps with a [[mallet]].\n\nCommercial stamps are available in various designs, typically geometric or representative of animals. Most stamping is performed on vegetable tanned leather that has been cased. This is the action of dampening the leather with water so that it soaks into the surface fibres. The water makes the leather softer and able to be compressed by the design being pressed or stamped into it. After the leather has been stamped, the design stays on the leather as it dries out, but it can fade if the leather becomes wet and is flexed.  To make the impressions last longer, the leather is conditioned with [[oils]] and [[fat]]s to make it waterproof and prevent the fibers from deforming.\n\n===Molding/shaping===\nLeather shaping or molding consists of soaking a piece of leather in water to greatly increase pliability and then shaping it by hand or with the use of objects or even molds as forms. As the leather dries it stiffens and holds its shape. Carving and stamping may be done prior to or after molding. Molding has become popular among hobbyists whose crafts are related to fantasy, goth/steampunk culture and cosplay as well as those interested in more classic styling of bags and household items.\n\nTwo well known pieces of molded leather are part of the funerary achievements of [[Edward, the Black Prince]], the heraldic crest and shield.<ref>http://myarmoury.com/feature_mow_bp.html Description and photographs of the original and the reproduction from the tomb in Canterbury Cathedral</ref>\n\n=== Laser cutting/etching ===\n[[Carbon dioxide laser]]s cut through leather very smoothly, and at low power a [[Laser cutting|laser cutter]] can etch detailed designs into leather to any desired depth although some discoloration and stiffening occurs in vegetable tanned tooling leather.\n\n=== Perforation ===\nPerforation \u2013 the result of punching that is provided for the manufacture of a large number of regularly arranged apertures of regular shape in the sheet and other material. A decorative technique that is used to connect two sheets of leather or to decorate them.\n\n=== Pyrography ===\nPyrography (purogravure) on leather is the art of using a hot needle to make a drawing on leather.
