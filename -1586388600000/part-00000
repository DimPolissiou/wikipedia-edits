He held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[heavyweight]] title from 2015 to 2020, and in doing so became the first American world heavyweight champion in nine years, which was the longest period of time in boxing history without an American heavyweight champion. As of February 2020, he is ranked as the world's third-best active heavyweight by the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrb.org/all-rankings/|title=RANKINGS {{!}} Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> fourth by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ringtv.com/ratings/|title=Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ring|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> and fifth by [[BoxRec]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/ratings?offset=0&sex=M&division=Heavyweight|title=BoxRec: Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=boxrec.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWilder had a late start to boxing, taking up the sport at 20 years of age. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the [[2008 Olympics]]. This led to his nickname of \"The Bronze Bomber\", which Wilder coined after [[Joe Louis]], who was known by the nickname of \"The Brown Bomber\".\n\nWilder is particularly known for his formidable punching power, having knocked out every opponent he has faced, except [[Tyson Fury]].  His [[knockout]]-to-win ratio stands at 98%, with 20 knockouts in the first round. He is a two-time winner of the ''[[Premier Boxing Champions]]'' [[Premier Boxing Champions#Knockout of the Year|Knockout of the Year]] award, in 2016 and 2017, and the winner of the [[The Ring magazine Knockout of the Year|''Ring'' magazine Knockout of the Year]] award in 2019.\n\n==Amateur career==\nWilder started boxing in October 2005, when he entered Skyy Boxing Gym in [[Northport, Alabama]], and began training under Jay Deas. Wilder was 20 at that time.\n\nBy 2007, he upset the favorites to win both the [[National Golden Gloves]] and the [[National Amateur Heavyweight Champions|US championships]] at 201&nbsp;lb (91&nbsp;kg).\n\nAt the Golden Gloves, he defeated highly touted cadet world champion [[Isiah Thomas (boxer)|Isiah Thomas]], a southpaw from Detroit, and David Thompson, of Brooklyn, in the finals. At the U.S. championship he defeated Quantis Graves and won the final 31\u201315 over southpaw James Zimmerman of San Jose, California.\n\nAt the Olympic trials, he beat Graves twice more and won the Olympic trials in only 21 bouts. Early in 2008 he scored a career-best win by edging out world championship silver medalist and future Olympic champion [[Rakhim Chakhkeiv|Rakhim Chakhiyev]] in Russia. He qualified for the Olympics by beating [[Deivi Julio Blanco|Deivis Julio]] 6:5 [[Jorge Qui\u00f1onez|Jorge Quinones]] from Ecuador on double countback and Brazilian [[Rafael Lima (boxer)|Rafael Lima]] 6:5 at the qualifier.\n\nIn a Russia-USA dual match on February 29, 2008, in [[Novosibirsk]], Wilder was knocked out by [[Evgenyi Romanov]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.sports.yahoo.com/news/boxe-evgeny-romanov-dernier-homme-084117921.html|title=Boxe: Evgeny Romanov, le dernier homme \u00e0 avoir mis KO le surpuissant Deontay Wilder|website=fr.sports.yahoo.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\nWilder then competed at heavyweight in the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]], defeating Abdelaziz Touilbini of Algeria and Mohamed Arjaoui of Morocco before losing to [[Clemente Russo]] of Italy in the semi-final to earn a bronze medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/olympic-results/beijing-2008/boxing/81-91kg-heavyweight-m?event=31432|title=81 - 91kg (heavyweight) men results - Boxing - Beijing 2008 Olympics|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\nWilder had an approximate amateur record of 30\u20135.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya_110112.htm|title=Developing Deontay Wilder|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114125605/http://doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya_110112.htm|archive-date=2013-01-14|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Deontay_Wilder#Amateur_Highlights|title=Deontay Wilder - BoxRec|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052830/http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Deontay_Wilder#Amateur_Highlights|archive-date=2017-01-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Olympic results===\n'''[[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]''':<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/BX.shtml|title=Beijing results|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820170926/http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/BX.shtml|archivedate=2008-08-20|df=}}</ref>\n*Defeated [[Abdelaziz Toulbini]] ([[Algeria]]) 10:4\n*Defeated [[Mohamed Arjaoui]] ([[Morocco]]) 10+:10 (tiebreaker criteria)\n*Lost to [[Clemente Russo]] ([[Italy]]) 1:7\n\n===World Championship results===\n'''[[2007 AIBA World Boxing Championships]]''':\n*Lost to [[Krzysztof Zimnoch]] ([[Poland]]) 20-23 (10/24/2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/WorldChamps2007.html|title=World Champs 2007|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416215928/http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/WorldChamps2007.html|archive-date=2016-04-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Early career===\nWilder made his professional debut at the age of 23 on November 15, 2008, at the Vanderbilt University Memorial Gymnasium in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

Fury, using his unorthodox stance, spent much of the fight using upper and lower-body movement to avoid Wilder's big shots and stay out of range. There was not much action in round one as both boxers used the round to feel each other out. Wilder tried to trap Fury into the corner, but Fury made Wilder miss most of his big swings. In round four, Wilder bloodied Fury's nose with his stiff jabs, but was unable to follow up on the attacks. In round six, Fury switched to southpaw stance and had success backing Wilder against the ropes and at the same time stayed cautious of Wilder's power. In round seven, after trading jabs, which saw Fury come out on top, Fury landed a counter right hand, then quickly tied Wilder up before he could throw anything back. Round eight saw back and forth action with both trying to land. Wilder threw a lot of power shots which Fury mostly evaded. In round nine, Wilder dropped Fury with a short left hook followed by an overhand right. Fury beat referee Jack Reiss' count and survived the round. Having expended a lot of energy trying to finish Fury in round nine, Wilder looked fatigued in round ten. This came to as an advantage for Fury as he landed two right hands. Fury also took advantage in round eleven, landing enough shots and avoided anything Wilder could throw. In round twelve, Wilder landed a right-left combination which put Fury down hard on his back. The crowd, commentary team and Wilder believed the fight was over. Reiss looked at Fury on the canvas and began giving him a count. To everyone's surprise, Fury beat the count. Reiss made Fury walk towards him and called for the action to continue. Wilder, fatigued again, was unable to land another power shot and Fury landed some right hands to finish the round and the fight on his feet. Both boxers embraced in a hug after the final bell sounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-controversial-draw-results--134241|title=Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury Ends in Controversial Draw|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46416721|title=Wilder v Fury: Stunning draw in WBC world heavyweight title fight|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Boxing|access-date=2008-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11569434/tyson-fury-forced-to-settle-for-a-draw-with-deontay-wilder|title=Tyson Fury forced to settle for a draw with Deontay Wilder|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\nAccording to CompuBox statistics, Wilder landed 71 punches of 430 thrown (17%), and Fury landed 84 of his 327 thrown (26%).

He held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[heavyweight]] title from 2015 to 2020, and in doing so became the first American world heavyweight champion in nine years, which was the longest period of time in boxing history without an American heavyweight champion. As of February 2020, he is ranked as the world's third-best active heavyweight by the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrb.org/all-rankings/|title=RANKINGS {{!}} Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> fourth by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ringtv.com/ratings/|title=Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ring|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> and fifth by [[BoxRec]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/ratings?offset=0&sex=M&division=Heavyweight|title=BoxRec: Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=boxrec.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWilder had a late start to boxing, taking up the sport at 20 years of age. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the [[2008 Olympics]]. This led to his nickname of \"The Bronze Bomber\", which Wilder coined after [[Joe Louis]], who was known by the nickname of \"The Brown Bomber\".\n\nWilder is particularly known for his formidable punching power, having knocked out every opponent he has faced, except [[Tyson Fury]].  His [[knockout]]-to-win ratio stands at 98%, with 20 knockouts in the first round. He is a two-time winner of the ''[[Premier Boxing Champions]]'' [[Premier Boxing Champions#Knockout of the Year|Knockout of the Year]] award, in 2016 and 2017, and the winner of the [[The Ring magazine Knockout of the Year|''Ring'' magazine Knockout of the Year]] award in 2019.\n\n==Amateur career==\nWilder started boxing in October 2005, when he entered Skyy Boxing Gym in [[Northport, Alabama]], and began training under Jay Deas. Wilder was 20 at that time.\n\nBy 2007, he upset the favorites to win both the [[National Golden Gloves]] and the [[National Amateur Heavyweight Champions|US championships]] at 201&nbsp;lb (91&nbsp;kg).\n\nAt the Golden Gloves, he defeated highly-touted cadet world champion [[Isiah Thomas (boxer)|Isiah Thomas]], a southpaw from Detroit, and David Thompson, of Brooklyn, in the finals. At the U.S. championship he defeated Quantis Graves and won the final 31\u201315 over southpaw James Zimmerman of San Jose, California.\n\nAt the Olympic trials, he beat Graves twice more and won the Olympic trials in only 21 bouts. Early in 2008 he scored a career-best win by edging out world championship silver medalist and future Olympic champion [[Rakhim Chakhkeiv|Rakhim Chakhiyev]] in Russia. He qualified for the Olympics by beating [[Deivi Julio Blanco|Deivis Julio]] 6:5 [[Jorge Qui\u00f1onez|Jorge Quinones]] from Ecuador on double countback and Brazilian [[Rafael Lima (boxer)|Rafael Lima]] 6:5 at the qualifier.\n\nIn a Russia-USA dual match on February 29, 2008, in [[Novosibirsk]], Wilder was knocked out by [[Evgenyi Romanov]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.sports.yahoo.com/news/boxe-evgeny-romanov-dernier-homme-084117921.html|title=Boxe: Evgeny Romanov, le dernier homme \u00e0 avoir mis KO le surpuissant Deontay Wilder|website=fr.sports.yahoo.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\nWilder then competed at heavyweight in the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]], defeating Abdelaziz Touilbini of Algeria and Mohamed Arjaoui of Morocco before losing to [[Clemente Russo]] of Italy in the semi-final to earn a bronze medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/olympic-results/beijing-2008/boxing/81-91kg-heavyweight-m?event=31432|title=81 - 91kg (heavyweight) men results - Boxing - Beijing 2008 Olympics|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\nWilder had an approximate amateur record of 30\u20135.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya_110112.htm|title=Developing Deontay Wilder|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114125605/http://doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya_110112.htm|archive-date=2013-01-14|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Deontay_Wilder#Amateur_Highlights|title=Deontay Wilder - BoxRec|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052830/http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Deontay_Wilder#Amateur_Highlights|archive-date=2017-01-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Olympic results===\n'''[[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]''':<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/BX.shtml|title=Beijing results|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820170926/http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/BX.shtml|archivedate=2008-08-20|df=}}</ref>\n*Defeated [[Abdelaziz Toulbini]] ([[Algeria]]) 10:4\n*Defeated [[Mohamed Arjaoui]] ([[Morocco]]) 10+:10 (tiebreaker criteria)\n*Lost to [[Clemente Russo]] ([[Italy]]) 1:7\n\n===World Championship results===\n'''[[2007 AIBA World Boxing Championships]]''':\n*Lost to [[Krzysztof Zimnoch]] ([[Poland]]) 20-23 (10/24/2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/WorldChamps2007.html|title=World Champs 2007|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416215928/http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/WorldChamps2007.html|archive-date=2016-04-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Early career===\nWilder made his professional debut at the age of 23 on November 15, 2008, at the Vanderbilt University Memorial Gymnasium in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

Entering round nine, Szpilka, aware from the ring commentators he could no longer win the fight on the cards, changed strategy and took a gamble. Going to the inside, Szpilka swung for the rafters, but Wilder read Szpilka and connected first with a powerful right hand to the face. Szpilka fell to the canvas, and his head jerked backwards in a reflex motion, abruptly ending the competitive contest and sending the ringside physicians and emergency medical personnel immediately into the ring.

Fury, using his unorthodox stance, spent much of the fight using upper and lower-body movement to avoid Wilder's big shots and stay out of range. There was not much action in round one as both boxers used the round to feel each other out. Wilder tried to trap Fury into the corner, but Fury made Wilder miss most of his big swings. In round four, Wilder bloodied Fury's nose with his stiff jabs, but was unable to follow up on the attacks. In round six, Fury switched to southpaw stance and had success backing Wilder against the ropes and at the same time stayed cautious of Wilder's power. In round seven, after trading jabs, which saw Fury come out on top, Fury landed a counter right hand, then quickly tied Wilder up before he could throw anything back. Round eight saw back and forth action with both trying to land. Wilder threw a lot of power shots which Fury mostly evaded. In round nine, Wilder dropped Fury with a short left hook followed by an overhand right. Fury beat referee Jack Reiss' count and survived the round. Having expended a lot of energy trying to finish Fury in round nine, Wilder looked fatigued in round ten. This came to as an advantage for Fury as he landed two right hands. Fury also took advantage in round eleven, landing enough shots and avoided anything Wilder could throw. In round twelve, Wilder landed a right-left combination which put Fury down hard on his back. The crowd, commentary team and Wilder believed the fight was over. Reiss looked at Fury on the canvas and began giving him a count. To everyone's surprise, Fury beat the count. Reiss made Fury walk towards him and called for the action to continue. Wilder, fatigued again, was unable to land another power shot and Fury landed some right hands to finish the round and the fight on his feet. Both boxers embraced in a hug after the final bell sounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-controversial-draw-results--134241|title=Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury Ends in Controversial Draw|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46416721|title=Wilder v Fury: Stunning draw in WBC world heavyweight title fight|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Boxing|access-date=2008-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11569434/tyson-fury-forced-to-settle-for-a-draw-with-deontay-wilder|title=Tyson Fury forced to settle for a draw with Deontay Wilder|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\nAccording to CompuBox statistics, Wilder landed 71 punches of 430 thrown (17%), and Fury landed 84 of his 327 thrown (26%).

While some were specifically created for use in the ''[[Super Smash Bros]].'' series, most come from established game franchises like the playable characters.\n\n=== Summonable ===\nCertain [[Item (gaming)|items]] in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series can be used to temporarily summon other characters into battle. The first of these, the [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]], was introduced in the original ''Super Smash Bros.'' game. It can be thrown to temporarily call forth a random [[List of Pok\u00e9mon|Pok\u00e9mon]], which will perform one of its signature abilities to attack opponents or affect the battle in other ways. Each ''Super Smash Bros.'' game has had a different set of Pok\u00e9mon that can appear from Pok\u00e9 Balls, though some such as [[Snorlax]] and [[Goldeen]] have appeared in multiple entries.\n\nAnother item, the Assist Trophy, was added in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' and functions similarly to the Pok\u00e9 Ball. Players who pick up an Assist Trophy will summon a random character from one of Nintendo's various franchises, causing them to interfere with opponents. Available characters vary between games, and range from supporting members of already represented franchises, such as ''Super Mario''{{'s}} [[Waluigi]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Park |first1=Gene |title=Waluigi was robbed and humiliated by Nintendo, and his fans are furious |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/06/12/waluigi-was-robbed-and-humiliated-by-nintendo-and-his-fans-are-furious/?noredirect=on |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref> and ''Star Fox''{{'s}} Andross, to more obscure characters like the [[Sheriff (video game)|Sheriff]], [[Dr. Kawashima]] from ''[[Brain Age]]'', Saki Amamiya from ''[[Sin and Punishment]]'' and Takamaru from ''[[The Mysterious Murasame Castle]]''. Some Assist Trophies, including [[Little Mac]], [[Dark Samus]] and [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]], have gone on to appear as playable fighters in later installments. There have also been Assist Trophies based on third-party characters, such as [[Bomberman]], [[Akira Yuki]], and [[Shovel Knight]].\n\n=== Bosses ===\nThroughout the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, most single-player modes have included several non-playable [[boss (video games)|boss]] characters. Some of these bosses were created specifically for the ''Super Smash Bros.'' franchise.\n\nMaster Hand is a glove-like being that appears in all games to date, serving as the final [[boss (video games)|boss]] of Classic Mode<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/various/various28.html|title=Master Hand|accessdate=April 21, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705090035/http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/various/various28.html|archivedate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> and, in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' introduced a left-hand counterpart to Master Hand named Crazy Hand, which appears alongside him under certain conditions. ''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U'' introduced a new form, Master Core, a shapeshifting mass of black particles that emerge from Master Hand and Crazy Hand after their defeat.\n\n''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' introduced Giga Bowser, a larger and more monstrous version of [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] that could be fought in the 51st Event Match, \"The Showdown\", and as a secret final opponent in the game\u2019s Adventure Mode under certain conditions. Giga Bowser uses the same abilities as Bowser, but is much stronger and has additional effects on his attacks, such as explosions and elemental damage. Giga Bowser later became Bowser's Final Smash in all subsequent games beginning with ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', with players able to control him for the duration of the Final Smash.\n\nTabuu is the villain of ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl''{{'s}} story mode, ''The Subspace Emissary''. He is a humanoid [[apparitional experience|apparition]] composed of pure energy, with a single eye-shaped object located where a person's stomach would be. He can conjure several weapons for use in battle, including a rapier and large chakram; change his size at will, and teleport. Towards the end of ''The Subspace Emissary'', it is revealed that Tabuu is the entity that controlled Master Hand and the true [[antagonist]] behind the events of the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/modea/modea17.html|title=Mysteries of the Subspace Emissary|work=Smash Bros.

Ridley eventually became playable in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'', with Meta Ridley as an alternate costume for him, while Petey Piranha became DLC character Piranha Plant's Final Smash. Three original bosses are also featured: Tabuu, the giant cyborg Galleom, and the twin-bodied robot Duon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/modea/modea15.html|title=Boss Strategies|work=Smash Bros.

Ultimate'' introduces Galeem, a seraphic menace who serves as the main villain of ''World of Light''. Known as the \"lord of light\" and \"the ultimate enemy\", Galeem destroys the ''Smash Bros.'' world, robs all the fighters except Kirby of their physical forms, and plans on creating a new world to the point of creating an army of puppet fighters powered by enslaved spirits. Galeem is opposed by Dharkon, a one-eyed creature with many tentacles. Described as the \"embodiment of chaos and darkness\", Dharkon seeks to defeat Galeem and consume the world in darkness. Galeem and Dharkon are aided by a swarm of Master Hand and Crazy Hand puppets respectively. The mode also features bosses Giga Bowser, Galleom, [[Ganon]], [[List of Kirby characters#Marx|Marx]], [[Monster Hunter|Rathalos,]] and [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]], who also appear as final opponents for different characters in the game's Classic Mode.\n\nOther boss characters from represented franchises may appear as hazards on certain stages and attack the fighters in the middle of a battle, such as the Yellow Devil from ''[[Mega Man]]'' and Metal Face from ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]''.\n\n=== Other ===\nIn each of the games, there is a group of generic enemy characters based on other fighters fought in large groups in the games' single-player campaigns and \"Multi-Man Smash\" minigames. In the Japanese versions of the games, these characters are called the {{nihongo|\"Mysterious Small Fry Enemy Corps\"|\u8b0e\u306e\u30b6\u30b3\u6575\u8ecd\u56e3}}. In the English localized versions of the games, they are given names that describe their physical form. These include the Fighting Polygon Team in the original game, the Fighting Wire Frames in ''Melee'', the Fighting Alloy Team in ''Brawl''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/various/various21.html|title=STADIUM: Multi-Man Brawl|work=Smash Bros.

Many generic enemies from various games appear as part of the \"Smash Run\" mode in ''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS''.\n\nThe Subspace Army are the antagonists of ''[[Super Smash Bros.

While some were specifically created for use in the ''[[Super Smash Bros]].'' series, most come from established game franchises like the playable characters.\n\n=== Summonable ===\nCertain [[Item (gaming)|items]] in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series can be used to temporarily summon other characters into battle. The first of these, the [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]], was introduced in the original ''Super Smash Bros.'' game. It can be thrown to temporarily call forth a random [[List of Pok\u00e9mon|Pok\u00e9mon]], which will perform one of its signature abilities to attack opponents or affect the battle in other ways. Each ''Super Smash Bros.'' game has had a different set of Pok\u00e9mon that can appear from Pok\u00e9 Balls, though some such as [[Snorlax]] and [[Goldeen]] have appeared in multiple entries.\n\nAnother item, the Assist Trophy, was added in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' and functions similarly to the Pok\u00e9 Ball. Players who pick up an Assist Trophy will summon a random character from one of Nintendo's various franchises, causing them to interfere with opponents. Available characters vary between games, and range from supporting members of already represented franchises, such as ''Super Mario''{{'s}} [[Waluigi]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Park |first1=Gene |title=Waluigi was robbed and humiliated by Nintendo, and his fans are furious |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/06/12/waluigi-was-robbed-and-humiliated-by-nintendo-and-his-fans-are-furious/?noredirect=on |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref> and ''Star Fox''{{'s}} Andross, to more obscure characters like the [[Sheriff (video game)|Sheriff]], [[Dr. Kawashima]] from ''[[Brain Age]]'', Saki Amamiya from ''[[Sin and Punishment]]'' and Takamaru from ''[[The Mysterious Murasame Castle]]''. Some Assist Trophies, including [[Little Mac]], [[Dark Samus]] and [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]], have gone on to appear as playable fighters in later installments. There have also been Assist Trophies based on third-party characters, such as [[Bomberman]], [[Akira Yuki]], and [[Shovel Knight]].\n\n=== Bosses ===\nThroughout the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, most single-player modes have included several non-playable [[boss (video games)|boss]] characters. Some of these bosses were created specifically for the ''Super Smash Bros.'' franchise.\n\nMaster Hand is a glove-like being that appears in all games to date, serving as the final [[boss (video games)|boss]] of Classic Mode<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/various/various28.html|title=Master Hand|accessdate=April 21, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705090035/http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/gamemode/various/various28.html|archivedate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> and, in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', the 50th Event Match \"Final Destination Match\". In ''Melee'', Master Hand is playable via a system glitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supersmashbros.ign.com/articles/news/3400/Play-as-Master-Hand-Glitch-Melee|title=Play as Master Hand Glitch (Melee)|publisher=IGN Entertainment|author=puffteam|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021192942/http://supersmashbros.ign.com/articles/news/3400/Play-as-Master-Hand-Glitch-Melee|archivedate=October 21, 2009}}</ref> He is also playable in ''Ultimate''{{'s}} Adventure Mode if certain requirements are met. ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' introduced a left-hand counterpart to Master Hand named Crazy Hand, which appears alongside him under certain conditions. ''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U'' introduced a new form, Master Core, a shapeshifting mass of black particles that emerge from Master Hand and Crazy Hand after their defeat.\n\n''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' introduced Giga Bowser, a larger and more monstrous version of [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] that could be fought in the 51st Event Match, \"The Showdown\", and as a secret final opponent in the game\u2019s Adventure Mode under certain conditions. Giga Bowser uses the same abilities as Bowser, but is much stronger and has additional effects on his attacks, such as explosions and elemental damage. Giga Bowser later became Bowser's Final Smash in all subsequent games beginning with ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', with players able to control him for the duration of the Final Smash.\n\nTabuu is the villain of ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl''{{'s}} story mode, ''The Subspace Emissary''. He is a humanoid [[apparitional experience|apparition]] composed of pure energy, with a single eye-shaped object located where a person's stomach would be. He can conjure several weapons for use in battle, including a rapier and large chakram; change his size at will, and teleport.

Ultimate'' introduces Galeem, a seraphic menace who serves as the main villain of ''World of Light''. Known as the \"lord of light\" and \"the ultimate enemy\", Galeem destroys the ''Smash Bros.'' world, robs all the fighters except Kirby of their physical forms, and plans on creating a new world to the point of creating an army of puppet fighters powered by enslaved spirits. Galeem is opposed by Dharkon, a one-eyed creature with many tentacles. Described as the \"embodiment of chaos and darkness\", Dharkon seeks to defeat Galeem and consume the world in darkness. Galeem and Dharkon are aided by a swarm of Master Hand and Crazy Hand puppets respectively. The mode also features bosses Giga Bowser, Galleom, [[Ganon]], [[List of Kirby characters#Marx|Marx]], [[Monster Hunter|Rathalos,]] and [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]], who also appear as final opponents for different characters in the game's Classic Mode.\n\nOther boss characters from represented franchises may appear as hazards on certain stages and attack the fighters in the middle of a battle, such as the Yellow Devil from ''[[Mega Man]]'' and Metal Face from ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]''.\n\n=== Other ===\nIn each of the games, there is a group of generic enemy characters based on other fighters fought in large groups in the games' single-player campaigns and \"Multi-Man Smash\" minigames. In the Japanese versions of the games, these characters are called the \"{{nihongo|Mysterious Small Fry Enemy Corps|\u8b0e\u306e\u30b6\u30b3\u6575\u8ecd\u56e3}}\".
