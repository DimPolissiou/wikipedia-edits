Those familiar with the sound of cannon fire say the sound is nearly identical. The booms occasionally cause shock waves that rattle plates. Early white settlers in North America were told by the native Haudenosaunee [[Iroquois]] that the booms were the sound of the [[Great Spirit]] continuing his work of shaping the earth.\n\nThe terms \"mistpouffers\" and \"Seneca guns\" both originate in Seneca Lake, NY, and refer to the rumble of [[artillery]] fire.

Pakistan's invading force, consisting of the 1st Armoured Division and 11th Infantry Division, crossed the [[International Border]] and captured the Indian town of Khem Karan. Considering the situation, GOC Indian 4th Mountain Division (Maj. Gen. Gurbaksh Singh) immediately ordered the division to fall back and assume a horseshoe shaped defensive position with Asal Uttar as its focal point. The battle strategy was the brainchild of Brigadier Thomas K.Theograj.<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/unsung-hero/article6797696.ece</ref><ref>http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/ARMY/Galleries/Wars/1965/XI/0100.jpg.html</ref><ref>http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/ARMY/Galleries/Wars/1965/XI/6517.jpg.html</ref>\n\nIn the night, the Indian troops flooded the sugar cane field, and the next morning, the Pakistani tanks of the 1st Armoured Division, consisting mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, were lured inside the horse-shoe trap. The swampy ground slowed down the advance of the Pakistani tanks and many of them could not move because of the muddy slush. Over 100 Pakistani tanks mostly Pattons, and a few Shermans and Chaffees, were destroyed and another 40+ captured<ref name=Wilson/><ref name=Jaques/>\nwhile the Indians, by their account, lost only 10 tanks during this counter offensive.<ref name=Zaloga/>\n\n== Conclusion ==\nDespite the initial thrust of the Pakistani Army into Indian territory, the battle ended in a decisive Indian Victory.<ref name=\"Wilson83\"/> The commander of Pakistani forces Maj.

Pakistan's invading force, consisting of the 1st Armoured Division and 11th Infantry Division, crossed the [[International Border]] and captured the Indian town of Khem Karan. Considering the situation, GOC Indian 4th Mountain Division (Maj. Gen. Gurbaksh Singh) immediately ordered the division to fall back and assume a horseshoe shaped defensive position with Asal Uttar as its focal point.

The swampy ground slowed down the advance of the Pakistani tanks and many of them could not move because of the muddy slush. Over 100 Pakistani tanks mostly Pattons, and a few Shermans and Chaffees, were destroyed and another 40+ captured<ref name=Wilson/><ref name=Jaques/>\nwhile the Indians, by their account, lost only 10 tanks during this counter offensive.<ref name=Zaloga/>\n\n== Conclusion ==\nDespite the initial thrust of the Pakistani Army into Indian territory, the battle ended in a decisive Indian Victory.<ref name=\"Wilson83\"/> The commander of Pakistani forces Maj.

Like most large container ships, ''MSC Flaminia'' is powered by a single low-speed two-stroke [[crosshead]] [[diesel engine]] coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Her main engine, a [[straight-10 engine|10-cylinder]] [[Hyundai Group|Hyundai]]-[[MAN B&W]] 10K98 MC-C, is rated at 57,100&nbsp;kW (76,600&nbsp;hp) and is capable of propelling the ship at {{convert|25|kn}}.<ref name=\"gl\" /> She also has a 1,500&nbsp;kW [[bow thruster]] for manoeuvering at ports. Power for onboard consumers and reefer containers is generated by four [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] 6R32LND auxiliary generators.<ref name=\"nsb_ship\" />\n\n==History==\n''MSC Flaminia'' was built in 2001 by [[South Korea]]n shipbuilder [[Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering]], commonly abbreviated as DSME.

Column sums are evaluated modulo 3. \n\nLinear combinations, or <em>vector addition</em>, of the rows of the matrix  \nproduces all possible <em>words</em> contained in the code. This is referred to as the <em>span</em> of the rows. The inner product of any two rows of the generator matrix will always sum to zero. These rows, or vectors, are said to be <em>orthogonal</em>. \n \nThe matrix product of the generator and parity-check matrices,  \n<math>[I_6|B_{alt}]\\,[-B_{alt}|I_6]^T</math>, is the <math>6\\times6</math> matrix of all zeroes, and by intent.  \nIndeed, this is an example of the very definition of any parity check matrix with respect to its generator matrix.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ternary Golay code was published by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Marcel J. E. Golay|last=Golay|year=1949}}.  It was independently discovered two years earlier by the [[Finland|Finnish]] football pool enthusiast [[Juhani Virtakallio]], who published it in 1947 in issues 27, 28 and 33 of the football [[magazine]] ''[[Veikkaaja]]''. {{harv|Barg|1993|loc=p.25}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Berlekamp\u2013van Lint\u2013Seidel graph]]\n* [[Binary Golay code]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Barg | first1=Alexander | title=At the dawn of the theory of codes | doi=10.1007/BF03025254 |mr=1199273 | year=1993 | journal=[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]] | issn=0343-6993 | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=20\u201326}}\n* M.J.E.
