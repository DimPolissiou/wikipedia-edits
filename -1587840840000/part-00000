Becoming Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger the following year, he saw unprecedented success in the [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|junior heavyweight]] division, winning the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] a record 11 times, as well as setting the record for longest reign with the title during his second reign at 628 days. Liger was the first three-time [[Best of the Super Juniors]] tournament winner (a record eventually tied by [[Koji Kanemoto]]), is a former six-time [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship|IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion]], won the [[Super J Cup]] twice (in 1995 and 2000), and was inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]] in 1999.

After graduating high school in the early 1980s, he would apply to [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]]'s (NJPW) dojo in the hope of becoming a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].<ref name=SlamBio/> He was not accepted because he did not meet the height requirements the dojo had at that time.<ref name=SlamBio/> Yamada, determined not to give up his dream of becoming a professional wrestler, left for [[Mexico]] and began his training there.<ref name=SlamBio/> By his own account, he was almost starving while studying in Mexico, due to this NJPW officials who were visiting took pity on him and asked him to come back to Japan to train in their dojo.<ref name=SlamBio/> In the NJPW dojo, he trained alongside the likes of [[Keiji Mutoh]], [[Masahiro Chono]] and [[Shinya Hashimoto]].<ref name=SlamBio/> While continuing his training, he had his debut match in March 1984 at the age of 19, wrestling against [[Shunji Kosugi]].<ref name=OWOW/><ref name=SlamBio/> He began studying various [[martial arts]] styles because he wanted to add something new and different to his wrestling style, which is how he learned his ''[[Professional wrestling attacks#Rolling wheel kick|Abisegeri]]'' kick. In 1985, Yamada participated in the [[Young Lion Cup]] and got to the final of the tournament before being defeated by Shunji Kosugi. In the beginning of 1986, Yamada participated in the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] League but lost to [[Mark Rocco|Black Tiger]]. On July 19, 1986, Yamada faced [[Nobuhiko Takada]] in a losing effort in his first of many IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship matches.\n\n===All Star Wrestling (1986\u20131987, 1989, 2014)===\nAfter winning the [[Young Lion Cup]] in March 1986,<ref name=SlamBio/> he went on an excursion of Europe, where he wrestled for [[All Star Wrestling]] in [[England]], under the name \"Flying\" Fuji Yamada.<ref name=SlamBio/><ref name=Flying>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingspiritmagazine.co.uk/art/news/159/jushin-thunder-liger-joins-the-uk-revolution|title=Jushin Thunder Liger Joins The UK Revolution|date=February 9, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2017|work=[[Fighting Spirit Magazine]]}}</ref> He won the World Heavy Middleweight Championship twice, once in September 1986 and once in March 1987, both times defeating \"Rollerball\" [[Mark Rocco]] and both times losing it back to him, the last of these title changes being televised on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref name=OWOW/> Yamada would later visit All Star again in 1989, with tag partner [[Masakatsu Funaki|Flying Funaki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishwrestlingarchive.co.uk/1989%20RESULTS.htm|title=1989 results|accessdate=July 2, 2010|work=British Wrestling Archive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405230950/http://www.britishwrestlingarchive.co.uk/1989%20RESULTS.htm|archive-date=April 5, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> He returned to Britain in 2014 to work once again for All Star Wrestling, this time under his masked Jushin Liger identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCcfg3FyhBI&t=3423s|title=All Star Wrestling FULL SHOW featuring Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger from Croydon 3/10/2014 ASW UK|last=Dean Allmark|date=October 5, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Stampede Wrestling (1987, 1989)===\nYamada went on an excursion in [[Canada]], around May 1987, where he wrestled in [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Stampede Wrestling]] in [[Calgary]] under his real name.<ref name=SlamBio/> He also trained under Hart in the legendary \"[[Hart House (Alberta)#The Dungeon|Dungeon]]\".<ref name=SlamBio/> His experiences there led him to refer to Hart as a \"very, very tough man.\" \n\n===New Japan Pro-Wrestling===\n\n====Return and character change (1987\u20131988)====\nAfter returning to Japan in August 1987, Yamada debuted his Shooting Star Press in a match against Masakatsu Funaki, for which he had gotten the idea from reading the [[manga]] ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''. Throughout 1987 and 1988, Yamada improved with each match, occasionally getting shots at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, most notably against [[Owen Hart]] on June 10, 1988, and against [[Shiro Koshinaka]] on December 9, 1988. He would also take part in the first ever [[Best of the Super Juniors|Top of the Super Juniors]] where he earned 31 points, not enough to progress to the final. Within months of his second Canadian excursion, NJPW called him back, as they needed him for a [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] based on an extremely popular [[anime]] [[superhero]], ''[[Jushin Liger (anime)|Jushin Liger]]'', created by [[Mangaka|manga artist]] [[Go Nagai]].<ref name=SlamBio/><ref name=WWE/> NJPW had done this previously with [[Tiger Mask]], which had become a huge success. Yamada was given a superhero-like full body costume and a demonic looking mask, resembling the superhero type featured in [[tokusatsu]] and anime programs.\n\n====IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion (1989\u20132000)====\n[[File:Jushin Thunder Liger 2007 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Liger in 2007]]\nYamada as \"Jushin Liger\" returned to NJPW on April 24, 1989, at the [[Tokyo Dome]].<ref name=OWOW/> In the character's debut match, he defeated [[Kuniaki Kobayashi]].<ref name=SlamBio/> He has also wrestled all the [[Black Tiger (professional wrestling)|Black Tigers]] to date (from Mark Rocco in 1989 to [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]] in 2009). The Liger character underwent changes in conjunction with the Go Nagai anime progressing and its hero powering up. In January 1990, Liger was renamed \"Jushin Thunder Liger\", a name he continues to use to this day.<ref name=NJPW/> He quickly became one of NJPW's top junior heavyweights, eventually capturing the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship eleven times,<ref name=WWE/> between May 25, 1989 and December 6, 1999, among numerous other titles and accolades while wrestling around the world. When appearing without his mask on, Yamada blocks his appearance by covering his face with one hand.\n\nEarly in his career, Yamada's style mostly consisted of high flying. Years later, he started adapting more power moves and started focusing more on grappling and telling a story in the ring; part of this change was due to the fact that Liger had to reduce the stress he was putting on his body after undergoing brain tumor surgery in August 1996, which explained why he lost his match to [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]] in the first round of the [[J-Crown]] tournament.<ref name=SlamBio/> He also had the opportunity to wrestle [[\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] on July 17, in which he lost.\n\nLiger has won two [[Super J-Cup]] tournaments in [[Super J-Cup (1995)|1995]] and [[Super J-Cup (2000)|2000]].<ref name=OWOW/>\n\n====Kishin Liger (1996, 2006, 2012, 2019)====\nOn October 20, 1996, [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] faced off in a match with Liger. As the match progressed, Muta resorted to his underhand tactics that had become his style over the years. He tore at Liger's mask and eventually ripped it off, but Liger kept his face down on the mat. After grabbing a chair outside the ring, Muta entered the ring but before he could hit Liger with it, Liger stood up and revealed his face to be painted pale white with red writings and spit mist into Muta's face (another Muta trademark). He tore off his bodysuit and revealed a painted chest, then proceeded to fight more aggressively the rest of the match, despite losing the match to Muta.\n\nOn July 30, 2006, Liger revived the \"Kishin Liger\" gimmick and faced off with rival Bad Boy Hido in NJPW.<ref name=Central/> The story was that Hido had cut a piece of Liger's hair and Liger vowed revenge, so he transformed into Kishin Liger. Liger won the match with a [[brainbuster]] onto a steel chair. Liger's next appearance as Kishin Liger took place in June 2012 and was brought on by [[Taichi Ishikari|Taichi]] tearing his mask to pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=584&c=4343 |title=Dominion 6.16 |accessdate=June 16, 2012 |work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] |language=Japanese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619045237/http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=584&c=4343 |archivedate=June 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nKishin Liger returned again on September 22, 2019 at Destruction in Kobe, when [[Minoru Suzuki]] removed Liger's mask. Kishin would spit mist into Suzuki's face and attempt to stab him with a spike, before giving chase to Suzuki while attacking officials, young lions, and [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in his pursuit.\n\nThe gimmick is a variation of The Great Muta gimmick which relies on bloody and evil tactics in a match, using mannerisms and imagery that differ from the person's normal ways. This gimmick also uses many wrestling moves that are regulars in The Great Muta's move set, such as the [[Asian mist]].\n\n====Heavyweight division (2000)====\nDuring 2000, as [[List of professional wrestling terms#Booker|booker]] [[Riki Choshu]] decided to de-emphasize the junior heavyweight division (a costly decision that diminished its credibility), Liger wrestled heavyweights without wearing the upper part of his bodysuit or his mask horns (the first time he wore that attire was on February 24, 1994, against Shinya Hashimoto in a non-title match between the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/NJReview-TVAsahi94.html|title=New Japan World Pro Wrestling, 3/5/94|last=Mancuso|first=Ryan|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Junior heavyweight veteran (2001\u20132020)====\nFrom 2004 to 2007, Liger was the leader of the NJPW [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] stable Control Terrorism Unit (CTU) along with [[Hirooki Goto]], [[Minoru Tanaka (wrestler)|Minoru Tanaka]], [[Rocky Romero|Black Tiger IV]], [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]], [[Shoji Akiyoshi|Jado]], [[Fergal Devitt|Prince Devitt]] and briefly [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]].<ref name=Central>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/liger.html|title=Puroresu Central profile|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=April 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jushin Liger ROHxNJPW Global Wars 2018.jpg|thumb|left|Liger in 2018]]\nCTU was disbanded in August 2007, when Liger decided CTU would disband while at the top of NJPW, Liger would then join Masahiro Chono's Legend stable.<ref name=OWOW/> The Legend stable would disband in February 2010, after Chono, Choshu and [[Akira Nogami|Akira]]'s departures.\n\nSince then, Liger has mainly teamed with fellow veteran Tiger Mask, remaining outside of championship contention for the most part.

Throughout 1987 and 1988, Yamada improved with each match, occasionally getting shots at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, most notably against [[Owen Hart]] on June 10, 1988, and against [[Shiro Koshinaka]] on December 9, 1988. He would also take part in the first ever [[Best of the Super Juniors|Top of the Super Juniors]] where he earned 31 points, not enough to progress to the final. Within months of his second Canadian excursion, NJPW called him back, as they needed him for a [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] based on an extremely popular [[anime]] [[superhero]], ''[[Jushin Liger (anime)|Jushin Liger]]'', created by [[Mangaka|manga artist]] [[Go Nagai]].<ref name=SlamBio/><ref name=WWE/> NJPW had done this previously with [[Tiger Mask]], which had become a huge success. Yamada was given a superhero-like full body costume and a demonic looking mask, resembling the superhero type featured in [[tokusatsu]] and anime programs.\n\n====IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion (1989\u20132000)====\n[[File:Jushin Thunder Liger 2007 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Liger in 2007]]\nYamada as \"Jushin Liger\" returned to NJPW on April 24, 1989, at the [[Tokyo Dome]].<ref name=OWOW/> In the character's debut match, he defeated [[Kuniaki Kobayashi]].<ref name=SlamBio/> He has also wrestled all the [[Black Tiger (professional wrestling)|Black Tigers]] to date (from Mark Rocco in 1989 to [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]] in 2009). The Liger character underwent changes in conjunction with the Go Nagai anime progressing and its hero powering up. In January 1990, Liger was renamed \"Jushin Thunder Liger\", a name he continues to use to this day.<ref name=NJPW/> He quickly became one of NJPW's top junior heavyweights, eventually capturing the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship eleven times,<ref name=WWE/> between May 25, 1989 and December 6, 1999, among numerous other titles and accolades while wrestling around the world. When appearing without his mask on, Yamada blocks his appearance by covering his face with one hand.\n\nEarly in his career, Yamada's style mostly consisted of high flying. Years later, he started adapting more power moves and started focusing more on grappling and telling a story in the ring; part of this change was due to the fact that Liger had to reduce the stress he was putting on his body after undergoing brain tumor surgery in August 1996, which explained why he lost his match to [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]] in the first round of the [[J-Crown]] tournament.<ref name=SlamBio/> He also had the opportunity to wrestle [[\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] on July 17, in which he lost.\n\nLiger has won two [[Super J-Cup]] tournaments in [[Super J-Cup (1995)|1995]] and [[Super J-Cup (2000)|2000]].<ref name=OWOW/>\n\n====Kishin Liger (1996, 2006, 2012, 2019)====\nOn October 20, 1996, [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] faced off in a match with Liger. As the match progressed, Muta resorted to his underhand tactics that had become his style over the years. He tore at Liger's mask and eventually ripped it off, but Liger kept his face down on the mat. After grabbing a chair outside the ring, Muta entered the ring but before he could hit Liger with it, Liger stood up and revealed his face to be painted pale white with red writings and spit mist into Muta's face (another Muta trademark). He tore off his bodysuit and revealed a painted chest, then proceeded to fight more aggressively the rest of the match, despite losing the match to Muta.\n\nOn July 30, 2006, Liger revived the \"Kishin Liger\" gimmick and faced off with rival Bad Boy Hido in NJPW.<ref name=Central/> The story was that Hido had cut a piece of Liger's hair and Liger vowed revenge, so he transformed into Kishin Liger. Liger won the match with a [[brainbuster]] onto a steel chair. Liger's next appearance as Kishin Liger took place in June 2012 and was brought on by [[Taichi Ishikari|Taichi]] tearing his mask to pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=584&c=4343 |title=Dominion 6.16 |accessdate=June 16, 2012 |work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] |language=Japanese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619045237/http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=584&c=4343 |archivedate=June 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nKishin Liger returned again on September 22, 2019 at Destruction in Kobe, when [[Minoru Suzuki]] removed Liger's mask. Kishin would spit mist into Suzuki's face and attempt to stab him with a spike, before giving chase to Suzuki while attacking officials, young lions, and [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in his pursuit.\n\nThe gimmick is a variation of The Great Muta gimmick which relies on bloody and evil tactics in a match, using mannerisms and imagery that differ from the person's normal ways. This gimmick also uses many wrestling moves that are regulars in The Great Muta's move set, such as the [[Asian mist]].\n\n====Heavyweight division (2000)====\nDuring 2000, as [[List of professional wrestling terms#Booker|booker]] [[Riki Choshu]] decided to de-emphasize the junior heavyweight division (a costly decision that diminished its credibility), Liger wrestled heavyweights without wearing the upper part of his bodysuit or his mask horns (the first time he wore that attire was on February 24, 1994, against Shinya Hashimoto in a non-title match between the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/NJReview-TVAsahi94.html|title=New Japan World Pro Wrestling, 3/5/94|last=Mancuso|first=Ryan|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Junior heavyweight veteran (2001\u20132020)====\nFrom 2004 to 2007, Liger was the leader of the NJPW [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] stable Control Terrorism Unit (CTU) along with [[Hirooki Goto]], [[Minoru Tanaka (wrestler)|Minoru Tanaka]], [[Rocky Romero|Black Tiger IV]], [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]], [[Shoji Akiyoshi|Jado]], [[Fergal Devitt|Prince Devitt]] and briefly [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]].<ref name=Central>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/liger.html|title=Puroresu Central profile|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=April 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jushin Liger ROHxNJPW Global Wars 2018.jpg|thumb|left|Liger in 2018]]\nCTU was disbanded in August 2007, when Liger decided CTU would disband while at the top of NJPW, Liger would then join Masahiro Chono's Legend stable.<ref name=OWOW/> The Legend stable would disband in February 2010, after Chono, Choshu and [[Akira Nogami|Akira]]'s departures.\n\nSince then, Liger has mainly teamed with fellow veteran Tiger Mask, remaining outside of championship contention for the most part.

Many critics described his music as operatic, nicknaming him \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock\" and \"the Big O\". Most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, while many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability. He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.\n\nOrbison began singing in a [[rockabilly]] and [[Country music|country-and-western]] band in high school. He was contracted by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956, but his greatest success came with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964). Soon afterward, he was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined.\n\nIn the 1980s, Orbison experienced a resurgence in popularity following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the [[Traveling Wilburys]], a rock supergroup with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989) was released as a solo single and became his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in the same year, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. ''Rolling Stone'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936 in [[Vernon, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Joe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&pg=RA10-PP22|title=Prairie Nights to Neon Lights: The Story of Country Music in West Texas|last2=Munde|first2=Alan|date=October 1996|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=978-0-89672-365-8|pages=134|language=en}}</ref> the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913\u20131984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and nurse Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 \u2013 May 12, 1992).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Nadine-Orbison/6000000012909498491 |title=Nadine Vesta Orbison |website=geni}}</ref> The family moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last=Orbison|first=Alex|publisher=Center Street|others=Orbison, Wesley,, Orbison, Roy Jr., Slate, Jeff,, Riesco, Marcel|year=2017|isbn=9781478976547|edition= Second|location=New York|pages=28|oclc=1017566749}}</ref>\n\nRoy attended Denver Avenue Elementary School<ref name=\":0\" /> until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon, and they moved again to [[Wink, Texas]] in 1946.

He considered his voice memorable, but not great.<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nRoy's father gave him a guitar on his sixth birthday. He recalled, \"I was finished, you know, for anything else\" by the time he was 7, and music became the focus of his life.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 7.</ref> His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s singing, with its slurred syllables,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 21.</ref> and he adopted the name \"Lefty Wilbury\" during his time with the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. One of the first musicians that he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to [[rhythm and blues]]), [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and Cajun music. The cajun favorite \"[[Jole Blon]]\" was one of the first songs that he sang in public. He began singing on a local radio show at age 8, and he became the show's host b y the late 1940s.<ref>Amburn, pp. 8, 9.</ref>\n\nIn high school, Orbison and some friends formed the band Wink Westerners.

He enrolled at [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay.<ref>Amburn, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> He then heard that his schoolmate [[Pat Boone]] had signed a record deal, and it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. He heard a song called \"Ooby Dooby\" while in college, composed by [[Dick Penner]] and Wade Moore, and he returned to Wink with \"Ooby Dooby\" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners after his first year.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He then enrolled in [[Odessa College|Odessa Junior College]]. Two members of the band quit and two new members were added,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and the group won a talent contest and obtained their own television show on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} The Wink Westerners kept performing on local TV, played dances on the weekends, and attended college during the day.\n\nWhile living in Odessa, Orbison saw a performance by [[Elvis Presley]].{{efn|Orbison later said that he \"couldn't overemphasize how shocking\" Presley looked and seemed to him that night.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>}} [[Johnny Cash]] toured the area in 1955 and 1956,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and he suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Orbison did so and was told, \"Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!\"{{efn|Both Orbison and Cash mentioned this anecdote years later, but Phillips denied that he was so abrupt on the phone with Orbison or that he hung up on him.

The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and broke into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> The Teen Kings toured with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\".<ref>Clayson, Alan p. 44.</ref> The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \"[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]\" and \"Rockhouse\". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips' home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref>Amburn, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A ballad Orbison wrote, \"The Clown\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOrbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote \"Claudette\"\u2014about Claudette Frady, whom he married in 1957\u2014and the [[Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of [[Chet Atkins]], who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \"Seems to Me\", by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then\u2014softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlaying shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Nashville]]. Only two singles were judged worthy of release by RCA.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\">Zak, p. 32.</ref> Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]].\n\n== 1960\u201364: Monument Records ==\n===Early singles===\nOrbison was one of the first recording artists to popularize the \"[[Nashville sound]]\", with a group of session musicians known as [[The Nashville A-Team]]. The Nashville sound was developed by producers Chet Atkins, [[Owen Bradley]] (who worked closely with [[Patsy Cline]]), Sam Phillips, and Fred Foster.<ref>Wolfe and Akenson, p. 24.</ref><ref>Hoffmann and Ferstler, p. 779.</ref> In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA had refused, \"Paper Boy\", backed by \"With the Bug\", but neither charted.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\">Zak, p. 33.</ref>\n\nAccording to musician and author Albin Zak, the studio (with sound engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], who experimented with [[Microphone practice|close miking]] the [[doo-wop]] backing singers), the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a \"polished, professional sound&nbsp;... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\".<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\"/> Orbison requested a string section and with it, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\", written with Joe Melson.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\">Lehman, p. 48.</ref> Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/><ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville \"brought a new splendor to rock\", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=decurtis155>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.</ref>\n\n\"Uptown\" reached only number 72 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>\n\n===Top-10 hits===\n====1960\u201362====\n\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \"Uptown\", and another song they had written called \"Come Back to Me (My Love)\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \"came not from his throat but deeper within\".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was \"[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down.<ref>Amburn p. 91.</ref> They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\"/><ref name=Fremer>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter \u2013 Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\"/>\n\n\"Only the Lonely\" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\"<ref name=\"rockhall\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name=\"amburn98\">Amburn, p. 98.</ref> Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \"Blue Angel\", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. \"I'm Hurtin'\", with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Running Scared.ogg\n|title=\"Running Scared\" (1961)\n|description=The ending of \"Running Scared\" features Orbison's natural voice hitting high A natural.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of \"Only the Lonely\" and \"I'm Hurtin'\", Orbison worked on a new song, \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\", based loosely on the rhythm of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]''; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, \"Running Scared\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> Just weeks later \"Running Scared\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \"Running Scared\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n\"Crying\" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \"Candy Man\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \"The Big O\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \"[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]\", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. (Orbison's producer later formed [[the Candymen]] quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970 and released a few singles and two albums of its own). Also in 1962, he charted with \"The Crowd\", \"Leah\", and \"Workin' for the Man\", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref>Amburn, p. 32.</ref> His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 91.</ref>\n\n====1963\u201364====\n[[File:1965 Roy Orbison.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Orbison began performing while wearing sunglasses in 1963, later recalling that he \"wasn't trying to be weird ...

He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an \"anonymous celebrity\".<ref>Lehman, p. 18.</ref> After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an aeroplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe [[stage fright]]; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat. The sunglasses led some people to assume he was blind.<ref>{{cite web |author=Robert Fontenot |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/oldieshistory/a/oldiesmyths.htm |title=Top 10 Oldies Myths: Urban Legends and Other Misperceptions about Early Rock and Roll: 2.

His string of top-40 hits continued with \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (US number seven, UK number six), \"Falling\" (US number 22, UK number 9), and \"[[Mean Woman Blues]]\" (US number five, UK number three) coupled with \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" (US number 29, UK number three).{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\">Brown, Kutner, and Warwick, p. 645.</ref> According to the official Roy Orbison U.S. discography by Marcel Riesco,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=249}} a rare alternate version of \"Blue Bayou\" was released in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).\n\nAs \"In Dreams\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with the [[the Beatles|Beatles]]. When he arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, \"What's a Beatle, anyway?\" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, \"I am\".<ref>Amburn, p. 115.</ref> On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison sang through 14 encores.<ref name=\"clayson109-113\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109\u2013113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting \"We want Roy!\" again, Lennon and McCartney physically held Orbison back.<ref>Amburn, p. 117.</ref> Starr later said, \"In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting.

''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\n\nTouring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette had an affair with the contractor who built their home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him.<ref>Amburn, pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with [[the Beach Boys]] and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref>Amburn, p. 125.</ref> He travelled to Australia again, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]]. [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\"<ref name=\"amburn134\">Amburn, p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman.ogg\n|title=\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964)\n|description=The opening guitar riff of \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was a direct influence on \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" by the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]].<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 128 and Lehman, p. 169.</ref>\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \"[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \"A pretty woman never needs any money\".<ref>Amburn, p. 127.</ref> Just 40 minutes later, \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, \"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\">Amburn, p. 128.</ref>\n\n==1965\u201369: Career decline and tragedies==\n[[File:Roy Orbison 1967.png|thumb|Orbison in 1967]]\nClaudette and Orbison divorced in November 1964 over her infidelities, but reconciled 10 months later. His contract with Monument was expiring in June 1965. Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison's agent, moved him from Monument Records to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) (though in Europe he remained with [[Decca Records|Decca's]] [[London Records]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/hlu9986 |title=Roy Orbison - Ride Away / Wondering - London - UK - HLU 9986 |website=45cat |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref>) for $1&nbsp;million, and the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast and, when not touring, writing or recording, dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nRose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville's A-Team.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\"/> Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964\u201365, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.<ref>Lehman, p. 14</ref>\n\nWhile on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}\n\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref>Amburn, p. 126.</ref>\n\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.<ref>Amburn, p. 54.</ref> Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], and died instantly.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref>\n\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]], and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, \"I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time\", with\u2014according to biographer Colin Escott\u2014\"zero conviction\".<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Amburn, pp. 151\u2013153.</ref>\n\nHe recorded an album dedicated to the songs of [[Don Gibson]] and another of [[Hank Williams]] covers, but both sold poorly. During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of England and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161\u201363.</ref> The property was sold to [[Johnny Cash]], who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it. On March 25, 1969, Orbison married German teenager [[Barbara Orbison|Barbara Jakobs]], whom he had met several weeks before his sons' deaths.<ref>Amburn, p. 163.</ref> Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison's parents.

He also failed to produce any popular singles after the 1960s except for a few in Australia. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents, and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.<ref>Amburn, p. 170.</ref> Peter Lehman observed that Orbison's absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released popular covers of his songs. Orbison's version of \"[[Love Hurts]]\" was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by hard rock band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by blues artist [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]]' version of \"Only the Lonely\" reached number one on the country music charts.<ref>Amburn, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\".\n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits reached number one in the UK in January 1976, and Orbison began to open concerts for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] that year, who started as [[Linda Ronstadt|Linda Ronstadt's]] backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" in 1977, her version reaching number three on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref>Amburn, p. 178.</ref> He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded \"[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]\" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\n\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]\n\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to spend the winter in [[Hawaii]]. He checked in to a hospital there where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]]. He underwent a triple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]] on January 18, 1978. He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183\u2013184.</ref> He felt revitalized following the surgery, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Don McLean]] recorded \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and it went to the top of the charts, first in the Netherlands then reaching number five in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was number one in the UK for three weeks and also topped the Irish Charts.<ref>Amburn, p. 182.</ref> He was all but forgotten in the US, yet he reached popularity in unlikely places such as [[Bulgaria]] in 1982.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964, and he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].<ref>Amburn, p. 183.</ref> In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet \"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\" from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', in which Orbison also had a cameo role, and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful of making a full return to popular music,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 192.</ref> though it was several years until this came to fruition. In the meantime, [[Van Halen]] released a hard-rock cover of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" on their 1982 album ''[[Diver Down]]'', again further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's music.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}}\n\n=== Career revival ===\n\n[[File:Orbison1987.jpg|thumb|left|Orbison performing in New York in 1987]]\n\nOrbison originally declined [[David Lynch]]'s request to allow the use of \"In Dreams\" for the film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986).<ref>Amburn, p. 191.</ref> Lynch used it anyway (although his first choice was \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=199}}); the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (played by  [[Dennis Hopper]]). It was lip-synched by an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] drug dealer played by [[Dean Stockwell]], after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere.<ref name=\"Amburn, p. 193\">Amburn, p. 193.</ref> Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, \"I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&nbsp;... I thought, 'What in the world&nbsp;...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie\u2014how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nBy 1987, Orbison's career was fully revived. He released an album of his re-recorded hits, titled ''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]''. \"Life Fades Away\", a song he co-wrote with his friend [[Glenn Danzig]] and recorded, was featured in the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |title=Glenn Danzig and Roy Orbison |publisher=RoyOrbison.com |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224630/http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}</ref> He and [[k.d. lang]] performed a duet of \"Crying\" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Hiding Out]]'' (1987); the pair received a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] after Orbison's death.<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/roy-orbison |title=GRAMMY Award Results for Roy Orbison |website=Recording Academy GRAMMY Awards |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and was initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album ''[[Born to Run]]'': \"I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector\u2014but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison.\"<ref name=\"clayson202-203\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 202\u2013203.</ref> In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt \"validated\" by the honor.<ref name=\"clayson202-203\"/> A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove nightclub]] in Los Angeles. They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: \"Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 207.</ref> The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.<ref>Amburn, p. 205.</ref>\n\n===Traveling Wilburys and ''Mystery Girl''===\n\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.<ref>Amburn, p. 218.</ref> By that evening, the group had written \"[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the [[Traveling Wilburys]], representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \"Lefty Wilbury\" after Lefty Frizzell.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 221.</ref>\n\nLynne later spoke of the recording sessions: \"Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'&nbsp;... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 208.</ref> Orbison was given one solo track, \"[[Not Alone Any More]]\", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]].<ref name=\"grammy\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.<ref>Amburn, p. 222.</ref>\n\nOrbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again, and was seemingly ecstatic about it. He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans, to develop a solo album, ''[[Mystery Girl]]''.\n\n''Mystery Girl'' was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]], whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever collaborated with.<ref>Amburn, p. 213.</ref> [[Elvis Costello]], Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him. The biggest hit from the album was \"[[You Got It]]\", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. It posthumously rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\"/>\n\nIn 2014, a demo of Orbison's \"The Way Is Love\" was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of ''Mystery Girl''. The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison's sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Roy's vocals; it was produced by [[John Carter Cash]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/21/unreleased-roy-orbison-track-the-way-is-love\n| title      = Unreleased Roy Orbison track resurrected by singer's sons\n| author     = Sean Michaels\n| date       = March 21, 2014\n| work       = The Guardian\n| accessdate = October 7, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the video for the Wilburys' \"Handle with Care\" was filmed with Orbison, the video for \"[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]\" was filmed and released posthumously.

In the final three months of his life, he gave ''Rolling Stone'' magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted [[Martin Sheen]] to play him in a biopic.<ref name=Pond/> In November 1988, ''Mystery Girl'' was completed, and ''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1'' was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in [[Johnny Cash]] that he was having chest pains. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in [[Antwerp]], where footage for the video for \"You Got It\" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in [[Boston]] was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.<ref>Amburn, pp. 227\u2013228.</ref>\n\nOrbison performed at the Front Row Theater in [[Highland Heights, Ohio]], on December 4. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys.

The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\"<ref name=\"amburn97\">Amburn, p. 97.</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|first2=Stephen L.|last2=Betts|date=October 5, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> and \"the Big O\".<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison's sons to administer their father's catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018, release of ''Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'' album as well as a fall 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called ''In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html|title=Roy Orbison with Royal Philharmonic \"Unchained Melodies\" Releases 11/16, Includes Duet With Country Music Sensation Cam|website=Music News Net}}</ref>\n\n===Songwriting===\n====Structures====\n\nMusic critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\".<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 20\">Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".<ref name=\"watrous\">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). \"Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold\". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way.&nbsp;... So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes&nbsp;... But that's always after the fact\u2014as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me.\" | Roy Orbison}}\n\n[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made \"radical left turns\", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \"Running Scared\" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\"/>\n\n====Themes====\n\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy\u2014try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a postmodern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things&nbsp;... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time.

[[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it.

When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 184.</ref> Bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who backed Orbison in his ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' concert, wrote about him, \"Roy Orbison was like an opera singer.

During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.<ref>{{Citation|last=Townsend|first=Paul|title=Roy Orbison, March 1967, Colston Hall, Bristol|date=January 2, 2014|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brizzlebornandbred/11707869923/|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Performance===\n[[File:Roy Orbison.jpg|thumb|250 px|Orbison, center (in white), performing in 1976]]\nOrbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like \"Mean Woman Blues\" did offer that.<ref>Lehman, p. 62.</ref> He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, \"I'm not a super personality\u2014on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like [[Chubby Checker]] or [[Bobby Rydell]] in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared.

Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Roy Orbison discography}}\n\n==Honors==\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 27, 2008 |via=Rolling Stone website |access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}\n\n* '''Grammys'''<ref name=\"grammy\"/>\n** Best Country Performance Duo or Group (1980), with Emmylou Harris\n** Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Recording (1986), with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson and Chips Moman\n** Best Country Vocal Collaboration (1988), with k.d. lang\n** Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (1989), as part of the Traveling Wilburys\n** Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male (1990)\n** Lifetime Achievement Award (1998)\n* [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"rockhall\"/>\n* [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"nswhof\"/>\n* [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=May 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130041222/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |archive-date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>\n* Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (2010)<ref name=\"Beeb\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8488965.stm Roy Orbison given Hollywood Walk of Fame star] BBC News (January 30, 2010).

Many critics described his music as operatic, nicknaming him \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock\" and \"the Big O\". Most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, while many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability. He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.\n\nOrbison began singing in a [[rockabilly]] and [[Country music|country-and-western]] band in high school. He was contracted by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956, but his greatest success came with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964). Soon afterward, he was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined.\n\nIn the 1980s, Orbison experienced a resurgence in popularity following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the [[Traveling Wilburys]], a rock supergroup with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989) was released as a solo single and became his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in the same year, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. ''Rolling Stone'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936 in [[Vernon, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Joe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&pg=RA10-PP22|title=Prairie Nights to Neon Lights: The Story of Country Music in West Texas|last2=Munde|first2=Alan|date=October 1996|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=978-0-89672-365-8|pages=134|language=en}}</ref> the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913\u20131984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and nurse Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 \u2013 May 12, 1992).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Nadine-Orbison/6000000012909498491 |title=Nadine Vesta Orbison |website=geni}}</ref> The family moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last=Orbison|first=Alex|publisher=Center Street|others=Orbison, Wesley,, Orbison, Roy Jr., Slate, Jeff,, Riesco, Marcel|year=2017|isbn=9781478976547|edition= Second|location=New York|pages=28|oclc=1017566749}}</ref>\n\nRoy attended Denver Avenue Elementary School<ref name=\":0\" /> until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon, and they moved again to [[Wink, Texas]] in 1946.

He considered his voice memorable, but not great.<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nRoy's father gave him a guitar on his sixth birthday. He recalled, \"I was finished, you know, for anything else\" by the time he was 7, and music became the focus of his life.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 7.</ref> His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s singing, with its slurred syllables,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 21.</ref> and he adopted the name \"Lefty Wilbury\" during his time with the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. One of the first musicians that he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to [[rhythm and blues]]), [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and Cajun music. The cajun favorite \"[[Jole Blon]]\" was one of the first songs that he sang in public. He began singing on a local radio show at age 8, and he became the show's host b y the late 1940s.<ref>Amburn, pp. 8, 9.</ref>\n\nIn high school, Orbison and some friends formed the band Wink Westerners. They played country standards and [[Glenn Miller]] songs at local honky-tonks and had a weekly radio show on [[KERB (AM)|KERB]] in [[Kermit, Texas]].<ref name=\"royorb1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |title=History Maker |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401175007/http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |website=The Official Roy Orbison Site |access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> They were offered $400 to play at a dance, and Orbison realized that he could make a living in music. He enrolled at [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay.<ref>Amburn, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> He then heard that his schoolmate [[Pat Boone]] had signed a record deal, and it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. He heard a song called \"Ooby Dooby\" while in college, composed by [[Dick Penner]] and Wade Moore, and he returned to Wink with \"Ooby Dooby\" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners after his first year.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He then enrolled in [[Odessa College|Odessa Junior College]]. Two members of the band quit and two new members were added,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and the group won a talent contest and obtained their own television show on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} The Wink Westerners kept performing on local TV, played dances on the weekends, and attended college during the day.\n\nWhile living in Odessa, Orbison saw a performance by [[Elvis Presley]].{{efn|Orbison later said that he \"couldn't overemphasize how shocking\" Presley looked and seemed to him that night.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>}} [[Johnny Cash]] toured the area in 1955 and 1956,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and he suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Orbison did so and was told, \"Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!\"{{efn|Both Orbison and Cash mentioned this anecdote years later, but Phillips denied that he was so abrupt on the phone with Orbison or that he hung up on him.

The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and broke into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> The Teen Kings toured with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\".<ref>Clayson, Alan p. 44.</ref> The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \"[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]\" and \"Rockhouse\". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips' home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref>Amburn, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A ballad Orbison wrote, \"The Clown\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOrbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote \"Claudette\"\u2014about Claudette Frady, whom he married in 1957\u2014and the [[Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of [[Chet Atkins]], who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \"Seems to Me\", by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then\u2014softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlaying shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Nashville]]. Only two singles were judged worthy of release by RCA.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\">Zak, p. 32.</ref> Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]].\n\n== 1960\u201364: Monument Records ==\n===Early singles===\nOrbison was one of the first recording artists to popularize the \"[[Nashville sound]]\", with a group of session musicians known as the [[the Nashville A-Team]]. The Nashville sound was developed by producers Chet Atkins, [[Owen Bradley]] (who worked closely with [[Patsy Cline]]), Sam Phillips, and Fred Foster.<ref>Wolfe and Akenson, p. 24.</ref><ref>Hoffmann and Ferstler, p. 779.</ref> In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA had refused, \"Paper Boy\", backed by \"With the Bug\", but neither charted.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\">Zak, p. 33.</ref>\n\nAccording to musician and author Albin Zak, the studio (with sound engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], who experimented with [[Microphone practice|close miking]] the [[doo-wop]] backing singers), the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a \"polished, professional sound&nbsp;... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\".<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\"/> Orbison requested a string section and with it, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\", written with Joe Melson.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\">Lehman, p. 48.</ref> Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/><ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville \"brought a new splendor to rock\", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=decurtis155>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.</ref>\n\n\"Uptown\" reached only number 72 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>\n\n===Top-10 hits===\n====1960\u201362====\n\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \"Uptown\", and another song they had written called \"Come Back to Me (My Love)\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \"came not from his throat but deeper within\".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was \"[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down.<ref>Amburn p. 91.</ref> They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\"/><ref name=Fremer>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter \u2013 Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\"/>\n\n\"Only the Lonely\" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\"<ref name=\"rockhall\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name=\"amburn98\">Amburn, p. 98.</ref> Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \"Blue Angel\", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. \"I'm Hurtin'\", with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Running Scared.ogg\n|title=\"Running Scared\" (1961)\n|description=The ending of \"Running Scared\" features Orbison's natural voice hitting high A natural.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of \"Only the Lonely\" and \"I'm Hurtin'\", Orbison worked on a new song, \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\", based loosely on the rhythm of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]''; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, \"Running Scared\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> Just weeks later \"Running Scared\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \"Running Scared\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n\"Crying\" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \"Candy Man\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \"The Big O\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \"[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]\", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. (Orbison's producer later formed [[the Candymen]] quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970 and released a few singles and two albums of its own). Also in 1962, he charted with \"The Crowd\", \"Leah\", and \"Workin' for the Man\", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref>Amburn, p. 32.</ref> His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 91.</ref>\n\n====1963\u201364====\n[[File:1965 Roy Orbison.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Orbison began performing while wearing sunglasses in 1963, later recalling that he \"wasn't trying to be weird ...  I didn't have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything, but the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse, although I never was, really.\"<ref>Creswell, p. 600.</ref>]]\n\nOrbison eventually developed an image that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an \"anonymous celebrity\".<ref>Lehman, p. 18.</ref> After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an aeroplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe [[stage fright]]; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat. The sunglasses led some people to assume he was blind.<ref>{{cite web |author=Robert Fontenot |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/oldieshistory/a/oldiesmyths.htm |title=Top 10 Oldies Myths: Urban Legends and Other Misperceptions about Early Rock and Roll: 2.

His string of top-40 hits continued with \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (US number seven, UK number six), \"Falling\" (US number 22, UK number 9), and \"[[Mean Woman Blues]]\" (US number five, UK number three) coupled with \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" (US number 29, UK number three).{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\">Brown, Kutner, and Warwick, p. 645.</ref> According to the official Roy Orbison U.S. discography by Marcel Riesco,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=249}} a rare alternate version of \"Blue Bayou\" was released in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).\n\nAs \"In Dreams\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with the [[the Beatles|Beatles]]. When he arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, \"What's a Beatle, anyway?\" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, \"I am\".<ref>Amburn, p. 115.</ref> On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison sang through 14 encores.<ref name=\"clayson109-113\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109\u2013113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting \"We want Roy!\" again, Lennon and McCartney physically held Orbison back.<ref>Amburn, p. 117.</ref> Starr later said, \"In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything.\"<ref name=\"clayson109-113\"/> Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work.<ref>Lennon, John; McCartney, Paul; Harrison, George; Starr, Ringo (2002). ''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\n\nTouring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette had an affair with the contractor who built their home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him.<ref>Amburn, pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with [[the Beach Boys]] and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref>Amburn, p. 125.</ref> He travelled to Australia again, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]]. [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\"<ref name=\"amburn134\">Amburn, p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman.ogg\n|title=\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964)\n|description=The opening guitar riff of \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was a direct influence on \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" by the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]].<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 128 and Lehman, p. 169.</ref>\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \"[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \"A pretty woman never needs any money\".<ref>Amburn, p. 127.</ref> Just 40 minutes later, \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, \"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\">Amburn, p. 128.</ref>\n\n==1965\u201369: Career decline and tragedies==\n[[File:Roy Orbison 1967.png|thumb|Orbison in 1967]]\nClaudette and Orbison divorced in November 1964 over her infidelities, but reconciled 10 months later. His contract with Monument was expiring in June 1965. Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison's agent, moved him from Monument Records to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) (though in Europe he remained with [[Decca Records|Decca's]] [[London Records]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/hlu9986 |title=Roy Orbison - Ride Away / Wondering - London - UK - HLU 9986 |website=45cat |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref>) for $1&nbsp;million, and the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast and, when not touring, writing or recording, dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nRose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville's A-Team.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\"/> Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964\u201365, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.<ref>Lehman, p. 14</ref>\n\nWhile on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}\n\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref>Amburn, p. 126.</ref>\n\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.<ref>Amburn, p. 54.</ref> Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], and died instantly.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref>\n\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]], and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, \"I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time\", with\u2014according to biographer Colin Escott\u2014\"zero conviction\".<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Amburn, pp. 151\u2013153.</ref>\n\nHe recorded an album dedicated to the songs of [[Don Gibson]] and another of [[Hank Williams]] covers, but both sold poorly. During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of England and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161\u201363.</ref> The property was sold to [[Johnny Cash]], who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it. On March 25, 1969, Orbison married German teenager [[Barbara Orbison|Barbara Jakobs]], whom he had met several weeks before his sons' deaths.<ref>Amburn, p. 163.</ref> Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison's parents. Orbison and Barbara had a son ([[Roy Orbison Jr.|Roy Kelton]]) in 1970 and another ([[Alex Orbison|Alexander]]) in 1974.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 178.</ref>\n\n==1970s\u201380s==\n===Struggles===\nOrbison continued recording albums in the 1970s, but none of them sold well and he went an entire decade by 1976 without an album reaching the charts. He also failed to produce any popular singles after the 1960s except for a few in Australia. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents, and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.<ref>Amburn, p. 170.</ref> Peter Lehman observed that Orbison's absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released popular covers of his songs. Orbison's version of \"[[Love Hurts]]\" was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by hard rock band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by blues artist [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]]' version of \"Only the Lonely\" reached number one on the country music charts.<ref>Amburn, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\".\n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits reached number one in the UK in January 1976, and Orbison began to open concerts for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] that year, who started as [[Linda Ronstadt|Linda Ronstadt's]] backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" in 1977, her version reaching number three on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref>Amburn, p. 178.</ref> He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded \"[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]\" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\n\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]\n\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to spend the winter in [[Hawaii]]. He checked in to a hospital there where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]]. He underwent a triple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]] on January 18, 1978. He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183\u2013184.</ref> He felt revitalized following the surgery, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Don McLean]] recorded \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and it went to the top of the charts, first in the Netherlands then reaching number five in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was number one in the UK for three weeks and also topped the Irish Charts.<ref>Amburn, p. 182.</ref> He was all but forgotten in the US, yet he reached popularity in unlikely places such as [[Bulgaria]] in 1982.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964, and he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].<ref>Amburn, p. 183.</ref> In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet \"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\" from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', in which Orbison also had a cameo role, and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful of making a full return to popular music,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 192.</ref> though it was several years until this came to fruition. In the meantime, [[Van Halen]] released a hard-rock cover of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" on their 1982 album ''[[Diver Down]]'', again further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's music.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}}\n\n=== Career revival ===\n\n[[File:Orbison1987.jpg|thumb|left|Orbison performing in New York in 1987]]\n\nOrbison originally declined [[David Lynch]]'s request to allow the use of \"In Dreams\" for the film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986).<ref>Amburn, p. 191.</ref> Lynch used it anyway (although his first choice was \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=199}}); the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (played by  [[Dennis Hopper]]). It was lip-synched by an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] drug dealer played by [[Dean Stockwell]], after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere.<ref name=\"Amburn, p. 193\">Amburn, p. 193.</ref> Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, \"I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&nbsp;... I thought, 'What in the world&nbsp;...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie\u2014how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nBy 1987, Orbison's career was fully revived. He released an album of his re-recorded hits, titled ''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]''. \"Life Fades Away\", a song he co-wrote with his friend [[Glenn Danzig]] and recorded, was featured in the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |title=Glenn Danzig and Roy Orbison |publisher=RoyOrbison.com |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224630/http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}</ref> He and [[k.d. lang]] performed a duet of \"Crying\" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Hiding Out]]'' (1987); the pair received a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] after Orbison's death.<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/roy-orbison |title=GRAMMY Award Results for Roy Orbison |website=Recording Academy GRAMMY Awards |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and was initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album ''[[Born to Run]]'': \"I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector\u2014but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison.\"<ref name=\"clayson202-203\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 202\u2013203.</ref> In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt \"validated\" by the honor.<ref name=\"clayson202-203\"/> A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove nightclub]] in Los Angeles. They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: \"Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 207.</ref> The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.<ref>Amburn, p. 205.</ref>\n\n===Traveling Wilburys and ''Mystery Girl''===\n\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.<ref>Amburn, p. 218.</ref> By that evening, the group had written \"[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the [[Traveling Wilburys]], representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \"Lefty Wilbury\" after Lefty Frizzell.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 221.</ref>\n\nLynne later spoke of the recording sessions: \"Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'&nbsp;... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 208.</ref> Orbison was given one solo track, \"[[Not Alone Any More]]\", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]].<ref name=\"grammy\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.<ref>Amburn, p. 222.</ref>\n\nOrbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again, and was seemingly ecstatic about it. He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans, to develop a solo album, ''[[Mystery Girl]]''.\n\n''Mystery Girl'' was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]], whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever collaborated with.<ref>Amburn, p. 213.</ref> [[Elvis Costello]], Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him. The biggest hit from the album was \"[[You Got It]]\", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. It posthumously rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\"/>\n\nIn 2014, a demo of Orbison's \"The Way Is Love\" was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of ''Mystery Girl''. The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison's sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Roy's vocals; it was produced by [[John Carter Cash]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/21/unreleased-roy-orbison-track-the-way-is-love\n| title      = Unreleased Roy Orbison track resurrected by singer's sons\n| author     = Sean Michaels\n| date       = March 21, 2014\n| work       = The Guardian\n| accessdate = October 7, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the video for the Wilburys' \"Handle with Care\" was filmed with Orbison, the video for \"[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]\" was filmed and released posthumously.

In the final three months of his life, he gave ''Rolling Stone'' magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted [[Martin Sheen]] to play him in a biopic.<ref name=Pond/> In November 1988, ''Mystery Girl'' was completed, and ''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1'' was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in [[Johnny Cash]] that he was having chest pains. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in [[Antwerp]], where footage for the video for \"You Got It\" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in [[Boston]] was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.<ref>Amburn, pp. 227\u2013228.</ref>\n\nOrbison performed at the Front Row Theater in [[Highland Heights, Ohio]], on December 4. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys. On December 6, 1988, he spent the day flying [[model aircraft|model airplanes]] with his sons and ate dinner at his mother's home in Hendersonville. Later that day, he died of a [[heart attack]], at the age of 52.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 213.</ref>\n\nA memorial for Orbison was held in Nashville, and another was held in Los Angeles.

The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\"<ref name=\"amburn97\">Amburn, p. 97.</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|first2=Stephen L.|last2=Betts|date=October 5, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> and \"the Big O\".<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison's sons to administer their father's catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018, release of ''Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'' album as well as a fall 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called ''In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html|title=Roy Orbison with Royal Philharmonic \"Unchained Melodies\" Releases 11/16, Includes Duet With Country Music Sensation Cam|website=Music News Net}}</ref>\n\n===Songwriting===\n====Structures====\n\nMusic critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\".<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 20\">Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".<ref name=\"watrous\">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). \"Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold\". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way.&nbsp;... So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes&nbsp;... But that's always after the fact\u2014as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me.\" | Roy Orbison}}\n\n[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made \"radical left turns\", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \"Running Scared\" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\"/>\n\n====Themes====\n\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy\u2014try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a postmodern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things&nbsp;... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time.

[[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it.

His voice could jar a corpse, always leave you muttering to yourself something like, \"Man, I don't believe it\". | Bob Dylan}}\n\nLikewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison's voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 184.</ref> Bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who backed Orbison in his ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' concert, wrote about him, \"Roy Orbison was like an opera singer. His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back. He never seemed like he was trying to sing, he just did it.\"<ref>Scheff, Jerry (2012). ''Way Down: Playing Bass with Elvis, Dylan, the Doors & More.'' Backbeat Books. p. 33.</ref>\n\nHis voice ranged from [[baritone]] to [[tenor]], and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range.<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Grady |first=Terence J. |date=February 2000 |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-02294.html |title=Orbison, Roy |website=American National Biography |url-access=subscription |access-date=May 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOrbison's severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.<ref>{{Citation|last=Townsend|first=Paul|title=Roy Orbison, March 1967, Colston Hall, Bristol|date=January 2, 2014|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brizzlebornandbred/11707869923/|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Performance===\n[[File:Roy Orbison.jpg|thumb|250 px|Orbison, center (in white), performing in 1976]]\nOrbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like \"Mean Woman Blues\" did offer that.<ref>Lehman, p. 62.</ref> He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, \"I'm not a super personality\u2014on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like [[Chubby Checker]] or [[Bobby Rydell]] in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 78.</ref>\n\nLang compared Orbison to a tree, with passive but solid beauty.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lang, k. d. |date=April 15, 2004 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |title=The Immortals \u2013 The Greatest Artists of All Time: 37) Roy Orbison |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506004850/https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |archive-date=May 6, 2009}}</ref> This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by [[John Belushi]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing \"Oh, Pretty Woman\", and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\"/> However, Lang quantified this style by saying, \"It's so hard to explain what Roy's energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence but not say a word. Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Roy Orbison discography}}\n\n==Honors==\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 27, 2008 |via=Rolling Stone website |access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}\n\n* '''Grammys'''<ref name=\"grammy\"/>\n** Best Country Performance Duo or Group (1980), with Emmylou Harris\n** Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Recording (1986), with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson and Chips Moman\n** Best Country Vocal Collaboration (1988), with k.d. lang\n** Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (1989), as part of the Traveling Wilburys\n** Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male (1990)\n** Lifetime Achievement Award (1998)\n* [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"rockhall\"/>\n* [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"nswhof\"/>\n* [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=May 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130041222/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |archive-date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>\n* Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (2010)<ref name=\"Beeb\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8488965.stm Roy Orbison given Hollywood Walk of Fame star] BBC News (January 30, 2010).
