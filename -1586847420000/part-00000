We met the workers of Khaybar coming out in the morning with their spades and baskets. When they saw the apostle and the army they cried, `Muhammad with his force,' and turned tail and fled. The apostle said, 'Allah akbar! Khaybar is destroyed. When we arrive in a people's square it is a bad morning for those who have been warned.'\" (page 511)\n\"So he got off his horse and came at him and 'Ali advanced with his shield. `Amr aimed a blow which cut deeply into the shield so that the sword stuck in it and struck his head.

We met the workers of Khaybar coming out in the morning with their spades and baskets. When they saw the apostle and the army they cried, `Muhammad with his force,' and turned tail and fled. The apostle said, 'Allah akbar! Khaybar is destroyed. When we arrive in a people's square it is a bad morning for those who have been warned.'\" (page 511)\n\"So he got off his horse and came at him and 'Ali advanced with his shield. `Amr aimed a blow which cut deeply into the shield so that the sword stuck in it and struck his head.

The season officially began on 15&nbsp;November, however, the formation of the first system&mdash;Zone of Disturbed Weather 01&mdash;occurred on 22&nbsp;July 2019, well before the official start of the season. It will end on 30 April 2020, with the exception of [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]], for which it will end on 15 May 2020. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of [[longitude|90\u00b0E]] and south of the [[Equator]]. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] in [[R\u00e9union]].\n\nFor the second consecutive year in a row, the first system formed before the official start of the season. Afterwards, two storms formed in the month of December: [[Cyclone Belna]] on 2 December, which brought flooding and strong wind to northwestern [[Madagascar]], as well as Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Ambali, which formed a day later. Ambali was the first very intense tropical cyclone in the basin since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. \n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\nThe season began with one of the strongest positive phases of the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD) in the past 40 years. [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France R\u00e9union]] expects that the positive anomalies will decay slowly throughout austral summer, having a prominent impact on the cyclone season through mid-February. As a result, storm activity was not forecast to begin until December&mdash;the month in which the monsoonal flow becomes established in the western half of the basin (the dry conditions in the central and eastern Indian Ocean induced by the IOD would prevent typical early-season storms).

The disturbance failed to organise into a tropical depression and dissipated on 25 July. Tropical activity came to a halt until 2 December when Tropical Disturbance 02 formed. A day later, Tropical Depression 03 formed and was later named Ambali. On 5 December, Tropical Storm Ambali rapidly intensified, becoming the first very intense tropical cyclone since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. Tropical Disturbance 02 then became Belna, and Belna continued to intensify into a Severe Tropical Storm. Belna then intensified into a cyclone, equivalent to a category 3 hurricane before making landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a category 2 hurricane-equivalent storm, leaving significant damages and 9 deaths. In late December, tropical storm Calvinia formed. It persisted into 2020. Activity was quiet for three weeks. On 19 January, a tropical depression formed, but soon dissipated without being named. Two tropical storms formed in late January, Diane and Esami. They also both dissipated without reaching tropical cyclone status. In early February, another tropical depression formed. It eventually intensified into a tropical storm and was named Francisco. Francisco degenerated into a remnant low several days after formation. In mid-February, the storm regenerated into a tropical depression. At the same time, another disturbance formed, and would strengthen into Tropical Storm Gabekile. It wasn't long until Gabekile strengthened into a tropical cyclone. However, it quickly weakened. By 19 February, Gabekile had dissipated. Nearly a month later, Moderate Tropical Storm Herold formed. On 14 March, [[Cyclone Herold|Herold]] strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Herold then rapidly intensified to become the season's 2nd Intense Tropical Cyclone.  Shortly after, it rapidly weakened as it moved southwards before dissipating. In early April, Moderate tropical storm Irondro formed.\n\n==Systems==\n===Zone of Disturbed Weather 01===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SWI\n|Image=01R 2019-07-23 0900Z.jpg\n|Track=01R 2019 track.png\n|Formed=22 July\n|Dissipated=25 July\n|10-min winds=25\n|Pressure=1001\n|Type1=ZODW\n}}\n\nIn mid-July, a broad wind circulation developed over the central Indian Ocean, accompanied by deep [[convection (meteorology)|convection]].

[[subtropical cyclone]] formation. The season officially began on 15&nbsp;November, however, the formation of the first system&mdash;Zone of Disturbed Weather 01&mdash;occurred on 22&nbsp;July 2019, well before the official start of the season. It will end on 30 April 2020, with the exception of [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]], for which it will end on 15 May 2020. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of [[longitude|90\u00b0E]] and south of the [[Equator]]. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] in [[R\u00e9union]].\n\nFor the second consecutive year in a row, the first system formed before the official start of the season. Afterwards, two storms formed in the month of December: [[Cyclone Belna]] on 2 December, which brought flooding and strong wind to northwestern [[Madagascar]], as well as Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Ambali, which formed a day later. Ambali was the first very intense tropical cyclone in the basin since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. \n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\nThe season began with one of the strongest positive phases of the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD) in the past 40 years. [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France R\u00e9union]] expects that the positive anomalies will decay slowly throughout austral summer, having a prominent impact on the cyclone season through mid-February. As a result, storm activity was not forecast to begin until December&mdash;the month in which the monsoonal flow becomes established in the western half of the basin (the dry conditions in the central and eastern Indian Ocean induced by the IOD would prevent typical early-season storms). With warm and wet conditions expected in the western Indian Ocean, cyclone formation is expected to be enhanced west of 70\u00b0E.<ref name=\"mfroutlook\">{{cite report |title=Pr\u00e9vision saisonni\u00e8re d\u2019activit\u00e9 cyclonique dans le Sud-Ouest de l'oc\u00e9an Indien : Saison 2019-2020. |url=http://www.meteofrance.re/documents/3714872/28998514/CP_previ_saison_cyclone_2019-2020.pdf |website=PREVISION SAISONNIERE ACTIVITE CYCLONIQUE SWIO 2019-2020 |publisher=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France La R\u00e9union |accessdate=6 December 2019 |location=Saint-Denis, R\u00e9union |language=French |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nA near-average eight to eleven storms are expected throughout the course of the season, with the possibility of a higher than average number of these attaining Tropical Cyclone strength with winds of {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} or greater as a result of favorable upper-level divergence in the western region of the basin.

The disturbance failed to organise into a tropical depression and dissipated on 25 July. Tropical activity came to a halt until 2 December when Tropical Disturbance 02 formed. A day later, Tropical Depression 03 formed and was later named Ambali. On 5 December, Tropical Storm Ambali rapidly intensified, becoming the first very intense tropical cyclone since [[Cyclone Fantala|Fantala]] in 2016. Tropical Disturbance 02 then became Belna, and Belna continued to intensify into a Severe Tropical Storm. Belna then intensified into a cyclone, equivalent to a category 3 hurricane before making landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a category 2 hurricane-equivalent storm, leaving significant damages and 9 deaths. In late December, tropical storm Calvinia formed. It persisted into 2020. Activity was quiet for three weeks. On 19 January, a tropical depression formed, but soon dissipated without being named. Two tropical storms formed in late January, Diane and Esami. They also both dissipated without reaching tropical cyclone status. In early February, another tropical depression formed. It eventually intensified into a tropical storm and was named Francisco. Francisco degenerated into a remnant low several days after formation. In mid-February, the storm regenerated into a tropical depression. At the same time, another disturbance formed, and would strengthen into Tropical Storm Gabekile. It wasn't long until Gabekile strengthened into a tropical cyclone. However, it quickly weakened. By 19 February, Gabekile had dissipated. Nearly a month later, Moderate Tropical Storm Herold formed. On 14 March, [[Cyclone Herold|Herold]] strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Herold then rapidly intensified to become the season's 2nd Intense Tropical Cyclone.  Shortly after, it rapidly weakened as it moved southwards before dissipating. In early April, Moderate tropical storm Irondro formed.\n\n==Systems==\n===Zone of Disturbed Weather 01===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SWI\n|Image=01R 2019-07-23 0900Z.jpg\n|Track=01R 2019 track.png\n|Formed=22 July\n|Dissipated=25 July\n|10-min winds=25\n|Pressure=1001\n|Type1=ZODW\n}}\n\nIn mid-July, a broad wind circulation developed over the central Indian Ocean, accompanied by deep [[convection (meteorology)|convection]].

The film was remade in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Veera Madakari]]'' (2009), in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[Siruthai]]'' (2011), in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Rowdy Rathore]]'' (2012), in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Indian Bengali]] as ''[[Bikram Singha: The Lion Is Back]]'' (2012), \n\nAnd Twice in [[Cinema of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi Bengali]] as ''[[Ulta Palta 69]]'' (2007) and ''[[Action Jasmine]]'' (2015) starring [[Symon Sadik]] and [[Bobby (actress)|Bobby]]\n\nWith six remakes, it is one among the highest remade film in Indian cinema (along with ''[[Pavitra Bandham]]'', ''[[Charlie Chaplin (2002 film)|Charlie Chaplin]]'', ''[[Shutter (2012 film)|Shutter]]'' and ''[[Brindavanam (2010 film)|Brindavanam]]''), and behind ''[[Drishyam]]'' and ''[[Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana]]'' (seven times each).\n\n==Plot==\nAthili Sathi Babu ([[Ravi Teja]]) is a rookie thief in Hyderabad, who is crazy about performing dare devil acts. He falls in love with Neeraja ([[Anushka Shetty]]), who is in Hyderabad to attend a marriage. Sathi Babu makes his way into her heart and she also starts loving him. Sathi Babu tells her the truth about him being a thief and resolves to give up crime forever. But before that, he decides to swindle one last person for a large sum of money along with his uncle Duvva ([[Brahmanandam]]). He tricks a woman in a bus stand and flees with a trunk. This leads Sathi Babu to Neha (Baby Neha), a young girl who was in the trunk instead of the wealth he thought was in the trunk, who thinks that Sathi Babu is her father. Flummoxed by what is happening, but forced to keep Neha with her as a police officer Inspector Mahanti ([[Rajiv Kanakala]]) keeps his eye on him.\n \nAlthough he tries keeping Neha away from Neeraja\u2019s eyes, the latter finds out about Neha. Angry and hurt, Neeraja leaves for her place leaving Sathi Babu heartbroken. Soon, unknown goons attack him, taking him to be  superintendent of Police, Vikram Rathore (also Ravi Teja), Neha\u2019s real father. Rathore looks exactly like Sathi Babu, which had caused all the confusion. While many unknown people help Sathi Babu run to safety with Neha in his arms, he is soon surrounded by the goons. It is then that Rathore makes an appearance and saves the day killing every goon by himself, but he soon dies suffering from injuries.\n \nThe other policemen who had assisted the SP then inform Sathi Babu of the whole incident. In Chambal village of Devgarh, Madhya Pradesh, the slain, and corrupt local [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|M. L. A.]] Bavuji ([[Vineet Kumar]]), a borderline psychopath, engulfs the town with his political corruption, illegal activities, criminal nexus, rape, and money laundering. His son Munna ([[Amit Tiwari]]) indulges in abusing women, and raping the wives of policemen. Rathore immediately arrests him and also makes him mentally insane. Munna humiliates police by removing their clothes but was killed by Rathod when he was hung from a tree by the belt of a humiliated inspector. Rathore was attacked by Bavuji's brother Titla ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]) on Holi where he was stabbed from the back as well as shot in the head while trying to save a village child and was assumed to be dead. But he survives with a brain injury although the goons assumed that he is dead. Effects of this brain injury are later visible and these effects are diminished by water falling on his head.\n \nSathi Babu then adopts Neha, who does not know that her father is dead. Then Sathi Babu returns to Devgarh posing as Rathore, and heads to settle the scores with Bavuji. Duvva tells Neeraja the truth and she forgives Sathi Babu. Sathi Babu, being a goon, handles Bavuji well with tricks. He sets the MLA's wine factory on fire and makes the villagers rob his food store. A fight ensues in which he defeats all of Bavuji's men alone. In the end, he fights with Titla on a rope bridge. Sathi Babu ties and cuts the rope and Titla falls to death. Sathi Babu gets married to Neeraja, and they leave for a new life with Neha and Duvva.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ravi Teja]] as Athili Sathi Babu / ASP Vikram Singh Rathore IPS (Double role)\n* [[Anushka Shetty]] as Neeraja Goswami\n* [[Ruthika]] as Sub-inspector Razia (2nd female lead)\n* [[Vineet Kumar]] as Bavuji, MLA\n* [[Amit Tiwari]] as Bavuji's Son\n* Abdul Rehman as Bavuji's Henchman\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Duvva Abbulu\n* Baby Neha as Neha\n* [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] as Titla\n* [[Rajiv Kanakala]] as Inspector Mahanti\n* [[Raghu Babu]] as Bavuji\u2019s brother-in-law\n* [[Jaya Prakash Reddy]] as Home Minister\n* [[Madhuri Sen]] as Inspector Mahanti's wife\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as DGP (Guest Appearance)\n* [[Jyothika]] as wife of Vikram  Rathore (In Portrait)\n* [[Meghna Naidu]] as [[item number|Item girl]] in song \"Vastavaa\"\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nThe shooting was disrupted by quarry workers started pelting the film\u2019s unit with stones, damaging most of the equipment and injuring some of the film crew including director [[S.

He falls in love with Neeraja ([[Anushka Shetty]]), who is in Hyderabad to attend a marriage. Sathi Babu makes his way into her heart and she also starts loving him. Sathi Babu tells her the truth about him being a thief and resolves to give up crime forever. But before that, he decides to swindle one last person for a large sum of money along with his uncle Duvva ([[Brahmanandam]]). He tricks a woman in a bus stand and flees with a trunk. This leads Sathi Babu to Neha (Baby Neha), a young girl who was in the trunk instead of the wealth he thought was in the trunk, who thinks that Sathi Babu is her father. Flummoxed by what is happening, but forced to keep Neha with her as a police officer Inspector Mahanti ([[Rajiv Kanakala]]) keeps his eye on him.\n \nAlthough he tries keeping Neha away from Neeraja\u2019s eyes, the latter finds out about Neha. Angry and hurt, Neeraja leaves for her place leaving Sathi Babu heartbroken. Soon, unknown goons attack him, taking him to be  superintendent of Police, Vikram Rathore (also Ravi Teja), Neha\u2019s real father. Rathore looks exactly like Sathi Babu, which had caused all the confusion. While many unknown people help Sathi Babu run to safety with Neha in his arms, he is soon surrounded by the goons. It is then that Rathore makes an appearance and saves the day killing every goon by himself, but he soon dies suffering from injuries.\n \nThe other policemen who had assisted the SP then inform Sathi Babu of the whole incident. In Chambal village of Devgarh, Madhya Pradesh, the slain, and corrupt local [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|M. L. A.]] Bavuji ([[Vineet Kumar]]), a borderline psychopath, engulfs the town with his political corruption, illegal activities, criminal nexus, rape, and money laundering. His son Munna ([[Amit Tiwari]]) indulges in abusing women, and raping the wives of policemen. Rathore immediately arrests him and also makes him mentally insane. Munna humiliates police by removing their clothes but was killed by Rathod when he was hung from a tree by the belt of a humiliated inspector. Rathore was attacked by Bavuji's brother Titla ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]) on Holi where he was stabbed from the back as well as shot in the head while trying to save a village child and was assumed to be dead. But he survives with a brain injury although the goons assumed that he is dead. Effects of this brain injury are later visible and these effects are diminished by water falling on his head.\n \nSathi Babu then adopts Neha, who does not know that her father is dead. Then Sathi Babu returns to Devgarh posing as Rathore, and heads to settle the scores with Bavuji. Duvva tells Neeraja the truth and she forgives Sathi Babu. Sathi Babu, being a goon, handles Bavuji well with tricks. He sets the MLA's wine factory on fire and makes the villagers rob his food store. A fight ensues in which he defeats all of Bavuji's men alone. In the end, he fights with Titla on a rope bridge. Sathi Babu ties and cuts the rope and Titla falls to death. Sathi Babu gets married to Neeraja, and they leave for a new life with Neha and Duvva.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ravi Teja]] as Athili Sathi Babu / ASP Vikram Singh Rathore IPS (Double role)\n* [[Anushka Shetty]] as Neeraja Goswami\n* [[Ruthika]] as Sub-inspector Razia (2nd female lead)\n* [[Vineet Kumar]] as Bavuji, MLA\n* [[Amit Tiwari]] as Bavuji's Son\n* Abdul Rehman as Bavuji's Henchman\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Duvva Abbulu\n* Baby Neha as Neha\n* [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] as Titla\n* [[Rajiv Kanakala]] as Inspector Mahanti\n* [[Raghu Babu]] as Bavuji\u2019s brother-in-law\n* [[Jaya Prakash Reddy]] as Home Minister\n* [[Madhuri Sen]] as Inspector Mahanti's wife\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as DGP (Guest Appearance)\n* [[Jyothika]] as wife of Vikram  Rathore (In Portrait)\n* [[Meghna Naidu]] as [[item number|Item girl]] in song \"Vastavaa\"\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nThe shooting was disrupted by quarry workers started pelting the film\u2019s unit with stones, damaging most of the equipment and injuring some of the film crew including director [[S.

LED lamp packaging may show the light output in [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], the [[Electric energy consumption|power consumption]] in watts, the [[color temperature]] in [[Kelvin]] or a colour description such as \"warm white\", \"cool white\" or \"daylight\", the operating temperature range, and sometimes the equivalent wattage of an incandescent lamp delivering the same output in lumens.\n\nThe directional emission characteristics of LEDs affect the design of lamps. While a single power LED may produce as much [[luminous flux|light output]] as an incandescent lamp using several times as much power, in most general lighting applications multiple LEDs are used. This can form a lamp with improved cost, light distribution, heat dissipation and possibly also color-rendering characteristics.\n\nLEDs run on [[direct current]] (DC), whereas mains current is [[alternating current]] (AC) and usually at much higher voltage than the LED can accept. LED lamps can contain a circuit for converting the mains AC into DC at the correct voltage. These circuits contain rectifiers, capacitors, and may have other active electronic components, which may also permit the lamp to be dimmed. In an [[LED filament]] lamp, the driving circuit is simplified because many LED junctions in series have approximately the same operating voltage as the AC supply. LEDs require a power supply system (driver) to interface them with the electric network. Generally the current waveform contains some amount of distortion, depending on the luminaries\u2019 technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ciugudeanu|first=Calin|last2=Buzdugan|first2=Mircea|last3=Beu|first3=Dorin|last4=Campianu|first4=Angel|last5=Galatanu|first5=Catalin Daniel|date=2019-12-12|title=Sustainable Lighting-Retrofit Versus Dedicated Luminaires-Light Versus Power Quality|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=11|issue=24|pages=7125|doi=10.3390/su11247125|issn=2071-1050|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Light-emitting diode#History}}\n[[File:Haitz-law.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Illustration of [[Haitz's law]], showing improvement in light output per LED over time, with a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis]]\n\nBefore the introduction of LED lamps, three types of lamps were used for the bulk of general (white) lighting:\n* [[Incandescent light bulb|Incandescent lights]], which produce light with a glowing filament heated by electric current.  These are very inefficient, having a [[luminous efficacy]] of 10\u201317 lumens/W, and also have a short lifetime of 1000 hours.  They are being phased out of general lighting applications.  Incandescent lamps produce a continuous [[Black-body radiation|black body spectrum]] of light similar to sunlight, and so produce high [[Color rendering index]] (CRI).\n* [[Fluorescent lamp]]s, which produce [[ultraviolet]] light by a [[glow discharge]] between two electrodes in a low pressure tube of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, which is converted to visible light by a [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] coating on the inside of the tube.  These are more efficient than incandescent lights, having a luminous efficacy of around 60 lumens/W, and have a longer lifetime 6,000\u201315,000 hours, and are widely used for residential and office lighting.  However, their [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] content makes them a hazard to the environment, and they have to be disposed of as [[hazardous waste]].\n* [[Metal-halide lamp]]s, which produce light by an arc between two electrodes in an atmosphere of argon, mercury and other metals, and iodine or bromine.  These were the most efficient white electric lights before LEDs, having a luminous efficacy of 75\u2013100 lumens/W and have a relatively long bulb lifetime of 6,000\u201315,000 hours, but because they require a 5\u20137 minute warmup period before turning on, are not used for residential lighting, but for commercial and industrial wide area lighting, and outdoor security lights and streetlights.  Like fluorescents, they also contain hazardous mercury.\n\nConsidered as electric energy converters, all these existing lamps are inefficient, emitting more of their input energy as waste heat than as visible light.  Global electric lighting in 1997 consumed 2016 terawatthours of energy.  Lighting consumes roughly 12% of electrical energy produced by industrialized countries.  The increasing scarcity of [[World energy resources|energy resources]], and the environmental costs of producing energy, particularly the discovery of [[global warming]] due to carbon dioxide emitted by the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s, which are the largest source of energy for electric power generation, created an increased incentive to develop more energy-efficient electric lights.\n\nThe first low-powered LEDs were developed in the early 1960s, and only produced light in the low, red frequencies of the spectrum.

The first LEDs emitted light in a very narrow band of wavelengths, of a color characteristic of the energy [[band gap]] of the [[semiconductor]] material used to make the LED.  LEDs that emit white light are made using two principal methods: either mixing light from multiple LEDs of various colors, or using a [[phosphor]] to convert some of the light to other colors. The light is not the same as a true black body, giving a different appearance to colors than an incandescent bulb. Color rendering quality is specified by the CRI, and {{As of|2019|lc=y}} is about 80 for many LED bulbs, and over 95 for more expensive [[high-CRI LED lighting]] (100 is the ideal value).\n\n[[RGB color model|RGB]] or [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]] white LEDs use multiple LED chips emitting red, green, and blue wavelengths. These three colors combine to produce white light. The [[color rendering index]] (CRI) is poor, typically 25 \u2013 65, due to the narrow range of wavelengths emitted.<ref name=ledcri>{{cite journal|bibcode=2002SPIE.4776...61N|title=Color rendering properties of LED light sources|journal=Proceedings of the SPIE|volume=4776|page=61|last1=Narendran|first1=Nadarajah|last2=Deng|first2=Lei|year=2002|doi=10.1117/12.452574|series=Solid State Lighting II}}</ref> Higher CRI values can be obtained using more than three LED colors to cover a greater range of wavelengths.\n\nThe second basic method uses LEDs in conjunction with a [[phosphor]] to produce [[complementary colors]] from a single LED.  Some of the light from the LED is absorbed by the molecules of the phosphor, causing them to [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]], emitting light of another color via the [[Stokes shift]].  The most common method is to combine a blue LED with a yellow phosphor, producing a narrow range of blue wavelengths and a broad band of \"yellow\" wavelengths actually covering the spectrum from green to red. The CRI value can range from less than 70 to over 90, although a wide range of commercial LEDs of this type have a color rendering index around 82.<ref name=ledcri/> Following successive increases in efficacy, which has reached 150 lm/W on a production basis as of 2017, this type has surpassed the performance of trichromatic LEDs.\n\nThe phosphors used in white light LEDs can give [[correlated color temperature]]s in the range of 2,200 K (dimmed incandescent) up to 7,000 K or more.<ref name=philips>{{cite web|title=Warm white LED light|url=https://www.philips.co.uk/c-m-li/led-lights/warm-led-light#|accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Color changing LED lighting===\nTunable lighting systems employ banks of colored LEDs that can be individually controlled, either using separate banks of each color, or multi-chip LEDs with the colors combined and controlled at the chip level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://luxreview.com/article/2016/05/two-minute-eplainer-tunable-white-leds|accessdate=4 September 2016|title=Two-minute explainer: Tunable-white LEDs}}</ref> For example, white LEDs of different color temperatures can be combined to construct an LED bulb that decreases its color temperature when dimmed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warm Glow Effect |url=https://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-li/choose-a-bulb/warm-glow-dimmable-led-lighting |website=Philips Lighting |accessdate=10 October 2018 |language=en-us}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfbu5zjQYdg teardown]</ref>\n\n===LED drivers===\n{{main|LED driver}}\nLED chips require controlled [[direct current]] (DC) electrical power and an appropriate circuit as an [[LED circuit|LED driver]] is required to convert the [[alternating current]] from the power supply to the regulated voltage direct current used by the LEDs.\n\nLED drivers are the essential components of LED lamps or luminaries. A good LED driver can guarantee a long life for an LED system and provide additional features such as dimming and control. The LED drivers can be put inside the lamp or luminaire, which is called a built-in type (or integral), or be put outside, which is called an independent type (or remote). According to different applications, different types of LED drivers need to be applied; for example, an outdoor driver for street light, an indoor point driver for a down light, and an indoor linear driver for a panel light.\n\nResearch studies such as <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ciugudeanu|first=Calin|last2=Buzdugan|first2=Mircea|last3=Beu|first3=Dorin|last4=Campianu|first4=Angel|last5=Galatanu|first5=Catalin Daniel|date=January 2019|title=Sustainable Lighting-Retrofit Versus Dedicated Luminaires-Light Versus Power Quality|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=11|issue=24|pages=7125|doi=10.3390/su11247125|doi-access=free}}</ref> analyse the power quality indicators correlated with the provided lighting outputs, under different voltage values and wave-forms.

[[Thermal management of high-power LEDs]] is required to keep the [[junction temperature]] close to ambient temperature.

Instead of increasing current levels, luminance is usually increased by combining multiple LEDs in one lamp. Solving the problem of efficiency droop would mean that household LED lamps would require fewer LEDs, which would significantly reduce costs.\n\nIn addition to being less efficient, operating LEDs at higher electric currents produces high temperatures which compromise the lifetime of the LED. Because of this increased heating at higher currents, [[light-emitting diode#High-power|high-brightness LEDs]] have an industry standard of operating at only 350&nbsp;mA, giving a good compromise between light output, efficiency, and longevity.<ref>[http://www.energy-daily.com/reports/The_LED_Dark_Secret_999.html The LED's dark secret].

The newer rare earth triphosphor blend linear fluorescent lamps made by Osram, Philips, Crompton and others have a life expectancy greater than 40,000 hours, if coupled with a warm-start electronic ballast.

LED lamp packaging may show the light output in [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], the [[Electric energy consumption|power consumption]] in watts, the [[color temperature]] in [[Kelvin]] or a colour description such as \"warm white\", \"cool white\" or \"daylight\", the operating temperature range, and sometimes the equivalent wattage of an incandescent lamp delivering the same output in lumens.\n\nThe directional emission characteristics of LEDs affect the design of lamps. While a single power LED may produce as much [[luminous flux|light output]] as an incandescent lamp using several times as much power, in most general lighting applications multiple LEDs are used. This can form a lamp with improved cost, light distribution, heat dissipation and possibly also color-rendering characteristics.\n\nLEDs run on [[direct current]] (DC), whereas mains current is [[alternating current]] (AC) and usually at much higher voltage than the LED can accept. LED lamps can contain a circuit for converting the mains AC into DC at the correct voltage. These circuits contain rectifiers, capacitors, and may have other active electronic components, which may also permit the lamp to be dimmed. In an [[LED filament]] lamp, the driving circuit is simplified because many LED junctions in series have approximately the same operating voltage as the AC supply. LEDs require a power supply system (driver) to interface them with the electric network. Generally the current waveform contains some amount of distortion, depending on the luminaries\u2019 technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ciugudeanu|first=Calin|last2=Buzdugan|first2=Mircea|last3=Beu|first3=Dorin|last4=Campianu|first4=Angel|last5=Galatanu|first5=Catalin Daniel|date=2019-12-12|title=Sustainable Lighting-Retrofit Versus Dedicated Luminaires-Light Versus Power Quality|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=11|issue=24|pages=7125|doi=10.3390/su11247125|issn=2071-1050|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Light-emitting diode#History}}\n[[File:Haitz-law.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Illustration of [[Haitz's law]], showing improvement in light output per LED over time, with a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis]]\n\nBefore the introduction of LED lamps, three types of lamps were used for the bulk of general (white) lighting:\n* [[Incandescent light bulb|Incandescent lights]], which produce light with a glowing filament heated by electric current.  These are very inefficient, having a [[luminous efficacy]] of 10\u201317 lumens/W, and also have a short lifetime of 1000 hours.  They are being phased out of general lighting applications.  Incandescent lamps produce a continuous [[Black-body radiation|black body spectrum]] of light similar to sunlight, and so produce high [[Color rendering index]] (CRI).\n* [[Fluorescent lamp]]s, which produce [[ultraviolet]] light by a [[glow discharge]] between two electrodes in a low pressure tube of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, which is converted to visible light by a [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] coating on the inside of the tube.  These are more efficient than incandescent lights, having a luminous efficacy of around 60 lumens/W, and have a longer lifetime 6,000\u201315,000 hours, and are widely used for residential and office lighting.  However, their [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] content makes them a hazard to the environment, and they have to be disposed of as [[hazardous waste]].\n* [[Metal-halide lamp]]s, which produce light by an arc between two electrodes in an atmosphere of argon, mercury and other metals, and iodine or bromine.  These were the most efficient white electric lights before LEDs, having a luminous efficacy of 75\u2013100 lumens/W and have a relatively long bulb lifetime of 6,000\u201315,000 hours, but because they require a 5\u20137 minute warmup period before turning on, are not used for residential lighting, but for commercial and industrial wide area lighting, and outdoor security lights and streetlights.  Like fluorescents, they also contain hazardous mercury.\n\nConsidered as electric energy converters, all these existing lamps are inefficient, emitting more of their input energy as waste heat than as visible light.  Global electric lighting in 1997 consumed 2016 terawatthours of energy.  Lighting consumes roughly 12% of electrical energy produced by industrialized countries.  The increasing scarcity of [[World energy resources|energy resources]], and the environmental costs of producing energy, particularly the discovery of [[global warming]] due to carbon dioxide emitted by the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s, which are the largest source of energy for electric power generation, created an increased incentive to develop more energy-efficient electric lights.\n\nThe first low-powered LEDs were developed in the early 1960s, and only produced light in the low, red frequencies of the spectrum.

The first LEDs emitted light in a very narrow band of wavelengths, of a color characteristic of the energy [[band gap]] of the [[semiconductor]] material used to make the LED.  LEDs that emit white light are made using two principal methods: either mixing light from multiple LEDs of various colors, or using a [[phosphor]] to convert some of the light to other colors. The light is not the same as a true black body, giving a different appearance to colors than an incandescent bulb. Color rendering quality is specified by the CRI, and {{As of|2019|lc=y}} is about 80 for many LED bulbs, and over 95 for more expensive [[high-CRI LED lighting]] (100 is the ideal value).\n\n[[RGB color model|RGB]] or [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]] white LEDs use multiple LED chips emitting red, green, and blue wavelengths. These three colors combine to produce white light. The [[color rendering index]] (CRI) is poor, typically 25 \u2013 65, due to the narrow range of wavelengths emitted.<ref name=ledcri>{{cite journal|bibcode=2002SPIE.4776...61N|title=Color rendering properties of LED light sources|journal=Proceedings of the SPIE|volume=4776|page=61|last1=Narendran|first1=Nadarajah|last2=Deng|first2=Lei|year=2002|doi=10.1117/12.452574|series=Solid State Lighting II}}</ref> Higher CRI values can be obtained using more than three LED colors to cover a greater range of wavelengths.\n\nThe second basic method uses LEDs in conjunction with a [[phosphor]] to produce [[complementary colors]] from a single LED.  Some of the light from the LED is absorbed by the molecules of the phosphor, causing them to [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]], emitting light of another color via the [[Stokes shift]].  The most common method is to combine a blue LED with a yellow phosphor, producing a narrow range of blue wavelengths and a broad band of \"yellow\" wavelengths actually covering the spectrum from green to red. The CRI value can range from less than 70 to over 90, although a wide range of commercial LEDs of this type have a color rendering index around 82.<ref name=ledcri/> Following successive increases in efficacy, which has reached 150 lm/W on a production basis as of 2017, this type has surpassed the performance of trichromatic LEDs.\n\nThe phosphors used in white light LEDs can give [[correlated color temperature]]s in the range of 2,200 K (dimmed incandescent) up to 7,000 K or more.<ref name=philips>{{cite web|title=Warm white LED light|url=https://www.philips.co.uk/c-m-li/led-lights/warm-led-light#|accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Color changing LED lighting===\nTunable lighting systems employ banks of colored LEDs that can be individually controlled, either using separate banks of each color, or multi-chip LEDs with the colors combined and controlled at the chip level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://luxreview.com/article/2016/05/two-minute-eplainer-tunable-white-leds|accessdate=4 September 2016|title=Two-minute explainer: Tunable-white LEDs}}</ref> For example, white LEDs of different color temperatures can be combined to construct an LED bulb that decreases its color temperature when dimmed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warm Glow Effect |url=https://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-li/choose-a-bulb/warm-glow-dimmable-led-lighting |website=Philips Lighting |accessdate=10 October 2018 |language=en-us}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfbu5zjQYdg teardown]</ref>\n\n===LED drivers===\n{{main|LED driver}}\nLED chips require controlled [[direct current]] (DC) electrical power and an appropriate circuit as an [[LED circuit|LED driver]] is required to convert the [[alternating current]] from the power supply to the regulated voltage direct current used by the LEDs.\n\nLED drivers are the essential components of LED lamps or luminaries. A good LED driver can guarantee a long life for an LED system and provide additional features such as dimming and control. The LED drivers can be put inside the lamp or luminaire, which is called a built-in type (or integral), or be put outside, which is called an independent type (or remote). According to different applications, different types of LED drivers need to be applied; for example, an outdoor driver for street light, an indoor point driver for a down light, and an indoor linear driver for a panel light.\n\nResearch studies such as <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ciugudeanu|first=Calin|last2=Buzdugan|first2=Mircea|last3=Beu|first3=Dorin|last4=Campianu|first4=Angel|last5=Galatanu|first5=Catalin Daniel|date=January 2019|title=Sustainable Lighting-Retrofit Versus Dedicated Luminaires-Light Versus Power Quality|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=11|issue=24|pages=7125|doi=10.3390/su11247125|doi-access=free}}</ref> analyse the power quality indicators correlated with the provided lighting outputs, under different voltage values and wave-forms.

[[Thermal management of high-power LEDs]] is required to keep the [[junction temperature]] close to ambient temperature. LED lamps typically include [[thermal management of high-power LEDs|heat dissipation]] elements such as [[heat sink]]s and [[fin (extended surface)|cooling fins]] and very high power lamps for industrial uses are frequently equipped with [[cooling fan]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/led-insights/4422914/Cooling-high-power-LEDs--The-four-myths-about-active-vs--passive-methods |title=Cooling high-power LEDs: The four myths about active vs. passive methods |website=EDN Network|date=17 October 2013|author=Ed Rodriguez|accessdate= 19 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Efficiency droop===\nThe term \"efficiency droop\" refers to the decrease in [[luminous efficacy]] of LEDs as the [[electric current]] increases above tens of [[Ampere|milliamps (mA)]]. Instead of increasing current levels, luminance is usually increased by combining multiple LEDs in one lamp. Solving the problem of efficiency droop would mean that household LED lamps would require fewer LEDs, which would significantly reduce costs.\n\nIn addition to being less efficient, operating LEDs at higher electric currents produces high temperatures which compromise the lifetime of the LED. Because of this increased heating at higher currents, [[light-emitting diode#High-power|high-brightness LEDs]] have an industry standard of operating at only 350&nbsp;mA, giving a good compromise between light output, efficiency, and longevity.<ref>[http://www.energy-daily.com/reports/The_LED_Dark_Secret_999.html The LED's dark secret].

Most older light fixtures are designed for the size and shape of these traditional bulbs. In the U.S. the regular sockets are E26 and E11, and E27 and E14 in some European countries.\n* [[Halogen lamps]] (also known as \"quartz-halogen\") are just incandescent lamps that run at a higher temperature than standard incandescents. They are slightly more efficient.\n* [[Fluorescent lamp]]s work by passing electricity through mercury vapor, which in turn emits ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet light is then absorbed by a phosphor coating inside the lamp, causing it to glow, or fluoresce. Conventional linear fluorescent lamps have life spans around 20,000 and 30,000 hours based on 3 hours per cycle according to lamps NLPIP reviewed in 2006. Induction fluorescent relies on electromagnetism rather than the cathodes used to start conventional linear fluorescent. The newer rare earth triphosphor blend linear fluorescent lamps made by Osram, Philips, Crompton and others have a life expectancy greater than 40,000 hours, if coupled with a warm-start electronic ballast. The life expectancy depends on the number of on/off cycles, and is lower if the light is cycled often. The ballast-lamp combined system efficacy for then current linear fluorescent systems in 1998 as tested by NLPIP ranged from 80 to 90 lm/W.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/pdf/VIEW/Guide3.pdf|title=Guide to Selecting Frequently Switched T8 Fluorescent Lamp-Ballast Systems|publisher=[[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]] National Lighting Product Information Program|date=April 1998|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s' specified lifespan typically ranges from 6,000 hours to 15,000 hours.<ref name=\"Raatma\"/>\n* Electricity prices vary in different areas of the world, and are customer dependent.

He became a lieutenant and was given command of the [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] ''Snelheid''. This was a small ship, with [[copper sheathing]], 12 guns and a crew of 60 men. The ''Snelheid'' was indeed a fast ship, and Hinxt often organized matches for speed with other ships.<ref name=\"Thea Roodhuyzen 2003\">Thea Roodhuyzen, ''De Amdiraliteit van Friesland'' (Franeker: Van Wijnen, 2003), 39.</ref> In the years 1783\u20131785, Hinxt sailed for the Dutch colony of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] in Latin-America. In the years 1787\u20131789, he sailed to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], where he visited the [[Aegean Islands]], among other places. On 23 December 1789, Hinxt was promoted to Captain.

Hinxt was known to be a good navigator, but he wasn't a good military man. Yet in 1794, he collided with the ship of war ''Walcheren'' (capt. Marinus J. Haringman). The side of the ''Snelheid'' became badly damaged. Captain Haringman (and other officers with him) acted arrogantly towards Hinxt and his small cutter and refused to pay the repair costs. In the end, the issue was solved when Admiral [[Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen]] got involved. Meanwhile, Hinxt was ready for a new ship. In a letter he complained because he ''was wet all the time, with wet clothes in a wet cabin'', and the decks were never dry.<ref name=\"Thea Roodhuyzen 2003\"/>\n\n===Marriages===\nHinxt married Anna Gerrits from the city of [[Leeuwarden]] in 1763. After her death he married Elisabeth Annes de Haan in 1769. She also died young, due to complications of childbirth. Hinxt married again in 1790, with Catharina Joris de Haan (Elisabeth's sister?), who was also born in Leeuwarden. The couple moved to the city of [[Harlingen, Friesland|Harlingen]].<ref name=\"kleinekerkstraat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinekerkstraat.nl/frames.php?p=bewo&s=i&id=20313|title=Harlingen, bewoners|work=kleinekerkstraat.nl|accessdate= 2014-08-24}}</ref> Hinxt had three children, but in 1797 only his daughter Anna Maria survived.<ref>Dirk Hendrik Kolff, Driftig van spraak, levendig van gang: herinneringen van marineofficier Dirk Hendrik Kolff (1761\u20131835), ed.

Old letters reveal that he did have contacts with the Patriot party. So when the patriots seized power in 1795, it was clear to Hinxt that he would join the [[Batavian Navy]].<ref>Thea Roodhuyzen, Thea Roodhuyzen, ''De Amdiraliteit van Friesland'' (Franeker: Van Wijnen, 2003), 40.</ref>\n\nIn 1796 Hinxt was given command of the ship ''Beschermer''. This was a ship of war with 56 guns, and a crew of 350 men. The ship became part of a fleet under Admiral [[Jan Willem de Winter]], which was made ready for an [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|invasion of Ireland]]. The fleet was meant to sail for [[Brest, France|Brest]] first, to combine with a French fleet. But a British blockade prevented the Dutch fleet from leaving port.<ref>J.F. Fischer Fzn.

The British flee under Admiral [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Adam Duncan]] was quickly informed of this, and on 11 October 1797 the two fleets engaged each other near the village of Camperdown. The ''Beschermer'' sailed in the tip of the line and was attacked by {{HMS|Belliqueux|1780|6}}. Hinxt was wounded early in the battle.

The Wilson Trail was developed by [[Friends of the Country Park]] and sponsored by various private organisations. The construction work of the trail began in 1994. The Wilson Trail was first opened on 21 January 1996.\n\nIn all, the Wilson Trail traverses eight of the Country Parks. On [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Tai Tam Country Park]] and its [[Tai Tam Country Park (Quarry Bay Extension)|Quarry Bay Extension]] begin the journey. Across the harbour, there is a gap where the trail runs through hills outside the parks. Then come the three parks named [[Ma On Shan (area)|Ma On Shan]], [[Lion Rock]], and [[Kam Shan]]. In the central New Territories, the Wilson Trail heads north through [[Shing Mun Country Park]] and [[Tai Mo Shan Country Park]]. Finally it climbs into the majestic [[Pat Sin Leng Country Park]]. Each of the Country Parks the Wilson Trail traverses has its individual character and appeal \u2013 offering, as one proceeds from south to north, changing settings with much of interest.<ref name=\"afcdhiking\" />\n\nThe trail is aligned north-south and runs from [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]], in the south of [[Hong Kong Island]] to [[Nam Chung]], in the northeastern [[New Territories]]. Of the four long-distance trails, the Wilson Trail is the newest. Since the trail crosses [[Victoria Harbour]], it makes use of the [[MTR]].\n\n==Stages==\nThe Wilson Trail is divided into ten stages:<ref name=\"afcdhiking\" /> and is marked by distance posts W001 \u2013 W138.  Although the other major Hong Kong trails measure distance posts every 500m, the distances between posts on the Wilson Trail range from 500m \u2013 650m.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left;font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

The stepped path ascends through low shrubs, flowering with pink melastoma in spring. On each side diagonal ridgelines cut the sky, and to the right there are mountain clefts. The scattered [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]] community spreads out below, and farther off the Stanley and [[Cape D'Aguilar|D'Aguilar]] peninsulas frame distant [[Beaufort Island (Hong Kong)|Beaufort Island]] and rugged [[Po Toi Islands|Poi Toi]].\n\nThe climb is long and occasional pauses reveal ever more dramatic vistas. On still blue days the hillsides shimmer, on grey windy days they are exhilarating. The suggestion of a summit comes into sight, but instead one reaches a knoll with a view compass. Here there are fine vistas into [[Repulse Bay]] and [[Deep Water Bay]], enclosed by the Chung Hom Kok headland. On the other side is a whaleback ridge, and beyond it steep plunging gullies. Beyond the expanse of [[Tai Tam]] Bay lie the Dragon's Back and [[Mount Collinson]].<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail01.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 1 Hong Kong Island</ref>\n\n===Stage 2===\nMaking a steady climb along a spur, the Wilson Trail begins Section 2 through the eastern ranges. Higher up, amidst low shrubland, past old wind-bent pines, the path leads towards a summit. To the left there are glimpses of Wong Nai Chung Gap and the city \u2013 to the right the beautiful Tai Tam valley spreads out.\n\nA kilometre up from Parkview the path reaches Jardine's Lookout (433 metres) \u2013 curiously exactly the same height as [[Violet Hill (Hong Kong)|Violet Hill]], now seen across the valley. The views from Jardine's Lookout are surely startling. To the left of the survey marker, one gazes down onto massed humanity in the urban districts. Yet, except perhaps on weekends, your only likely company here will be passing ants \u2013 or the kites wheeling overhead. Long descending ridges frame the city. On the other side lies raw nature: the Tai Tam valley, wooded and green, with its nestling reservoirs. Beyond there the rugged coast of Tai Tam Bay extends out, and still farther off rise some outlying islands.<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail02.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 2 Hong Kong Island</ref>\n\n===Stage 3===\n[[File:View of Tseung Kwan O and Sharp Peak, from Black Hill.jpg|thumb|248x248px|View of Tseung Kwan O and Sharp Peak from Black Hill]]\nA trifle mystified at how it crossed the harbour, the Wilson Trail makes up for any lapse as Section 3 twists energetically up [[Devil's Peak, Hong Kong|Devil's Peak]] (222 metres). It unhappily joins sections of a couple of roads: [[O King Road]] and [[Ma Yau Tong Road]].  Past the remains of an old hilltop fort, the trail has fine panoramas \u2013 out across Tathong Channel to turtle-shaped Tung Lung Chau, over the harbour to its rim of buildings and mountains, and northeastwards to Clear Water Bay Peninsula.\n\nWayside cuttings and fern banks lead us on. Then, just through a small pass, one looks back to the impressive northern face of Devil's Peak with its sheer forbidding cliffs. So begins a section of hiking trail that only Hong Kong could offer, with startling contrasts of country and city. On one hand there are dark heavy boulders, reddish earth, bracken, bamboos \u2013 and the sounds of birdsong. On the other, just a few hundred metres away, a line of tower blocks forms a barrier \u2013 and the rumble of city traffic comes up.\n\nFarther on a steep path ascends to [[Black Hill, Hong Kong|Black Hill]], past boulder outcrops veined with quartz. The flat-topped summit of [[Black Hill, Hong Kong|Black Hill]] (304 metres) presents the first all-round view of Kowloon peninsula. The hill itself \u2013 steep, rocky, scrubby \u2013 drops down to a fringe of tower blocks, farthest sentinels of urban districts that reach back and back. Incredibly densely developed, Kowloon presents an awesome concrete expanse. How good to be up in the hills!\n\nAs the Black Hill ridge winds on new vistas open up. To the north and northeast are hints of the grandeur of Clear Water Bay Peninsula and the [[Sai Kung District|Sai Kung]] region. Ranges recede into the distance. And, on clear days, the profiles of Ma On Shan and Sharp Peak rise up \u2013 the former with its hollow saddle, the latter with its twisted conical summit.<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail03.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 3 East Kowloon Hills</ref>\n\n===Stage 4===\nHillsides thick with trees line the Wilson Trail where Section 4 climbs up from [[Tseng Lan Shue]]. Utterly different to the open ridges of the previous section, here an old stone paved village path ascends into the hills. The air is moist, the ground carpeted with fallen leaves. Lichen covered trees and jumbled boulders line the trail. Farther up, deeper into the woods, the last sounds of the village fade. With no distant views to savour, close up details dominate. Bright green foliage shimmers with the wet. The only sounds are the buzz of insects, chirping birds and the drip-drip of ground water.\n\nBeneath slender bamboos one comes upon a lovely spot \u2013 where a mountain stream gurgles down. Boulders stand green with moss, ferns hang from overgrown terrace walls. The same stream that once irrigated the nearby fields now feeds nature \u2013 and aquatic life, tiny fish and crustaceans that since ages have lived here dart through the waters.\n\nSome distance on one reaches the village of Tai Lam Wu, where the long climb up to Tate's Pass begins. The route starts amidst woodland, lower and scrubbier than before. Lianas hang down, roots cross the path. Barbed pandanus fronds threaten to scar passing hikers' legs.<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail04.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 4 East Kowloon Hills</ref>\n\n===Stage 5===\nA short distance northwest of Sha Tin Pass, the Wilson Trail offers the first glimpse of the northern regions that it later crosses. Section 5 descends some gravelly hills. Here, along a bracken path, splendid vistas open up of the far northwest.\n\nPencil pines and thick stands of paperbarks, yellow-brown bark peeling, spread over the hills, while in the valley richer hues show native trees which have propagated naturally. Beard-like orange mosses and grey-green lichens edge the path. Dwarf bamboos and sedges hem in the small gully streams Swinging out along the path, an opposite ridge closes in the scene. Then, around a corner, the vistas suddenly open up. Sha Tin's tower blocks extend to the left beneath the foothills \u2013 and far off the ramparts of Pat Sin Leng rise up, 15 kilometres due north but over twice that distance as reached along the Wilson Trail.\n\nFarther on, by a distinctive pine knoll, is a fine panorama of the southern New Territories. Sha Tin is now in central view, cradled between the Tai Mo Shan and Ma On Shan massifs. All the region's main summits are in sight: the great bulk of Tai Mo Shan, the sharp profile of Needle Hill, Grassy Hill's rounded summit \u2013 and, to the right, the magnificent uplands around Ma On Shan and The Hunch Backs.<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail05.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 5 Central Kowloon Hills</ref>\n\n===Stage 6===\nArrived at the first of the three reservoirs it passes close by, the Wilson Trail ascends above Kowloon Reservoir \u2013 where Section 6 heads northwest into the central New Territories. The woodland here is lower than the forests along the previous catchment trail, yet even so the reservoir soon disappears from sight behind trees. An earthen path, initially reasonably level and then steadily ascending, winds up behind the reservoir through Kam Shan valley. Fallen leaves lie soft underfoot, the banks are hung with plants and ferns. Lianas tangle through the middle storey of this maturing forest, the end result of earlier reforestation to stabilise the reservoir's watershed slopes.\n\nOccasional panoramas open out showing the Kowloon peaks. Less often breaks in the trees reveal glimpses of the reservoir, with its ochre banks and jade green waters, typical of all the local dams. Come here in winter and the galley-prow banks will be high out of the water \u2013 but in summer, after rain, water laps right up to the trees. Hiking farther around one crosses a series of small gully streams that run into the reservoir. Sharp edged pandanus fronds, dwarf bamboos and ferns surround the small watercourses \u2013 hidden worlds where, in rock pools up and down the hillsides, crustaceans and tiny fish inhabit the often turbulent streams.\n\nThe best time to be here is the late afternoon after a fine, clear day. Then, the sun westering over Shing Mun, gaps between the trees show Kowloon Reservoir at its best. Mirror waters reach across to a turreted dam \u2013 the woodland shimmers with emerald greens \u2013 black-eared kites wheel overhead. As zephyrs fade, stillness gathers up the land.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail06.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 6 Central Kowloon Hills</ref>\n\n===Stage 7===\nNow just over halfway along the Wilson Trail's entire length, the route crosses Shing Mun dam and turns northwards \u2013 where Section 7 begins its journey along the reservoir. The valley setting is impressive and, off to the left, Tai Mo Shan's imposing slopes and summit rise up.\n\nThe trail leading around the eastern banks is one of the territory's most attractive reservoir walks. The water lies close below, the vegetation is varied \u2013 and, given the elongated inlets, the path's turns bring ever-changing vistas. At the start one is looking generally north, across the water to rising wooded slopes. The reservoir itself, edged with orange-brown banks, runs back into narrow inlets ending at stony gullies. Hiking farther on, larger inlets provide views to the south \u2013 to the main dam wall and in one place right back to Smuggler's Ridge. The hillside vegetation becomes richer towards the far end, with fern-filled depressions, canopy trees and \u2013 in one place \u2013 a curtain of overhanging bamboos. Gully streams enclose lush vegetation, with mosses and lichens.\n\nSo the reservoir leads around, with ever changing surroundings and fresh vistas. Towards the northern end its waters narrow. Here one gazes past lagoons to the western shore. Paperbark trees flourish on swampy land, helped by inundations when the reservoir over fills. In spring yellow-flowered acacias colour the hills. Beyond the narrow [[head of the reservoir]] a woodland trail wends uphill, amidst tall bamboos. At the top, a stream crosses the path \u2013 its shaded rock platform making a pleasant oasis for resting.\n\nFarther on, the woodland is at its most mature and striking. In the densely vegetated gullies, amidst lichen boulders and moss banks, huge elephant ear plants and massed ferns luxuriate.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail07.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 7 Central New Territories Ranges</ref>\n\n===Stage 8===\nDrawn downhill into suburban surroundings, the Wilson Trail perhaps wishes that it could leap across Tai Po's developed areas \u2013 and begin Section 8 with the clear enticing challenge of climbing Cloudy Hill. Some hikers may wish to do exactly that. But, described below, we follow the mapped route, though hurrying across the first part.\n\nTurning left uphill, past the Fan Sin Temple and gradually working up through villa homes, the route has earth paths, concrete steps, bitumen and later a narrow road. Initially climbing, then running along a level, it skirts the valley's middle slopes past grassy hillsides and nursery farms. After a two-kilometre excursion through here, the trail descends to Shek Kwu Lung. Then, across the river, it goes northwest for 400 metres \u2013 before taking a right turn, to head to Tai Po Tau Drive. This is the least attractive part of all the Wilson Trail, and you may prefer to go by taxi to Tai Po Tau Drive.\n\nThe trail up to Cloudy Hill is exhilarating. As it ascends, woodland quickly gives way to shrubland, blazing pink in spring with melastomas. Then, beyond the first pavilion, wide panoramas begin to appear.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail08.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 8 Central New Territories Ranges</ref>\n\n===Stage 9===\nContinuing down the northern slopes of Cloudy Hill, the Wilson Trail descends through attractive uplands. Section 9 looks across to still grander country, where the trail later winds up into the Pat Sin range and along its serrated ridgeline. Undulating heathland begins the descent. Gaps between the hills reveal the far north New Territories, with its narrow plains before the Shenzhen River. Ahead and to the right the magnificent bulk of Pat Sin Leng draws steadily closer.\n\nLower down, now close above the ox-bow waters of tiny Hok Tau Reservoir, is one of the most delightful settings in Hong Kong. Surrounded by slopes of pink flowering melastoma and other shrubs, armies of frogs croaking below, one overlooks a secluded valley. Farther off ridges recede into the background, each framing another still higher one \u2013 right back to Ma On Shan, some 12 kilometres distant.\n\nDown at Hok Tau, the path skirts the reservoir with its fringe of lush growth. Then it leads up through a pine forest, before turning straight uphill to begin the ascent to Pat Sin Leng. Up and up \u2013 a rocky trail and stone steps push to the top. Pausing for breath the views are majestic. Pat Sin Leng sweeps up, slopes rising towards a cliff edge escarpment. Down in the valley a stream meanders through woodland.\n\nHigher still the entire region reveals itself. Beyond an intervening saddle the villages of Sha Lo Tung appear, abandoned and overgrown. Across the farther ridgeline the tips of Tai Po's buildings come into view, with Ma On Shan rising across Tolo Channel. Beyond a ravine, wild and inhospitable, stand the Shenzhen skyscrapers \u2013 supremely surreal seen from here.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail09.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 9 Northeast New Territories Ranges</ref>\n\n===Stage 10===\nThe eastern extremity of [[Pat Sin Leng]] marks the final turning along the Wilson Trail \u2013 where Section 10 swings northwest and descends to [[Nam Chung]]. Now over 70&nbsp;km along the trail from its start at [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]], though only 30&nbsp;km due north of there, this is the Wilson Trail's culminating section.\n\nThe summit at [[Hsien Ku Fung]], on three sides surrounded by sheer slopes, offers a bird's eye panorama of the far northeast \u2013 a barely inhabited region of striking beauty. Immediately to the east [[Plover Cove Reservoir]] spreads out, its 6&nbsp;km expanse of water reaching back to rugged hills. Northeast is the tangled country that encloses Double Haven, with its islets and islands. Northwest, where the trail leads, hills descend to Nam Chung.\n\nDown from the summit, panoramas extend across wooded hills to [[Wu Kau Tang]] \u2013 and over [[Starling Inlet]] to [[Sha Tau Kok]]. The trail continues on amidst shrubland and, farther down, enters low woodlands. After the windswept heights of [[Pat Sin Leng]] it seems lush.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail10.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 10 Northeast New Territories Ranges</ref>\n\n==Wild monkeys==\nThere are significant numbers of monkeys along the trail in Stages 6, 7, and 8.  They tend to be aggressive with regard to food.  Do not carry loose shopping bags, etc., as they may be bold enough to attempt to grab them from you.  Also, try to pack your garbage out of the parks: much of the garbage strewn around the picnic areas is the result of monkeys raiding rubbish bins.  Visitors are reminded not to feed these wild animals as uncontrolled feeding has led to unnatural growth of the monkey population and caused nuisances. A feeding ban has been implemented and enforced in the area since July 1999 to help the monkeys revert to forage natural food in the natural environment.\n\nThese monkeys are mostly [[rhesus macaque]]s (''Macaca mulatta''), although there also exist [[crab-eating macaque|long-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis'') and rhesus/long-tailed hybrids.<ref name=\"afcd.gov.hk\">http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/conservation/con_fau/con_fau_mon/con_fau_mon_wild/con_fau_mon_wild_abt.html</ref>\n  \nThe original wild stock of [[rhesus macaque]]s is believed to have become extirpated. The existing wild monkey populations are considered as the descendants of the individuals which have been introduced to the Kowloon Hills, i.e. [[Kam Shan Country Park|Kam Shan]] and Lion Rock Country Parks in the 1910s. It is believed that the [[rhesus macaque]]s have been re-introduced to Hong Kong to control the spread of a local poisonous plant, the [[strychnos]]. Because [[strychnos]]' fruit is toxic to humans, there was concern that they may contaminate the reservoir water.  But [[strychnos]] is not poisonous to monkeys; on the contrary, it is one of their favourite foods.  [[Crab-eating macaque|Long-tailed macaque]]s were introduced to the parks in the 1950s.<ref name=\"afcd.gov.hk\"/>\n\n==Access points and facilities==\nAll up-to-date bus route and schedule information can be found via the Hong Kong [http://www.td.gov.hk/en/transport_in_hong_kong/public_transport/index.html Transport Department] website.\n\n===Start===\nStage 1 begins on Stanley Gap Road.   The 6, 6A, or the 260 buses from [[Stanley Market]] or Central, or the 73 bus from Stanley or [[Cyberport]], stops on request at the trailhead.  Buses are frequent in both directions.  There are no facilities here.\n\nThere is no pedestrian access to the trail head from [[Stanley Market]]: the sidewalk ends around 200m after the bus stop and walking along the narrow, winding road in traffic is not recommended.  Additionally, the promising footpath opposite the trailhead is a dead end, stopping at a locked gate after 100m-200m.\n\n===Between stages 1 and 2===\nStage 1 ends/Stage 2 begins 100m from [[Hong Kong Parkview]], where there is a [[ParknShop]] supermarket, bathroom facilities, taxi stand, and a shuttle bus (HK$20) to [[Wanchai]] and Central. Tickets for the bus can be purchased at the concierge desk inside the club, opposite the bus stop.  Various public buses stop at the base of Tai Tam Reservoir Road on Wong Nai Chung Gap Road, 600m down the hill from the trail entrance.\n\n===Between stages 2 and 3===\nStage 2 ends at [[Tai Koo Station]] [[MTR]].  There are a wide range of restaurants and convenience stores.  There are bathroom facilities at Kornhill Plaza above the station.  Stage 3 begins at [[Lam Tin Station]] [[MTR]] with a range of facilities.\n\n===Between stages 3 and 4===\nStage 3 ends/Stage 4 begins at [[Clear Water Bay Road]].  There are a couple of small family-run convenience stores on the Stage 4 (north) side of the road.  There are also several minibus stops to the west of the trail, including the 1A minibus that links to [[Choi Hung Station]] [[MTR]] stop.\n\n===Between stages 4 and 5===\nStage 4 ends/Stage 5 begins at Shap Yi Wat Village.  There may be a small shop available seasonally here.  Shap Yi Wat Village is accessible by taxi (15 minutes from [[Wong Tai Sin]] [[MTR]]), but don't expect to find a taxi in the \"village\".  The Sha Tin Pass Estate housing development is a 1.5K walk down Sha Tin Pass Road from the village and is serviced by the 18/18M [[green minibus]].  The 18/18M shuttles between Sha Tin Pass Estate and [[Wong Tai Sin Station]] [[MTR]].\n\n===Between stages 5 and 6===\nStage 5 ends/Stage 6 begins at [[Tai Po Road]] (Sha Tin Heights section) across from [[Kowloon Group of Reservoirs#Kowloon Reservoir|Kowloon Reservoir]]. There do not appear to be any usable facilities here, although the map indicate a public restroom 200m east along the road.   The KMB buses 72 and 81 are available for easy access to various stations.  The 81 toward [[Jordan, Hong Kong|Jordan (\u4f50\u6566)]] stops at [[Mong Kok Station]] [[MTR]].\n\n===Between stages 6 and 7===\nStage 6 ends/Stage 7 begins at [[Shing Mun Reservoir]] (also known as the Jubilee Reservoir).   There is no public transport access here, although a taxi can get within 50m.  Don't expect to find a taxi waiting.  Otherwise, it is a 1.6K walk to the 82 [[green minibus]] terminus on Shun Min Road.  This bus will take you to [[Tsuen Wan Station]].  There is also a visitors center 50m from the bus terminus, but there are no facilities here.\n\n===Between stages 7 and 8===\nThe 23S/23K [[green minibus]] travels between the residential village of San Uk Ka and [[Tai Po Market Station]] [[MTR]].  The stop is on the trail, 100m into Stage 8. The buses are frequent (at least every 15 minutes) and take around 10 minutes.  Alternatively, the station is a 2K walk.   There are two restaurants and a small grocery store opposite the drainage canal 100m past the trail turn at distance post 090.\n\n===Within Stage 8===\nBetween distance post 97 and 98, the trail passes within 200m of a shopping center that connects to [[Tai Wo Station]] [[MTR]].  Follow the [[MTR]] sign posted on the trail on the north side of the drainage canal.  There is a [[7-Eleven]] and several restaurants at the shopping centre.  This is the last place to resupply or access clean restrooms anywhere directly alongside the trail until the terminus (Stage 10) at Nam Chung.\n\n===Between stages 8 and 9===\nThe transition from Stage 8 to Stage 9 is between distance post 105 and 106, near the peak of [[Cloudy Hill]].  Between distance post 107 and 108, there is a side trail/road that leads 2.8K to the small residential village of Kau Lung Hang, the terminus of the 25B [[green minibus]].   The road is steep, traversing more than 300m of vertical, so budget time accordingly. The 25B shuttles between Kau Lung Hang and [[Tai Wo Station]] [[MTR]].  There are no services at Kau Lung Hang.\n\nAlternatively, one can enter/exit the trail at [[Hok Tau Reservoir]].  The 52B [[green minibus]] travels between [[Fanling Station]] [[MTR]] and Hok Tau Road.  The bus terminus is around a 2K walk along Hok Tau Road and intersects the trail at the reservoir close to distance post 112.   The last bus scheduled from [[Hok Tau Road]] departs around 8:30 pm.\n\n===Between stages 9 and 10===\nThere is no convenient access.  There is a steep trail from the Stage 9/10 switchover point atop Hsien Ku Fung down to Pat Sing Leng Nature Trail.  The Pat Sin Leng Nature Trail starts at the Plover Cove Country Park Visitors Centre to the 20C [[green minibus]] stop.  Total distance from the switchover to the bus stop is 1.1K.  The 20C connects to [[Tai Po Market Station]] [[MTR]].\n\n===Trail terminus===\nThe trail terminus is at Nam Chung, on a side road around 1.5K from the main road.  Confusingly, both the side road at the trail head and the main road are called \"Luk Keng Road\".   The bus stop for the 56K [[green minibus]] shuttles between Luk Keng Village and [[Fanling Station]] [[MTR]] and will stop, on request, at the intersection of the main road and the side road.    Those beginning the trail here can ask the bus driver to drop them at Nam Chung.  For those returning from the trail, be warned that the last bus departs around 7:30 pm.  Also, mobile phones are unlikely to work here (one is more likely to get a roaming signal from the mainland than a Hong Kong signal).  An alternative return route is to walk 1&nbsp;km east along the road toward Luk Keng Village\u2014to the minibus terminus\u2014and either take the bus, or if it is after 7:30 pm, ask someone at the small restaurant/convenience area to call a taxi for you.\n\nThere are bathroom facilities located around 500m from the trail terminus along the side road as well as at the intersection of the side road and the main road.\n\n==Raleigh Challenge==\n[[Raleigh International]]'s \"Raleigh Challenge \u2013 Wilson Trail\" is the first hiking competition which covered the longest distance of the Wilson Trail, spanning across the Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories from south to north.<ref>[http://www.raleigh.org.hk/wilsontrail/ Raleigh Challenge: Wilson Trail]</ref> To avoid crowds at the trailhead on Stanley Gap Road, the Challenge bypasses the first 2K of Stage 1 (\"The Twins\") and instead takes a side trail to the lower part of Tai Tam Reservoir Road, passing Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir and Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir, and heads to Tai Tam Road.\n\n==Other long-distance trails of Hong Kong==\nThe Wilson Trail is the most recent of the four long-distance trails of Hong Kong.  The others are:\n*[[Hong Kong Trail]]: across [[Hong Kong Island]] ({{convert|50|km}})\n*[[Lantau Trail]]: on [[Lantau Island]] ({{convert|70|km}})\n*[[MacLehose Trail]]: from [[Sai Kung Peninsula|Sai Kung]] to [[Tuen Mun]] ({{convert|100|km}})\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hong Kong Country Parks & Special Areas]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Wilson Trail}}\n*[http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cou/cou_vis_cou_ttqbe/cou_vis_cou_ttqbe.html Tai Tam Country Park by Hong Kong Government]\n*[http://www.raleigh.org.hk/wilsontrail Raleigh Challenge-Wilson Trail]\n{{coord|22.250062|N|114.198498|E|source:zhwiki_region:CN|format=dms|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Hiking trails in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Tai Tam]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Chinese\n|pic=Wilson Trail Stage One 1.jpg\n|caption=Wilson Trail memorial monument along stage 1 on [[Stanley Gap Road]].\n|t=\u885b\u5955\u4fe1\u5f91\n|s=\u536b\u5955\u4fe1\u5f84\n|j=wai6 jik6 seon3 ging3\n|p=W\u00e8iy\u00ecx\u00ecn J\u00ecng\n}}\n[[Image:Wilson Trail stage 3.JPG|right|250px|thumb|A Wilson Trail road sign near [[O King Road]] on stage 3 of the trail.]]\n[[Image:Wilson Trail rs.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A road sign showing \"Wilson Trail\" along stage 3 of the trail on [[Lei Yue Mun Road]].]]\n[[File:Monkey Family on a Wilson Trail Monument.JPG|thumb|Wilson Trail, Section 7, [[rhesus macaque]]s atop a Wilson Trail memorial monument]]\n[[Image:Wilson Trail Stage Ten 1.jpg|right|250px|thumb|\"Wilson Trail\" memorial monument located at [[Nam Chung]] in stage 10 of the trail.]]\n\nThe '''Wilson Trail''' ({{zh|t=\u885b\u5955\u4fe1\u5f91}}) is a {{convert|78|km|mi|adj=on}} [[List of long-distance footpaths|long-distance footpath]] in Hong Kong, 63&nbsp;km of which runs through Hong Kong country parks.<ref name=\"afcdhiking\">[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Country and Marine Parks Authority Agriculture</ref> It was named after [[David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn]], who was [[Governor of Hong Kong]] from 1987 to 1992. The Wilson Trail was developed by [[Friends of the Country Park]] and sponsored by various private organisations. The construction work of the trail began in 1994. The Wilson Trail was first opened on 21 January 1996.\n\nIn all, the Wilson Trail traverses eight of the Country Parks. On [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Tai Tam Country Park]] and its [[Tai Tam Country Park (Quarry Bay Extension)|Quarry Bay Extension]] begin the journey. Across the harbour, there is a gap where the trail runs through hills outside the parks. Then come the three parks named [[Ma On Shan (area)|Ma On Shan]], [[Lion Rock]], and [[Kam Shan]]. In the central New Territories, the Wilson Trail heads north through [[Shing Mun Country Park]] and [[Tai Mo Shan Country Park]]. Finally it climbs into the majestic [[Pat Sin Leng Country Park]]. Each of the Country Parks the Wilson Trail traverses has its individual character and appeal \u2013 offering, as one proceeds from south to north, changing settings with much of interest.<ref name=\"afcdhiking\" />\n\nThe trail is aligned north-south and runs from [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]], in the south of [[Hong Kong Island]] to [[Nam Chung]], in the northeastern [[New Territories]]. Of the four long-distance trails, the Wilson Trail is the newest. Since the trail crosses [[Victoria Harbour]], it makes use of the [[MTR]].\n\n==Stages==\nThe Wilson Trail is divided into ten stages:<ref name=\"afcdhiking\" /> and is marked by distance posts W001 \u2013 W138.  Although the other major Hong Kong trails measure distance posts every 500m, the distances between posts on the Wilson Trail range from 500m \u2013 650m.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left;font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

The stepped path ascends through low shrubs, flowering with pink melastoma in spring. On each side diagonal ridgelines cut the sky, and to the right there are mountain clefts. The scattered [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]] community spreads out below, and farther off the Stanley and [[Cape D'Aguilar|D'Aguilar]] peninsulas frame distant [[Beaufort Island (Hong Kong)|Beaufort Island]] and rugged [[Po Toi Islands|Poi Toi]].\n\nThe climb is long and occasional pauses reveal ever more dramatic vistas. On still blue days the hillsides shimmer, on grey windy days they are exhilarating. The suggestion of a summit comes into sight, but instead one reaches a knoll with a view compass. Here there are fine vistas into [[Repulse Bay]] and [[Deep Water Bay]], enclosed by the Chung Hom Kok headland. On the other side is a whaleback ridge, and beyond it steep plunging gullies. Beyond the expanse of [[Tai Tam]] Bay lie the Dragon's Back and [[Mount Collinson]].<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail01.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 1 Hong Kong Island</ref>\n\n===Stage 2===\nMaking a steady climb along a spur, the Wilson Trail begins Section 2 through the eastern ranges. Higher up, amidst low shrubland, past old wind-bent pines, the path leads towards a summit. To the left there are glimpses of Wong Nai Chung Gap and the city \u2013 to the right the beautiful Tai Tam valley spreads out.\n\nA kilometre up from Parkview the path reaches Jardine's Lookout (433 metres) \u2013 curiously exactly the same height as [[Violet Hill (Hong Kong)|Violet Hill]], now seen across the valley. The views from Jardine's Lookout are surely startling. To the left of the survey marker, one gazes down onto massed humanity in the urban districts. Yet, except perhaps on weekends, your only likely company here will be passing ants \u2013 or the kites wheeling overhead. Long descending ridges frame the city. On the other side lies raw nature: the Tai Tam valley, wooded and green, with its nestling reservoirs. Beyond there the rugged coast of Tai Tam Bay extends out, and still farther off rise some outlying islands.<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail02.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 2 Hong Kong Island</ref>\n\n===Stage 3===\n[[File:View of Tseung Kwan O and Sharp Peak, from Black Hill.jpg|thumb|248x248px|View of Tseung Kwan O and Sharp Peak from Black Hill]]\nA trifle mystified at how it crossed the harbour, the Wilson Trail makes up for any lapse as Section 3 twists energetically up [[Devil's Peak, Hong Kong|Devil's Peak]] (222 metres). It unhappily joins sections of a couple of roads: [[O King Road]] and [[Ma Yau Tong Road]].  Past the remains of an old hilltop fort, the trail has fine panoramas \u2013 out across Tathong Channel to turtle-shaped Tung Lung Chau, over the harbour to its rim of buildings and mountains, and northeastwards to Clear Water Bay Peninsula.\n\nWayside cuttings and fern banks lead us on. Then, just through a small pass, one looks back to the impressive northern face of Devil's Peak with its sheer forbidding cliffs. So begins a section of hiking trail that only Hong Kong could offer, with startling contrasts of country and city. On one hand there are dark heavy boulders, reddish earth, bracken, bamboos \u2013 and the sounds of birdsong. On the other, just a few hundred metres away, a line of tower blocks forms a barrier \u2013 and the rumble of city traffic comes up.\n\nFarther on a steep path ascends to [[Black Hill, Hong Kong|Black Hill]], past boulder outcrops veined with quartz. The flat-topped summit of [[Black Hill, Hong Kong|Black Hill]] (304 metres) presents the first all-round view of Kowloon peninsula. The hill itself \u2013 steep, rocky, scrubby \u2013 drops down to a fringe of tower blocks, farthest sentinels of urban districts that reach back and back. Incredibly densely developed, Kowloon presents an awesome concrete expanse. How good to be up in the hills!\n\nAs the Black Hill ridge winds on new vistas open up. To the north and northeast are hints of the grandeur of Clear Water Bay Peninsula and the [[Sai Kung District|Sai Kung]] region. Ranges recede into the distance. And, on clear days, the profiles of Ma On Shan and Sharp Peak rise up \u2013 the former with its hollow saddle, the latter with its twisted conical summit.<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail03.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 3 East Kowloon Hills</ref>\n\n===Stage 4===\nHillsides thick with trees line the Wilson Trail where Section 4 climbs up from [[Tseng Lan Shue]]. Utterly different to the open ridges of the previous section, here an old stone paved village path ascends into the hills. The air is moist, the ground carpeted with fallen leaves. Lichen covered trees and jumbled boulders line the trail. Farther up, deeper into the woods, the last sounds of the village fade. With no distant views to savour, close up details dominate. Bright green foliage shimmers with the wet. The only sounds are the buzz of insects, chirping birds and the drip-drip of ground water.\n\nBeneath slender bamboos one comes upon a lovely spot \u2013 where a mountain stream gurgles down. Boulders stand green with moss, ferns hang from overgrown terrace walls. The same stream that once irrigated the nearby fields now feeds nature \u2013 and aquatic life, tiny fish and crustaceans that since ages have lived here dart through the waters.\n\nSome distance on one reaches the village of Tai Lam Wu, where the long climb up to Tate's Pass begins. The route starts amidst woodland, lower and scrubbier than before. Lianas hang down, roots cross the path. Barbed pandanus fronds threaten to scar passing hikers' legs.<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail04.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 4 East Kowloon Hills</ref>\n\n===Stage 5===\nA short distance northwest of Sha Tin Pass, the Wilson Trail offers the first glimpse of the northern regions that it later crosses. Section 5 descends some gravelly hills. Here, along a bracken path, splendid vistas open up of the far northwest.\n\nPencil pines and thick stands of paperbarks, yellow-brown bark peeling, spread over the hills, while in the valley richer hues show native trees which have propagated naturally. Beard-like orange mosses and grey-green lichens edge the path. Dwarf bamboos and sedges hem in the small gully streams Swinging out along the path, an opposite ridge closes in the scene. Then, around a corner, the vistas suddenly open up. Sha Tin's tower blocks extend to the left beneath the foothills \u2013 and far off the ramparts of Pat Sin Leng rise up, 15 kilometres due north but over twice that distance as reached along the Wilson Trail.\n\nFarther on, by a distinctive pine knoll, is a fine panorama of the southern New Territories. Sha Tin is now in central view, cradled between the Tai Mo Shan and Ma On Shan massifs. All the region's main summits are in sight: the great bulk of Tai Mo Shan, the sharp profile of Needle Hill, Grassy Hill's rounded summit \u2013 and, to the right, the magnificent uplands around Ma On Shan and The Hunch Backs.<ref>[http://hiking.gov.hk/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail05.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 5 Central Kowloon Hills</ref>\n\n===Stage 6===\nArrived at the first of the three reservoirs it passes close by, the Wilson Trail ascends above Kowloon Reservoir \u2013 where Section 6 heads northwest into the central New Territories. The woodland here is lower than the forests along the previous catchment trail, yet even so the reservoir soon disappears from sight behind trees. An earthen path, initially reasonably level and then steadily ascending, winds up behind the reservoir through Kam Shan valley. Fallen leaves lie soft underfoot, the banks are hung with plants and ferns. Lianas tangle through the middle storey of this maturing forest, the end result of earlier reforestation to stabilise the reservoir's watershed slopes.\n\nOccasional panoramas open out showing the Kowloon peaks. Less often breaks in the trees reveal glimpses of the reservoir, with its ochre banks and jade green waters, typical of all the local dams. Come here in winter and the galley-prow banks will be high out of the water \u2013 but in summer, after rain, water laps right up to the trees. Hiking farther around one crosses a series of small gully streams that run into the reservoir. Sharp edged pandanus fronds, dwarf bamboos and ferns surround the small watercourses \u2013 hidden worlds where, in rock pools up and down the hillsides, crustaceans and tiny fish inhabit the often turbulent streams.\n\nThe best time to be here is the late afternoon after a fine, clear day. Then, the sun westering over Shing Mun, gaps between the trees show Kowloon Reservoir at its best. Mirror waters reach across to a turreted dam \u2013 the woodland shimmers with emerald greens \u2013 black-eared kites wheel overhead. As zephyrs fade, stillness gathers up the land.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail06.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 6 Central Kowloon Hills</ref>\n\n===Stage 7===\nNow just over halfway along the Wilson Trail's entire length, the route crosses Shing Mun dam and turns northwards \u2013 where Section 7 begins its journey along the reservoir. The valley setting is impressive and, off to the left, Tai Mo Shan's imposing slopes and summit rise up.\n\nThe trail leading around the eastern banks is one of the territory's most attractive reservoir walks. The water lies close below, the vegetation is varied \u2013 and, given the elongated inlets, the path's turns bring ever-changing vistas. At the start one is looking generally north, across the water to rising wooded slopes. The reservoir itself, edged with orange-brown banks, runs back into narrow inlets ending at stony gullies. Hiking farther on, larger inlets provide views to the south \u2013 to the main dam wall and in one place right back to Smuggler's Ridge. The hillside vegetation becomes richer towards the far end, with fern-filled depressions, canopy trees and \u2013 in one place \u2013 a curtain of overhanging bamboos. Gully streams enclose lush vegetation, with mosses and lichens.\n\nSo the reservoir leads around, with ever changing surroundings and fresh vistas. Towards the northern end its waters narrow. Here one gazes past lagoons to the western shore. Paperbark trees flourish on swampy land, helped by inundations when the reservoir over fills. In spring yellow-flowered acacias colour the hills. Beyond the narrow [[head of the reservoir]] a woodland trail wends uphill, amidst tall bamboos. At the top, a stream crosses the path \u2013 its shaded rock platform making a pleasant oasis for resting.\n\nFarther on, the woodland is at its most mature and striking. In the densely vegetated gullies, amidst lichen boulders and moss banks, huge elephant ear plants and massed ferns luxuriate.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail07.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 7 Central New Territories Ranges</ref>\n\n===Stage 8===\nDrawn downhill into suburban surroundings, the Wilson Trail perhaps wishes that it could leap across Tai Po's developed areas \u2013 and begin Section 8 with the clear enticing challenge of climbing Cloudy Hill. Some hikers may wish to do exactly that. But, described below, we follow the mapped route, though hurrying across the first part.\n\nTurning left uphill, past the Fan Sin Temple and gradually working up through villa homes, the route has earth paths, concrete steps, bitumen and later a narrow road. Initially climbing, then running along a level, it skirts the valley's middle slopes past grassy hillsides and nursery farms. After a two-kilometre excursion through here, the trail descends to Shek Kwu Lung. Then, across the river, it goes northwest for 400 metres \u2013 before taking a right turn, to head to Tai Po Tau Drive. This is the least attractive part of all the Wilson Trail, and you may prefer to go by taxi to Tai Po Tau Drive.\n\nThe trail up to Cloudy Hill is exhilarating. As it ascends, woodland quickly gives way to shrubland, blazing pink in spring with melastomas. Then, beyond the first pavilion, wide panoramas begin to appear.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail08.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 8 Central New Territories Ranges</ref>\n\n===Stage 9===\nContinuing down the northern slopes of Cloudy Hill, the Wilson Trail descends through attractive uplands. Section 9 looks across to still grander country, where the trail later winds up into the Pat Sin range and along its serrated ridgeline. Undulating heathland begins the descent. Gaps between the hills reveal the far north New Territories, with its narrow plains before the Shenzhen River. Ahead and to the right the magnificent bulk of Pat Sin Leng draws steadily closer.\n\nLower down, now close above the ox-bow waters of tiny Hok Tau Reservoir, is one of the most delightful settings in Hong Kong. Surrounded by slopes of pink flowering melastoma and other shrubs, armies of frogs croaking below, one overlooks a secluded valley. Farther off ridges recede into the background, each framing another still higher one \u2013 right back to Ma On Shan, some 12 kilometres distant.\n\nDown at Hok Tau, the path skirts the reservoir with its fringe of lush growth. Then it leads up through a pine forest, before turning straight uphill to begin the ascent to Pat Sin Leng. Up and up \u2013 a rocky trail and stone steps push to the top. Pausing for breath the views are majestic. Pat Sin Leng sweeps up, slopes rising towards a cliff edge escarpment. Down in the valley a stream meanders through woodland.\n\nHigher still the entire region reveals itself. Beyond an intervening saddle the villages of Sha Lo Tung appear, abandoned and overgrown. Across the farther ridgeline the tips of Tai Po's buildings come into view, with Ma On Shan rising across Tolo Channel. Beyond a ravine, wild and inhospitable, stand the Shenzhen skyscrapers \u2013 supremely surreal seen from here.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail09.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 9 Northeast New Territories Ranges</ref>\n\n===Stage 10===\nThe eastern extremity of [[Pat Sin Leng]] marks the final turning along the Wilson Trail \u2013 where Section 10 swings northwest and descends to [[Nam Chung]]. Now over 70&nbsp;km along the trail from its start at [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]], though only 30&nbsp;km due north of there, this is the Wilson Trail's culminating section.\n\nThe summit at [[Hsien Ku Fung]], on three sides surrounded by sheer slopes, offers a bird's eye panorama of the far northeast \u2013 a barely inhabited region of striking beauty. Immediately to the east [[Plover Cove Reservoir]] spreads out, its 6&nbsp;km expanse of water reaching back to rugged hills. Northeast is the tangled country that encloses Double Haven, with its islets and islands. Northwest, where the trail leads, hills descend to Nam Chung.\n\nDown from the summit, panoramas extend across wooded hills to [[Wu Kau Tang]] \u2013 and over [[Starling Inlet]] to [[Sha Tau Kok]]. The trail continues on amidst shrubland and, farther down, enters low woodlands. After the windswept heights of [[Pat Sin Leng]] it seems lush.<ref>[http://www.hkwalkers.net/eng/longtrail/wtrail/wtrail/wtrail10.htm Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department \u2013 Wilson Trail] Stage 10 Northeast New Territories Ranges</ref>\n\n==Wild monkeys==\nThere are significant numbers of monkeys along the trail in Stages 6, 7, and 8.  They tend to be aggressive with regard to food.  Do not carry loose shopping bags, etc., as they may be bold enough to attempt to grab them from you.  Also, try to pack your garbage out of the parks: much of the garbage strewn around the picnic areas is the result of monkeys raiding rubbish bins.  Visitors are reminded not to feed these wild animals as uncontrolled feeding has led to unnatural growth of the monkey population and caused nuisances. A feeding ban has been implemented and enforced in the area since July 1999 to help the monkeys revert to forage natural food in the natural environment.\n\nThese monkeys are mostly [[rhesus macaque]]s (''Macaca mulatta''), although there also exist [[crab-eating macaque|long-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis'') and rhesus/long-tailed hybrids.<ref name=\"afcd.gov.hk\">http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/conservation/con_fau/con_fau_mon/con_fau_mon_wild/con_fau_mon_wild_abt.html</ref>\n  \nThe original wild stock of [[rhesus macaque]]s is believed to have become extirpated. The existing wild monkey populations are considered as the descendants of the individuals which have been introduced to the Kowloon Hills, i.e. [[Kam Shan Country Park|Kam Shan]] and Lion Rock Country Parks in the 1910s. It is believed that the [[rhesus macaque]]s have been re-introduced to Hong Kong to control the spread of a local poisonous plant, the [[strychnos]]. Because [[strychnos]]' fruit is toxic to humans, there was concern that they may contaminate the reservoir water.  But [[strychnos]] is not poisonous to monkeys; on the contrary, it is one of their favourite foods.  [[Crab-eating macaque|Long-tailed macaque]]s were introduced to the parks in the 1950s.<ref name=\"afcd.gov.hk\"/>\n\n==Access points and facilities==\nAll up-to-date bus route and schedule information can be found via the Hong Kong [http://www.td.gov.hk/en/transport_in_hong_kong/public_transport/index.html Transport Department] website.\n\n===Start===\nStage 1 begins on Stanley Gap Road.   The 6, 6A, or the 260 buses from [[Stanley Market]] or Central, or the 73 bus from Stanley or [[Cyberport]], stops on request at the trailhead.  Buses are frequent in both directions.  There are no facilities here.\n\nThere is no pedestrian access to the trail head from [[Stanley Market]]: the sidewalk ends around 200m after the bus stop and walking along the narrow, winding road in traffic is not recommended.  Additionally, the promising footpath opposite the trailhead is a dead end, stopping at a locked gate after 100m-200m.\n\n===Between stages 1 and 2===\nStage 1 ends/Stage 2 begins 100m from [[Hong Kong Parkview]], where there is a [[ParknShop]] supermarket, bathroom facilities, taxi stand, and a shuttle bus (HK$20) to [[Wanchai]] and Central. Tickets for the bus can be purchased at the concierge desk inside the club, opposite the bus stop.  Various public buses stop at the base of Tai Tam Reservoir Road on Wong Nai Chung Gap Road, 600m down the hill from the trail entrance.\n\n===Between stages 2 and 3===\nStage 2 ends at [[Tai Koo Station]] [[MTR]].  There are a wide range of restaurants and convenience stores.  There are bathroom facilities at Kornhill Plaza above the station.  Stage 3 begins at [[Lam Tin Station]] [[MTR]] with a range of facilities.\n\n===Between stages 3 and 4===\nStage 3 ends/Stage 4 begins at [[Clear Water Bay Road]].  There are a couple of small family-run convenience stores on the Stage 4 (north) side of the road.  There are also several minibus stops to the west of the trail, including the 1A minibus that links to [[Choi Hung Station]] [[MTR]] stop.\n\n===Between stages 4 and 5===\nStage 4 ends/Stage 5 begins at Shap Yi Wat Village.  There may be a small shop available seasonally here.  Shap Yi Wat Village is accessible by taxi (15 minutes from [[Wong Tai Sin]] [[MTR]]), but don't expect to find a taxi in the \"village\".  The Sha Tin Pass Estate housing development is a 1.5K walk down Sha Tin Pass Road from the village and is serviced by the 18/18M [[green minibus]].  The 18/18M shuttles between Sha Tin Pass Estate and [[Wong Tai Sin Station]] [[MTR]].\n\n===Between stages 5 and 6===\nStage 5 ends/Stage 6 begins at [[Tai Po Road]] (Sha Tin Heights section) across from [[Kowloon Group of Reservoirs#Kowloon Reservoir|Kowloon Reservoir]]. There do not appear to be any usable facilities here, although the map indicate a public restroom 200m east along the road.   The KMB buses 72 and 81 are available for easy access to various stations.  The 81 toward [[Jordan, Hong Kong|Jordan (\u4f50\u6566)]] stops at [[Mong Kok Station]] [[MTR]].\n\n===Between stages 6 and 7===\nStage 6 ends/Stage 7 begins at [[Shing Mun Reservoir]] (also known as the Jubilee Reservoir).   There is no public transport access here, although a taxi can get within 50m.  Don't expect to find a taxi waiting.  Otherwise, it is a 1.6K walk to the 82 [[green minibus]] terminus on Shun Min Road.  This bus will take you to [[Tsuen Wan Station]].  There is also a visitors center 50m from the bus terminus, but there are no facilities here.\n\n===Between stages 7 and 8===\nThe 23S/23K [[green minibus]] travels between the residential village of San Uk Ka and [[Tai Po Market Station]] [[MTR]].  The stop is on the trail, 100m into Stage 8. The buses are frequent (at least every 15 minutes) and take around 10 minutes.  Alternatively, the station is a 2K walk.   There are two restaurants and a small grocery store opposite the drainage canal 100m past the trail turn at distance post 090.\n\n===Within Stage 8===\nBetween distance post 97 and 98, the trail passes within 200m of a shopping center that connects to [[Tai Wo Station]] [[MTR]].  Follow the [[MTR]] sign posted on the trail on the north side of the drainage canal.  There is a [[7-Eleven]] and several restaurants at the shopping centre.  This is the last place to resupply or access clean restrooms anywhere directly alongside the trail until the terminus (Stage 10) at Nam Chung.\n\n===Between stages 8 and 9===\nThe transition from Stage 8 to Stage 9 is between distance post 105 and 106, near the peak of [[Cloudy Hill]].  Between distance post 107 and 108, there is a side trail/road that leads 2.8K to the small residential village of Kau Lung Hang, the terminus of the 25B [[green minibus]].   The road is steep, traversing more than 300m of vertical, so budget time accordingly. The 25B shuttles between Kau Lung Hang and [[Tai Wo Station]] [[MTR]].  There are no services at Kau Lung Hang.\n\nAlternatively, one can enter/exit the trail at [[Hok Tau Reservoir]].  The 52B [[green minibus]] travels between [[Fanling Station]] [[MTR]] and Hok Tau Road.  The bus terminus is around a 2K walk along Hok Tau Road and intersects the trail at the reservoir close to distance post 112.   The last bus scheduled from [[Hok Tau Road]] departs around 8:30 pm.\n\n===Between stages 9 and 10===\nThere is no convenient access.  There is a steep trail from the Stage 9/10 switchover point atop Hsien Ku Fung down to Pat Sing Leng Nature Trail.  The Pat Sin Leng Nature Trail starts at the Plover Cove Country Park Visitors Centre to the 20C [[green minibus]] stop.  Total distance from the switchover to the bus stop is 1.1K.  The 20C connects to [[Tai Po Market Station]] [[MTR]].\n\n===Trail terminus===\nThe trail terminus is at Nam Chung, on a side road around 1.5K from the main road.  Confusingly, both the side road at the trail head and the main road are called \"Luk Keng Road\".   The bus stop for the 56K [[green minibus]] shuttles between Luk Keng Village and [[Fanling Station]] [[MTR]] and will stop, on request, at the intersection of the main road and the side road.    Those beginning the trail here can ask the bus driver to drop them at Nam Chung.  For those returning from the trail, be warned that the last bus departs around 7:30 pm.  Also, mobile phones are unlikely to work here (one is more likely to get a roaming signal from the mainland than a Hong Kong signal).  An alternative return route is to walk 1&nbsp;km east along the road toward Luk Keng Village\u2014to the minibus terminus\u2014and either take the bus, or if it is after 7:30 pm, ask someone at the small restaurant/convenience area to call a taxi for you.\n\nThere are bathroom facilities located around 500m from the trail terminus along the side road as well as at the intersection of the side road and the main road.\n\n==Raleigh Challenge==\n[[Raleigh International]]'s \"Raleigh Challenge \u2013 Wilson Trail\" is the first hiking competition which covered the longest distance of the Wilson Trail, spanning across the Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories from south to north.<ref>[http://www.raleigh.org.hk/wilsontrail/ Raleigh Challenge: Wilson Trail]</ref> To avoid crowds at the trailhead on Stanley Gap Road, the Challenge bypasses the first 2K of Stage 1 (\"The Twins\") and instead takes a side trail to the lower part of Tai Tam Reservoir Road, passing Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir and Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir, and heads to Tai Tam Road.\n\n==Other long-distance trails of Hong Kong==\nThe Wilson Trail is the most recent of the four long-distance trails of Hong Kong.  The others are:\n*[[Hong Kong Trail]]: across [[Hong Kong Island]] ({{convert|50|km}})\n*[[Lantau Trail]]: on [[Lantau Island]] ({{convert|70|km}})\n*[[MacLehose Trail]]: from [[Sai Kung Peninsula|Sai Kung]] to [[Tuen Mun]] ({{convert|100|km}})\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hong Kong Country Parks & Special Areas]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Wilson Trail}}\n*[http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cou/cou_vis_cou_ttqbe/cou_vis_cou_ttqbe.html Tai Tam Country Park by Hong Kong Government]\n*[http://www.raleigh.org.hk/wilsontrail Raleigh Challenge-Wilson Trail]\n{{coord|22.250062|N|114.198498|E|source:zhwiki_region:CN|format=dms|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Hiking trails in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Tai Tam]]\n", "name_user": "124.244.134.197", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eStages)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Trail"}
{"title_page": "Mickey Mouse March", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date= August 2009}}\n\n\"'''(The) Mickey Mouse (Club) March'''\" is the opening theme for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' television show, which aired in the United States from October 1955 to 1959, on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. (The first two lines are: ''Who\u2019s the leader of the Club that\u2019s made for you and me? M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!'')
