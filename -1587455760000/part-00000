At this meeting, Ray P. Warren was elected as the group's first conductor. In a bid to secure an adequate rehearsal venue from the university for the newly formed band, dePont volunteered the band to provide the music for the [[University_of_Michigan_Law_School|Law School's]] upcoming observance of [[Washington's Birthday]]. This was considered to be one of the most important events of the school year. Delivering on dePont's promise, the band's first public performance was on-stage in University Hall at that celebration on February 22, 1897. University president [[James Burrill Angell]] was satisfied with the band's performance and granted dePont's request for rehearsal space in Room A of University Hall. By 1898, the band was being referred to as the \"University of Michigan Band\" and had become an integral part of the Michigan tradition by playing at the football games.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/marching-band-about-html.aspx?path=spirit | title=About the Michigan Marching Band | website=mgoblue.com | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Michigan | access-date=2019-03-06 | quote=By the fall of 1898, the presence of the band at the football games had become an integral part of the Michigan football tradition.}}</ref>\n=== 1900 - 1929 ===\nIn these early years, the university provided no financial support for the band. The ensemble disbanded in early 1903 amid a series of leadership changes, but reunited that fall before performing in its first \"snow bowl\" at the game against the [[University of Chicago]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The following year, on October 18, 1904, the band reintroduced the playing of \"[[The Victors]]\" at Michigan football games. Eugene J. Fischer became the band's conductor with the start of the 1906 season.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />[[File:Michigan Marching Band entering Ferry Field, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|The 1920 Michigan Marching Band from the Michiganensian yearbook 1921.]]\n\nAfter Michigan moved out of the [[Big Ten Conference#History|Western Football Conference]] during the 1911 season, [[J. Fred Lawton]] and Earl Vincent Moore composed the fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]],\" which became an immediate hit. Fischer made the song a standard part of the band's football game performances. [[George Olsen]] became the marching band's first drum major in 1914 and inadvertently started the \"[[Michigan_Marching_Band#Goal post toss|Goal Post Toss]]\" tradition during the game against [[Syracuse University]]. During this time, the band was also changing its performance style to incorporate military drill techniques. Thanks to Fischer's prolonged efforts to secure university funding for the band, Wilfred Wilson was hired by the university in 1915 as the ensemble's new conductor.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />\n\nThe Nu Chapter of the band fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], was established to promote and serve the University bands in 1925. Around this time, the university purchased Morris Hall and allocated it as the band's permanent \"home.\" By 1926, membership in the band had grown to nearly 100 musicians prior to Fischer's departure.

Falcone resigned in 1935 after a long struggle with hearing loss, and [[William D. Revelli]], director of the award-winning Hobart, Indiana, high school band, was hired as his successor. In 1936, the term, \"Marching Band\" came into use referring to the portion of the band that played at football games. This group had previously been known as the \"Varsity Band\" or the \"Fighting Band.\" Upon his appointment, Revelli required all male wind instrument majors at the university to participate in the Marching Band. To raise funds for a new band facility, Revelli oversaw an all-campus talent show known as \"Varsity Night.\" This annual event would later evolve into the Band-O-Rama concert series.<ref>{{Citation | title=School of Music, Theatre & Dance (University of Michigan) Publications | publisher=UM Libraries | date=1996 | page=13 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0nlAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PT615&ots=K6gMspPEf2&dq=-site%3Amichiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&pg=PT615#v=onepage&q=-site:michiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&f=false | access-date=2019-05-06 }}</ref>\n[[File:University of Michigan Band halftime show 1949.jpg|thumb|389x389px|1949 Michigan Band performing a halftime show in Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor MI.]]\n\nRevelli formally aligned the band with the School of Music in 1940.

Graduate students in the music school or former MMB members that are graduate students in other University programs are hired to help direct the MMB and also to oversee student staff positions.  The MMB also has a color guard instructor, Joan Noble-Pruett, and a percussion instructor, Chuck Ricotta, that each oversee their respective sections to ensure the visual and rhythmic elements of the band are perfect.<ref>{{Citation | title=Band-O-Rama: Victors Valiant! | place=Ann Arbor, MI | publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance | year=2017 | page=11 | language=English | url=https://issuu.com/umichsmtd/docs/bor17_final/10 }}</ref>\n\n===Drum Major===\nThe Michigan Marching Band has one drum major, commonly referred to as the \"Man Up Front\" or \"Woman Up Front,\" for the entire ensemble. Like in most [[Big_Ten_Conference|Big Ten]] bands, the MMB drum major is not a conducting position. The drum major provides whistle commands to provide song tempos and parade instructions. While it is not required of the position, most drum majors perform twirling routines during the halftime show. The drum major is also responsible for teaching proper marching techniques during Band Week. The drum major is best known for the [[Michigan Marching Band#Back bend|back bend]] performed during pregame.\n\nAuditions for this position are held yearly in a two-phase process. The first phase is held in front of the MMB staff which narrows the field of candidates. The second phase is held at the band's spring meeting and the final vote is decided by the current members of the MMB.\n\n===Section Leaders===\nSection leaders are the heads of their sections and are responsible for the music performance. They hold weekly music rehearsals for their section. Section leaders are determined by the staff and generally announced at the \"Spring Meeting,\" traditionally held on the last day of Winter semester.\n\n===Rank Leaders===\nRank Leaders are determined in phases. Generally each year during the final stages of the winter semester, band members are invited to nominate people in their own section to be considered for a Rank Leader Candidate spot. Rank Leader Candidates are then selected by the staff and announced during the Spring Meeting or sometimes later. Rank Leader Candidates then participate in a retreat to learn how to teach the marching technique before Band Week begins. Rank Leaders help the incoming members learn the marching techniques, then have two days of review with all other returning members and the incoming members. Band members are then given the chance to fill out Rank Leader evaluations. The staff then narrows down the potential candidates to the actual Rank Leaders for the year, taking the evaluations into account.\n\nDuring the season, Rank Leaders are in charge of the marching position and style of 12 members on the field. They are given full drill charts to ensure that their rank members are in formation. To save paper, regular members are given coordinate sheets to give their position on the field by numbers rather than graphically.\n\n===Performance Block===\nThe Performance Block is the subset of the MMB that performs pre-game and halftime.  An additional subset is called \"halftime only\" which adds to the performance block for halftime.  The halftime block usually consists of an additional 6 piccolos, 6 alto saxophones, 12 horns, 3 bass drums, 4 snare drums, 4 tenor drums, 6 cymbals, and 6 to 12 sousaphones (depending on the drill requirements).\n\nThe rank leaders along with the MMB staff decide which members in block are to be challenged for their position in block.  This method lessens tension in the band as a member does not need to challenge an individual member of the performance block for their position.  There are no minimum or maximum requirements for challenges, and some members may not be challenged every week.\n\nChallenges are typically held after rehearsal on Fridays for the following game. Challenges consist of a halftime marching audition while playing a musical excerpt from the weekly show, followed by performing a portion of the pre-game show.  Results are posted the following Monday.\n\n===Reserves===\nBand members who are not in the performance block, called \"reserves,\" spend each week rehearsing marching fundamentals on an adjacent practice field while the performance block learns the show to prepare for the game.  The reserves are no less a part of the MMB, as they still march to and from the stadium, perform in the stands during football games, provide ancillary support services during the halftime shows, and may be asked (on short notice) to take the place of a performance block member who cannot perform due to injury, illness, or other circumstances.\n\n==Band Week==\nEvery summer during the two weeks before the first home game, the MMB holds its \"Band Week.\" New members, rank leaders, drumline, and flags arrive first to rehearse marching styles and traditional music. New members learn marching fundamentals from the Drum Major and Rank Leaders. The returning members join a few days later and the music audition is held to determine the players' chairs. After the returning members have been through a couple days of marching rehearsal, \"First Look\" is held. During First Look the entire band performs [[glide step]] and a pre-game portion which are both observed and scored by the staff. These performances are given in groups of 8. After the initial performance block is set, it devotes the remainder of Band Week to rehearsing the performance of pre-game and halftime for the first home game of the season. The reserves spend the remainder of Band Week practicing for the next challenge.\n\n\n\n==Routines==\n\n===Saturday morning rehearsal===\nThe Michigan Marching Band practices on Elbel Field in the morning prior to each home game. Practice typically begins at 7:00&nbsp;<small>AM</small> for a game with a noon [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. The band begins rehearsal with music warm-ups and a review of the halftime music. Next, it rehearses transition elements of the pregame performance. Lastly, the band reviews the drill for the halftime performance. Music is either sung or played at \"half volume\" during this portion of the rehearsal to preserve the band members' [[embouchure]] for the game.\n\n===Step Show===\n[[Image:RevelliHall.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Revelli Hall]]\nThe Michigan Drumline performs the Step Show on the steps of Revelli Hall about an hour and a half before kickoff. The group runs through warm-ups, some pieces arranged specifically for the drumline, the parade cadence series, and closes with \"[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]].\"\n\n===March to the stadium===\nFollowing the Step Show, the Michigan Marching Band lines up on the steps of Revelli Hall for inspection by the drum major before stepping off to the stadium. Once this is complete, the band begins parading to the stadium by moving out onto Hoover Street. The parade route goes down Hoover Street, turning left onto Greene Street and then into the [[Michigan Stadium]] parking lot. The band then stops in the parking lot among tailgaters and performs a shortened version of \"[[The Victors]]\" the band commonly refers to as \"Parking Lot Victors.\" Once finished, they progress to the mouth of the tunnel of Michigan Stadium where \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" and the trio of \"The Victors\" is played in the direction of the tunnel.\n\n===Pregame Show===\nThe reserve members leave the parade formation, run down the tunnel onto the field and move into the stands to watch pregame. The remaining band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into \"entry lines\" for the start of the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The [[Michigan Stadium]] and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!\"<ref name=\"Mlive-Grapentine\" />\n\n====Entries====\n[[File:DSC 7256 (15329279660).jpg|thumb|right|361x|Band members doing \"Ups\" during Entries]]\nA style of marching used by the Michigan Marching Band that is not meant to be used while playing. This style is characterized by fast exchanges of the legs, with the knees making a 90-degree bend or less. Using this marching style, the band then 'pours' out of the tunnel onto the field to the \"Entry Cadence\" at approximately 220 [[BPM (music)|BPM]] in \"entry lines\" which then fold out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, consisting of 192 musicians. After the last game against a non-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] team, in addition to Entries, members would raise their arms up in a follow-the-leader fashion at a 45-degree angle, known as \"Ups\". Right before the band folds out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band would the drop their arms in a follow-the-leader fashion at double the pace of \"Ups\". Despite the name, Entries are also used at the end of pregame and halftime shows as a quick, organized, and efficient way to get members off the field as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:UConn vs. Michigan 2010 06 (Michigan Marching Band).JPG|thumb|left|\"Tunnel\" formation used in the Pregame show for the football team entrance.]]\n====\"M Fanfare\"====\nWhile in the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band plays the \"M Fanfare.\" The \"M Fanfare\" was composed by longtime Michigan Marching Band arranger and composer [[Jerry Bilik]], consisting of portions of \"[[The Victors]],\" \"[[Varsity (fight song)]],\" and \"[[The Yellow and Blue]].\" The band's twirlers and drum major are introduced during the \"M Fanfare.\"\n\n=====Back bend=====\nAt the climax of the \"M Fanfare,\" the drum major performs a signature move. The drum major moves from the middle of the band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, turns to face the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. Originally, drum majors kept their hats on and touched their plumes to the ground. \n[[File:Eastern Michigan vs. Michigan 2011 01 (U-M drum major).jpg|thumb|324x324px|Michigan Drum Major Back Bend]]\nThe first drum major to do a back-bend as part of the Michigan Band's pregame show was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.\n\nAlbert Ahronheim was the next drum major after Mark Brown, but did not incorporate the back bend into his pregame routine. Instead, he used his gymnastic skills and performed handsprings and back flips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe back bend returned with Jeff Wilkins in 1975.\n\nIn 1993, Matthew Pickus became the first drum major to remove the hat and touch his head to the ground. This feat was first performed during the pregame of the 1993 Michigan-Notre Dame game. Matthew used the hat-less back bend for the rest of his career as drum major. Since approximately 2003, the hat-less back bend has become the standard for Michigan drum majors.\n\n====\"The Victors\"====\nDuring the pregame performance, the band plays the pregame version of \"[[The Victors]]\" while marching across the field to the north end zone. Before the trio starts, an added drum transition occurs, allowing the band to change formations from \"sweep lines\" to the \"hollow block M\" formation. During the transition, Carl Grapentine announces, \"All the Maize and Blue faithful join in a rousing chorus of 'The Victors!'\" These words were introduced during the Becher era.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band: 1983 Pregame | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1983-10-15 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQjVcxTE4Y&t=140 }}</ref> Prior to that, the announcer would say, \"Let's all join and sing for a big Michigan victory!\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band Pregame, October 13, 1979 | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1979-10-13 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy24ifHg9yA&t=131 }}</ref> For the Ohio State game, he would add another \"big\" to the announcement. The trio of \"The Victors\" is then played while marching to the south end zone.\n\n=====Goal post toss=====\nDuring \"[[The Victors]]\", the drum major marches down to the north end zone goal post and tosses his/her [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] or baton over the cross bar. Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without dropping it, the football team will win the game.\n\n=====Lock step / high step=====\nFor the past 15 seasons, while playing the break strain of \"[[The Victors]],\" the Michigan Marching Band performs its [[Chair step|lock step]] (formerly known as high step). This is done for 16 counts at half tempo. In this technique, the \"post leg\" remains perpendicular to the ground while the \"free leg\" makes a right angle with the shin being perpendicular to the ground and an extreme downward toe point. The transition to the next step is made by snapping the free leg down and thrusting the post leg up. This style juxtaposes the more fluid, ''traditional step''.\n\n=====Glide step=====\nIn contrast to the strong, snappy lock step, the traditional [[Glide step|glide step]] is a more fluid and elegant. With the knee of the free leg only making a 60-degree angle, as opposed to the 90-degree angle, this marching style is used during the majority of the pregame show.\n\n====Visitor's fight song====\nImmediately following \"[[The Victors]],\" the band plays the visitor's fight song to the south end zone. The upper section of the south end zone is where a large portion of the visiting fans sit. Playing the visitor's fight song is a strong tradition among all [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] marching bands.\n\n====\"Varsity\"====\nFollowing the visitor's fight song, the band transitions into the school's 1911-1931 fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]].\" The band once again forms \"sweep lines\" and marches back to the middle of the field and then folds out into another \"Block M\" formation similar to the \"Fanfare M\" formation.\n\n====\"Blues Brothers\"====\n[[File:The Cake, Michigan Marching Band, Michigan Stadium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan (21733694042).jpg|thumb|347x347px|The \"cake\" formation.]]\nOriginating in 1985, once a year, generally at a game without a visiting band, the Michigan Marching Band performs the [[Otis Redding]] hit \"[[I Can't Turn You Loose]],\" made famous in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', at midfield. The band forms concentric circles on the field and during a vamp in the music, collapses the circles into what is commonly referred to as \"the cake.\" The entire band fits into a 10-yard diameter circle, centered on the 50-yard line. Once this is complete, the band members scramble back to their \"Fanfare M\" positions. \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" was first performed during the 1980 season during the \"Saturday Afternoon Live\" field show, a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' after which it quickly became popular. \"The Cake\" formation was added in 1985. The song is now also regularly played during the pause in between the third and fourth quarters of football games.\n<br />\n\n[[File:20090926 Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band salute.jpg|thumb|right|347px|Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band in tunnel formation]]\n\n====\"Let's Go Blue\" and team entrance====\nTime permitting, the band plays \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" to the south, east, north and west sides of Michigan Stadium. \"Let's Go Blue\" was written in the mid 1970s by Joseph Carl, a tuba player who was also in the Hockey Pep Band, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major who also served as a music arranger for the marching band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/21/627356/a-catchy-intro-to-a-cheer-became-music-to-the-ears-of-myriad-fans |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |last=Stieg |first=Bill |date=1984-05-21 |website=si.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29 |quote='He hummed it to me, and two hours later I had done a complete arrangement and copied parts for everyone,' he said. 'The next Saturday, we played it.'}}</ref> The band then splits the diagonal lines of the \"M\" formation to allow room for the \"Go Blue, M Club Supports You\" banner to be raised for the team's entrance, also known as the \"Tunnel Formation\". The team runs onto the field as the band plays the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" twice.\n\n====\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nSince September 22, 2001, the team has been on the field for the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The band uses the Henry Fillmore \"trumpeting arrangement\" of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" further arranged by alumnus [[Robert Longfield]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Michigan Marching Band Performs Star-Spangled Banner at 2005 Rose Bowl Game | date = 2005-01-01 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WjpNGHPok | access-date = 2019-05-06 }}</ref> The band then collapses the split \"M\" formation back to the solid \"Block M\" formation. Following the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" the marching band marches to the north end zone while playing the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" and, once finished, marches (to the \"Entry Cadence\") off the field.\n\n===Postgame show===\nAfter every home game, the football team runs to the northwest corner of the stadium and joins the band and students in singing \"[[The Yellow and Blue]]\" and a trio of \"[[The Victors]].\" The band then returns to the field and performs \"The Victors\" as written, or in its entirety. They also play selections of the halftime performance. The performance closes with \"Temptation\", \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" \"The Yellow and Blue,\" \"The Victors\" (trio), and the \"Entry Cadence.\" When the football team wins, the band members wear their [[Shako|shakos]] backward during the post-game performance. Visiting bands are invited to join the MMB on the field for a shared postgame show, alternating between musical numbers. After the performance, the band forms into parade lines and marches back through the tunnel and then back to Revelli Hall. When the drum cadence begins, the band chants, \"Go Michigan, beat [whichever team is next on the schedule (e.g. \"[[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|The Fighting Irish]]\")], followed by \"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!\" \n\n====\"Temptation\" and \"Hawaiian War Chant\"====\n\"[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\" are percussion features that have been played by the MMB for over 50 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. \"Temptation\" is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. \"Temptation\" is played first, followed by \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, \"Because you can't have one without the other, the 'Hawaiian War Chant!'\" During the post-game band show, when it comes time for \"Temptation,\" the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n* ''Forever Valiant'' (2017)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Forever Valiant |year=2017}}</ref>\n*''This is Michigan'' (2012)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=This is Michigan |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2012}}</ref>\n* ''2008 Season Highlights'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=2008 Season Highlights |title-link= |others= |year=2009 |publisher=Regents Of The University Of Michigan |id=UMMBCDSPS }}</ref>\n* ''Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web |title=Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics |url=https://www.amazon.com/Gameday-Faves-Michigan-Wolverines-Classics/dp/B002VBVHYE/ |website=Amazon.com |publisher=2Thumbz Entertainment |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n*''The Maize Album'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Maize Album |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2009}}</ref>\n*''The Blue Album'' (2008)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Blue Album |others=Jamie L.

At this meeting, Ray P. Warren was elected as the group's first conductor. In a bid to secure an adequate rehearsal venue from the university for the newly formed band, dePont volunteered the band to provide the music for the [[University_of_Michigan_Law_School|Law School's]] upcoming observance of [[Washington's Birthday]]. This was considered to be one of the most important events of the school year. Delivering on dePont's promise, the band's first public performance was on-stage in University Hall at that celebration on February 22, 1897. University president [[James Burrill Angell]] was satisfied with the band's performance and granted dePont's request for rehearsal space in Room A of University Hall. By 1898, the band was being referred to as the \"University of Michigan Band\" and had become an integral part of the Michigan tradition by playing at the football games.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/marching-band-about-html.aspx?path=spirit | title=About the Michigan Marching Band | website=mgoblue.com | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Michigan | access-date=2019-03-06 | quote=By the fall of 1898, the presence of the band at the football games had become an integral part of the Michigan football tradition.}}</ref>\n=== 1900 - 1929 ===\nIn these early years, the university provided no financial support for the band. The ensemble disbanded in early 1903 amid a series of leadership changes, but reunited that fall before performing in its first \"snow bowl\" at the game against the [[University of Chicago]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The following year, on October 18, 1904, the band reintroduced the playing of \"[[The Victors]]\" at Michigan football games. Eugene J. Fischer became the band's conductor with the start of the 1906 season.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />[[File:Michigan Marching Band entering Ferry Field, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|The 1920 Michigan Marching Band from the Michiganensian yearbook 1921.]]\n\nAfter Michigan moved out of the [[Big Ten Conference#History|Western Football Conference]] during the 1911 season, [[J. Fred Lawton]] and Earl Vincent Moore composed the fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]],\" which became an immediate hit. Fischer made the song a standard part of the band's football game performances. [[George Olsen]] became the marching band's first drum major in 1914 and inadvertently started the \"[[Michigan_Marching_Band#Goal post toss|Goal Post Toss]]\" tradition during the game against [[Syracuse University]]. During this time, the band was also changing its performance style to incorporate military drill techniques.

Falcone resigned in 1935 after a long struggle with hearing loss, and [[William D. Revelli]], director of the award-winning Hobart, Indiana, high school band, was hired as his successor. In 1936, the term, \"Marching Band\" came into use referring to the portion of the band that played at football games. This group had previously been known as the \"Varsity Band\" or the \"Fighting Band.\" Upon his appointment, Revelli required all male wind instrument majors at the university to participate in the Marching Band. To raise funds for a new band facility, Revelli oversaw an all-campus talent show known as \"Varsity Night.\" This annual event would later evolve into the Band-O-Rama concert series.<ref>{{Citation | title=School of Music, Theatre & Dance (University of Michigan) Publications | publisher=UM Libraries | date=1996 | page=13 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0nlAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PT615&ots=K6gMspPEf2&dq=-site%3Amichiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&pg=PT615#v=onepage&q=-site:michiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&f=false | access-date=2019-05-06 }}</ref>\n[[File:University of Michigan Band halftime show 1949.jpg|thumb|389x389px|1949 Michigan Band performing a halftime show in Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor MI.]]\n\nRevelli formally aligned the band with the School of Music in 1940.

Graduate students in the music school or former MMB members that are graduate students in other University programs are hired to help direct the MMB and also to oversee student staff positions.  The MMB also has a color guard instructor, Joan Noble-Pruett, and a percussion instructor, Chuck Ricotta, that each oversee their respective sections to ensure the visual and rhythmic elements of the band are perfect.<ref>{{Citation | title=Band-O-Rama: Victors Valiant! | place=Ann Arbor, MI | publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance | year=2017 | page=11 | language=English | url=https://issuu.com/umichsmtd/docs/bor17_final/10 }}</ref>\n\n===Drum Major===\nThe Michigan Marching Band has one drum major, commonly referred to as the \"Man Up Front\" or \"Woman Up Front,\" for the entire ensemble. Like in most [[Big_Ten_Conference|Big Ten]] bands, the MMB drum major is not a conducting position. The drum major provides whistle commands to provide song tempos and parade instructions. While it is not required of the position, most drum majors perform twirling routines during the halftime show. The drum major is also responsible for teaching proper marching techniques during Band Week. The drum major is best known for the [[Michigan Marching Band#Back bend|back bend]] performed during pregame.\n\nAuditions for this position are held yearly in a two-phase process. The first phase is held in front of the MMB staff which narrows the field of candidates. The second phase is held at the band's spring meeting and the final vote is decided by the current members of the MMB.\n\n===Section Leaders===\nSection leaders are the heads of their sections and are responsible for the music performance. They hold weekly music rehearsals for their section. Section leaders are determined by the staff and generally announced at the \"Spring Meeting,\" traditionally held on the last day of Winter semester.\n\n===Rank Leaders===\nRank Leaders are determined in phases. Generally each year during the final stages of the winter semester, band members are invited to nominate people in their own section to be considered for a Rank Leader Candidate spot. Rank Leader Candidates are then selected by the staff and announced during the Spring Meeting or sometimes later. Rank Leader Candidates then participate in a retreat to learn how to teach the marching technique before Band Week begins. Rank Leaders help the incoming members learn the marching techniques, then have two days of review with all other returning members and the incoming members. Band members are then given the chance to fill out Rank Leader evaluations. The staff then narrows down the potential candidates to the actual Rank Leaders for the year, taking the evaluations into account.\n\nDuring the season, Rank Leaders are in charge of the marching position and style of 12 members on the field. They are given full drill charts to ensure that their rank members are in formation. To save paper, regular members are given coordinate sheets to give their position on the field by numbers rather than graphically.\n\n===Performance Block===\nThe Performance Block is the subset of the MMB that performs pre-game and halftime.  An additional subset is called \"halftime only\" which adds to the performance block for halftime.  The halftime block usually consists of an additional 6 piccolos, 6 alto saxophones, 12 horns, 3 bass drums, 4 snare drums, 4 tenor drums, 6 cymbals, and 6 to 12 sousaphones (depending on the drill requirements).\n\nThe rank leaders along with the MMB staff decide which members in block are to be challenged for their position in block.  This method lessens tension in the band as a member does not need to challenge an individual member of the performance block for their position.  There are no minimum or maximum requirements for challenges, and some members may not be challenged every week.\n\nChallenges are typically held after rehearsal on Fridays for the following game. Challenges consist of a halftime marching audition while playing a musical excerpt from the weekly show, followed by performing a portion of the pre-game show.  Results are posted the following Monday.\n\n===Reserves===\nBand members who are not in the performance block, called \"reserves,\" spend each week rehearsing marching fundamentals on an adjacent practice field while the performance block learns the show to prepare for the game.  The reserves are no less a part of the MMB, as they still march to and from the stadium, perform in the stands during football games, provide ancillary support services during the halftime shows, and may be asked (on short notice) to take the place of a performance block member who cannot perform due to injury, illness, or other circumstances.\n\n==Band Week==\nEvery summer during the two weeks before the first home game, the MMB holds its \"Band Week.\" New members, rank leaders, drumline, and flags arrive first to rehearse marching styles and traditional music. New members learn marching fundamentals from the Drum Major and Rank Leaders. The returning members join a few days later and the music audition is held to determine the players' chairs. After the returning members have been through a couple days of marching rehearsal, \"First Look\" is held. During First Look the entire band performs [[glide step]] and a pre-game portion which are both observed and scored by the staff. These performances are given in groups of 8. After the initial performance block is set, it devotes the remainder of Band Week to rehearsing the performance of pre-game and halftime for the first home game of the season. The reserves spend the remainder of Band Week practicing for the next challenge.\n\n\n\n==Routines==\n\n===Saturday morning rehearsal===\nThe Michigan Marching Band practices on Elbel Field in the morning prior to each home game. Practice typically begins at 7:00&nbsp;<small>AM</small> for a game with a noon [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. The band begins rehearsal with music warm-ups and a review of the halftime music. Next, it rehearses transition elements of the pregame performance. Lastly, the band reviews the drill for the halftime performance. Music is either sung or played at \"half volume\" during this portion of the rehearsal to preserve the band members' [[embouchure]] for the game.\n\n===Step Show===\n[[Image:RevelliHall.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Revelli Hall]]\nThe Michigan Drumline performs the Step Show on the steps of Revelli Hall about an hour and a half before kickoff. The group runs through warm-ups, some pieces arranged specifically for the drumline, the parade cadence series, and closes with \"[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]].\"\n\n===March to the stadium===\nFollowing the Step Show, the Michigan Marching Band lines up on the steps of Revelli Hall for inspection by the drum major before stepping off to the stadium. Once this is complete, the band begins parading to the stadium by moving out onto Hoover Street. The parade route goes down Hoover Street, turning left onto Greene Street and then into the [[Michigan Stadium]] parking lot. The band then stops in the parking lot among tailgaters and performs a shortened version of \"[[The Victors]]\" the band commonly refers to as \"Parking Lot Victors.\" Once finished, they progress to the mouth of the tunnel of Michigan Stadium where \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" and the trio of \"The Victors\" is played in the direction of the tunnel.\n\n===Pregame Show===\nThe reserve members leave the parade formation, run down the tunnel onto the field and move into the stands to watch pregame. The remaining band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into \"entry lines\" for the start of the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The [[Michigan Stadium]] and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!\"<ref name=\"Mlive-Grapentine\" />\n\n====Entries====\n[[File:DSC 7256 (15329279660).jpg|thumb|right|361x|Band members doing \"Ups\" during Entries]]\nA style of marching used by the Michigan Marching Band that is not meant to be used while playing. This style is characterized by fast exchanges of the legs, with the knees making a 90-degree bend or less. Using this marching style, the band then 'pours' out of the tunnel onto the field to the \"Entry Cadence\" at approximately 220 [[BPM (music)|BPM]] in \"entry lines\" which then fold out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, consisting of 192 musicians. After the last game against a non-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] team, in addition to Entries, members would raise their arms up in a follow-the-leader fashion at a 45-degree angle, known as \"Ups\". Right before the band folds out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band would the drop their arms in a follow-the-leader fashion at double the pace of \"Ups\". Despite the name, Entries are also used at the end of pregame and halftime shows as a quick, organized, and efficient way to get members off the field as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:UConn vs. Michigan 2010 06 (Michigan Marching Band).JPG|thumb|left|\"Tunnel\" formation used in the Pregame show for the football team entrance.]]\n====\"M Fanfare\"====\nWhile in the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band plays the \"M Fanfare.\" The \"M Fanfare\" was composed by longtime Michigan Marching Band arranger and composer [[Jerry Bilik]], consisting of portions of \"[[The Victors]],\" \"[[Varsity (fight song)]],\" and \"[[The Yellow and Blue]].\" The band's twirlers and drum major are introduced during the \"M Fanfare.\"\n\n=====Back bend=====\nAt the climax of the \"M Fanfare,\" the drum major performs a signature move. The drum major moves from the middle of the band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, turns to face the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. Originally, drum majors kept their hats on and touched their plumes to the ground. \n[[File:Eastern Michigan vs. Michigan 2011 01 (U-M drum major).jpg|thumb|324x324px|Michigan Drum Major Back Bend]]\nThe first drum major to do a back-bend as part of the Michigan Band's pregame show was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.\n\nAlbert Ahronheim was the next drum major after Mark Brown, but did not incorporate the back bend into his pregame routine. Instead, he used his gymnastic skills and performed handsprings and back flips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe back bend returned with Jeff Wilkins in 1975.\n\nIn 1993, Matthew Pickus became the first drum major to remove the hat and touch his head to the ground. This feat was first performed during the pregame of the 1993 Michigan-Notre Dame game. Matthew used the hat-less back bend for the rest of his career as drum major. Since approximately 2003, the hat-less back bend has become the standard for Michigan drum majors.\n\n====\"The Victors\"====\nDuring the pregame performance, the band plays the pregame version of \"[[The Victors]]\" while marching across the field to the north end zone. Before the trio starts, an added drum transition occurs, allowing the band to change formations from \"sweep lines\" to the \"hollow block M\" formation. During the transition, Carl Grapentine announces, \"All the Maize and Blue faithful join in a rousing chorus of 'The Victors!'\" These words were introduced during the Becher era.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band: 1983 Pregame | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1983-10-15 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQjVcxTE4Y&t=140 }}</ref> Prior to that, the announcer would say, \"Let's all join and sing for a big Michigan victory!\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band Pregame, October 13, 1979 | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1979-10-13 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy24ifHg9yA&t=131 }}</ref> For the Ohio State game, he would add another \"big\" to the announcement. The trio of \"The Victors\" is then played while marching to the south end zone.\n\n=====Goal post toss=====\nDuring \"[[The Victors]]\", the drum major marches down to the north end zone goal post and tosses his/her [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] or baton over the cross bar. Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without dropping it, the football team will win the game.\n\n=====Lock step / high step=====\nFor the past 15 seasons, while playing the break strain of \"[[The Victors]],\" the Michigan Marching Band performs its [[Chair step|lock step]] (formerly known as high step). This is done for 16 counts at half tempo. In this technique, the \"post leg\" remains perpendicular to the ground while the \"free leg\" makes a right angle with the shin being perpendicular to the ground and an extreme downward toe point. The transition to the next step is made by snapping the free leg down and thrusting the post leg up. This style juxtaposes the more fluid, ''traditional step''.\n\n=====Glide step=====\nIn contrast to the strong, snappy lock step, the traditional [[Glide step|glide step]] is a more fluid and elegant. With the knee of the free leg only making a 60-degree angle, as opposed to the 90-degree angle, this marching style is used during the majority of the pregame show.\n\n====Visitor's fight song====\nImmediately following \"[[The Victors]],\" the band plays the visitor's fight song to the south end zone. The upper section of the south end zone is where a large portion of the visiting fans sit. Playing the visitor's fight song is a strong tradition among all [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] marching bands.\n\n====\"Varsity\"====\nFollowing the visitor's fight song, the band transitions into the school's 1911-1931 fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]].\" The band once again forms \"sweep lines\" and marches back to the middle of the field and then folds out into another \"Block M\" formation similar to the \"Fanfare M\" formation.\n\n====\"Blues Brothers\"====\n[[File:The Cake, Michigan Marching Band, Michigan Stadium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan (21733694042).jpg|thumb|347x347px|The \"cake\" formation.]]\nOriginating in 1985, once a year, generally at a game without a visiting band, the Michigan Marching Band performs the [[Otis Redding]] hit \"[[I Can't Turn You Loose]],\" made famous in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', at midfield. The band forms concentric circles on the field and during a vamp in the music, collapses the circles into what is commonly referred to as \"the cake.\" The entire band fits into a 10-yard diameter circle, centered on the 50-yard line. Once this is complete, the band members scramble back to their \"Fanfare M\" positions. \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" was first performed during the 1980 season during the \"Saturday Afternoon Live\" field show, a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' after which it quickly became popular. \"The Cake\" formation was added in 1985. The song is now also regularly played during the pause in between the third and fourth quarters of football games.\n<br />\n\n[[File:20090926 Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band salute.jpg|thumb|right|347px|Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band in tunnel formation]]\n\n====\"Let's Go Blue\" and team entrance====\nTime permitting, the band plays \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" to the south, east, north and west sides of Michigan Stadium. \"Let's Go Blue\" was written in the mid 1970s by Joseph Carl, a tuba player who was also in the Hockey Pep Band, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major who also served as a music arranger for the marching band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/21/627356/a-catchy-intro-to-a-cheer-became-music-to-the-ears-of-myriad-fans |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |last=Stieg |first=Bill |date=1984-05-21 |website=si.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29 |quote='He hummed it to me, and two hours later I had done a complete arrangement and copied parts for everyone,' he said. 'The next Saturday, we played it.'}}</ref> The band then splits the diagonal lines of the \"M\" formation to allow room for the \"Go Blue, M Club Supports You\" banner to be raised for the team's entrance, also known as the \"Tunnel Formation\". The team runs onto the field as the band plays the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" twice.\n\n====\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nSince September 22, 2001, the team has been on the field for the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The band uses the Henry Fillmore \"trumpeting arrangement\" of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" further arranged by alumnus [[Robert Longfield]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Michigan Marching Band Performs Star-Spangled Banner at 2005 Rose Bowl Game | date = 2005-01-01 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WjpNGHPok | access-date = 2019-05-06 }}</ref> The band then collapses the split \"M\" formation back to the solid \"Block M\" formation. Following the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" the marching band marches to the north end zone while playing the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" and, once finished, marches (to the \"Entry Cadence\") off the field.\n\n===Postgame show===\nAfter every home game, the football team runs to the northwest corner of the stadium and joins the band and students in singing \"[[The Yellow and Blue]]\" and a trio of \"[[The Victors]].\" The band then returns to the field and performs \"The Victors\" as written, or in its entirety. They also play selections of the halftime performance. The performance closes with \"Temptation\", \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" \"The Yellow and Blue,\" \"The Victors\" (trio), and the \"Entry Cadence.\" When the football team wins, the band members wear their [[Shako|shakos]] backward during the post-game performance. Visiting bands are invited to join the MMB on the field for a shared postgame show, alternating between musical numbers. After the performance, the band forms into parade lines and marches back through the tunnel and then back to Revelli Hall. When the drum cadence begins, the band chants, \"Go Michigan, beat [whichever team is next on the schedule (e.g. \"[[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|The Fighting Irish]]\")], followed by \"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!\" \n\n====\"Temptation\" and \"Hawaiian War Chant\"====\n\"[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\" are percussion features that have been played by the MMB for over 50 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. \"Temptation\" is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. \"Temptation\" is played first, followed by \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, \"Because you can't have one without the other, the 'Hawaiian War Chant!'\" During the post-game band show, when it comes time for \"Temptation,\" the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n* ''Forever Valiant'' (2017)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Forever Valiant |year=2017}}</ref>\n*''This is Michigan'' (2012)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=This is Michigan |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2012}}</ref>\n* ''2008 Season Highlights'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=2008 Season Highlights |title-link= |others= |year=2009 |publisher=Regents Of The University Of Michigan |id=UMMBCDSPS }}</ref>\n* ''Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web |title=Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics |url=https://www.amazon.com/Gameday-Faves-Michigan-Wolverines-Classics/dp/B002VBVHYE/ |website=Amazon.com |publisher=2Thumbz Entertainment |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n*''The Maize Album'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Maize Album |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2009}}</ref>\n*''The Blue Album'' (2008)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Blue Album |others=Jamie L.

They built many sanctuaries dedicated to the gods of the [[sun]] and the [[earth]]. Near the village of Nenkovo (northwest of Kardzhali), an artificial cave was found in 2001. It has the form of a woman's [[womb]]. Exactly at noon, when the sun is highest in the sky, a ray of light comes in through a stone slit forming a falitic shade in the cave. According to the Thracian beliefs, this is the conception of the new sun god. This cave is considered a complex [[astronomy|astronomic]] facility (compared to [[Stonehenge]] in Great Britain) as the ray of light enters the cave on a single day of the year.<ref>[http://novinar.net/?act=news&sql=MjMxOzE1== (2 May 2001) ''\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440''] Newspaper article in Bulgarian with photos</ref>\n\nThere are many stone castles and palaces that the Thracians built in the region&nbsp;\u2014 Perperek, Ustra, Vishegrad. The most magnificent is [[Perperikon]], where a Thracian king resided. The place has become increasingly popular since the recent archaeological works rendered wealth of artifacts.\n\nDuring the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, Kardzhali was the center of a Christian eparchy&nbsp;\u2014 Achridos.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} During the reign of the [[Bulgarian Empire]], Kardzhali was known as ''Zherkovo''{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} a name that was used by the Bulgarians until the 17th century.

The area was of strategic importance for the Bulgarian Empire during the Middle Ages and the remains of numerous Medieval fortress scattered on the surrounding hills can still be seen.\n\n[[File:Memmorial March after Todor Alexandrov's assassination, Kardzhali 18 September 1924.jpg|thumb]]\n\nThe town developed largely due to its position on the trade routes during the period of Ottoman rule. However, it remained a small town. During the 18th century, Turkish [[brigands]] used this remote town as a hideaway and supply point, and the town was later named after their leader K\u0131rca Ali. The best known of these units was led by [[Osman Pazvanto\u011flu|Pazvanto\u011flu Osman Pasha]], who ruled most of the northeastern Bulgarian lands and the Danube estuary until 1807.\n\n[[File:BASA-KJ-1096-1-399-1-Slyadno horo.jpg|thumb|Round dance]]\n\nKardzhali and its neighborhood became part of the autonomous province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] under the stipulations of the Berlin Congress of 1878, but, after the reunification of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] and [[Eastern Rumelia]] in 1885, it was ceded back to the Ottoman Empire as a township of [[Komotini|G\u00fcm\u00fclcine]] sanjak in [[Edirne]] vilayet. [[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]] ended during the [[First Balkan War]] when the town and the surrounding area were liberated by the Bulgarian General [[Vasil Delov]] on 21 October 1912. The day has been celebrated with concerts and commemorative events as a municipal holiday since 1937.

After the [[Second Balkan war]] and the [[First World War]], [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] Christian refugees from [[Eastern Thrace|Eastern]] and [[Western Thrace]] settled in Kardzhali. Some Turks immediately moved to the remains of the Ottoman Empire in 1913 in response to the Bulgarian return to their lands. Further emigration to Turkey continued between 1913 and 1989. This included two emigration waves in the 1930s and 1950s as a result of treaties between Bulgaria and Turkey and most notably in 1989 in response to the state sponsored [[Revival Process]] which saw the forced [[Bulgarisation]] of ethnic Turks.\n\nAfter 1990 the deteriorating economic conditions in Bulgaria (and especially the region) during the post-communist transition led to significant emigration by both Bulgarians and Turks, with the Bulgarians moving to other parts of the country or abroad and with the Turks moving mainly to Turkey.\n\n[[File:Kardzhali Old Clock Tower, \u0427\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u041a\u044a\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0438.jpg|thumb|Kardzhali Old Clock Tower]]\n\nAccording to the last census in 2011 Kardzhali Province is the Bulgarian province with the highest relative proportion of ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], though Kardzhali municipality and the city itself have a lower proportion of ethnic Turks than the rest of the province.

[[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]] ended during the [[First Balkan War]] when the town and the surrounding area were liberated by the Bulgarian General [[Vasil Delov]] on 21 October 1912. The day has been celebrated with concerts and commemorative events as a municipal holiday since 1937. Kardzhali was declared the center of Kardzhali Province, when it was created from the most southern part of [[Stara Zagora Province]]<ref>[http://www.visittobulgaria.com/visit/dir.asp?d=0-8-Ardino Ardino's history]</ref> in 1949.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:JewishMemorial.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Memorial to the Jewish community of Kardzhali]]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Kardzhali has a population of 43,880, while the Kardzhali municipality (which in addition to the city also includes 117 villages) has a population of 67,846.<ref>[http://www.nsi.bg/ORPDOCS/Census2011_1.pop_by_age.xls Population by province, municipality, settlement and age by 01.02.2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908134107/http://www.nsi.bg/ORPDOCS/Census2011_1.pop_by_age.xls |date=2013-09-08 }} {{in lang|bg}}</ref>\n\nDuring Ottoman rule before 1912 most of the population of the city were Muslims - [[Bulgarian Turks|Turks]], [[Muslim Bulgarians|Pomaks]] and [[Muslim Roma]]. After the [[Second Balkan war]] and the [[First World War]], [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] Christian refugees from [[Eastern Thrace|Eastern]] and [[Western Thrace]] settled in Kardzhali. Some Turks immediately moved to the remains of the Ottoman Empire in 1913 in response to the Bulgarian return to their lands. Further emigration to Turkey continued between 1913 and 1989. This included two emigration waves in the 1930s and 1950s as a result of treaties between Bulgaria and Turkey and most notably in 1989 in response to the state sponsored [[Revival Process]] which saw the forced [[Bulgarisation]] of ethnic Turks.\n\nAfter 1990 the deteriorating economic conditions in Bulgaria (and especially the region) during the post-communist transition led to significant emigration by both Bulgarians and Turks, with the Bulgarians moving to other parts of the country or abroad and with the Turks moving mainly to Turkey.\n\n[[File:Kardzhali Old Clock Tower, \u0427\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u041a\u044a\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0438.jpg|thumb|Kardzhali Old Clock Tower]]\n\nAccording to the last census in 2011 Kardzhali Province is the Bulgarian province with the highest relative proportion of ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], though Kardzhali municipality and the city itself have a lower proportion of ethnic Turks than the rest of the province.

However, presently there is no cigarette production in the region as the once big [[Tobacco]] company \"Haskovo-BT\" was closed in 2005.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160409114554/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-242959110.html HighBeam]</ref> Currently, the biggest enterprises produce food, machinery, and textiles.\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of Haskovo was 14,191 in 1887.<ref name=\"BAN\"/> Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns.

In the game, the player controls Captain Viridian, who must rescue their spacecrew after a teleporter malfunction caused them to be separated in Dimension VVVVVV. The gameplay is characterized by the inability of the player to jump, instead opting on controlling the direction of gravity, causing the player to fall upwards or downwards.<ref name=\"kotaku-review\" /> The game consists of more than 400 individual rooms, and also supports the creation of user-created levels. \n\nThe game was built in [[Adobe Flash]] and released on January 11, 2010, for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]]. The game was [[Porting|ported]] to [[C++]] by Simon Roth in 2011,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12kqw6/comment/c6vvzvj |title=\nI'm Simon Roth, creator of sci-fi god-game Maia. AMA - IAmA |website=[[reddit]]}}</ref> and released as part of the [[Humble Indie Bundle|Humble Indie Bundle #3]]. The port to C++ allowed the porting of the game to other platforms such as [[Linux]], [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]], [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:VVVVVV - The Tomb of Mad Carew.png|thumb|left|In this room, Captain Viridian must avoid the red spikes and green ghost. The \"C\" icon to the left of the spike pit is a checkpoint, which the player is returned to upon dying.]]\n\nUnlike most [[Platform video game|platforming]] games, in ''VVVVVV'' the player is not able to jump, but instead can reverse the direction of gravity when standing on a surface, causing Captain Viridian to fall either upwards or downwards.<ref name=\"kotaku-review\" />  This feature was first seen in the 1986 [[8-bit]] game [[Terminus (1986 video game)|''Terminus'']]. The player uses this mechanic to traverse the game's environment and avoid various hazards, including stationary spikes and moving enemies.\n\nLater areas introduce new mechanics such as moving floors or rooms which, upon touching one edge of the screen, [[wraparound (video games)|cause the player character to appear on the other side]].<ref name=\"indiegames-review\" />  \n\n''VVVVVV'' contains eight main [[Level (video gaming)|levels]], including an intro level, four levels which can be accessed in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear sequence]], two intermission levels, and one final level, only seen outside Dimension VVVVVV (in a \"polar dimension\"). These are situated inside a large open world for the player to explore, spanning more than 400 individual rooms.<ref name=\"rps-review\" />  Due to its high level of difficulty, the game world contains many checkpoints, to which the player's character is reset upon death.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Plot ==\nThe player controls Captain Viridian, who at the outset of ''VVVVVV'' must evacuate the spaceship along with the captain's crew, when the ship becomes affected by \"dimensional interference\".  The crew escapes through a [[Teleportation|teleporter]] on the ship; however, Captain Viridian becomes separated from the rest of the crew on the other end of the teleporter.  Upon returning to the ship, the Captain learns that the ship is trapped in an alternative dimension (referred to as ''Dimension VVVVVV''), and that the ship's crew has been scattered throughout this dimension. The player's goal, as Captain Viridian, is to rescue the missing crew members and find the cause of the dimensional interference.<ref name=\"eurogamer-review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/vvvvvv-review |title=''VVVVVV Review'' |first=Oli |last=Welsh |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2011-01-05 }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nThe gravity-flipping mechanic of ''VVVVVV'' is based on an earlier game designed by Cavanagh, entitled ''Sine Wave Ninja''.  In an interview with IndieGames.com, Cavanagh said that he was interested in using this idea as a core concept of a game, something he felt other games which include a gravity-flipping mechanism had never done before.<ref name=\"indiegames\">{{cite web |url=https://indiegamesplus.com/2010/01/intervvvvvview_terry_cavanagh |title=Intervvvvvview: Terry Cavanagh |first=Michael |last=Rose |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-12-01 |publisher=indiegamesplus.com }}</ref>\n\nCavanagh first unveiled ''VVVVVV'' on his blog in June 2009.  The game had been in development for two weeks, and Cavanagh estimated that the game would be finished in another two, \"but hopefully not much longer.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/2009/06/vvvvvvvv-preview |title=VVVVVVVV Preview |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-06-10 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>  A follow-up post published in July 2009 included screenshots of the game and an explanation of the game's gravity-flipping mechanic.  Cavanagh wrote that ''VVVVVV'', unlike some of his previous work such as ''Judith'' and ''Pathways'', would not be a \"storytelling experiment\", but rather \"focused on the level design\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/2009/07/when-its-done |title=When It's Done |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-07-15 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>  The game was first shown publicly at the 2009 [[Eurogamer Expo]], which gave Cavanagh the opportunity to collect feedback from players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=1019 |title=Eurogamer Expo 2009 |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-11-05 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>  In December 2009, a beta version of ''VVVVVV'' which had been given to donors was [[Internet leak|leaked]] on [[4chan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/2009/12/final-push |title=Final Push |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-12-07 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe visual style of ''VVVVVV'' is heavily inspired by games released for the [[Commodore 64]] 8-bit computer from the 1980s, especially ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'' which is referenced by the element of collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game \"that looked and felt like the C64 games I grew up with.\" He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to ''[[QWOP]]'' developer [[Bennett Foddy]], who created every room name in the final version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/2010/01/down-under |title=Down Under |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2010-08-01 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2013-09-08 }}</ref> The graphical style of ''VVVVVV'' is heavily influenced by the [[Commodore 64]]; similarly, the game's music is heavily dependent on [[chiptune]] elements. Swedish composer Magnus P\u00e5lsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled ''PPPPPP''.\n\nCavanagh also considered this game an opportunity to indulge in his \"retro fetish\".  He has said because he lacks the technical prowess to make more modern-looking games, he instead focuses on making them visually interesting; additionally, he finds this to be made easier by \"work[ing] within narrow limits\".<ref name=\"indiegames\" /> ''VVVVVV'' was the first game which Cavanagh sold commercially.  While his previous games were all released as freeware, due to the size of ''VVVVVV'' compared to his previous work, Cavanagh felt that he \"couldn't see [himself] going down that route.\"<ref name=\"indiegames\" />[[File:Sad Elephant room in the game vvvvvv.jpg|thumb|right|The Sad Elephant near Space Station 2]]\n\n''VVVVVV'' contains many strange visual elements, most notable of which being the sad elephant, sometimes also called the elephant in the room, which is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant for a short period of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from [[Jet Set Willy]] as once believed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vvvvvv-wiki.wikispaces.com/Curiosities|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214231154/http://vvvvvv-wiki.wikispaces.com/Curiosities|archivedate=2014-02-14|accessdate=2016-07-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Release ===\n''VVVVVV'' was released on January 11, 2010 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]. A [[trial version]] of the game is playable on the website [[Kongregate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kongregate.com/games/TerryCavanagh/vvvvvv-demo |title=Play VVVVVV Demo, a free online game on Kongregate |publisher=[[Kongregate]] |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>  A [[Linux]] version was in development, but a number of technical difficulties arose in the [[Software port|porting]] process, which led Cavanagh to cancel it for the time being.\n\nThe game was rewritten in C++ by games developer Simon Roth in 2011, allowing Linux support to be successfully implemented. This formed version 2.0 of ''VVVVVV'', launched on July 24, 2011 as part of the third [[Humble Indie Bundle]]. Version 2.0 also features support for custom levels, and a level editor.<ref>{{cite web|title=VVVVVV v2|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/07/26/vvvvvv-v2-0-now-with-added-notch|first=Lewie|last=Procter|date=2011-08-01 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] }}</ref> The C++ port also allowed for the implementation of new graphics modes and various speed improvements.

In the game, the player controls Captain Viridian, who must rescue their spacecrew after a teleporter malfunction caused them to be separated in Dimension VVVVVV. The gameplay is characterized by the inability of the player to jump, instead opting on controlling the direction of gravity, causing the player to fall upwards or downwards.<ref name=\"kotaku-review\" /> The game consists of more than 400 individual rooms, and also supports the creation of user-created levels. \n\nThe game was built in [[Adobe Flash]] and released on January 11, 2010, for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]]. The game was [[Porting|ported]] to [[C++]] by Simon Roth in 2011,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12kqw6/comment/c6vvzvj |title=\nI'm Simon Roth, creator of sci-fi god-game Maia.

The \"C\" icon to the left of the spike pit is a checkpoint, which the player is returned to upon dying.]]\n\nUnlike most [[Platform video game|platforming]] games, in ''VVVVVV'' the player is not able to jump, but instead can reverse the direction of gravity when standing on a surface, causing Captain Viridian to fall either upwards or downwards.<ref name=\"kotaku-review\" />  This feature was first seen in the 1986 [[8-bit]] game [[Terminus (1986 video game)|''Terminus'']]. The player uses this mechanic to traverse the game's environment and avoid various hazards, including stationary spikes and moving enemies.\n\nLater areas introduce new mechanics such as moving floors or rooms which, upon touching one edge of the screen, [[wraparound (video games)|cause the player character to appear on the other side]].<ref name=\"indiegames-review\" />  \n\n''VVVVVV'' contains eight main [[Level (video gaming)|levels]], including an intro level, four levels which can be accessed in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear sequence]], two intermission levels, and one final level, only seen outside Dimension VVVVVV (in a \"polar dimension\"). These are situated inside a large open world for the player to explore, spanning more than 400 individual rooms.<ref name=\"rps-review\" />  Due to its high level of difficulty, the game world contains many checkpoints, to which the player's character is reset upon death.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Plot ==\nThe player controls Captain Viridian, who at the outset of ''VVVVVV'' must evacuate the spaceship along with the captain's crew, when the ship becomes affected by \"dimensional interference\".  The crew escapes through a [[Teleportation|teleporter]] on the ship; however, Captain Viridian becomes separated from the rest of the crew on the other end of the teleporter.  Upon returning to the ship, the Captain learns that the ship is trapped in an alternative dimension (referred to as ''Dimension VVVVVV''), and that the ship's crew has been scattered throughout this dimension. The player's goal, as Captain Viridian, is to rescue the missing crew members and find the cause of the dimensional interference.<ref name=\"eurogamer-review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/vvvvvv-review |title=''VVVVVV Review'' |first=Oli |last=Welsh |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2011-01-05 }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nThe gravity-flipping mechanic of ''VVVVVV'' is based on an earlier game designed by Cavanagh, entitled ''Sine Wave Ninja''.  In an interview with IndieGames.com, Cavanagh said that he was interested in using this idea as a core concept of a game, something he felt other games which include a gravity-flipping mechanism had never done before.<ref name=\"indiegames\">{{cite web |url=https://indiegamesplus.com/2010/01/intervvvvvview_terry_cavanagh |title=Intervvvvvview: Terry Cavanagh |first=Michael |last=Rose |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-12-01 |publisher=indiegamesplus.com }}</ref>\n\nCavanagh first unveiled ''VVVVVV'' on his blog in June 2009.

Cavanagh wrote that ''VVVVVV'', unlike some of his previous work such as ''Judith'' and ''Pathways'', would not be a \"storytelling experiment\", but rather \"focused on the level design\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/2009/07/when-its-done |title=When It's Done |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-07-15 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>  The game was first shown publicly at the 2009 [[Eurogamer Expo]], which gave Cavanagh the opportunity to collect feedback from players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=1019 |title=Eurogamer Expo 2009 |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-11-05 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>  In December 2009, a beta version of ''VVVVVV'' which had been given to donors was [[Internet leak|leaked]] on [[4chan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/2009/12/final-push |title=Final Push |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-12-07 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe visual style of ''VVVVVV'' is heavily inspired by games released for the [[Commodore 64]] 8-bit computer from the 1980s, especially ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'' which is referenced by the element of collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game \"that looked and felt like the C64 games I grew up with.\" He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to ''[[QWOP]]'' developer [[Bennett Foddy]], who created every room name in the final version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/2010/01/down-under |title=Down Under |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2010-08-01 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2013-09-08 }}</ref> The graphical style of ''VVVVVV'' is heavily influenced by the [[Commodore 64]]; similarly, the game's music is heavily dependent on [[chiptune]] elements. Swedish composer Magnus P\u00e5lsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled ''PPPPPP''.\n\nCavanagh also considered this game an opportunity to indulge in his \"retro fetish\".  He has said because he lacks the technical prowess to make more modern-looking games, he instead focuses on making them visually interesting; additionally, he finds this to be made easier by \"work[ing] within narrow limits\".<ref name=\"indiegames\" /> ''VVVVVV'' was the first game which Cavanagh sold commercially.  While his previous games were all released as freeware, due to the size of ''VVVVVV'' compared to his previous work, Cavanagh felt that he \"couldn't see [himself] going down that route.\"<ref name=\"indiegames\" />[[File:Sad Elephant room in the game vvvvvv.jpg|thumb|right|The Sad Elephant near Space Station 2]]\n\n''VVVVVV'' contains many strange visual elements, most notable of which being the sad elephant, sometimes also called the elephant in the room, which is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant for a short period of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from [[Jet Set Willy]] as once believed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vvvvvv-wiki.wikispaces.com/Curiosities|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214231154/http://vvvvvv-wiki.wikispaces.com/Curiosities|archivedate=2014-02-14|accessdate=2016-07-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Release ===\n''VVVVVV'' was released on January 11, 2010 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]].

This formed version 2.0 of ''VVVVVV'', launched on July 24, 2011 as part of the third [[Humble Indie Bundle]]. Version 2.0 also features support for custom levels, and a level editor.<ref>{{cite web|title=VVVVVV v2|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/07/26/vvvvvv-v2-0-now-with-added-notch|first=Lewie|last=Procter|date=2011-08-01 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] }}</ref> The C++ port also allowed for the implementation of new graphics modes and various speed improvements. Version 2.0, however, does not support saved games from the original Flash version of ''VVVVVV''; many players received this update via Steam without warning, and hence were unable to continue their existing saved games. A save-file exporter is in development.<ref>{{cite web|title=Update Killed My Save File|url=http://distractionware.com/forum/index.php?topic=361.0|website=distractionware forums}}</ref>\n\nBased on this [[source code]] it was also ported in 2011 for the [[Open Pandora]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdroms.de/openpandoragmbh-pandora-pnd/vvvvvv-v2-2-1-0-pandora-game-port|title=VVVVVV v2.2.1.0 (Pandora Game Port) \u203a Pandora \u203a PDRoms - Homebrew 4 you|date=2011-12-27|website=PDRoms - Homebrew 4 you|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> which requires the data files from the [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] or [[Linux]] version of the game to work.\n\nOn October 7, 2011, it was announced that a version of the game was being made for [[Nintendo 3DS]] by Nicalis.

It was elected Bulgarian tree of the year in 2013. On 19 March 2014 the results of an online poll were revealed at a ceremony in the European Parliament. The Old Elm was voted [[European Tree of the Year]] 2014.

Sliven was conquered by [[Rome]] around 72\u201371 BCE when the [[Thracians|Thracian]]<ref>Fol, Aleksandar. The Thracian Royal city of Kabyle. - In: Settlement Life in Ancient Thrace.

With the emergence of the [[Roman Empire]] the region of the city became part of the [[Thrace|Thracian]] province of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nA new stage in the city's history began around 2nd-4th century. The first written records of the settlement's name, Tuida/Suida/Tsuida date to this period. This name is most likely of [[Thracian language|Thracian]] origin. Its etymology is currently not understood. Known as \"\u0130slimye\" by the Turks, during Ottoman rule it was a sanjak centre in first [[Rumelia eyalet]], then [[Silistra Eyalet|Silistre]] ([[Ochakov|\u00d6zi]]) eyalet, [[Edirne vilayet]], finally being for a short period a  centre of a department in the autonomous province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] before its inclusion in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1885. During the [[First World War]] it was the site of the [[Sliven prisoner of war camp]], the largest such camp in the country. It was the place of internment for Greek and Serbian civilians and soldiers, with peak numbers of 19,000.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Pissari |first=Milovan |date=2013 |title=Bulgarian Crimes against Civilians in Occupied Serbia during the First World War|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2013/0350-76531344357P.pdf|journal=Balcanica |publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies  |issue=44 |pages=357\u2013390 |doi=10.2298/BALC1344357P |accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn more modern times, Sliven became one of the most significant cultural centres during the Bulgarian National Revival, with much of its old heritage still preserved and enriched and today offers to its citizens and visitors a lot of opportunities for cultural life. It served as the birthplace of many prominent Bulgarians who contributed to the enlightenment such as [[Hadzhi Dimitar]], [[Dobri Chintulov]], [[Evgeniy Chapkanov]], [[Ivan Seliminski]] and many others. Another notable native is [[Anton Pann]] who composed the [[Romania]]n national anthem. Another notable resident is [[Yordan Letchkov]], whose goal in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] eliminated defending champion Germany. Letchkov was mayor of Sliven from 2003 to 2011.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy of Sliven has centered around industry since the early 19th century. In 1834, [[Dobri Zhelyazkov]] established the first factory in Bulgarian lands, thus starting industrial development in Bulgaria. Sliven was one of the largest industrial centers in Bulgaria, playing an important role during the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. It has long-lived traditions in textiles, machine-building, glass-making, chemical production, and the technical and food industries.\n\nFollowing the beginning of communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944, most industries were nationalized and much industrial building and development was spurred. Industry continued to develop until the fall of communism, at which point much of the previously built industry stagnated; many plants and factories were shut down and there was little development.\n\nIn contemporary times, Sliven has experienced a surge in economy with increased investment, banking establishments and new industries have begun to emerge. The dairy industry, which has long been present, continues to grow and thrive. The wine industry, with companies such as [[Bulgarian wine|Vinprom]] and Vini Sliven and about a dozen others, continues to grow as grapes are easily grown due to the climate conditions. In terms of heavy industry, the city produces electric lights and electrical machines. The city has also become notorious as a source of young girls who are trafficked into the sex industry.\n\nLight industry in Sliven is mostly devoted to textiles with many companies making wool clothing, socks, and food.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Dramatic Theatre Sliven .jpg|right|thumb|200px|Theater traditions in Sliven date back 140 years when the city opens its first theatrical stage. The first professional theatrical ensemble was created in 1918 at the Zora community center. The dramatic theater in Sliven, situated on the city's main square. This theatre serves as a venue for various performing arts.]]\nThere are many buildings in the city built in the National Revival Architecture style, including the House museum \"Hadzhi Dimitar\". It is in the south western part of the town and shows visitors a complex  of a native memorial home and an old traditional inn. The Museum collection \"Dobri Chintulov\" is on the North side of Sliven; it was the home of the Bulgarian revival teacher and poet Dobri Chintulov.\nThe city's main theater is located at the main city square. It is named after the Sliven native Stefan Kirov (\u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432) who was a prominent actor and director.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of cities in Bulgaria]]\n* [[Upper Thrace]]\n\n==Twin towns -

Investors are exploring the opportunity to use the famous local wind (Bora) for the production of electricity.\n\nAnother point of interest and a major symbol of the city as featured on the coat of arms, is the more than thousand-year-old Stariyat Briast (\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0411\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0442, \"The Old Elm\"), a huge [[Smooth-leaved Elm]] in the center of the city. During Ottoman rule, Turkish officials used to hang Bulgarian revolutionaries on it. Today the city is helping the tree to live on by frequent evaluations and reinforcing its base. It was elected Bulgarian tree of the year in 2013. On 19 March 2014 the results of an online poll were revealed at a ceremony in the European Parliament. The Old Elm was voted [[European Tree of the Year]] 2014. The city also served as an important strategic centre for the [[Bulgarian Army]], with the headquarters of the Bulgarian Third Army located in the centre of the city, being situated relatively near to the sensitive Turkish border.\n\n[[Sliven Peak]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Sliven.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name comes from the Slavic word ''sliv'' (\"pour, confluence\") + the Slavic suffix or ending ''-en''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sliven.gvardia.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=221&Itemid=80 |title=\u0417\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d |publisher=\u0411\u041d\u0421 \u2013 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2008-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928233719/http://sliven.gvardia.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=221&Itemid=80 |archivedate=2008-09-28 }}</ref>\n|\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Karandila2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|View of Sliven and the [[Upper Thracian Lowlands|lowlands of Thrace]] from southern [[Stara Planina]]]]\n\nSliven is located 300&nbsp;km east of Bulgaria's capital [[Sofia]], 100&nbsp;km from [[Burgas]], the country's largest commercial port, 130&nbsp;km from the border with [[Greece]] and 130&nbsp;km from the border with [[Turkey]].

Ruins of a [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement dating to around 5th\u20133rd century BCE as well as [[Thrace|Thracian]] ceramics and [[Hellenistic]] coins have been discovered in the area of Hisarlaka \u2014 a small hill in Sliven. In antiquity it was known as ''Selymnos (\u03a3\u03ae\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 in [[Greek language|Greek]])''. The area occupied by present-day Sliven has in the past been settled by the [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes Asti, Kabileti and Seleti. These tribes held their independence until time of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered them.\n\nThe 2nd century BCE marked the beginning of the Roman conquests of northeastern [[Thracia]]. Sliven was conquered by [[Rome]] around 72\u201371 BCE when the [[Thracians|Thracian]]<ref>Fol, Aleksandar. The Thracian Royal city of Kabyle. - In: Settlement Life in Ancient Thrace.

With the emergence of the [[Roman Empire]] the region of the city became part of the [[Thrace|Thracian]] province of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nA new stage in the city's history began around 2nd-4th century. The first written records of the settlement's name, Tuida/Suida/Tsuida date to this period. This name is most likely of [[Thracian language|Thracian]] origin. Its etymology is currently not understood. Known as \"\u0130slimye\" by the Turks, during Ottoman rule it was a sanjak centre in first [[Rumelia eyalet]], then [[Silistra Eyalet|Silistre]] ([[Ochakov|\u00d6zi]]) eyalet, [[Edirne vilayet]], finally being for a short period a  centre of a department in the autonomous province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] before its inclusion in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1885. During the [[First World War]] it was the site of the [[Sliven prisoner of war camp]], the largest such camp in the country. It was the place of internment for Greek and Serbian civilians and soldiers, with peak numbers of 19,000.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Pissari |first=Milovan |date=2013 |title=Bulgarian Crimes against Civilians in Occupied Serbia during the First World War|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2013/0350-76531344357P.pdf|journal=Balcanica |publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies  |issue=44 |pages=357\u2013390 |doi=10.2298/BALC1344357P |accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn more modern times, Sliven became one of the most significant cultural centres during the Bulgarian National Revival, with much of its old heritage still preserved and enriched and today offers to its citizens and visitors a lot of opportunities for cultural life. It served as the birthplace of many prominent Bulgarians who contributed to the enlightenment such as [[Hadzhi Dimitar]], [[Dobri Chintulov]], [[Evgeniy Chapkanov]], [[Ivan Seliminski]] and many others. Another notable native is [[Anton Pann]] who composed the [[Romania]]n national anthem. Another notable resident is [[Yordan Letchkov]], whose goal in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] eliminated defending champion Germany. Letchkov was mayor of Sliven from 2003 to 2011.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy of Sliven has centered around industry since the early 19th century. In 1834, [[Dobri Zhelyazkov]] established the first factory in Bulgarian lands, thus starting industrial development in Bulgaria. Sliven was one of the largest industrial centers in Bulgaria, playing an important role during the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. It has long-lived traditions in textiles, machine-building, glass-making, chemical production, and the technical and food industries.\n\nFollowing the beginning of communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944, most industries were nationalized and much industrial building and development was spurred. Industry continued to develop until the fall of communism, at which point much of the previously built industry stagnated; many plants and factories were shut down and there was little development.\n\nIn contemporary times, Sliven has experienced a surge in economy with increased investment, banking establishments and new industries have begun to emerge. The dairy industry, which has long been present, continues to grow and thrive. The wine industry, with companies such as [[Bulgarian wine|Vinprom]] and Vini Sliven and about a dozen others, continues to grow as grapes are easily grown due to the climate conditions. In terms of heavy industry, the city produces electric lights and electrical machines. The city has also become notorious as a source of young girls who are trafficked into the sex industry.\n\nLight industry in Sliven is mostly devoted to textiles with many companies making wool clothing, socks, and food.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Dramatic Theatre Sliven .jpg|right|thumb|200px|Theater traditions in Sliven date back 140 years when the city opens its first theatrical stage. The first professional theatrical ensemble was created in 1918 at the Zora community center. The dramatic theater in Sliven, situated on the city's main square. This theatre serves as a venue for various performing arts.]]\nThere are many buildings in the city built in the National Revival Architecture style, including the House museum \"Hadzhi Dimitar\". It is in the south western part of the town and shows visitors a complex  of a native memorial home and an old traditional inn. The Museum collection \"Dobri Chintulov\" is on the North side of Sliven; it was the home of the Bulgarian revival teacher and poet Dobri Chintulov.\nThe city's main theater is located at the main city square.

In 2002, the Federal Government decided to build a dam on the Satpara Lake allocating $10 million to the project, in 2004. Progress has, however, been slow. Satpara Lake is {{convert|6|mi|km}} from Skardu. Satpara Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in the countryside offering trout fishing and row boating. This lake is the source of Skardu's drinking water. The dam was mostly completed in 2011 and four powerhouse units are operational; the latest started operation in June 2013.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:PIA rendezvous-edit.jpg|thumb|[[Pakistan International Airlines]] operates one daily flight to [[Skardu Airport]] using a [[Boeing 737-300]].]]\n\n===Road===\nThe normal road route into Skardu is via the [[Karakorum Highway]] and a [[Skardu Road (S1)]] into the [[Skardu Valley]] from it. Roads once linked Skardu to [[Srinagar]] and [[Leh]], though none are open for cross-[[Line of Control|LoC]] travel.\n\nSkardu's weather can have adverse effects on transport in and out of the region, as Skardu is often snowbound during the winter months. Roads in and out of Skardu can be blocked for extended periods of time, sometimes leaving air travel as the only feasible alternative.\n\n===Air===\n[[Skardu Airport]] is served by a daily direct flight from [[Islamabad]].

The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|\u221224.1|\u00b0C|0}} on 7 January 1995.<ref name=PMD>{{cite web |url= http://www.pakmet.com.pk/cdpc/Climate/Skardu_Climate_Data.txt |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100613053345/http://www.pakmet.com.pk/cdpc/Climate/Skardu_Climate_Data.txt |archivedate= 13 June 2010 |title=Skardu Climate Data |work=web.archive.org |year=2014 |accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Skardu\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 13.9\n|Feb record high C = 16.7\n|Mar record high C = 24.0\n|Apr record high C = 29.6\n|May record high C = 34.4\n|Jun record high C = 40.0\n|Jul record high C = 41.0\n|Aug record high C = 41.0\n|Sep record high C = 38.2\n|Oct record high C = 31.2\n|Nov record high C = 22.9\n|Dec record high C = 16.2\n|year record high C = 41.0\n|Jan high C = 3.2\n|Feb high C = 6.1\n|Mar high C = 12.4\n|Apr high C = 18.8\n|May high C = 23.4\n|Jun high C = 28.7\n|Jul high C = 31.6\n|Aug high C = 31.2\n|Sep high C = 27.2\n|Oct high C = 20.4\n|Nov high C = 13.2\n|Dec high C = 6.5\n|year high C = 14.9\n|Jan low C = -8.0\n|Feb low C = -4.4\n|Mar low C = 1.5\n|Apr low C = 6.6\n|May low C = 9.7\n|Jun low C = 13.4\n|Jul low C = 16.4\n|Aug low C = 16.0\n|Sep low C = 11.4\n|Oct low C = 4.3\n|Nov low C = -1.9\n|Dec low C = -5.6\n|year low C = 4.1\n|Jan record low C = -24.1\n|Feb record low C = -20.0\n|Mar record low C = -13.5\n|Apr record low C = \u22121.1\n|May record low C = 0.4\n|Jun record low C = 4.0\n|Jul record low C = 7.5\n|Aug record low C = 7.0\n|Sep record low C = 2.6\n|Oct record low C = -4.2\n|Nov record low C = -9.5\n|Dec record low C = -17.2\n|year record low C = \u221224.1\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 27.5\n|Feb rain mm = 25.9\n|Mar rain mm = 36.9\n|Apr rain mm = 31.3\n|May rain mm = 25.3\n|Jun rain mm = 9.0\n|Jul rain mm = 9.8\n|Aug rain mm = 12.2\n|Sep rain mm = 9.3\n|Oct rain mm = 7.3\n|Nov rain mm = 5.6\n|Dec rain mm = 16.3\n|year rain mm = 172.7\n|time day = 17:00 [[Pakistan Standard Time|PST]]\n|Jan humidity = 64.3\n|Feb humidity = 52.0\n|Mar humidity = 34.9\n|Apr humidity = 25.6\n|May humidity = 24.6\n|Jun humidity = 22.3\n|Jul humidity = 27.3\n|Aug humidity = 30.7\n|Sep humidity = 29.9\n|Oct humidity = 31.2\n|Nov humidity = 36.6\n|Dec humidity = 56.2\n|year humidity = 29.6\n|source 1 = Pakistan Meteorological Department<ref name=PMD/>\n|date=August 2012\n}}\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Baltoro_glacier_from_air.jpg|thumb|Skardu is located near the [[Baltoro Glacier]] - [[List of glaciers#List of longest glaciers in world in non-polar regions|one of the world's longest]] outside a [[Polar regions of Earth|polar region]].]]\nSkardu is located along the Kohistan-Ladakh [[terrane]], formed as a magmatic arch over a [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyan]] subduction zone that was later accreted onto the [[Eurasian Plate]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The region has low seismic activity compared to surrounding regions, suggesting that Skardu is located in a passive structural element of the [[Main Central Thrust|Himalayan thrust]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The stone in the Skardu region is Katzara [[schist]], with a [[Radiometric dating|Radiometric]] age of 37 to 105 million years.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNumerous complex granitic pegmatites and a few alpine-cleft metamorphic deposits are found in the Shigar Valley and its tributaries. Shigar Valley contains the Main Karokoram Thrust separating the metasediments (chlorite to amphibolite grade) on the Asian plate from the southern volcanoclastic rocks of the Kohistan-Ladakh island arc.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Shangrila, Lower Kachura Lake.jpg|thumbnail|Shangri La resort]]\nSkardu, along with [[Gilgit]], is a major tourism, trekking and expedition hub in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]]. The mountainous terrain of the region, which includes four of the world's 14 [[Eight-thousander]] peaks, attracts tourists, trekkers and mountaineers from around the world. The main tourist season is from April to October; except at this time, the area can be cut off for extended periods by the snowy, freezing winter weather.\n\n===Mountains===\n[[File:Jamia masjid(mosque) skardu. photo by me.jpg|thumbnail|Skardu grand mosque]]\nAccessible from Skardu by road, the nearby [[Askole]] and [[Hushe]] are the main gateways to the snow-covered {{convert|8,000|m|ft|lk=out|adj=on|abbr=off}} peaks including [[K2]], the [[Gasherbrum]]s, [[Broad Peak]], and the [[Trango Towers]], and to the huge glaciers of [[Baltoro Glacier|Baltoro]], [[Biafo Glacier|Biafo]] and [[Trango Glacier|Trango]]. This makes Skardu the main tourist and mountaineering base in the area, which has led to the development of a reasonably extensive tourist infrastructure including shops and hotels. The popularity of the region results in high prices, especially during the main trekking season.\n\n===Deosai National Park===\n\nTreks to the [[Deosai Plains]], the second highest in the world at {{convert|4114|m|ft}} above sea level, after the [[Chang Tang]] in [[Tibet]], either start from or end at Skardu. In the local [[Balti language]], Deosai is called Byarsa ''\u0f56\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f66\u200b'', meaning 'summer place'. With an area of approximately {{convert|3000|km2|0|abbr=out}}, the plains extend all the way to Ladakh and provides a habitat for [[snow leopard]]s, [[ibex]], [[Tibetan blue bear]]s and wild horses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAccessible from Skardu by road, the nearby [[Manthokha Waterfall]] is very beautiful place approx 70 kilometre from skardu in kharmong or kargil valley.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Skardu Fort===\n\n[[File:SkarduFortEntrance1167.JPG|thumb|right|[[Skardu Fort]] was built by Raja Ali Sher at the end of the 16th century, and was home to Skardu's local ''Rajas'']]\n[[Skardu Fort]] or Kharphocho Fort lies on the eastern face of the Khardrong or Mindoq-Khar (\"Castle of Queen Mindoq\") hill {{convert|15|m|abbr=off}} above Skardu town. The fort dates from the 8th century CE and contains an old mosque probably dating back to the arrival of Islam in the 16th century CE. The fort provides a panoramic view of Skardu town, the Skardu valley and the [[Indus River]]. It was built by [[Maqpon dynasty]] rulers of Baltistan. It was a seven-storey building. Mostly local people say that Kharpoocho is made by a ghost as they were servants of the ruler of that time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nKharphocho (Skardu) fort was built on a design similar to that of [[Leh Palace]] and the [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]]. The name Kharpochhe means the great fort \u2014 ''Khar'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] means castle or fort and ''Chhe'' means great.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Shigar Fort===\n[[File:Shigar fort.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Shigar Fort]] is a 400 year old fort in the nearby town of [[Shigar]].]]\nLocated on the route to the world's second highest mountain, K-2 is Shigar Fort. It is also known as Fong-Khar, which in the local language means the \"Palace on the Rock\". The complex at Shigar comprises the 400-year-old fort/palace and two more recent buildings: the \"Old House\" and the \"Garden House\". The former palace of the Raja of Shigar has been transformed into a 20-room heritage guesthouse, with the grand audience hall serving as a museum of Balti culture and featuring select examples of fine wood-carvings, as well as other heritage objects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Kachura Lakes===\n\nThere are two Kachura lakes \u2014 the less well-known (Upper) [[Kachura Lake]] and the more famous [[Shangrila Lake]] (\"Lower Kachura Lake\"). Shangrila Lake is home to the Shangrila Resort hotel complex (possibly the reason for the lake's alternative name), built in a Chinese style and another popular destination for tourists in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]]. The resort has a unique restaurant, set up inside the [[fuselage]] of an [[aircraft]] that crashed nearby. Kachura Lake is famous for its deep blue waters.\n\n===Satpara Lake===\n\n[[Satpara Lake]] is Skardu Valley's main lake. In 2002, the Federal Government decided to build a dam on the Satpara Lake allocating $10 million to the project, in 2004. Progress has, however, been slow. Satpara Lake is {{convert|6|mi|km}} from Skardu. Satpara Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in the countryside offering trout fishing and row boating. This lake is the source of Skardu's drinking water. The dam was mostly completed in 2011 and four powerhouse units are operational; the latest started operation in June 2013.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:PIA rendezvous-edit.jpg|thumb|[[Pakistan International Airlines]] operates one daily flight to [[Skardu Airport]] using a [[Boeing 737-300]].]]\n\n===Road===\nThe normal road route into Skardu is via the [[Karakorum Highway]] and a [[Skardu Road (S1)]] into the [[Skardu Valley]] from it. Roads once linked Skardu to [[Srinagar]] and [[Leh]], though none are open for cross-[[Line of Control|LoC]] travel.\n\nSkardu's weather can have adverse effects on transport in and out of the region, as Skardu is often snowbound during the winter months. Roads in and out of Skardu can be blocked for extended periods of time, sometimes leaving air travel as the only feasible alternative.\n\n===Air===\n[[Skardu Airport]] is served by a daily direct flight from [[Islamabad]]. Air travel in winter is subject to disruption due to the unpredictable winter weather.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Satpara Dam===\nThe [[Satpara Dam]] development project on the [[Satpara Lake]] was inaugurated in 2003. It was expected to be completed in December 2006; now the development work will be completed in December 2013. It is {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} south of Skardu city and is at an elevation of {{convert|2,700|m|ft}} from mean sea level. The main source of water is melting ice of the [[Deosai plains]] during the summer season. Now Satpara Dam provides drinking water to the whole city of Skardu and agricultural water to major areas of Skardu, for example, Gayoul, Newrangha, Khlangranga, Shigari Khurd, etc.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.wapda.gov.pk/htmls/sataparapj.html |title=SATPARA DAM PROJECT Updated as |publisher=Wapda.gov.pk |accessdate=6 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923031802/http://www.wapda.gov.pk/htmls/sataparapj.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt is a multipurpose project, which will produce 17.36 megawatts hydro generation, irrigate {{convert|15000|acre|km2}} of land and provide 13 cusecs drinking water daily to Skardu city.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Baltistan]]\n*[[Ladakh]]\n*[[Northern Areas]]\n*[[Satpara Dam]]\n*[[Haji Gham]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n* {{citation |editor1=M.

traditional state in [[Nsukka]] Local Government Area of [[Enugu State]], [[Nigeria]]. A culturally rich, stable traditional political system with institutions of government dating back 900 years, it is one of the oldest civilisations in existence pre-colonial Nigeria. Today, it is made up of three autonomous communities/towns, listed in order of seniority: Akpa-Edem, Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani <ref>Edem Autonomous Communities http://www.ebeano.org/LocalGovernments.html</ref> but unified as a culturally inviolable and indivisible federated entity.\n\nEdem has an area of {{convert|50.492|km2|abbr=on}} with several hills providing stunning views from multiple points.  The population of Edem is 39,633 based on the National Population Commission census conducted in 2006.\n\nEdem shares common borders with [[Obimo]] on the south, [[Nsukka]] on the east, [[Ibagwa Ani]] on the north, and Nrobo on the west.  Towns along the border include Okpuje near Owa and Egu Amegu, Abbi near Egu Amegu Abbi, Ugwuoke Ugwuinyi near Egu Amegu, and Ero Uno near Edem-Ani.\n\nThe people of Edem are from the [[Igala people|Igala]] ethnic group but currently, located in the South East of Nigeria since the division of the country into states and geopolitical zones.  Due to their ancestry and proximity to [[Northern Nigeria]], as well as their location in the northern part of [[Igboland]], they are referred to as Northern Igbos. \n\n==Composition of Edem==\nEdem is made up of 41 villages:\n\n'''Akpa-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Oba\n* Amadiuba\n* Amadimogo\n* Amankwa\n* Dimunazu\n* Igoro Agbo\n* Igoro Ugwu\n* Isamani\n* Nkawushi\n* Obeke\n* Okiti\n* Owa-Edem\n* Uwenu na Uwani Obeke\n\n'''Ozi-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Uwenu\n* Amabunegu\n* Amamkpume\n* Amaudo\n* Amaukpa\n* Amaukwa\n* Dimoke\n* Ezi-Ozi\n* Ikwe Ezike\n* Obinegun \n* Ukpara\n* Umueyi\n* Umuoji\n* Umokoo\n\n'''Edem-Ani Zone'''\n\n* Amaenu-Edem\n* Amaezumesu\n* Amaogwu\n* Isu\n* Nkofi\n* Odojo\n* Ogbododu\n* Owere-Ugwu\n* Owereagbo\n* Ozara\n* Ubogidi\n* Umuchiagwu\n* Umuchioke\n* Uwani-Edem\nEach village has an Oha Council headed by an [[Onyishi]] according to their culture and traditions.\n\n==Traditional Political System and Institutions==\nThe principal Edem ancestral, cultural, traditional political system and institution is Oha Edem (Edem Ruling Council of Elders) which consists of the following members to name a few: Eze Edem (The Sovereign), Onyishi Edem (The Oldest Man/Clan Head of Edem), Ossai Edem (Cultural Principal Private Secretary to Eze Edem), Atama Tazz (Chief Priest of Edem), Ndi Ishi (Zonal/Clan Heads), Asogwa (Ambassador of a Clan), Iduja (Deputy Ambassador of a Clan), Omabe/Ogbanabo (Traditional Police of the Realm & Ogueze (bodyguards) to the Eze Edem). Ogbanabo has Esato as the Senior Officer and Akaaju as the Junior Officer). \n\n[[Eze Edem]] is the Sovereign, the symbol of unity, custodian of culture and dispenser of justice within the Edem cultural political system. The Eze Edem is compelled by law to perform the Executive, Legislative and Judicial functions as they concern Edem culture. Kingship in Edem involves considerable self-denial.\n\nOnyishi Edem is drawn from Obeke Akpa-Edem, Onyishi Akpa-Edem is drawn from Owa, Onyishi Ozi-Edem from Umuokoo while Onyishi Edem-Ani is from Amaogwu. \n\nWhile Onyishi Ozi-Edem and Onyishi Edem-Ani must be the oldest in their clan, the criteria for selecting Onyishi Akpa-Edem is different. The people of Akpa-Edem felt that somebody younger and stronger will represent them better hence their Onyishi is always a much younger person compared to his colleagues from the other 2 zones. Meanwhile, the people in Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani zones believed an older, wiser and more experienced person will represent them better. \n\nWithin Oha Edem, each member has a specific role to play for e.g. the Asogwa Umuchiagwu is Ega/Oga [Provost/Messenger] Oha Edem, assisted by Asogwa Ezi-Ozi.\n\nMembers of Oha are divided into 2 categories. Category 1 is Idi-Ani which is made up of  Ndi Ishi (Onyishi). Category 2 is Oha Enu which is made up of Asogwas and Idujas. This applies to Oha Edem and also different levels of Oha in the 3 zones/autonomous communities. \n\nMembership of Oha Edem is based on hereditary positions for the relevant contributing zones/clans/families. Different zones/clans/families have their own rules/criteria for deciding who will be an Oha member. It cannot be decided by people who are not from that zone/clan/family. The process is completely independent and cannot be manipulated. \n\nThere is never a haste in replacing a deceased member/official of Oha. Whenever the zone/clan/family is ready to enthrone a replacement, so shall it be. In the case of the Eze Edem, the same principle of \"never in a haste\" also applies. It is on record that it once took nearly 25 years for a new Eze Edem to ascend the throne after the demise of his predecessor. Easy example, the current Eze Edem ascended the throne on the 16th of July 2009 while his father and predecessor passed away 10 years earlier on the 14th of October 1999. During this vacuum, a Regent was appointed by Oha Edem.\n\nEdem and its cultural/traditional institutions existed long before the Europeans set foot on the shores of modern-day Nigeria. Edem was a sovereign and fully independent traditional state long before the Europeans came into Africa. It continues to maintain that cultural independence till date.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe main economic activity in the kingdom is [[agriculture]]. The people practice [[shifting cultivation]] and [[crop rotation]].\n\n[[Cash Crop|Cash crops]]: kolanuts, oil beans, [[breadfruit]], black-eyed beans, brown beans, yams, cocoyams, [[cowpea]]s, maize, cotton, and groundnuts.\n\nFruits: citrus fruits (tangerines, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and oranges), cashews, avocado pears, guavas, pawpaws, pineapples, bananas, watermelons, mangoes, pears, African star apples, black apples, blue apples, showasho and [[irvingia]](wild mangoes or bush mangoes).\n\nVegetables: light green [[amaranth]], dark green amaranth, ahihara, waterleaves, [[Vernonia|bitterleaves]], pumpkins, [[Eggplant|garden eggs]], [[Telfairia occidentalis|fluted pumpkins]], okra, red chili peppers, yellow chili peppers, [[alligator pepper]]s and black pepper.\n\nDue to the rocky nature of certain parts of Edem, another significant economic activity is the small-scale manual production of stone for construction.\n\nIn March 2020, Walcot Industries Limited, part of Walcot Group, commenced the construction of the Walcot Integrated Industrial Complex in Edem. The industrial estate spans 28.62 hectares of land with a total project cost of \u20a65.7 billion. \n\n== Tourism ==\nNatural features that visitors can view include the Akatakata Waterfalls from Ugwu Ovo (\"Ovo hill\") down to Igoro Agbo, Okpu cave and stream in Nkawushi and a valley from Amaho down to Owa, all in Akpa-Edem.\n\nAnother major tourist attraction is the year-round hunting. The kingdom has large, thick forests where various types of wild animals can be hunted. These forests have some trees that are over a 100 years old.\n\nEdem has a beneficial temperature throughout the year. The lowest temperature is 19&nbsp;\u00b0C (66&nbsp;\u00b0F) and the hottest is 33&nbsp;\u00b0C (91&nbsp;\u00b0F), whether in the rainy season or dry season.\n\n==Festivals==\nThe five main festivals celebrated at different times of the year and, in some cases, on a zone-by-zone basis are as follows: Onunu Edem, Omabe Festival (celebrated in three stages: Uda Omabe, Ulo Omabe and Okiti Omabe), Egba Chukwu, Okputukputu Eze Edem and Edem Week.\n\n==Life and Religion==\nEdem is known for having [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indigene#English indigenes] that live very long, frequently over 100 years.

traditional state in [[Nsukka]] Local Government Area of [[Enugu State]], [[Nigeria]]. A culturally rich, stable traditional political system with institutions of government dating back 900 years, it is one of the oldest civilisations in existence pre-colonial Nigeria. Today, it is made up of three autonomous communities/towns, listed in order of seniority: Akpa-Edem, Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani <ref>Edem Autonomous Communities http://www.ebeano.org/LocalGovernments.html</ref> but unified as a culturally inviolable and indivisible federated entity.\n\nEdem has an area of {{convert|50.492|km2|abbr=on}} with several hills providing stunning views from multiple points.  The population of Edem is 39,633 based on the National Population Commission census conducted in 2006.\n\nEdem shares common borders with [[Obimo]] on the south, [[Nsukka]] on the east, [[Ibagwa Ani]] on the north, and Nrobo on the west.  Towns along the border include Okpuje near Owa and Egu Amegu, Abbi near Egu Amegu Abbi, Ugwuoke Ugwuinyi near Egu Amegu, and Ero Uno near Edem-Ani.\n\nThe people of Edem are from the [[Igala people|Igala]] ethnic group but currently, located in the South East of Nigeria since the division of the country into states and geopolitical zones.
