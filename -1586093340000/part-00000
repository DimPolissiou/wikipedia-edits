The song became popular across Scotland and England towards the end of the reign of [[James I of England|James Vl & I]], and the earliest publication date found is 1651.<ref>\"Broom of the Cowdenknowes\" http://www.kinglaoghaire.com/site/lyrics/song_67.html</ref> The melody was also published as a dance tune, during the same year, in John Playford's first edition of ''[[The Dancing Master|The English Dancing Master]]''.<ref>Playford, John. ''The English Dancing Master'', 81. London, 1651 http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/playford_1651/081small.html</ref>\n\nThroughout the many versions of the popular [[folksong]], there are many lyrical variations, but the plot remain consistent. The shepherdess and stranger fall in love and have an affair. When she becomes pregnant, she is banished from her country. She seeks out her lover, finding him to now be a wealthy lord.

The song became popular across Scotland and England towards the end of the reign of [[James I of England|James Vl & I]], and the earliest publication date found is 1651.<ref>\"Broom of the Cowdenknowes\" http://www.kinglaoghaire.com/site/lyrics/song_67.html</ref> The melody was also published as a dance tune, during the same year, in John Playford's first edition of ''[[The Dancing Master|The English Dancing Master]]''.<ref>Playford, John. ''The English Dancing Master'', 81. London, 1651 http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/playford_1651/081small.html</ref>\n\nThroughout the many versions of the popular [[folksong]], there are many lyrical variations, but the plot remain consistent. The shepherdess and stranger fall in love and have an affair. When she becomes pregnant, she is banished from her country. She seeks out her lover, finding him to now be a wealthy lord. They marry, but she is never truly happy away from her own country, and she pines for \"the bonnie bonnie broom\".\n\nTraditionally, the song is sung from the perspective of the shepherdess.

American [[Greg LeMond]] ({{ct|C.A|1990}}) repeated his 1989 victory in the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], ahead of [[Claudio Chiappucci]] ({{ct|CAR|1990}}) and [[Erik Breukink]] ({{ct|PDM|1990}}).\n\nThe Tour started with a prologue [[time trial]] at the [[Futuroscope]] theme park, won by [[Thierry Marie]] ({{ct|CAS|1990}}). On the first stage, a four-rider group escaped and gained more than ten minutes on the rest of the field. [[Steve Bauer]] ({{ct|MOT|1990}}) became the new leader of the race, but faltered in the Alps as [[Ronan Pensec]] ({{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}}), also from the escape group, took over. Two days later, during a mountain time trial to [[Villard-de-Lans]], the lead passed to Claudio Chiappucci, who had been in the same group as well. Chiappucci fought to hang on to his advantage over defending champion LeMond, but was overtaken in the final time trial on the penultimate stage. It was LeMond's third Tour victory, a feat he achieved without winning an individual stage.\n\nThe [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was won by [[Olaf Ludwig]] ({{ct|PSC|1990}}), while the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]] was won by [[Thierry Claveyrolat]] ({{ct|RMO|1990}}).

Mottet started to drop behind the group of favourites on the Madeleine, while Bernard retired. On the descent, Indur\u00e1in got away but was overtaken by Claveyrolat on the climb of the Glandon. In between the climbs, at the feed zone, LeMond was involved in a crash, but able to carry on.{{sfn|Abt|1991|pp=128\u2013129}} On the Glandon, Delgado accelerated and only LeMond and Bugno were able to follow. Together they caught Indur\u00e1in, who set the tempo in the group through the ensuing valley and ensured that they reached Claveyrolat by the foot of the final climb. Shortly after the group began the ascent, Delgado attacked, with LeMond and Bugno following. As the pace slowed, Claveyrolat, Parra, and Breukink managed to catch back up. {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, Delgado lost contact with Bugno, who accelerated and took LeMond, Breukink, Claveyrolat, and Parra with him. It were Bugno and LeMond who were fastest along the finishing straight, with Bugno coming out on top to win the stage. Breukink finished third, one second behind LeMond in second place.

Chiappucci, without the help of strong teammates, had to lead the chase himself, bringing back the breakaway {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish. Just as the contact was made, a group of ten riders attacked, among them LeMond, Breukink, Indur\u00e1in, and [[Andrew Hampsten]] ({{ct|MOT|1990|nolink=yes}}). At the foot of the last climb of the day, the [[Col de la Croix de Chaubouret]], Delgado led a counter-attack with Bugno and [[Marino Lejarreta]] ({{ct|ONC|1990|nolink=yes}}). Although Indur\u00e1in dropped back to aid Delgado's chase, the LeMond group maintained an advantage of thirty seconds until the finish. Here, Chozas won the sprint from Breukink and Hampsten.

He joined an attack by teammate Claveyrolet at {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, before setting off on his own after a further unsuccessful attempt to form a breakaway. Seventeen more riders caught up to him after {{convert|91|km|mi|abbr=on}}. [[Jean-Claude Bagot]] ({{ct|RMO|1990|nolink=yes}}) then attacked from the lead group with {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} left to ride, but he was caught on the final ascent to [[Causse Noir]] near [[Millau]]. Lejarreta accelerated from the group of favourites with {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} to go, and was followed by Indur\u00e1in and Bugno. At the finish, Lejarreta took victory, but did not raise his arms in celebration, thinking someone had finished ahead of him. 24 seconds later followed Indur\u00e1in and Bugno. LeMond and Breukink finished together, another ten seconds behind. Chiappucci could only finish 13th, losing 13 seconds to LeMond and Breukink, whom he now led by 1:49 minutes in the general classification.

[[Adri van der Poel]] ({{ct|Weinmann|1990}}) launched an attack that resulted in an eleven-rider strong breakaway. This group was almost caught after {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} of racing, but while three riders dropped back into the peloton, eight remained in front and were later joined by several others, who bridged across, including Roche, Mottet, Claveyrolet, and Chozas. The now 19 rider strong group increased their advantage to up to eight minutes, which would have moved Chozas up to fourth place overall. Therefore, the main field began to cut into their advantage, led by {{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}}, {{ct|BAN|1990|nolink=yes}}, and {{ct|PDM|1990|nolink=yes}}. Eventually, Mottet attacked from the lead group and held on to the finish, winning the stage by 2:02 minutes ahead of [[Giuseppe Calcaterra]] ({{ct|Chateau d'Ax|1990|nolink=yes}}). When the peloton reached the finish, a split occurred in the field, which gained Chiappucci three seconds on his rivals in the general classification.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=196\u2013197}}\n\n===Pyrenees===\n[[File:Claudio Chiappucci Tour 1993 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Claudio Chiappucci]] (''pictured at the [[1993 Tour de France]]'') became an unexpected contender for the overall victory.]]\nIn very hot conditions, stage 16 saw the last mountain-top finish of the Tour. In the second half of the stage, the summits of the [[Col d'Aspin]], the [[Col du Tourmalet]], and the final ascent to [[Luz Ardiden]] had to be climbed. On the early slopes of the Aspin, Chiappucci followed an attack by [[J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller (cyclist)|J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller]] ({{ct|TVM|1990|nolink=yes}}) and found himself in a lead group, building an advantage on his rivals. At the summit, he led the group across 45 seconds ahead of the main field. As {{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}} began to chase for LeMond on the approach to the Tourmalet, the gap began to decrease. In the front group, [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez Torres]] ({{ct|ONC|1990|nolink=yes}}) attacked and got away on his own. Behind, in the group of favourites, Breukink experienced a ''jour sans'', a day without energy, and began to fall behind. At the top of the Tourmalet, Chiappucci's lead over LeMond and Delgado was still 1:07 minutes, but in the valley before the final climb, he was caught with {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to go. On the ascent to Luz Ardiden, Chiappucci defiantly set the pace at the front of the group. However, with {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} left to race, an attack by Parra was too much and while LeMond, Indur\u00e1in, and Lejarreta followed, Chiappucci fell behind. LeMond moved to the front and set a devastating pace as Parra was quickly dropped. They then caught the lone leader Mart\u00ednez Torres with {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} to go. Lejarreta was dropped shortly thereafter. For the duration of the climb LeMond worked at the front setting the pace to increase his time gains essentially winning the Tour on this attack. Indur\u00e1in overtook him as they approached the summit and coming around the final turn he quickly snapped his head around to verify LeMond wasn't going to challenge him for the stage win and began clapping his hands in celebration as he claimed the victory six seconds ahead of the [[Americans|American]]. Chiappucci eventually lost 2:19 minutes, which reduced his advantage over LeMond, who was now second overall, to just five seconds. Breukink lost 4:16 minutes, dropping to fourth behind Delgado, who finished 1:32 behind teammate Indur\u00e1in.{{sfn|Abt|1991|pp=170\u2013172}}{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=198\u2013203}}\n{{quote box|quote=I've never seen a descent that fast.

Early on, a 19-man breakaway formed, including riders such as Bauer, Konyshev, [[Ac\u00e1cio da Silva]] ({{ct|CAR|1990|nolink=yes}}), [[Johan Bruyneel]] ({{ct|LTS|1990|nolink=yes}}), as well as LeMond's teammates Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle and [[Atle Kv\u00e5lsvoll]]. On the Aubisque, [[\u00d3scar Vargas (cyclist)|\u00d3scar Vargas]] ({{ct|Postobon|1990|nolink=yes}}) attacked and reached the summit ahead of the lead group. On the Marie-Blanque, the situation had changed and Delgado's {{ct|BAN|1990|nolink=yes}} teammate [[Dominique Arnaud]] led solo over the top, 10:20 minutes ahead of the peloton. LeMond, already troubled by a saddle sore and swollen feet, got into even more trouble: isolated from his teammates, he punctured a tire about {{convert|800|m|yd|abbr=on}} from the summit. With the group of favourites, including yellow jersey Chiappucci, leaving him behind, LeMond had to wait 1:20 minutes for his team car to arrive. The new wheel given to him was rubbing on the frame, which meant that LeMond had to dismount again and change bikes. By now, he crossed the top of the Marie-Blanque 1:27 minutes behind Chiappucci. Teammates [[Eric Boyer]] and [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Simon]] joined him, but had problems keeping up with LeMond during the descent, which he took flat out and without braking in order to catch back up. Duclos-Lassalle and Kv\u00e5lsvoll were ordered by the team to stop and drop back from the lead group to aid LeMond in reaching Chiappucci after {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} of chasing.

After {{convert|153|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the group had swollen to 24 riders. Bontempi, formerly a very good sprinter, but now considered past his prime, attacked from the breakaway and went solo to the finish, where he won the stage, 1:28 ahead of [[Dag Otto Lauritzen]] ({{ct|MOT|1990|nolink=yes}}). During the stage, the Tour circumvented another blockade by sheep farmers, which only managed to hold up the press caravan, but did not influence the race.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=214\u2013216}}\n\nThe individual time trial on the penultimate day, stage 20, became decisive for the race's outcome.

[[Stephen Hodge (cyclist)|Stephen Hodge]] tried to break away in Paris, in an attempt to make up the 16 seconds his {{ct|ONC|1990|nolink=yes}} team trailed {{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}} in the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], but he was not successful. The stage came down to a sprint, won by Museeuw, ahead of [[Adriano Baffi]] ({{ct|ARI|1990|nolink=yes}}) and Olaf Ludwig. It was the only time during that year's Tour that a stage finished in a mass sprint.{{sfn|Abt|1991|p=188}} LeMond crossed the finish line safely in the middle of the field, his arms aloft in celebration at his third overall Tour victory.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=222}}{{sfn|Abt|1990|p=222}} 156 riders out of 198 starters reached the finish in Paris.{{sfn|Bacon|2014|p=190}} In last place, the ''[[lanterne rouge]]'', was [[Rodolfo Massi]] ({{ct|ARI|1990|nolink=yes}}).{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=225}} Four teams managed to reach Paris with all nine riders: {{ct|LTS|1990|nolink=yes}}, {{ct|Postobon|1990|nolink=yes}}, {{ct|MOT|1990|nolink=yes}}, and {{ct|Chateau d'Ax|1990|nolink=yes}}.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=39}}\n\nLeMond had won the Tour without taking a stage win. Since the end of [[World War II]], only [[Roger Walkowiak]] ([[1956 Tour de France|1956]]), [[Gastone Nencini]] ([[1960 Tour de France|1960]]), [[Lucien Aimar]] ([[1966 Tour de France|1966]]) had done so.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=223}}{{sfn|Fife|2000|p=239}} He countered criticism that he had not shown enough fighting spirit by not taking an individual stage, saying: \"If I had worried about individual stage victories, it's possible I would have lost the Tour de France.\"{{sfn|Abt|1991|p=188}} Particular praise was given after the Tour to Miguel Indur\u00e1in, who some speculated could have challenged for the overall victory had he not worked for Delgado, in particular on the stage to Alpe d'Huez, where he lost 12 minutes.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=197}}{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|p=99}}\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThere were four main classifications in the 1990 Tour de France.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013455}} The most important was the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}} Time bonuses were distributed to the first three finishers of each stage that was not a mountain stage or a time trial. The winner received a 20-second time bonus, with 12 seconds for second and eight seconds for third place respectively.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=128\u2013129}} These bonuses were reduced to 12, 8, and 4 seconds on stage 1, since two stages were held on the same day.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=79}} In addition, time bonuses could be won during intermediate sprints during the first half of the race. The first three riders across the line were granted a bonus of 6, 4, and 2 seconds respectively.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=183}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0422-029, Olaf Ludwig.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Olaf Ludwig]] (''pictured at the 1988 [[Peace Race]]'') won the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]].]]\nThe [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was calculated in another way: the first cyclists to finish in a stage received points, based on their rank and the type of stage. Flat stages awarded the winner 35 points, down to one point for 25th place. On medium mountain stages, 25 points were given to the winner, down to one point for 20th place. On a mountainous stage, the first rider across the finish received 20 points, down to one point for 15th place. In time trials, 15 points were given to the winner, down to one point for tenth place.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=154}} All stages, except time trials, also had one or more intermediate sprints, where some points could be won.

The organisation ranked climbs by difficulty, with fourth category being the easiest and ''hors category'' rated the hardest ascents. Points for this classification were won by the cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first. An ''hors category'' climb gave the first rider across 40 points, down to one point for 15th place. First-category mountains awarded 30 points for the first rider, with second-, third-, and fourth-category giving out 20, 10, and 5 points respectively to the first across the summit.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=164}} The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}} Thierry Claveyrolat won the classification with 321 points, while Chiappucci placed second on 179 points.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=226}}\n\nThere was also the [[young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1966 were eligible.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}} Until 1988, the leader of this classification had worn a white jersey, while in 1989, the leader was highlighted by wearing the logo of the [[European Union]] on his shoulder.

The race consisted of 21 stages and a prologue, over a total distance of {{convert|3,403.8|km|0|abbr=on}}. American [[Greg LeMond]] ({{ct|C.A|1990}}) repeated his 1989 victory in the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], ahead of [[Claudio Chiappucci]] ({{ct|CAR|1990}}) and [[Erik Breukink]] ({{ct|PDM|1990}}).\n\nThe Tour started with a prologue [[time trial]] at the [[Futuroscope]] theme park, won by [[Thierry Marie]] ({{ct|CAS|1990}}). On the first stage, a four-rider group escaped and gained more than ten minutes on the rest of the field. [[Steve Bauer]] ({{ct|MOT|1990}}) became the new leader of the race, but faltered in the Alps as [[Ronan Pensec]] ({{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}}), also from the escape group, took over. Two days later, during a mountain time trial to [[Villard-de-Lans]], the lead passed to Claudio Chiappucci, who had been in the same group as well. Chiappucci fought to hang on to his advantage over defending champion LeMond, but was overtaken in the final time trial on the penultimate stage. It was LeMond's third Tour victory, a feat he achieved without winning an individual stage.\n\nThe [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was won by [[Olaf Ludwig]] ({{ct|PSC|1990}}), while the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]] was won by [[Thierry Claveyrolat]] ({{ct|RMO|1990}}). [[Gilles Delion]] ({{ct|HEL|1990}}) was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|best young rider]], while [[Eduardo Chozas]] ({{ct|ONC|1990}}) was awarded the [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|super-combativity prize]]. {{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}}, the team of race winner LeMond, won the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]].\n\nThe 1990 race was the first edition in which riders from [[Eastern bloc]] nations participated. Ludwig became the first rider from [[East Germany]] and [[Dimitri Konyshev]] ({{ct|Alfa Lum|1990}}) the first Soviet rider to win a stage at the Tour.\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and

He recorded a time of 7:49 minutes, four seconds faster than LeMond and [[Ra\u00fal Alcal\u00e1]] ({{ct|PDM|1990|nolink=yes}}) in second and third respectively.

After just {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the first stage, [[Claudio Chiappucci]] ({{ct|CAR|1990|nolink=yes}}) broke away from the field. He had won the mountain classifications at both [[1990 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]] and the Giro d'Italia that year and aimed at getting the jersey early on in the Tour as well.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=112}} He was joined in his breakaway by [[Steve Bauer]] ({{ct|MOT|1990|nolink=yes}}), [[Ronan Pensec]] ({{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}}), and [[Frans Maassen]] ({{ct|RAB|1990|nolink=yes}}).{{sfn|Abt|1991|p=68}} With the team time trial looming in the afternoon, the field allowed the break to draw out an advantage. Additionally, a protest by sheep farmers held up the [[peloton]], the main field, and caused several crashes, including for Delgado. Chiappucci took the points at the mountain sprints, ensuring that he would wear the polka-dot jersey for the next stage. {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, the lead was still at 13 minutes. As Maassen took the stage victory ahead of Pensec, the four-man group still retained an advantage of 10:35 minutes over the rest of the field. Bauer took the lead in the general classification, having posted the fastest time in the prologue.{{sfn|Abt|1991|pp=68\u201370}} Later in the day the team time trial was won by the {{ct|PSC|1990|nolink=yes}} team. Seven seconds slower, {{ct|PDM|1990|nolink=yes}} finished in second place. Fignon's Castorama team finished fifth, 33 seconds slower than Panasonic, but 20 seconds faster than LeMond's Z team, who were seventh.

At this point, [[Moreno Argentin]] ({{ct|ARI|1990|nolink=yes}}) had already attacked and was building an advantage on the rest of the field. He also crashed, but was able to remount and continued to win the stage by 2:29 minutes.

Next, [[S\u00f8ren Lilholt]] ({{ct|Sigma|1990|nolink=yes}}) attacked and was later joined by [[Kurt Steinmann]] ({{ct|Weinmann|1990|nolink=yes}}) and [[William Pulido]] ({{ct|Postob\u00f3n|1990|nolink=yes}}). The escapees enjoyed a maximum advantage of 45 seconds, but were caught with {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} to go. {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} later, the peloton passed through the narrow streets of Villech\u00e8rel, causing a crash and the field to split.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=122\u2013123}} Bugno, Delgado, and Fignon were caught out behind the incident.{{sfn|Abt|1991|p=87}} While Delgado and Bugno lost 21 seconds in the end, Fignon lost 44 seconds to his rivals in the general classification.{{sfn|Fignon|2010|p=225}}{{sfn|Abt|1991|p=89}} At the finish, which for the first time was at [[Mont-Saint-Michel]],{{sfn|Abt|1991|p=88}} Ludwig opened his sprint too early, allowing [[Johan Museeuw]] ({{ct|LTS|1990|nolink=yes}}), who won the stage, and [[Guido Bontempi]] ({{ct|CAR|1990|nolink=yes}}) to pass him.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=123}} Robert Millar was caught up in a crash, losing nine minutes, effectively ruling him out from competing in the general classification.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=193}}\n\nStage 5, by far the longest at {{convert|301|km|mi|abbr=on}}, was run in rainy conditions. As the peloton sped up to catch an early breakaway, Fignon drifted backwards and ultimately abandoned the Tour at the first feeding station. After the breakaway was cuaght, [[Gerrit Solleveld]] ({{ct|RAB|1990|nolink=yes}}) attacked and stayed away, winning the stage 4:27 minutes ahead of Museeuw, who won the sprint of the field.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=125\u2013126}} Argentin, still bruised from his fall on stage 3 and another on stage 5, abandoned after the rest day.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=143}}\n\n===North-east and Jura===\nDuring stage 6, Chiappucci punctured twice, both times at the start of the two ascents of the day. This meant that he was unable to defend his lead in the mountain classification, and the polka-dot jersey went to [[Dimitri Konyshev]] ({{ct|Alfa Lum|1990|nolink=yes}}), who became the first Soviet rider to wear a leader's jersey at the Tour de France. Bugno attacked shortly behind the feed zone, leading to a number of reactions from the field, but after {{convert|173|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the peloton was back together. A small group, containing Museeuw and [[Viatcheslav Ekimov]] ({{ct|PSC|1990|nolink=yes}}), among others, lept away {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish. [[Jelle Nijdam]] ({{ct|RAB|1990|nolink=yes}}) accelerated from this group with {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on}} to go and won the stage, ahead of [[Jesper Skibby]] ({{ct|TVM|1990|nolink=yes}}) and Museeuw.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n[[File:Raul ALCALA (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ra\u00fal Alcal\u00e1]] (''pictured at the [[1993 Tour de France]]'') won the [[time trial]] on stage 7.]]\nStage 7's individual time trial was run in changing conditions. While the early starters competed in the dry, the later riders rode on wet roads. Miguel Indur\u00e1in set an early fast time and held the lead for most of the day. Greg LeMond started fast, but faded later on to eventually finish fifth. [[Ra\u00fal Alcal\u00e1]] ({{ct|PDM|1990|nolink=yes}}), also a late starter, was the fastest, 1:24 ahead of Indur\u00e1in's time. Bugno was third, ahead of Delgado.{{sfn|Abt|1991|p=104}} Of the riders from the stage-1 breakaway, Pensec was fastest, in seventh place. He remained second overall however, 17 seconds behind Bauer, who finished the time trial in 14th place, one place ahead of Chiappucci. Stephen Roche lost 3 minutes in the last {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}}  alone, suffering from [[hyperglycemia]]. Likewise, Charly Mottet lost significant time, finishing three-and-a-half minutes behind Alcal\u00e1.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=147\u2013149}} Alcal\u00e1 moved into fifth place overall, still more than seven minutes behind Bauer.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=193}}\n\nEarly during stage 8, a four-man breakaway went ahead, but was quickly caught. The speed of the peloton saw [[\u00c1lvaro Pino]] ({{ct|Seur|1990|nolink=yes}}), winner of the [[1986 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], abandon the race. [[Michel Vermote]] ({{ct|RMO|1990|nolink=yes}}) then attacked after {{convert|33|km|mi|abbr=on}} on a section of cobbled road. His maximum lead was over 11 minutes, but after about {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} on his own, he was brought back by the main field.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=150\u2013151}} In the final {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}, a group of 13 riders escaped, including Ludwig and Museeuw. Ludwig judged his sprint well this time and beat Museeuw for the win.{{sfn|Abt|1991|pp=109\u2013110}} It was the first stage victory by a rider from [[East Germany]] and from the Eastern bloc in the Tour de France.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|p=152}}\n\nStage 9 headed into Switzerland and was the last day that featured rain, before temperatures began to rise significantly. An escape group went clear after {{convert|74|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which included Frans Maassen, who was still in fourth place overall. This prompted Bauer's {{ct|MOT|1990|nolink=yes}} team to chase, bringing the group back after {{convert|44|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At the C\u00f4te des Rousses, the first second-category climb of the Tour, [[Massimo Ghirotto]] ({{ct|CAR|1990|nolink=yes}}) and [[Eduardo Chozas]] ({{ct|ONC|1990|nolink=yes}}) were out in front alone. On the same climb, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bernard]] ({{ct|LVC|1990|nolink=yes}}), third in the 1987 Tour, fell behind and out of contention.

On the first climb of the day, the [[Col de la Colombi\u00e8re]], [[Omar Hern\u00e1ndez]] ({{ct|Postobon|1990|nolink=yes}}) attacked, followed by [[Thierry Claveyrolat]] ({{ct|RMO|1991|nolink=yes}}). As Hern\u00e1ndez slowed, Claveyrolat took over and continued on alone, riding the rest of the stage on his own to take victory.

Two mountains had to be crossed beforehand: the [[Col de la Madeleine]] and the [[Col du Glandon]]. Claveyrolat attacked again, early on during the ascent of the Madeleine, and gathered the mountain points at the summit. Mottet started to drop behind the group of favourites on the Madeleine, while Bernard retired. On the descent, Indur\u00e1in got away but was overtaken by Claveyrolat on the climb of the Glandon. In between the climbs, at the feed zone, LeMond was involved in a crash, but able to carry on.{{sfn|Abt|1991|pp=128\u2013129}} On the Glandon, Delgado accelerated and only LeMond and Bugno were able to follow. Together they caught Indur\u00e1in, who set the tempo in the group through the ensuing valley and ensured that they reached Claveyrolat by the foot of the final climb. Shortly after the group began the ascent, Delgado attacked, with LeMond and Bugno following. As the pace slowed, Claveyrolat, Parra, and Breukink managed to catch back up. {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, Delgado lost contact with Bugno, who accelerated and took LeMond, Breukink, Claveyrolat, and Parra with him. It were Bugno and LeMond who were fastest along the finishing straight, with Bugno coming out on top to win the stage. Breukink finished third, one second behind LeMond in second place. Meanwhile, Millar paced Pensec up the climb, who finished 48 seconds behind Bugno and retained the race lead.{{sfn|Vespini|2008|pp=100\u2013102}} Delgado lost forty seconds, while Indur\u00e1in, exhausted by his work on the flat, lost 12 minutes on Alpe d'Huez, falling from contention.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|pp=101\u2013102}} Chiappucci finished 1:48 minutes behind Bugno.

[[Phil Anderson (cyclist)|Phil Anderson]] ({{ct|TVM|1990}}) led down the descent from Villard-de-Lans, followed by Mottet, which prompted a reaction by the main field and both riders were brought back after {{convert|33|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Several attempts to form lasting breakaways followed, but it took until the climb of the C\u00f4te d'Ardoix at {{convert|33|km|mi|abbr=on}} for a thirty-rider group to get away, including Pensec and Claveyrolat. Chiappucci, without the help of strong teammates, had to lead the chase himself, bringing back the breakaway {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish. Just as the contact was made, a group of ten riders attacked, among them LeMond, Breukink, Indur\u00e1in, and [[Andrew Hampsten]] ({{ct|MOT|1990|nolink=yes}}). At the foot of the last climb of the day, the [[Col de la Croix de Chaubouret]], Delgado led a counter-attack with Bugno and [[Marino Lejarreta]] ({{ct|ONC|1990|nolink=yes}}). Although Indur\u00e1in dropped back to aid Delgado's chase, the LeMond group maintained an advantage of thirty seconds until the finish. Here, Chozas won the sprint from Breukink and Hampsten. A group containing Alcal\u00e1, Roche, and Parra lost 3:09 minutes. Chiappucci came in with the peloton, losing 4:53 minutes. Pensec dropped from second to fourth in the general classification, arriving 7:47 minutes after Chozas. Chiappucci now led the race by 2:02 minutes over Breukink, with LeMond third at 2:34.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=190\u2013192}}{{sfn|Abt|1991|pp=154\u2013156}}\n[[File:Marino Lejarreta.jpg|thumb|[[Marino Lejarreta]] (''pictured in 1987'') won stage 14, making it two victories in a row for the {{ct|ONC|1990}} team.]]\nDuring the early part of stage 14, [[Jean-Claude Colotti]] ({{ct|RMO|1990|nolink=yes}}) was highly active. He joined an attack by teammate Claveyrolet at {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, before setting off on his own after a further unsuccessful attempt to form a breakaway. Seventeen more riders caught up to him after {{convert|91|km|mi|abbr=on}}. [[Jean-Claude Bagot]] ({{ct|RMO|1990|nolink=yes}}) then attacked from the lead group with {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} left to ride, but he was caught on the final ascent to [[Causse Noir]] near [[Millau]]. Lejarreta accelerated from the group of favourites with {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} to go, and was followed by Indur\u00e1in and Bugno. At the finish, Lejarreta took victory, but did not raise his arms in celebration, thinking someone had finished ahead of him. 24 seconds later followed Indur\u00e1in and Bugno. LeMond and Breukink finished together, another ten seconds behind. Chiappucci could only finish 13th, losing 13 seconds to LeMond and Breukink, whom he now led by 1:49 minutes in the general classification. Lejarreta moved up to seventh place overall.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=194\u2013196}}{{sfn|Abt|1991|pp=160\u2013161}}\n\nStage 15 was a transition stage, the last before the Pyrenees, and featured only smaller climbs. [[Adri van der Poel]] ({{ct|Weinmann|1990}}) launched an attack that resulted in an eleven-rider strong breakaway. This group was almost caught after {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} of racing, but while three riders dropped back into the peloton, eight remained in front and were later joined by several others, who bridged across, including Roche, Mottet, Claveyrolet, and Chozas. The now 19 rider strong group increased their advantage to up to eight minutes, which would have moved Chozas up to fourth place overall. Therefore, the main field began to cut into their advantage, led by {{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}}, {{ct|BAN|1990|nolink=yes}}, and {{ct|PDM|1990|nolink=yes}}. Eventually, Mottet attacked from the lead group and held on to the finish, winning the stage by 2:02 minutes ahead of [[Giuseppe Calcaterra]] ({{ct|Chateau d'Ax|1990|nolink=yes}}). When the peloton reached the finish, a split occurred in the field, which gained Chiappucci three seconds on his rivals in the general classification.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=196\u2013197}}\n\n===Pyrenees===\n[[File:Claudio Chiappucci Tour 1993 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Claudio Chiappucci]] (''pictured at the [[1993 Tour de France]]'') became an unexpected contender for the overall victory.]]\nIn very hot conditions, stage 16 saw the last mountain-top finish of the Tour. In the second half of the stage, the summits of the [[Col d'Aspin]], the [[Col du Tourmalet]], and the final ascent to [[Luz Ardiden]] had to be climbed. On the early slopes of the Aspin, Chiappucci followed an attack by [[J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller (cyclist)|J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller]] ({{ct|TVM|1990|nolink=yes}}) and found himself in a lead group, building an advantage on his rivals. At the summit, he led the group across 45 seconds ahead of the main field. As {{ct|C.A|1990|nolink=yes}} began to chase for LeMond on the approach to the Tourmalet, the gap began to decrease. In the front group, [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez Torres]] ({{ct|ONC|1990|nolink=yes}}) attacked and got away on his own. Behind, in the group of favourites, Breukink experienced a ''jour sans'', a day without energy, and began to fall behind. At the top of the Tourmalet, Chiappucci's lead over LeMond and Delgado was still 1:07 minutes, but in the valley before the final climb, he was caught with {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to go. On the ascent to Luz Ardiden, Chiappucci defiantly set the pace at the front of the group. However, with {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} left to race, an attack by Parra was too much and while LeMond, Indur\u00e1in, and Lejarreta followed, Chiappucci fell behind. LeMond moved to the front and set a devastating pace as Parra was quickly dropped. They then caught the lone leader Mart\u00ednez Torres with {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} to go. Lejarreta was dropped shortly thereafter. For the duration of the climb LeMond worked at the front setting the pace to increase his time gains essentially winning the Tour on this attack. Indur\u00e1in overtook him as they approached the summit and coming around the final turn he quickly snapped his head around to verify LeMond wasn't going to challenge him for the stage win and began clapping his hands in celebration as he claimed the victory six seconds ahead of the [[American]]. Chiappucci eventually lost 2:19 minutes, which reduced his advantage over LeMond, who was now second overall, to just five seconds. Breukink lost 4:16 minutes, dropping to fourth behind Delgado, who finished 1:32 behind teammate Indur\u00e1in.{{sfn|Abt|1991|pp=170\u2013172}}{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=198\u2013203}}\n{{quote box|quote=I've never seen a descent that fast.

Early on, a 19-man breakaway formed, including riders such as Bauer, Konyshev, [[Ac\u00e1cio da Silva]] ({{ct|CAR|1990|nolink=yes}}), [[Johan Bruyneel]] ({{ct|LTS|1990|nolink=yes}}), as well as LeMond's teammates Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle and [[Atle Kv\u00e5lsvoll]]. On the Aubisque, [[\u00d3scar Vargas (cyclist)|\u00d3scar Vargas]] ({{ct|Postobon|1990|nolink=yes}}) attacked and reached the summit ahead of the lead group. On the Marie-Blanque, the situation had changed and Delgado's {{ct|BAN|1990|nolink=yes}} teammate [[Dominique Arnaud]] led solo over the top, 10:20 minutes ahead of the peloton. LeMond, already troubled by a saddle sore and swollen feet, got into even more trouble: isolated from his teammates, he punctured a tire about {{convert|800|m|yd|abbr=on}} from the summit. With the group of favourites, including yellow jersey Chiappucci, leaving him behind, LeMond had to wait 1:20 minutes for his team car to arrive. The new wheel given to him was rubbing on the frame, which meant that LeMond had to dismount again and change bikes. By now, he crossed the top of the Marie-Blanque 1:27 minutes behind Chiappucci. Teammates [[Eric Boyer]] and [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Simon]] joined him, but had problems keeping up with LeMond during the descent, which he took flat out and without braking in order to catch back up. Duclos-Lassalle and Kv\u00e5lsvoll were ordered by the team to stop and drop back from the lead group to aid LeMond in reaching Chiappucci after {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} of chasing. Up ahead, Bruyneel attacked from the lead group and was followed by Konyshev, who got the better of the Belgian in the two-man sprint for the stage victory. It was the first time that a Soviet or Russian rider had won a stage of the Tour de France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-18/sports/sp-843_1_17th-stage|title=Tour de France: LeMond Has Flat as Konyshev Wins 17th Stage|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=18 July 1990 |access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref>{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=203\u2013205}}{{sfn|Abt|1990|pp=219\u2013220}}{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=195\u2013196}} LeMond accused Chiappucci of violating the unwritten rules of the sport, where traditionally a leader is not attacked if they have a crash or mechanical difficulties.

The field started the day slowly and a real attack did not materialise until Anderson broke away after {{convert|139|km|mi|abbr=on}}. He was soon joined by six other riders, but the break was caught {{convert|34|km|mi|abbr=on}} later. With {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to go, a more serious move formed, with 19 riders, which included LeMond, Chiappucci, Breukink, Bugno, and Alcal\u00e1. At {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} remaining, Breukink, Bugno, and the latter's teammate, [[Roberto Gusmeroli]], attacked from the leading group. The other 16 riders fell behind and were soon caught by the main field. At the finish, Gusmeroli led out Bugno, who easily beat Breukink to become the first rider to win two stages at that year's Tour. Breukink meanwhile gained 18 seconds on Delgado and therefore moved into third place overall.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=212\u2013214}}{{sfn|Abt|1991|p=181}}\n\nThe next day, the peloton equally made a slow start to the stage, with the first real attack coming more than halfway into the race, after {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

After {{convert|153|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the group had swollen to 24 riders. Bontempi, formerly a very good sprinter, but now considered past his prime, attacked from the breakaway and went solo to the finish, where he won the stage, 1:28 ahead of [[Dag Otto Lauritzen]] ({{ct|MOT|1990|nolink=yes}}). During the stage, the Tour circumvented another blockade by sheep farmers, which only managed to hold up the press caravan, but did not influence the race.{{sfn|Nicholson|1991|pp=214\u2013216}}\n\nThe individual time trial on the penultimate day, stage 20, became decisive for the race's outcome.

Located on the [[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|U.S. Route 77]] corridor between [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] and [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]], Kingsville is the principal city of the [[Kingsville, Texas micropolitan area|Kingsville Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which is part of the larger [[Corpus Christi-Kingsville Combined Statistical Area]]. The population was 26,213 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], and in 2018 the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population at 25,487.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n\nNamed in honor of [[Richard King (entrepreneur)|Richard King]], Kingsville's first buildings were constructed in 1904 along the newly completed, now defunct, [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] line, adjacent to the famous [[King Ranch]].  The city was incorporated in 1913.<ref name=\"TSHA\">{{cite web|title=Kingsville, TX|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdk02|website=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> It is home to [[Texas A&M University-Kingsville]], a member of the [[Texas A&M University System]], and [[Naval Air Station Kingsville]], one of the U.S. Navy\u2019s two locations for [[United States Naval Aviator#Strike syllabus|jet aviation training]].\n\n==History==\nWith the continued growth of the [[King Ranch]] in the mid to late 19th century, the desire for a railroad through the region increased, both to connect the communities of the [[Rio Grande Valley]] to the rest of [[Texas]], and to serve the King Ranch. At the turn of the 20th century, [[Henrietta King]] deeded a portion of the ranch to entice the construction of a town and to bring the railroad adjacent to the ranch.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> Robert Justus Kleberg, Jr., the ranch manager, formed the Kleberg Town and Improvement Company in 1903, tasked with planning and constructing the town.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> In 1904, the community was planned three miles from the King Ranch headquarters and was named in honor of the founder of the King Ranch, [[Richard King (entrepreneur)|Richard King]]. That same year, construction of the [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] reached Kingsville, and the first train passed through the town on July 4, 1904, considered the founding date of the city. Kingsville's first post office was also established that year.<ref name=\"KVGS\">{{cite web|title=About Kingsville|url=http://www.cityofkingsville.com/visit/about-kingsville/|website=City of Kingsville|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911, the city was incorporated and the first city government was established. Two years later, in 1913, Kingsville was named the county seat of the newly established [[Kleberg County]].<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> Around 1920, oil and natural gas were discovered near Kingsville, leading to the city's first population boom.<ref name=\"TXES\">{{cite web |title=Kingsville, Texas |url=http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasGulfCoastTowns/Kingsville-Texas.htm |website=TexasEscapes |publisher=Texas Escapes |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> In 1925, the South Texas Teachers College opened, later changing its name in 1929 to the Texas College of Arts and Industries (Texas A&I). The school went on to adopt its current name, [[Texas A&M University-Kingsville]] when it joined in the [[Texas A&M University System]] in 1993.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> In 1942, the U.S. Navy opened a training airfield, [[Naval Air Station Kingsville]] to the east of town, which after a brief period of closure following World War II, has remained open to this day and is one of two major Naval Aviation jet training facilities for the Navy.<ref name=\"TXES\" /> \n\nSeveral major industries have called Kingsville home throughout the city's history. In 1944, the [[Celanese Corporation]] opened a plant north of Kingsville that is still in operation today.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> In the early 1960s, Humble Oil and Refining Company, now known as [[Exxon]], relocated a district office to Kingsville due to the city's close proximity to nearby oil fields.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> Population steadily increased in Kingsville, peaking at just under 30,000 residents in the mid 1980s.<ref name=\"TXES\" />  Since that time, the city has experienced an mild economic slump, with the the closing of Exxon's district office, decreased enrollment at the university, and the decreased economic impact of the petroleum industry all cited as factors for the city's decline.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> \n\n==Geography==\nKingsville is located in [[South Texas]], approximately 33 miles (54&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], 91 miles (146&nbsp;km) north of [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]] and 101 miles (163&nbsp;km) east of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2010, the city has a total area of {{convert|13.9|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|13.8|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi}} (0.22%) is water. Kingsville is located in the geographic [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] region of the United States, known as the [[Texas Coastal Bend|Coastal Bend]] in Texas, bordered by the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Baffin Bay]] to the east, and the South Texas Plains or brush country to the north, west and south.

The population was 26,213 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], and in 2018 the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population at 25,487.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n\nNamed in honor of [[Richard King (entrepreneur)|Richard King]], Kingsville's first buildings were constructed in 1904 along the newly completed, now defunct, [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] line, adjacent to the famous [[King Ranch]].  The city was incorporated in 1913.<ref name=\"TSHA\">{{cite web|title=Kingsville, TX|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdk02|website=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> It is home to [[Texas A&M University-Kingsville]], a member of the [[Texas A&M University System]], and [[Naval Air Station Kingsville]], one of the U.S. Navy\u2019s two locations for [[United States Naval Aviator#Strike syllabus|jet aviation training]].\n\n==History==\nWith the continued growth of the [[King Ranch]] in the mid to late 19th century, the desire for a railroad through the region increased, both to connect the communities of the [[Rio Grande Valley]] to the rest of [[Texas]], and to serve the King Ranch. At the turn of the 20th century, [[Henrietta King]] deeded a portion of the ranch to entice the construction of a town and to bring the railroad adjacent to the ranch.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> Robert Justus Kleberg, Jr., the ranch manager, formed the Kleberg Town and Improvement Company in 1903, tasked with planning and constructing the town.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> In 1904, the community was planned three miles from the King Ranch headquarters and was named in honor of the founder of the King Ranch, [[Richard King (entrepreneur)|Richard King]]. That same year, construction of the [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] reached Kingsville, and the first train passed through the town on July 4, 1904, considered the founding date of the city. Kingsville's first post office was also established that year.<ref name=\"KVGS\">{{cite web|title=About Kingsville|url=http://www.cityofkingsville.com/visit/about-kingsville/|website=City of Kingsville|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911, the city was incorporated and the first city government was established. Two years later, in 1913, Kingsville was named the county seat of the newly established [[Kleberg County]].<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> Around 1920, oil and natural gas were discovered near Kingsville, leading to the city's first population boom.<ref name=\"TXES\">{{cite web |title=Kingsville, Texas |url=http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasGulfCoastTowns/Kingsville-Texas.htm |website=TexasEscapes |publisher=Texas Escapes |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> In 1925, the South Texas Teachers College opened, later changing its name in 1929 to the Texas College of Arts and Industries (Texas A&I). The school went on to adopt its current name, [[Texas A&M University-Kingsville]] when it joined in the [[Texas A&M University System]] in 1993.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> In 1942, the U.S. Navy opened a training airfield, [[Naval Air Station Kingsville]] to the east of town, which after a brief period of closure following World War II, has remained open to this day and is one of two major Naval Aviation jet training facilities for the Navy.<ref name=\"TXES\" /> \n\nSeveral major industries have called Kingsville home throughout the city's history. In 1944, the [[Celanese Corporation]] opened a plant north of Kingsville that is still in operation today.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> In the early 1960s, Humble Oil and Refining Company, now known as [[Exxon]], relocated a district office to Kingsville due to the city's close proximity to nearby oil fields.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> Population steadily increased in Kingsville, peaking at just under 30,000 residents in the mid 1980s.<ref name=\"TXES\" />  Since that time, the city has experienced an mild economic slump, with the the closing of Exxon's district office, decreased enrollment at the university, and the decreased economic impact of the petroleum industry all cited as factors for the city's decline.<ref name=\"TSHA\" /> \n\n==Geography==\nKingsville is located in [[South Texas]], approximately 33 miles (54&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], 91 miles (146&nbsp;km) north of [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]] and 101 miles (163&nbsp;km) east of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]].

It is also a [[demonym]] for people from Birmingham. It is often erroneously used in referring to all accents of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]],{{sfnp|Elmes|2006|p=130}} as it is markedly distinct from the [[Black Country dialect|traditional accent]] of the adjacent [[Black Country]] but modern-day population mobility has tended to blur the distinction. For instance, [[Dudley]]-born comedian [[Lenny Henry]], [[Walsall]]-born rock musician [[Noddy Holder]], [[Smethwick]]-reared actress [[Julie Walters]], [[Wollaston, West Midlands|Wollaston]]-born soap actress [[Jan Pearson]] and [[West Bromwich]]-born comedian [[Frank Skinner]], are sometimes mistaken for Brummie-speakers by people outside the West Midlands county.\n\nAdditionally, population mobility has meant that to a degree, the Brummie accent extends into some parts of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]], but much of the accent within the borough might be considered to be closer to contemporary RP. For example, [[Solihull]]-born presenter [[Richard Hammond]] (despite often being referred to as a Brummie) does not speak with a strong Brummie accent but is identifiably from the West Midlands.\n\nThe Brummie accent and the [[Coventry#Accent|Coventry accent]] are also quite distinct in their differences, despite only {{convert|19|mi|km}} separating the cities. To the untrained ear, however, all of these accents may sound very similar, just as British English speakers may find it hard to distinguish between different [[Canadian English|Canadian]] and [[American English|American]] accents or Australian and New Zealand accents.\n\n==Name==\nThe term ''Brummie'' derives from ''[[Brummagem]]'' or ''Bromwichham'', which are historical variants of the name Birmingham.\n\n==Accent==\nThe strength of a person's accent varies greatly all across Birmingham.{{sfnp|Elmes|2006|p=130}} Like most cities, the accent changes relative to the area of the city. A common misconception is that everyone in Birmingham speaks the same accent. It could be argued Brummie is an accent rather than a dialect as in Black Country, which is a dialect with unique words and phrases, as in owamya? for ''how are you'', which many comment is not used in Brummie speech. Similarly, Brummies pronounce ''I'' as 'oy' whereas Black Country uses the dialect 'Ah' as in 'Ah bin' meaning I have been.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Thorne|2003}} has said that the accent is \"a dialectal hybrid of northern, southern, [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[Warwickshire]], [[Staffordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]] speech\", also with elements from the languages and dialects of its [[British Asian|Asian]] and [[British Afro-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] communities.\n\nThere are also differences between Brummie and [[Black Country]] accents, which are not readily apparent to people from outside the West Midlands.{{sfnp|Elmes|2006|p=130}} A Black Country accent and a Birmingham accent can be hard to distinguish if neither accent is that broad. Phonetician [[John C. Wells|John Wells]] has admitted that he cannot tell any difference between the accents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2011/06/black-country.html|title=The Black Country|last=Wells|first=John|date=13 June 2011|website=John Wells\u2019s phonetic blog|publisher=Blogspot|accessdate=18 May 2014|quote=I have a terrible confession to make.

He alleges that overseas visitors, in contrast, find it \"lilting and melodious\", and from this claims that such dislike is driven by various linguistic myths and social factors peculiar to the UK (\"social [[snobbery]], negative media [[stereotyping]], the poor public image of the City of Birmingham, and the north/south geographical and linguistic divide\").\n\nFor instance, despite the city's cultural and innovative history, its industrial background (as depicted by the [[arm-and-hammer symbol|arm-and-hammer]] in [[Coat of arms of Birmingham|Birmingham's coat of arms]]) has led to a muscular and unintelligent stereotype: a \"Brummagem screwdriver\" is UK slang for a hammer.<ref name=\"Partridge2006\">{{cite book|author=Eric Partridge|title=A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAjyQdFwh4UC&pg=PA142|date=2 May 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-96365-2|page=142}}</ref>\n\nThorne also cites the mass media and entertainment industry where actors, usually non-Birmingham, have used inaccurate accents and/or portrayed negative roles.\n\nAdvertisements are another medium where many perceive stereotypes. Journalist Lydia Stockdale, writing in the [[Birmingham Post]], commented on advertisers' association of Birmingham accents with pigs: the pig in the ad for Colman's Potato Bakes, [[Nick Park]]'s [[Hells Angel]] Pigs for [[Centrica|British Gas]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s \"Dave the window-cleaner pig\" all had Brummie accents.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stockdale|first=Lydia|date=2 December 2004|title=Pig ignorant about the Brummie accent|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Perspective:+Pig+ignorant+about+the+Brummie+accent%3B+Lydia+Stockdale...-a0125619689|work=Birmingham Post|access-date=23 May 2010|via=The Free Library}}</ref> In 2003, a [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax]] bank advertisement featuring [[Howard Brown (Halifax Bank)|Howard Brown]], a Birmingham- born and based employee, was replaced by an animated version with an exaggerated comical accent overdubbed by a [[Cockney]] actor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ezard|first=John|date=20 January 2003|title=Face of the Halifax given a makeover ... and a cockney's voiceover|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jan/20/advertising.uknews|work=The Guardian|access-date=23 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Pronunciation==\n{{IPA notice|section}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Phoneme\n!Brummie\n!example\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u00e6/}}\n|{{IPA|[a]}}\n|''trap''\n|-\n|{{IPA|/a\u028a/}}\n|{{IPA|[\u00e6\u028a~\u00e6\u0259]}}\n|''mouth''\n|-\n|{{IPA|/e\u026a/}}\n|{{IPA|[a\u026a]}}\n|''face''\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0259\u028a/}}\n|{{IPA|[\u028c\u028a]}}\n|''goat''\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u028c/}}\n|{{IPA|[\u028a]}}\n|''strut''\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u028a/}}\n|{{IPA|[\u028a]}}\n|''foot''\n|-\n|{{IPA|/\u0254r/}}\n|{{IPA|[\u028c\u028a\u0259]}}\n|''force''\n|}\n\nUrszula Clark has proposed the FACE vowel as a difference between Birmingham and Black Country pronunciation, with Birmingham speakers' using /\u028c\u026a/ and Black Country speakers' using /\u00e6\u026a/.<ref>Handbook of Varieties of English, Mouton de Gruyter, 2004, page 148</ref>  She also mentions that Black Country speakers are more likely to use /\u026a\u028a/ where most other accents use /ju\u02d0/ (in words such as new, Hugh, stew, etc.).<ref>Handbook of Varieties of English, Mouton de Gruyter, 2004, page 151</ref> This /\u026a\u028a/ is also present in some North American dialects for words like ''eww'', ''grew'', ''new'' ''due'', etc., contrasting with /u/ (words like ''boo'', ''zoo'', ''to'', ''too'', ''moon'', ''dune'' etc.). Other North American dialects may use /ju/ for this purpose, or even make no distinction at all.\n\nBelow are some common features of a recognisable Brummie accent (a given speaker may not necessarily use all, or use a feature consistently). The letters enclosed in square brackets{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|[]}}{{spaced ndash}}use the [[Help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]].  The corresponding example words in italics are spelt so that a reader using [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) can approximate the sounds.\n\n* The vowel of ''mouth'' (RP {{IPA|[a\u028a]}}) can be {{IPA|[\u00e6\u028a]}} or {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0259]}}\n* The vowel of ''goat'' (RP {{IPA|[\u0259\u028a]}}) can be close to {{IPA|[\u0251\u028a]}} (so to an RP speaker, ''goat'' may sound like \"gout\")\n* Final unstressed {{IPA|/i/}}, as in ''happy'', may be realised as {{IPA|[\u0259i]}}, though this varies considerably between speakers\n* The letters ''ng'' often represent {{IPA|/\u014b\u0261/}} where RP has just {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (e.g. ''singer'' as {{IPA|[si\u014b\u0261\u0259]}}). See [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#NG-coalescence|\"ng\"-coalescence]]\n* Both the vowels of ''strut'' and ''foot'' are pronounced {{IPA|[\u028a]}}, as in northern England.

It has been used as the title of the autobiographical book and musical play about the Birmingham childhood of radio presenter and entertainer [[Malcolm Stent]]\n; Mom : the common variation of the word \"Mum\" \n; Our kid : used to refer to siblings (as in \"Our kid fell off his bike.\") Also commonly used in the [[English language in Northern England|north of England]].\n; Our wench : affectionate term, meaning 'sister' or sometimes used by a husband referring to his wife; derived from the older 16th and 17th meaning of \"woman\"\n; The outdoor : exclusive West Midlands term for off-licence\n; Pop : another word for a carbonated drink, e.g. '' \"Do you want a glass of pop?\". '' (common in other parts of England)\n; Snap : food, a meal, allegedly derived from the act of eating itself (example usage ''\"I'm off to get my snap\"'' equates to ''\"I'm leaving to get my dinner\"'').

It is also a [[demonym]] for people from Birmingham. It is often erroneously used in referring to all accents of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]],{{sfnp|Elmes|2006|p=130}} as it is markedly distinct from the [[Black Country dialect|traditional accent]] of the adjacent [[Black Country]] but modern-day population mobility has tended to blur the distinction. For instance, [[Dudley]]-born comedian [[Lenny Henry]], [[Walsall]]-born rock musician [[Noddy Holder]], [[Smethwick]]-reared actress [[Julie Walters]], [[Wollaston, West Midlands|Wollaston]]-born soap actress [[Jan Pearson]] and [[West Bromwich]]-born comedian [[Frank Skinner]], are sometimes mistaken for Brummie-speakers by people outside the West Midlands county.\n\nAdditionally, population mobility has meant that to a degree, the Brummie accent extends into some parts of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]], but much of the accent within the borough might be considered to be closer to contemporary RP. For example, [[Solihull]]-born presenter [[Richard Hammond]] (despite often being referred to as a Brummie) does not speak with a strong Brummie accent but is identifiably from the West Midlands.\n\nThe Brummie accent and the [[Coventry#Accent|Coventry accent]] are also quite distinct in their differences, despite only {{convert|19|mi|km}} separating the cities. To the untrained ear, however, all of these accents may sound very similar, just as British English speakers may find it hard to distinguish between different [[Canadian English|Canadian]] and [[American|American]] accents or Australian and New Zealand accents.\n\n==Name==\nThe term ''Brummie'' derives from ''[[Brummagem]]'' or ''Bromwichham'', which are historical variants of the name Birmingham.\n\n==Accent==\nThe strength of a person's accent varies greatly all across Birmingham.{{sfnp|Elmes|2006|p=130}} Like most cities, the accent changes relative to the area of the city. A common misconception is that everyone in Birmingham speaks the same accent. It could be argued Brummie is an accent rather than a dialect as in Black Country, which is a dialect with unique words and phrases, as in owamya? for ''how are you'', which many comment is not used in Brummie speech. Similarly, Brummies pronounce ''I'' as 'oy' whereas Black Country uses the dialect 'Ah' as in 'Ah bin' meaning I have been.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Thorne|2003}} has said that the accent is \"a dialectal hybrid of northern, southern, [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[Warwickshire]], [[Staffordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]] speech\", also with elements from the languages and dialects of its [[British Asian|Asian]] and [[British Afro-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] communities.\n\nThere are also differences between Brummie and [[Black Country]] accents, which are not readily apparent to people from outside the West Midlands.{{sfnp|Elmes|2006|p=130}} A Black Country accent and a Birmingham accent can be hard to distinguish if neither accent is that broad. Phonetician [[John C. Wells|John Wells]] has admitted that he cannot tell any difference between the accents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2011/06/black-country.html|title=The Black Country|last=Wells|first=John|date=13 June 2011|website=John Wells\u2019s phonetic blog|publisher=Blogspot|accessdate=18 May 2014|quote=I have a terrible confession to make.

He alleges that overseas visitors, in contrast, find it \"lilting and melodious\", and from this claims that such dislike is driven by various linguistic myths and social factors peculiar to the UK (\"social [[snobbery]], negative media [[stereotyping]], the poor public image of the City of Birmingham, and the north/south geographical and linguistic divide\").\n\nFor instance, despite the city's cultural and innovative history, its industrial background (as depicted by the [[arm-and-hammer symbol|arm-and-hammer]] in [[Coat of arms of Birmingham|Birmingham's coat of arms]]) has led to a muscular and unintelligent stereotype: a \"Brummagem screwdriver\" is UK slang for a hammer.<ref name=\"Partridge2006\">{{cite book|author=Eric Partridge|title=A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAjyQdFwh4UC&pg=PA142|date=2 May 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-96365-2|page=142}}</ref>\n\nThorne also cites the mass media and entertainment industry where actors, usually non-Birmingham, have used inaccurate accents and/or portrayed negative roles.\n\nAdvertisements are another medium where many perceive stereotypes.

Other North American dialects may use /ju/ for this purpose, or even make no distinction at all.\n\nBelow are some common features of a recognisable Brummie accent (a given speaker may not necessarily use all, or use a feature consistently).

It has been used as the title of the autobiographical book and musical play about the Birmingham childhood of radio presenter and entertainer [[Malcolm Stent]]\n; Mom : the common variation of the word \"Mum\" \n; Our kid : used to refer to siblings (as in \"Our kid fell off his bike.\") Also commonly used in the [[English language in Northern England|north of England]].\n; Our wench : affectionate term, meaning 'sister' or sometimes used by a husband referring to his wife; derived from the older 16th and 17th meaning of \"woman\"\n; The outdoor : exclusive West Midlands term for off-licence\n; Pop : another word for a carbonated drink, e.g. '' \"Do you want a glass of pop?\". '' (common in other parts of England)\n; Snap : food, a meal, allegedly derived from the act of eating itself (example usage ''\"I'm off to get my snap\"'' equates to ''\"I'm leaving to get my dinner\"''). May also refer to the tin containing lunch, a \"snap tin\", as taken down the pit by miners\n; Scrage: a scratched cut, where skin is sliced off. For example, ''\"I fell over and badly scraged my knee\"''\n; Suff : another word for drain, as in ''\"put it down the suff\"''\n; Throw a wobbly : to become sulky or have a tantrum (not unique to Birmingham, common in Australia)\n; Trap : to leave suddenly, or flee\n; Up the cut : up the canal (not unique to Birmingham)\n; Yampy : mad, daft, barmy. Many from Black Country believe ''yampy'' originates from their region, from the Dudley-Tipton area, which has been appropriated and claimed as their own by both Birmingham and Coventry dialects. However, the word is found in areas of the Black Country, both outside Birmingham and Tipton/Dudley which therefore might have been a general term used in south Staffordshire and north Worcestershire areas.\n\n==Notable speakers==\n[[File:Ozzy on tour in Japan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ozzy Osbourne]] is known for his Brummie accent.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC|date=22 September 2014|title=Why is the Birmingham accent so difficult to mimic?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29307916|work=BBC News|access-date=12 December 2016}}</ref>]]\nExamples of speakers include TV presenter [[Adrian Chiles]], singer/musician [[Christine McVie]], comedian [[Jasper Carrott]], [[The Goodies|Goodies]] actor and TV presenter [[Bill Oddie]], hip-hop and garage musician [[Mike Skinner (musician)|Mike Skinner]], rock musicians [[Ozzy Osbourne]] (and all other members of the original [[Black Sabbath]]), [[Roy Wood]], [[Jeff Lynne]] ([[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]] founders), [[Rob Halford]] ([[Judas Priest]]), [[Barney Greenway]] ([[Napalm Death]]), [[Dave Pegg]] (of [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]),  broadcaster [[Les Ross]], politicians [[Clare Short]] and [[Jess Phillips]], [[Special Air Service|SAS]] soldier and author [[John \"Brummie\" Stokes]], and many actresses and actors including [[Martha Howe-Douglas]], [[Donnaleigh Bailey]], [[Nicolas Woodman]], [[Sarah Smart]], [[John Oliver]] and [[Ryan Cartwright]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black Country dialect]]\n* [[Potteries dialect]] (North Staffordshire)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Clark\n|first=Ursula\n|editor-last=Schneider\n|editor-first=Edgar W.\n|editor2-last=Burridge\n|editor2-first=Kate\n|editor3-last=Kortmann\n|editor3-first=Bernd\n|editor4-last=Mesthrie\n|editor4-first=Rajend\n|editor5-last=Upton\n|editor5-first=Clive\n|year=2004\n|title=A handbook of varieties of English\n|chapter=The English West Midlands: phonology\n|volume=The British Isles\n|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter\n|pages=140???\n|isbn=3-11-017532-0\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Clark\n|first=Urszula\n|year=2013\n|title=West Midlands English: Birmingham and the Black Country\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFarBgAAQBAJ\n|isbn=0748685804\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Elmes\n|first=Simon\n|year=2006\n|title=Talking for Britain: a journey through the voices of a nation\n|publisher=Penguin\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJIdAQAAIAAJ\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Gimson\n|first=Alfred Charles\n|editor-last=Cruttenden\n|editor-first=Alan\n|year=2014\n|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English\n|publisher=Routledge\n|edition=8th\n|isbn=9781444183092\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2nMAgAAQBAJ\n}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Thorne\n|first=Stephen\n|year=2003\n|title=Birmingham English: A Sociolinguistic Study\n|publisher=University of Birmingham\n|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.402460\n}}\n* {{Accents of English|hide1=y|hide3=y|mode=cs2}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{External links|date=May 2014}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A496352 How to Speak Brummie]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190402162644/http://www.talklikeabrummie.co.uk/ Talk Like A Brummie] A wiki-based Birmingham dialect dictionary\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081020064327/http://www.ebrummie.co.uk/ ebrummie.co.uk] Dr Steve Thorne's website devoted to the study of Brummie, including a dictionary, MP3 speech samples, discussion of his research on stereotypes, etc.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130812172251/http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/english57.html Birmingham English sample] using a test paragraph including most English sounds: George Mason University [https://web.archive.org/web/20080821121056/http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/ Speech Accent Archive].
