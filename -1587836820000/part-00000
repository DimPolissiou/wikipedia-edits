{"title_page": "Focal length", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Rear focal distance|lens to film distance in a camera|Flange focal distance}}\n[[File:Focal-length.svg|frame|right|The focal point '''F''' and focal length ''f'' of a positive (convex) lens, a negative (concave) lens, a concave mirror, and a convex mirror.]]\n \nThe '''focal length''' of an [[Optics|optical]] system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges [[light]]; it is the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of the system's [[optical power]]. A positive focal length indicates that a system converges light, while a negative focal length indicates that the system diverges light. A system with a shorter focal length bends the [[Ray (optics)|ray]]s more sharply, bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance or diverging them more quickly. For the special case of a [[thin lens]] in air, a positive focal length is the distance over which initially [[Collimated beam|collimated]] (parallel) rays are brought to a [[Focus (optics)|focus]], or alternatively a negative focal length indicates how far in front of the lens a [[point source]] must be located to form a collimated beam. For more general optical systems, the focal length has no intuitive meaning; it is simply the inverse of the system's optical power.\n\nIn most [[photography]] and all [[telescopy]], where the subject is essentially infinitely far away, longer focal length (lower optical power) leads to higher [[magnification]] and a narrower [[angle of view]]; conversely, shorter focal length or higher optical power is associated with lower magnification and a wider angle of view. On the other hand, in applications such as [[microscopy]] in which magnification is achieved by bringing the object close to the lens, a shorter focal length (higher optical power) leads to higher magnification because the subject can be brought closer to the center of projection.   Please  \n\n== Thin lens approximation ==\nFor a thin lens in air, the focal length is the distance from the center of the [[Lens (optics)|lens]] to the principal foci (or ''focal points'') of the lens. For a converging lens (for example a [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|convex lens]]), the focal length is positive, and is the distance at which a beam of [[collimated light]] will be focused to a single spot.  For a diverging lens (for example a [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|concave lens]]), the focal length is negative, and is the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the lens.\n\nWhen a lens is used to form an image of some object, the distance from the object to the lens ''u'', the distance from the lens to the image ''v'', and the focal length ''f'' are related by\n:<math>\\frac{1}{f} =\\frac{1}{u}+\\frac{1}{v}\\ .</math>\n\nThe focal length of a thin ''convex'' lens can be easily measured by using it to form an image of a distant light source on a screen. The lens is moved until a sharp image is formed on the screen.

Technically, long focal length lenses are only \"telephoto\" if the focal length is longer than the physical length of the lens, but the term is often used to describe any long focal length lens.\n\nDue to the popularity of the [[135 film|35&nbsp;mm standard]], camera\u2013lens combinations are often described in terms of their [[35 mm equivalent focal length|35&nbsp;mm-equivalent focal length]], that is, the focal length of a lens that would have the same angle of view, or field of view, if used on a [[Full-frame digital SLR|full-frame]] 35&nbsp;mm camera.  Use of a 35&nbsp;mm-equivalent focal length is particularly common with [[digital camera]]s, which often use sensors smaller than 35&nbsp;mm film, and so require correspondingly shorter focal lengths to achieve a given angle of view, by a factor known as the [[crop factor]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Depth of field]]\n* [[Dioptre]]\n* [[f-number]] or focal ratio\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Focal length}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{photography subject}}\n\n[[Category:Geometrical optics]]\n[[Category:Length]]\n[[Category:Science of photography]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Rear focal distance|lens to film distance in a camera|Flange focal distance}}\n[[File:Focal-length.svg|frame|right|The focal point '''F''' and focal length ''f'' of a positive (convex) lens, a negative (concave) lens, a concave mirror, and a convex mirror.]]\n\nThe '''focal length''' of an [[Optics|optical]] system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges [[light]]; it is the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of the system's [[optical power]]. A positive focal length indicates that a system converges light, while a negative focal length indicates that the system diverges light. A system with a shorter focal length bends the [[Ray (optics)|ray]]s more sharply, bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance or diverging them more quickly. For the special case of a [[thin lens]] in air, a positive focal length is the distance over which initially [[Collimated beam|collimated]] (parallel) rays are brought to a [[Focus (optics)|focus]], or alternatively a negative focal length indicates how far in front of the lens a [[point source]] must be located to form a collimated beam. For more general optical systems, the focal length has no intuitive meaning; it is simply the inverse of the system's optical power.\n\nIn most [[photography]] and all [[telescopy]], where the subject is essentially infinitely far away, longer focal length (lower optical power) leads to higher [[magnification]] and a narrower [[angle of view]]; conversely, shorter focal length or higher optical power is associated with lower magnification and a wider angle of view. On the other hand, in applications such as [[microscopy]] in which magnification is achieved by bringing the object close to the lens, a shorter focal length (higher optical power) leads to higher magnification because the subject can be brought closer to the center of projection.\n\n== Thin lens approximation ==\nFor a thin lens in air, the focal length is the distance from the center of the [[Lens (optics)|lens]] to the principal foci (or ''focal points'') of the lens. For a converging lens (for example a [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|convex lens]]), the focal length is positive, and is the distance at which a beam of [[collimated light]] will be focused to a single spot.  For a diverging lens (for example a [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|concave lens]]), the focal length is negative, and is the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the lens.\n\nWhen a lens is used to form an image of some object, the distance from the object to the lens ''u'', the distance from the lens to the image ''v'', and the focal length ''f'' are related by\n:<math>\\frac{1}{f} =\\frac{1}{u}+\\frac{1}{v}\\ .</math>\n\nThe focal length of a thin ''convex'' lens can be easily measured by using it to form an image of a distant light source on a screen. The lens is moved until a sharp image is formed on the screen. In this case {{Sfrac|''u''}} is negligible, and the focal length is then given by \n:<math>f \\approx v\\ .</math>\n\nDetermining the focal length of a ''concave'' lens is somewhat more difficult.  The focal length of such a lens is considered that point at which the spreading beams of light would meet before the lens if the lens were not there.  No image is formed during such a test, and the focal length must be determined by passing light (for example, the light of a laser beam) through the lens, examining how much that light becomes dispersed/ bent, and following the beam of light backwards to the lens's focal point.\n\n== General optical systems ==\n[[File:Thick Lens Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Thick lens diagram]]\n\nFor a ''thick'' lens (one which has a non-negligible thickness), or an imaging system consisting of several lenses or mirrors (e.g. a [[photographic lens]] or a [[telescope]]), the focal length is often called the ''effective focal length'' (EFL), to distinguish it from other commonly used parameters:\n* ''Front focal length'' (FFL) or ''front focal distance'' (FFD) (''s''<sub>F</sub>) is the distance from the front focal point of the system (F) to the [[surface vertex|vertex]] of the ''first optical surface'' (S<sub>1</sub>).<ref name = \"Greivenkamp\" /><ref name=\"Hecht1\">{{cite book |first=Eugene |last=Hecht |year=2002 |title=Optics |edition=4th |publisher=[[Addison Wesley]] |isbn=978-0805385663 |page=168}}</ref>\n* ''Back focal length'' (BFL) or ''back focal distance'' (BFD) (''s\u2032''<sub>F\u2032</sub>) is the distance from the vertex of the ''last optical surface'' of the system (S<sub>2</sub>) to the rear focal point (F\u2032).<ref name = \"Greivenkamp\" /><ref name=\"Hecht1\" />\n\nFor an optical system in air, the effective focal length (''f'' and ''f\u2032'') gives the distance from the front and rear [[principal plane]]s (H and H\u2032) to the corresponding focal points (F and F\u2032).

Technically, long focal length lenses are only \"telephoto\" if the focal length is longer than the physical length of the lens, but the term is often used to describe any long focal length lens.\n\nDue to the popularity of the [[135 film|35&nbsp;mm standard]], camera\u2013lens combinations are often described in terms of their [[35 mm equivalent focal length|35&nbsp;mm-equivalent focal length]], that is, the focal length of a lens that would have the same angle of view, or field of view, if used on a [[Full-frame digital SLR|full-frame]] 35&nbsp;mm camera.  Use of a 35&nbsp;mm-equivalent focal length is particularly common with [[digital camera]]s, which often use sensors smaller than 35&nbsp;mm film, and so require correspondingly shorter focal lengths to achieve a given angle of view, by a factor known as the [[crop factor]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Depth of field]]\n* [[Dioptre]]\n* [[f-number]] or focal ratio\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Focal length}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{photography subject}}\n\n[[Category:Geometrical optics]]\n[[Category:Length]]\n[[Category:Science of photography]]\n", "name_user": "27.34.104.164", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(New updated data)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length"}

The body is black and the secondaries are silvery grey. The head is tinged in pink and bill is silvery with dark ceres. The nostril openings are slit-like. Juveniles are largely dark and take about four or five years to acquire the adult plumage. In flight, the adults show a dark leading edge of the wing and has a white wing-lining on the underside.

The preferred nesting trees were [[Ficus benghalensis|Banyan]], [[sacred fig|Peepul]], [[Terminalia arjuna|Arjun]], and [[Neem]]. The main nesting period was November to March with eggs being laid mainly in January. Several pairs nest in the vicinity of each other and isolated nests tend to be those of younger birds. Nests are nearly 3 feet in diameter and half a foot in thickness, and are lined with green leaves.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> Solitary nests are not used regularly and are sometimes taken over by the red-headed vulture and large owls such as ''[[Bubo coromandus]]''. The male initially brings twigs and arranges them to form the nest. During courtship the male bills the female's head, back and neck. The female invites copulation, and the male mounts and hold the head of the female in his bill.<ref name=Sharma /> Usually, the female lays a single egg, which is white with a tinge of bluish-green. Female birds destroy the nest on loss of an egg. They are usually silent but make hissing and roaring sounds at the nest or when jostling for food.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> The eggs hatch after about 30 to 35 days of incubation. The young chick is covered with grey down. The parents feed them with bits of meat from a carcass. The young birds remain for about three months in the nest.<ref name=Sharma>{{cite journal|first=I.

It is much smaller than the Eurasian Griffon. It has a white neck ruff. The adult's whitish back, rump, and underwing coverts contrast with the otherwise dark plumage. The body is black and the secondaries are silvery grey. The head is tinged in pink and bill is silvery with dark ceres. The nostril openings are slit-like. Juveniles are largely dark and take about four or five years to acquire the adult plumage. In flight, the adults show a dark leading edge of the wing and has a white wing-lining on the underside. The undertail coverts are black.<ref name=\"RasmussenAnderton2005\" />\n\nIt is the smallest of the ''[[Gyps]]'' vultures, but is still a very large bird.

The preferred nesting trees were [[Ficus benghalensis|Banyan]], [[sacred fig|Peepul]], [[Terminalia arjuna|Arjun]], and [[Neem]]. The main nesting period was November to March with eggs being laid mainly in January. Several pairs nest in the vicinity of each other and isolated nests tend to be those of younger birds. Nests are nearly 3 feet in diameter and half a foot in thickness, and are lined with green leaves.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> Solitary nests are not used regularly and are sometimes taken over by the red-headed vulture and large owls such as ''[[Bubo coromandus]]''. The male initially brings twigs and arranges them to form the nest. During courtship the male bills the female's head, back and neck. The female invites copulation, and the male mounts and hold the head of the female in his bill.<ref name=Sharma /> Usually, the female lays a single egg, which is white with a tinge of bluish-green. Female birds destroy the nest on loss of an egg. They are usually silent but make hissing and roaring sounds at the nest or when jostling for food.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> The eggs hatch after about 30 to 35 days of incubation. The young chick is covered with grey down. The parents feed them with bits of meat from a carcass. The young birds remain for about three months in the nest.<ref name=Sharma>{{cite journal|first=I.

It is in the north of [[Mumbai]] City and is governed by [[Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation]] (MBMC). It was once Asia's largest steel utensils manufacturer. It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]. The city is 5.6 KM away from [[Ghodbunder Fort]] and port which was once major port of India for Arabian Horse Imports. The city is the major Tourist gateway for [[Global Vipassana Pagoda]] which is 14.8 Km south of the city and to Essel world and Water Kingdom which is Asia's Biggest Amusement Park. The city has a plenty of Hotels and Temples.The city has a majority of Population of Hindus followed by Jain's and the Muslims. The city also has 2 public Library and well designed Study Hubs. Bhayander is well connected to rest of Mumbai by railways ([[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]) and Roadways. The current Mayor of Bhayander is [[Geeta Bharat Jain]].\n\nIt is 8 km north of [[Mumbai City]] and is governed by the [[Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation]] (MBMC). It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]].\n\nLike all railway stations on Mumbai suburban railway, Bhayandar is divided into two parts by the rail line: East and West. The West was traditionally residential and the East was predominantly an industrial area. Another distinct distribution between East and West Bhayandar is the food. East will provide you a huge range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes whereas West region offers predominantly vegetarian food. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighboring Mira Road on the east side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb. Government-owned [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] and [[marshland]] in West Mira Road have restricted the southward spread of Bhayandar. There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a gargantuan industrial complex.\n\nThe east Indian villages in Bhayandar are Murdha, Rai, Morva, Dongri, Uttan, Pali Chowk, Tarodi etc. They were formed by Portuguese travelers when [[Vasai]] (formerly Bassein) was a famous port. One route for \"Essel World\" is via Gorai, one of the villages close to Bhayandar. [[Gorai]] is popular for its beach and nearby Manori beach and is a popular weekend getaway for Bhayandar residents. It also is a great place for meditators who visit the Pagoda. In the 1970s Bhayandar was a village before the builders converted the fertile farming land into a concrete jungle.\n\nThe MBMC's ([[Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation]]) main office is in Bhayandar (West). Departments like Property Tax, Octroi, Transportation, Health, Ambulance for Emergency, Library, Water, Education, Birth-Death Registration, Tree, Advertising Fee, Animals, Public Construction, City Development, Accounts, etc. are a part of the MBMC's suite.\n\nThe recent success of real estate in Mumbai has helped Bhayandar become one of the populated stations on the Western railway circuit. There are trains starting and ending at this station; this shows the growth of Bhayandar in the last decade. Nowadays Mira Bhayandar Municipal Transport (MBMT) bus service are provided which runs in the Mira - Bhayandar city. Mahanagar Gas (MGL) pipeline service is available. Tata Power, as well as Adani Energy, has 24-hour electric supply. Multiplex and hyper market called Maxus Mall which includes a six-screen multiplex and [[Big Bazaar]]. D-Mart and Sahakari Bhandar have made a mark in the city. Bhayandar has witnessed hike in property rates in a short time and have shown that Bhayandar is coming up as an important destination. The famous residential landmarks are Chandan Park, Jesal Park, Sarvoday Paradise, Golden Nest, Indralok in the East side.\n\nThere are many hotels in Bhayandar. One of the best is the Veg Sagar near flyover end, Bhayandar west. There are many playing grounds for children such as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Ground, Agarwal and Maxus cricket ground and morva bhati ground.\n\nMost recent development has been noticed with regards to hospitals having world class facilities for all. One of them being Mira-Bhayandar Institute for Reproductive Assistance (MIRA) providing fertility clinic and total woman care.\n\n==Mira Bhayander Sports Complex==\nFirst-ever sports complex in Mira Bhayander which gives sports enthusiasts a great platform to the participants to show their talent and chase their passion of sports with the help of professional coaches and live their dreams.\n==Schools==\n[[File:Bhayandar stationboard.jpg|alt=Bhayander Railway station - one of the busiest railway station in Western Suburban Railways.|thumb|Bhayandar Railway Station]]\n\n*ST.Xavier's High school (SSC)\n*Mother Mary English High School (SSC)\n*RBK International School (IGCSE)\n*Our Lady Of Nazareth High school and Jr. College (SSC)\n*Sardar Vallabhai Patel vidyalaya (SSC)\n*St. Francis High School\n*RBK Global School (CBSE) \n*Mother Teresa High school\n*D'silva High School (SSC)\n*St. Soldier Public School\n*St  Aloysius English  High School\n*Tapovan Vidhyalay CBSE School\n*S.L.
