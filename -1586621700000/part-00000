The lines often are printed with fine width and in light colour and such paper is sometimes called ''feint-ruled paper''.  Additional vertical lines may provide [[Margin (typography)|margin]]s or act as [[tab stop]]s or create a grid for plotting data; for example, [[graph paper]] (''squared paper'' or ''grid paper'') is divided into squares by horizontal and vertical lines.\n\n==Generic types==\nLines on ruled paper provide a guide to help users keep their writing or drawing consistent with a predetermined set of rules. The ruling layout is not determined by the [[paper size]] but by the purpose, style of handwriting or the language used. Many different line layouts support handwriting, [[calligraphy]], plotting data on graphs, musical notation or help teach students to write in a particular language or script. The following are common examples:\n\n* '''Note paper''' (or ''Writing paper'', ''Filler paper'', ''Loose leaf paper'', ''Binder paper'') is typically used for handwriting and is produced in different layouts and sizes. The layout usually consists of evenly spaced horizontal lines, or ''feints'', with vertical lines drawn to indicate [[Margin (typography)|margin]]s, the middle of the page, or sections of a line.

Often every tenth or fifth line is bolded to assist in counting the lines when plotting data.\n* '''Quadrille ruled''' paper (or ''quad paper'') is similar to graph paper but without the bolded tenth lines.

West German Zeiss products were labelled Opton for sale in the Eastern bloc, while East German Zeiss products were labelled \"Zeiss Jena\" or simply \"Jena\" for sale in Western countries.\n\nIn 1973, the Western Carl Zeiss AG entered into a licensing agreement with the Japanese camera company [[Yashica]] to produce a series of high-quality 35&nbsp;mm film cameras and lenses bearing the [[Contax]] and Zeiss brand names. This collaboration continued under Yashica's successor, [[Kyocera]], until the latter ceased all camera production in 2005.

Today this becomes exemplarily visible in the latest [[EUV lithography]] systems, the equipment needed to produce the latest generations of semiconductor components. It also includes early high performance optical microscopes up to today's electron and ion microscopes, which reach sub-nanometers resolution. It includes technology leadership in early surgical microscopes and ophthalmic devices. It also includes high performance contact metrology systems. For many years Zeiss showed new innovations in fields as astronomical telescopes, photographic and cinematic lenses. \n\nEarly on, Carl Zeiss realised that he needed a competent scientist so as to take the firm beyond just being another optical workshop. In 1866, the service of [[Ernst Abbe|Dr. Ernst Abbe]] was enlisted. From then on novel products appeared in rapid succession which brought the Zeiss company to the forefront of optical technology.\n\nAbbe was instrumental in the development of the famous Jena optical glass. When he was trying to eliminate stigmatism from microscopes, he realized that the range of optical glasses available was insufficient. After some calculations, he realised that performance of optical instruments would dramatically improve if optical glasses of appropriate properties were available. His challenge to glass manufacturers was finally answered by [[Otto Schott|Dr. Otto Schott]], who established the famous glassworks at Jena from which new types of optical glass began to appear from 1888 to be employed by Zeiss and other makers.\n\nThe new Jena optical glass also opened up the possibility of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]], but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently, the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]], and in the production of [[apochromat]]ic lenses. Abbe started the [[Photographic lens design|design of a photographic lens]] of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further.\n\nZeiss' domination of photographic lens innovation was due to Dr [[Paul Rudolph (physicist)|Paul Rudolph]]. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at each side of the diaphragm, appropriately named \"Anastigmat\". This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with maximum apertures of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective maximum apertures of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 maximum aperture. These lenses are now better known by the trademark \"Protar\", which was first used in 1900.\n\nAt the time, single combination lenses, which occupy one side of the diaphragm only, were still popular. Rudolph designed one with three cemented elements in 1893, with the option of fitting two of them together in a lens barrel as a compound lens, but it was found to be the same as the Dagor by C.P. Goerz, designed by Emil von Hoegh. Rudolph then came up with a single combination with four cemented elements, which can be considered as having all the elements of the Protar stuck together in one piece. Marketed in 1894, it was called the Protarlinse Series VII, the most highly corrected single combination lens with maximum apertures between f/11 and f/12.5, depending on its focal length.\n\nBut the important thing about this Protarlinse is that two of these lens units can be mounted in the same lens barrel to form a compound lens of even greater performance and a larger aperture, between f/6.3 and f/7.7. In this configuration, it was called the Double Protar Series VIIa. An immense range of focal lengths can thus be obtained by the various combination of Protarlinse units.\n\nRudolph also investigated the [[Double-Gauss lens|Double-Gauss]] concept of a symmetrical design with thin positive menisci enclosing negative elements. The result was the Planar Series Ia of 1896, with maximum apertures up to f/3.5, one of the fastest lenses of its time. Whilst it was very sharp, it suffered from [[Coma (optics)|coma]] which limited its popularity. However, further developments of this configuration made it the design of choice for high-speed lenses of standard coverage.\n\nProbably inspired by the Stigmatic lenses designed by Hugh Aldis for [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer]] of London, Rudolph designed a new asymmetrical lens with four thin elements, the Unar Series Ib, with apertures up to f/4.5. Due to its high speed, it was used extensively on hand cameras.\n\nThe most important Zeiss lens by Rudolph was the [[Tessar]], first sold in 1902 in its Series IIb f/6.3 form. It can be said as a combination of the front half of the Unar with the rear half of the Protar. This proved to be the most valuable and flexible design, with tremendous development potential. Its maximum aperture was increased to f/4.7 in 1917 and reached f/2.7 in 1930. It is probable that every lens manufacturer has produced lenses of the Tessar configurations.\n\nRudolph left Zeiss after World War I, but many other competent designers such as Mert\u00e9, Wandersleb, etc. kept the firm at the leading edge of photographic lens innovations. One of the most significant designers was the ex-Ernemann man [[Ludwig Bertele|Dr Ludwig Bertele]], famed for his Ernostar high-speed lens.\n\nWith the advent of the [[Contax]] by Zeiss-Ikon, the first professional 35mm system camera became available. At this stage the Leica was no more than a convenient and portable snapshot camera. However Leitz could see the potential offered by the Contax and rapidly developed a coupled rangefinder and started to introduce additional lenses. As a system camera there was a need for a range of lenses for the Contax. Bertele's Sonnar series of lenses designed for the Contax was the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various Tessars and Triotars.\n\nThe last important Zeiss innovation before World War II was the technique of applying an anti-reflective coating to lens surfaces invented by [[Olexander Smakula]] in 1935.<ref>[http://www.zeiss.com/corporate/en_de/history/company%20history/at-a-glance/at-a-glance-milestones.html#1895-_-1945 History of Camera Lenses from Carl Zeiss&nbsp;\u2014 1935&nbsp;\u2014 Alexander Smakula develops anti-reflection coating]</ref> A lens so treated was marked with a red \"T\", short for \"Transparent\".

At first, both firms produced very similar lines of products, and extensively cooperated in product-sharing, but they drifted apart as time progressed. Jena's new direction was to concentrate on developing lenses for 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex cameras, and many achievements were made, especially in ultra-wide angle designs. In addition to that, Oberkochen also worked on designing lenses for the 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex camera [[Contarex]], for the [[medium format]] camera [[Hasselblad]], for large format cameras like the [[Linhof|Linhof Technika]], interchangeable front element lenses such as for the 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex [[Contaflex SLR|Contaflex]] and other types of cameras.\n\nSince the beginning of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme, allowing other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]], [[Bausch & Lomb]], Ross, Koristka, Krauss, [[Kodak]]. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon collaborated with Yashica to produce the new [[Contax]] cameras, and many of the Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica's optical arm, Tomioka. As Yashica's owner [[Kyocera]] ended camera production in 2006, and Yashica lenses were then made by [[Cosina]], who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon coupled rangefinder camera. Another licensee active today is [[Sony]] who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras.\n\n== Business relationships ==\nZeiss has licensed its name and/or technology to various other companies, including [[Hasselblad]], [[Rollei]], Yashica, Sony, [[Logitech]], and [[Alpa]]. The nature of the collaboration varies, from co-branding optics designed by another firm (e.g., Sony) to complete optical design and manufacturing (e.g., Hasselblad).\n\nOn 27 April 2005, the company announced a collaboration with [[Nokia]] in the camera phone market, with Zeiss providing camera optics. Zeiss will again provide optics for Nokia products through a collaboration with [[HMD Global]] announced on 6 July 2017.<ref name=\"theverge-2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15927360/hdm-nokia-zeiss-partnership-android-phones|title=Nokia and Zeiss brands reunite for the Android era|publisher=|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Zeiss Ikon Rangefinder w35mm f2.JPG|thumb|right|2004 Zeiss Ikon rangefinder with 35mm \u0192/2 Biogon lens.]]\n\n== Zeiss cameras ==\n=== Zeiss ZX digital cameras ===\nThe Zeiss ZX1 full-frame 35mm F/2 large-sensor compact camera was announced during Photokina 2018 with the slogan 'Shoot \u2013 Edit \u2013 Share'.

Much of the capital came from Zeiss which also provided most of the lenses and shutters for the cameras. Among the founders was August Nagel of Contessa-Nettel, who left the company in 1928 to form the Nagel Works, and in 1932, his company was bought by Kodak. After World War II, Japanese Nippon Kogaku offered the \"Nikon\" camera, and Zeiss Ikon prevented some European distribution under the theory that \"Nikon\" was an infringement on their brand name.\n\nThe earliest Zeiss Ikon cameras were a range of medium and large format folding cameras, for film and glass plate photography. The most expensive was the Universal Juwel (Jewel) an Ica-designed glass plate camera with origins in 1909. This was a favorite of both [[Ansel Adams]] and [[Dorothea Lange]]. Despite German production, the folding Super Ikonta was among the mainstays of British Army photographers during World War II.\n\nIn 1932 Zeiss Ikon introduced the Contax line of 35mm rangefinder cameras having recognised the potential for a system camera using 35mm film. The Contax I was introduced with a wide range of lenses and accessories for scientific and professional use. In 1936, an improved model the Contax II was introduced and became the favorite of many renowned photographers and journalists, including [[Robert Capa]] and [[Margaret Bourke-White]]. A second 35mm camera, the Contax III, was mechanically identical with a light meter grafted to the top of the camera.\n\nAfter World War II, the Soviets removed the Contax factory to Kiev, as war reparations, and produced the Contax II and III cameras under the Kiev brand. The first Kiev cameras were identical except for logos. Zeiss Ikon were without designs or facilities for making the Contax and set about producing an improved replacement. These were named the Contax IIa and IIIa, and were smaller and lighter than the original designs. But by the time the IIa and IIIa hit the market, they faced strong competition from many European and Asian brands, notably the visually similar Nikon which was a high quality camera sharing the same lens-mount and most of the features.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Zeiss Ikon was focusing on [[single-lens reflex camera]]s and while offering rangefinders, they were not adding features and became uncompetitive with Japanese brands including Canon, Yashica, Minolta, and Nikon. The [[Contaflex SLR|Zeiss Ikon Contaflex]] single-lens reflex cameras were viable in the mid 1950s, but soon lost market share to the Japanese brands.\n\nMore recent 35mm rangefinder cameras are simply named \"Zeiss Ikon.\" The most recent \"Zeiss Ikon\" rangefinder camera was an [[Leica M mount|M mount]] camera with automatic exposure, introduced by Zeiss in 2004, manufactured in Japan by Cosina, and now discontinued.\n\n== Camera lenses ==\n=== Cinema lenses ===\nCarl Zeiss AG has long been renowned for its motion picture lenses. Zeiss manufactures prime and zoom lenses for 35mm, 16mm, and 65mm film production. They also make lenses for digital cinema and high definition video. Zeiss is mainly known in the trade for their association with the German camera manufacturer [[Arri]] for whom they currently produce lenses.{{Clear}}\n\nCurrent models of Zeiss cinema lenses are:\n<div style=\"float:left;

West German Zeiss products were labelled Opton for sale in the Eastern bloc, while East German Zeiss products were labelled \"Zeiss Jena\" or simply \"Jena\" for sale in Western countries.\n\nIn 1973, the Western Carl Zeiss AG entered into a licensing agreement with the Japanese camera company [[Yashica]] to produce a series of high-quality 35&nbsp;mm film cameras and lenses bearing the [[Contax]] and Zeiss brand names. This collaboration continued under Yashica's successor, [[Kyocera]], until the latter ceased all camera production in 2005.

[[Jenoptik]] GmbH was split off as a specialty company in the areas of [[photonics]], [[optoelectronics]], and [[mechatronics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mti.uni-jena.de/~i6koka/history/start.html|title=A Short Review On History Of Optics In Jena|first=Karsten|last=K\u00f6nig|work=Institute of Anatomy II, [[University of Jena]]|date=21 July 1998|access-date=19 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930050448/http://www.mti.uni-jena.de/~i6koka/history/start.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://optics.org/cws/article/articles/7286|title=A passion for politics and a head for business|work=[[Institute of Physics|Optics & Laser Europe]]|date=1 January 2002|access-date=19 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Hensoldt AG was renamed Carl Zeiss Sports Optics GmbH on 1 October 2006.<ref>[http://www.zeiss.co.za/c12567a80033f8e4/Contents-Frame/8e4f89e09e5ef290c1256fb8002dac6a What you should know about Carl Zeiss Sports Optics GmbH] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124193255/http://www.zeiss.co.za/c12567a80033f8e4/Contents-Frame/8e4f89e09e5ef290c1256fb8002dac6a |date=24 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe companies of the Zeiss Gruppe in and around Dresden have branched into new technologies: screens and products for the [[automotive industry]], for example.\n\nToday, there are arguably three companies with primarily Zeiss Ikon heritage: ''Zeiss Germany'', the Finnish/Swedish ''Ikon'' (which bought the West German ''Zeiss Ikon AG''), and the independent eastern ''Zeiss Ikon''.\n\nA division called Carl Zeiss Vision produces lenses for eyeglasses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zeiss.com/vision-care/en_us/home.html|website=Zeiss Vision Care|title=A new experience in vision|access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref> In 2005, the eyeglass division merged with U.S. company SOLA, which included the former American Optical Company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zeiss.com/vision-care/en_us/about-zeiss/company-history/abstract-the-21st-century.html|website=Carl Zeiss AG|title=Company History Abstract: The 21st Century|access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opticalheritagemuseum.org/AOEventsSlideshoprintablefile.pdf|website=Optical Heritage Museum|title=American Optical History|author=Dick Whitney, Curator|access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 2013, Carl Zeiss officially announced its plan to rename the brand from \"Carl Zeiss\" to simply \"Zeiss\".

Today this becomes exemplarily visible in the latest [[EUV lithography]] systems, the equipment needed to produce the latest generations of semiconductor components. It also includes early high performance optical microscopes up to today's electron and ion microscopes, which reach sub-nanometers resolution. It includes technology leadership in early surgical microscopes and ophthalmic devices. It also includes high performance contact metrology systems. For many years Zeiss showed new innovations in fields as astronomical telescopes, photographic and cinematic lenses. \n\nEarly on, Carl Zeiss realised that he needed a competent scientist so as to take the firm beyond just being another optical workshop. In 1866, the service of [[Ernst Abbe|Dr. Ernst Abbe]] was enlisted. From then on novel products appeared in rapid succession which brought the Zeiss company to the forefront of optical technology.\n\nAbbe was instrumental in the development of the famous Jena optical glass. When he was trying to eliminate stigmatism from microscopes, he realized that the range of optical glasses available was insufficient. After some calculations, he realised that performance of optical instruments would dramatically improve if optical glasses of appropriate properties were available. His challenge to glass manufacturers was finally answered by [[Otto Schott|Dr. Otto Schott]], who established the famous glassworks at Jena from which new types of optical glass began to appear from 1888 to be employed by Zeiss and other makers.\n\nThe new Jena optical glass also opened up the possibility of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]], but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently, the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]], and in the production of [[apochromat]]ic lenses. Abbe started the [[Photographic lens design|design of a photographic lens]] of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further.\n\nZeiss' domination of photographic lens innovation was due to Dr [[Paul Rudolph (physicist)|Paul Rudolph]]. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at each side of the diaphragm, appropriately named \"Anastigmat\". This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with maximum apertures of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective maximum apertures of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 maximum aperture. These lenses are now better known by the trademark \"Protar\", which was first used in 1900.\n\nAt the time, single combination lenses, which occupy one side of the diaphragm only, were still popular. Rudolph designed one with three cemented elements in 1893, with the option of fitting two of them together in a lens barrel as a compound lens, but it was found to be the same as the Dagor by C.P. Goerz, designed by Emil von Hoegh. Rudolph then came up with a single combination with four cemented elements, which can be considered as having all the elements of the Protar stuck together in one piece. Marketed in 1894, it was called the Protarlinse Series VII, the most highly corrected single combination lens with maximum apertures between f/11 and f/12.5, depending on its focal length.\n\nBut the important thing about this Protarlinse is that two of these lens units can be mounted in the same lens barrel to form a compound lens of even greater performance and a larger aperture, between f/6.3 and f/7.7. In this configuration, it was called the Double Protar Series VIIa. An immense range of focal lengths can thus be obtained by the various combination of Protarlinse units.\n\nRudolph also investigated the [[Double-Gauss lens|Double-Gauss]] concept of a symmetrical design with thin positive menisci enclosing negative elements. The result was the Planar Series Ia of 1896, with maximum apertures up to f/3.5, one of the fastest lenses of its time. Whilst it was very sharp, it suffered from [[Coma (optics)|coma]] which limited its popularity. However, further developments of this configuration made it the design of choice for high-speed lenses of standard coverage.\n\nProbably inspired by the Stigmatic lenses designed by Hugh Aldis for [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer]] of London, Rudolph designed a new asymmetrical lens with four thin elements, the Unar Series Ib, with apertures up to f/4.5. Due to its high speed, it was used extensively on hand cameras.\n\nThe most important Zeiss lens by Rudolph was the [[Tessar]], first sold in 1902 in its Series IIb f/6.3 form. It can be said as a combination of the front half of the Unar with the rear half of the Protar. This proved to be the most valuable and flexible design, with tremendous development potential. Its maximum aperture was increased to f/4.7 in 1917 and reached f/2.7 in 1930. It is probable that every lens manufacturer has produced lenses of the Tessar configurations.\n\nRudolph left Zeiss after World War I, but many other competent designers such as Mert\u00e9, Wandersleb, etc. kept the firm at the leading edge of photographic lens innovations. One of the most significant designers was the ex-Ernemann man [[Ludwig Bertele|Dr Ludwig Bertele]], famed for his Ernostar high-speed lens.\n\nWith the advent of the [[Contax]] by Zeiss-Ikon, the first professional 35mm system camera became avaialable. At this stage the Leica was no more than a convenient and portable snapshot camera. However Leitz could see the potential offered by the Contax and rapidly developed a coupled rangefinder and started to introduce additional lenses. As a system camera there was a need for a range of lenses for the Contax. Bertele's Sonnar series of lenses designed for the Contax was the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various Tessars and Triotars.\n\nThe last important Zeiss innovation before World War II was the technique of applying an anti-reflective coating to lens surfaces invented by [[Olexander Smakula]] in 1935.<ref>[http://www.zeiss.com/corporate/en_de/history/company%20history/at-a-glance/at-a-glance-milestones.html#1895-_-1945 History of Camera Lenses from Carl Zeiss&nbsp;\u2014 1935&nbsp;\u2014 Alexander Smakula develops anti-reflection coating]</ref> A lens so treated was marked with a red \"T\", short for \"Transparent\".

At first, both firms produced very similar lines of products, and extensively cooperated in product-sharing, but they drifted apart as time progressed. Jena's new direction was to concentrate on developing lenses for 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex cameras, and many achievements were made, especially in ultra-wide angle designs. In addition to that, Oberkochen also worked on designing lenses for the 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex camera [[Contarex]], for the [[medium format]] camera [[Hasselblad]], for large format cameras like the [[Linhof|Linhof Technika]], interchangeable front element lenses such as for the 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex [[Contaflex SLR|Contaflex]] and other types of cameras.\n\nSince the beginning of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme, allowing other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]], [[Bausch & Lomb]], Ross, Koristka, Krauss, [[Kodak]]. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon collaborated with Yashica to produce the new [[Contax]] cameras, and many of the Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica's optical arm, Tomioka. As Yashica's owner [[Kyocera]] ended camera production in 2006, and Yashica lenses were then made by [[Cosina]], who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon coupled rangefinder camera. Another licensee active today is [[Sony]] who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras.\n\n== Business relationships ==\nZeiss has licensed its name and/or technology to various other companies, including [[Hasselblad]], [[Rollei]], Yashica, Sony, [[Logitech]], and [[Alpa]]. The nature of the collaboration varies, from co-branding optics designed by another firm (e.g., Sony) to complete optical design and manufacturing (e.g., Hasselblad).\n\nOn 27 April 2005, the company announced a collaboration with [[Nokia]] in the camera phone market, with Zeiss providing camera optics. Zeiss will again provide optics for Nokia products through a collaboration with [[HMD Global]] announced on 6 July 2017.<ref name=\"theverge-2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15927360/hdm-nokia-zeiss-partnership-android-phones|title=Nokia and Zeiss brands reunite for the Android era|publisher=|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Zeiss Ikon Rangefinder w35mm f2.JPG|thumb|right|2004 Zeiss Ikon rangefinder with 35mm \u0192/2 Biogon lens.]]\n\n== Zeiss cameras ==\n=== Zeiss ZX digital cameras ===\nThe Zeiss ZX1 full-frame 35mm F/2 large-sensor compact camera was announced during Photokina 2018 with the slogan 'Shoot \u2013 Edit \u2013 Share'.

Much of the capital came from Zeiss which also provided most of the lenses and shutters for the cameras. Among the founders was August Nagel of Contessa-Nettel, who left the company in 1928 to form the Nagel Works, and in 1932, his company was bought by Kodak. After World War II, Japanese Nippon Kogaku offered the \"Nikon\" camera, and Zeiss Ikon prevented some European distribution under the theory that \"Nikon\" was an infringement on their brand name.\n\nThe earliest Zeiss Ikon cameras were a range of medium and large format folding cameras, for film and glass plate photography. The most expensive was the Universal Juwel (Jewel) an Ica-designed glass plate camera with origins in 1909. This was a favorite of both [[Ansel Adams]] and [[Dorothea Lange]]. Despite German production, the folding Super Ikonta was among the mainstays of British Army photographers during World War II.\n\nIn 1932 Zeiss Ikon introduced the Contax line of 35mm rangefinder cameras having recognised the potential for a system camera using 35mm film. The Contax I was introduced with a wide range of lenses and accessories for scientific and professional use. In 1936, an improved model the Contax II was introduced and became the favorite of many renowned photographers and journalists, including [[Robert Capa]] and [[Margaret Bourke-White]]. A second 35mm camera, the Contax III, was mechanically identical with a light meter grafted to the top of the camera.\n\nAfter World War II, the Soviets removed the Contax factory to Kiev, as war reparations, and produced the Contax II and III cameras under the Kiev brand. The first Kiev cameras were identical except for logos. Zeiss Ikon were without designs or facilities for making the Contax and set about producing an improved replacement. These were named the Contax IIa and IIIa, and were smaller and lighter than the original designs. But by the time the IIa and IIIa hit the market, they faced strong competition from many European and Asian brands, notably the visually similar Nikon which was a high quality camera sharing the same lens-mount and most of the features.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Zeiss Ikon was focusing on [[single-lens reflex camera]]s and while offering rangefinders, they were not adding features and became uncompetitive with Japanese brands including Canon, Yashica, Minolta, and Nikon. The [[Contaflex SLR|Zeiss Ikon Contaflex]] single-lens reflex cameras were viable in the mid 1950s, but soon lost market share to the Japanese brands.\n\nMore recent 35mm rangefinder cameras are simply named \"Zeiss Ikon.\" The most recent \"Zeiss Ikon\" rangefinder camera was an [[Leica M mount|M mount]] camera with automatic exposure, introduced by Zeiss in 2004, manufactured in Japan by Cosina, and now discontinued.\n\n== Camera lenses ==\n=== Cinema lenses ===\nCarl Zeiss AG has long been renowned for its motion picture lenses. Zeiss manufactures prime and zoom lenses for 35mm, 16mm, and 65mm film production. They also make lenses for digital cinema and high definition video. Zeiss is mainly known in the trade for their association with the German camera manufacturer [[Arri]] for whom they currently produce lenses.{{Clear}}\n\nCurrent models of Zeiss cinema lenses are:\n<div style=\"float:left;

Pests of plant cultures such as weeds, bacteria, fungi and viruses are killed through induced hot steam which causes vital cellular proteins to  [[Protein folding|unfold]]. Biologically, the method is considered a partial disinfection. Important heat-resistant, spore-forming bacteria can survive and revitalize the soil after cooling down. Soil fatigue can be cured through the release of nutritive substances blocked within the soil. Steaming leads to a better starting position, quicker growth and strengthened resistance against plant disease and pests. Today, the application of hot steam is considered the best and most effective way to disinfect sick soil, potting soil and compost. \nIt is being used as an alternative to [[bromomethane]], whose production and use was curtailed by the [[Montreal Protocol]]. \"Steam effectively kills pathogens by heating the soil to levels that cause [[protein]] coagulation or [[enzyme]] inactivation.\"<ref name=gov>[http://www.epa.gov/ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume3/steam3.html EPA] Steam as an Alternative to Methyl Bromide in Nursery Crops</ref>\n\n==Benefits of soil steaming==\nSoil sterilization provides secure and quick relief of soils from substances and organisms harmful to plants such as:\n* Bacteria\n* Viruses\n* Fungi\n* [[Nematodes]] and\n* Other Pests\n\nFurther positive effects are:\n\n* All weed and weed seeds are killed<ref>Research report of DLR Rheinlandpfalz, September 2010: [http://www.soil-steaming-steam-boiler-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steaming-research-results_dlr2010.pdf'' Weed control in seed cultures, especially  arugula''], Author: Dr. Norbert Laun, Institute \"Queckbrunnerhof\", Schifferstadt (Germany).

Viewed on 19. January 2012.</ref>\n* Blocked nutritive substances in the soil are tapped and made available for plants\n* Alternative to methyl bromide and other critical chemicals in agriculture\n\n==Steaming with superheated steam==\nThrough modern steaming methods with superheated steam at 180&ndash;200&nbsp;[[Celsius|\u00b0C]], an optimal soil disinfection can be achieved. Soil only absorbs a small amount of humidity. Micro organisms become active once the soil has cooled down. This creates an optimal environment for instant tillage with seedlings and seeds. \nAdditionally the method of integrated steaming can promote a target-oriented resettlement of steamed soil with beneficial organisms. In the process, the soil is first freed from all organisms and then revitalized and microbiologically buffered through the injection of a soil activator based on compost which contains a natural mixture of favorable microorganisms (e.g. ''Bacillus subtilis'', etc.).\n\nDifferent types of such steam application are also available in practice, including substrate steaming, surface steaming and deep soil steaming.\n\n\n\n\n==Surface steaming==\nSeveral methods for surface steaming are in use amongst which are: area sheet steaming, the steaming hood, the steaming harrow, the steaming plough and vacuum steaming with drainage pipes or mobile pipe systems.\n\nIn order to pick the most suitable steaming method, certain factors have to be considered such as soil structure, plant culture and area performance. At present, more advanced methods are being developed, such as sandwich steaming or partially integrated sandwich steaming in order to minimize energy consumption and associated costs as much as possible.\n\n==Deep soil steaming==\nDeep soil steaming is a concept adopted by the Norwegian company Soil Steam international AS. They have developed a technology that manages to get the steam 30-40 cm deep in the soil. This is done in a continous process and their last prototype managed to treat 1 hectare in 10 hours. When steaming the soil this deep, they get deep enough to avoid that the farmer brings up new seeds, fungi or nematodes when he plows in the fall. This means that the treatment last for many years as the soil stays free from weeds, seeds, fungi and nematodes for many years after one deep soil steam opperation. See more info on soilsteam.com\n\n\n===Sheet steaming===\n\nSurface steaming with special sheets (sheet steaming) is a method which has been established for decades in order to steam large areas reaching from 15 to 400 m<sup>2</sup> in one step. If properly applied, sheet steaming is simple and highly economic. The usage of heat resistant, non-decomposing insulation fleece saves up to 50% energy, reduces the steaming time significantly and improves penetration. Single working step areas up to 400 m<sup>2</sup> can be steamed in 4\u20135 hours down to 25\u201330&nbsp;cm depth / 90&nbsp;\u00b0C. \nThe usage of heat resistant and non-decomposing synthetic insulation fleece, 5&nbsp;mm thick, 500 gr / m<sup>2</sup>, can reduce steaming time by about 30%. Through a steam injector or a perforated pipe, steam is injected underneath the sheet after it has been laid out and weighted with sand sacks.\n\nThe area performance in one working step depends on the capacity of the steam generator (e.g. steam boiler):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Steam capacity kg/h:\n! 100\n! 250\n! 300\n! 400\n! 550\n! 800\n! 1000\n! 1350\n! 2000\n|-\n| '''Area m<sup>2</sup>:'''\n| 15\u201320\n| 30\u201350\n| 50\u201365\n| 60\u201390\n| 80\u2013120\n| 130\u2013180\n| 180\u2013220\n| 220\u2013270\n| 300\u2013400\n|}\n\nThe steaming time depends on soil structure as well as outside temperature and amounts to 1\u20131.5 hours per 10&nbsp;cm steaming depth. Hereby the soil reaches a temperature of about 85&nbsp;\u00b0C. Milling for soil loosening is not recommended since soil structure may become too fine which reduces its penetrability for steam. The usage of spading machines is ideal for soil loosening. The best results can be achieved if the soil is cloddy at greater depth and granulated at lesser depth.\n\nIn practice, working with at least two sheets simultaneously has proven to be highly effective. While one sheet is used for steaming the other one is prepared for steam injection, therefore unnecessary steaming recesses are avoided.\n\n===Depth steaming with vacuum===\nSteaming with vacuum which is induced through a mobile or fixed installed pipe system in the depth of the area to be steamed, is the method that reaches the best penetration. Despite high capital cost, the fixed installation of drainage systems is reasonable for intensively used areas  since steaming depths of up to 80&nbsp;cm can be achieved.\n\nIn contrast to fixed installed drainage systems, pipes in mobile suction systems are on the surface. A central suction pipeline consisting of zinc-coated, fast-coupling pipes are connected in a regular spacing of 1.50 m and the ends of the hoses are pushed into the soil to the desired depth with a special tool.\n\nThe steaming area is covered with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced in the middle of the sheet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. \nAs soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on.  First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward.\n \nDuring the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet.\n     \nAs with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20\u201330 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10&nbsp;cm steaming depth.  The steam requirement is approximately 7\u20138&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.\n    \nThe most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.\n\n====Negative pressure technique====\nNegative pressure technique generates appropriate soil temperature at a 60&nbsp;cm depth and complete control of [[nematode]]s, [[fungi]] and [[weed]]s is achieved. In this technique, the steam is introduced under the steaming sheath and forced to enter the soil profile by a negative pressure. The negative pressure is created by a fan that sucks the air out of the soil through buried perforated [[polypropylene]] pipes. This system requires a permanent installation of perforated pipes into the soil, at a depth of at least 60&nbsp;cm to be protected from [[plough]].<ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/004/Y1809E/y1809e07.htm FAO] Global report on validated alternatives to the use of methyl bromide for soil</ref>\n\n===Steaming with hoods===\n<!-- [[Image:Vollautomat9.jpg|thumb|right|Fully automatic steaming robot with steaming hoods]] -->\n[[Image:haube.jpeg|thumb|right|Half automatic steaming hood with three wings in greenhouse]]\n\nA steaming hood is a mobile device consisting of corrosion-resistant materials such as aluminum, which is put down onto the area to be steamed. In contrast to sheet steaming, cost-intensive working steps such as laying out and weighting the sheets don't occur, however the area steamed per working step is smaller in accordance to the size of the hood.\n\nOutdoors, a hood is positioned either manually or via tractor with a special pre-stressed  4 point suspension arm. Steaming time amounts to 30 min for a penetration down to 25&nbsp;cm depth. Hereby a temperature of 90&nbsp;\u00b0C can be reached. In large stable glasshouses, the hoods are attached to tracks. They are lifted and moved by pneumatic cylinders. Small and medium-sized hoods up to 12 m<sup>2</sup> are lifted manually using a tipping lever or moved electrically with special winches.\n\n===Combined surface and depth injection of steam (Sandwich Steaming)===\n\n[[Image:sandwichdaempfung.jpg|thumb|right|Sandwich steaming machine model Sterilter constructed by Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche equipped with MSD/moeschle steam boiler]]\n\nSandwich steaming, which was developed in a project among DEIAFA, University of Turin (Italy, www.deiafa.unito.it) and Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche (see image), represents a combination of depth and surface steaming, offers an efficient method to induce hot steam into the soil. The steam is simultaneously pushed into the soil from the surface and from the depth. For this purpose, the area, which must be equipped with a deep steaming injection system, is covered with a steaming hood. The steam enters the soil from the top and the bottom at the same time. Sheets are not suitable, since a high pressure up to 30&nbsp;mm water column arises underneath the cover.\n\nSandwich steaming offers several advantages. On the one hand, application of energy can be increased to up to 120&nbsp;kg steam per m<sup>2</sup>/h. In comparison to other steaming methods up to 30% energy savings can be achieved and the usage of fuel (e.g. heating oil) accordingly decreases. The increased application of energy leads to a quick heating of the soil which reduces the loss of heat. On the other hand, only half of the regular steaming time is needed.\n\nComparison of sandwich steaming with other steam injection methods relating to steam output and energy demand(*):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Steaming method\n! Max. steam output\n! Energy demand (*)\n|-\n| '''Sheet steaming'''\n| 6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 100&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| '''Depth steaming (Sheet + vacuum)'''\n| 14&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 120&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| '''Hood steaming (Alu)'''\n| 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 80&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| '''Hood steaming (Steel)\t'''\n| 50&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 75&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| '''Sandwich steaming'''\n| 120&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 60&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|}\n\n(*) in soil max 30% moisture\n\nClearly, Sandwich steaming reaches the highest steam output at the lowest energy demand.\n\n===Partially integrated sandwich steaming===\nThe partial integrated sandwich steaming is an advanced combined method for steaming merely the areas which shall be planted and purposely leaving out those areas which shall not be used. In order to avoid risk of re-infection of steamed areas with pest from unsteamed areas, beneficial organisms can directly be injected into the hygenized soil via a soil activator (e.g. special compost). The partial sandwich steaming unlocks further potential savings in the steaming process.\n\n==Container / Stack steaming==\nStack steaming is used when thermically treating compost and substrates such as turf. Depending on the amount, the material to be steamed is piled up to 70&nbsp;cm height in steaming boxes or in small dump trailers. Steam is evenly injected via manifolds. For huge amounts, steaming containers and soil boxes are used which are equipped with suction systems to improve steaming results. Midget amounts can be steamed in special small steaming devices.\n\nThe amount of soil steamed should be tuned in a way that steaming time amounts to at most 1.5 h in order to avoid large quantities of condensed water in the bottom layers of the soil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Steam Output kg/h:\n! 100\n! 250\n! 300\n! 400\n! 550\n! 800\n! 1000\n! 1350\n! 2000\n|-\n| '''m<sup>3</sup>/h about:'''\n| 1.0\u20131.5\n| 2.5\u20133.0\n| 3.0\u20133.5\n| 4.0\u20135.0\n| 5.5\u20137.0\n| 8.0\u201310.0\n| 10.0\u201313.0\n| 14.0\u201318.0\n| 20.0\u201325.0\n|}\n\nIn light substrates, such as turf, the performance per hour is significantly higher.\n\n==History==\nModern soil steam sterilization was first discovered in 1888 (by Frank in Germany) and was first commercially used in the United States (by Rudd) in 1893 (Baker 1962). Since then, a wide variety of steam machines have been built to disinfest both commercial greenhouse and nursery field soils (Grossman and Liebman 1995). In the 1950s, for example, steam sterilization technologies expanded from disinfestation of potting soil and greenhouse mixes to commercial production of steam rakes and tractor-drawn steam blades for fumigating small acres of cut flowers and other high-value field crops (Langedijk 1959). Today, even more effective steam technologies are being developed.<ref name=gov/>\n\n==Application of hot steam ==\n* In horticulture as well as nurseries for sterilization of substrates and top soil\n* In agriculture for sterilization and treatment of food waste for pig fattening and heating of molasses\n* In mushroom cultivation for pasteurization of  growing rooms, sterilization of top soil and combined application as heating\n* In wineries as combination boiler for sterilization and cleaning of storage tanks, tempering of mash and for warm water generation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{aut|Quarles, W.}} (1997): STEAM - The Hottest Alternative to Methyl Bromide.

Pests of plant cultures such as weeds, bacteria, fungi and viruses are killed through induced hot steam which causes vital cellular proteins to  [[Protein folding|unfold]]. Biologically, the method is considered a partial disinfection. Important heat-resistant, spore-forming bacteria can survive and revitalize the soil after cooling down. Soil fatigue can be cured through the release of nutritive substances blocked within the soil. Steaming leads to a better starting position, quicker growth and strengthened resistance against plant disease and pests. Today, the application of hot steam is considered the best and most effective way to disinfect sick soil, potting soil and compost. \nIt is being used as an alternative to [[bromomethane]], whose production and use was curtailed by the [[Montreal Protocol]]. \"Steam effectively kills pathogens by heating the soil to levels that cause [[protein]] coagulation or [[enzyme]] inactivation.\"<ref name=gov>[http://www.epa.gov/ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume3/steam3.html EPA] Steam as an Alternative to Methyl Bromide in Nursery Crops</ref>\n\n==Benefits of soil steaming==\nSoil sterilization provides secure and quick relief of soils from substances and organisms harmful to plants such as:\n* Bacteria\n* Viruses\n* Fungi\n* [[Nematodes]] and\n* Other Pests\n\nFurther positive effects are:\n\n* All weed and weed seeds are killed<ref>Research report of DLR Rheinlandpfalz, September 2010: [http://www.soil-steaming-steam-boiler-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steaming-research-results_dlr2010.pdf'' Weed control in seed cultures, especially  arugula''], Author: Dr. Norbert Laun, Institute \"Queckbrunnerhof\", Schifferstadt (Germany).

Soil only absorbs a small amount of humidity. Micro organisms become active once the soil has cooled down. This creates an optimal environment for instant tillage with seedlings and seeds. \nAdditionally the method of integrated steaming can promote a target-oriented resettlement of steamed soil with beneficial organisms. In the process, the soil is first freed from all organisms and then revitalized and microbiologically buffered through the injection of a soil activator based on compost which contains a natural mixture of favorable microorganisms (e.g. ''Bacillus subtilis'', etc.).\n\nDifferent types of such steam application are also available in practice, including substrate steaming, surface steaming and deep soil steaming.\n\n\n\n\n==Surface steaming==\nSeveral methods for surface steaming are in use amongst which are: area sheet steaming, the steaming hood, the steaming harrow, the steaming plough and vacuum steaming with drainage pipes or mobile pipe systems.\n\nIn order to pick the most suitable steaming method, certain factors have to be considered such as soil structure, plant culture and area performance. At present, more advanced methods are being developed, such as sandwich steaming or partially integrated sandwich steaming in order to minimize energy consumption and associated costs as much as possible.\n\n==Deep soil steaming==\nDeep soil steaming is a concept adopted by the Norwegian company Soil Steam international AS. They have developed a technology that manages to get the steam 30-40 cm deep in the soil. This is done in a continous process and their last prototype managed to treat 1 hectare in 10 hours. When steaming the soil this deep, they get deep enough to avvoid that the farmer brings up new seeds, fungi or nematodes when he plows in the fall. This means that the treatment last for many years as the soil stays free from weeds, seeds, fungi and nematodes for many years after one deep soil steam opperation. See more info on soilsteam.com\n\n\n===Sheet steaming===\n\nSurface steaming with special sheets (sheet steaming) is a method which has been established for decades in order to steam large areas reaching from 15 to 400 m<sup>2</sup> in one step. If properly applied, sheet steaming is simple and highly economic. The usage of heat resistant, non-decomposing insulation fleece saves up to 50% energy, reduces the steaming time significantly and improves penetration. Single working step areas up to 400 m<sup>2</sup> can be steamed in 4\u20135 hours down to 25\u201330&nbsp;cm depth / 90&nbsp;\u00b0C. \nThe usage of heat resistant and non-decomposing synthetic insulation fleece, 5&nbsp;mm thick, 500 gr / m<sup>2</sup>, can reduce steaming time by about 30%. Through a steam injector or a perforated pipe, steam is injected underneath the sheet after it has been laid out and weighted with sand sacks.\n\nThe area performance in one working step depends on the capacity of the steam generator (e.g. steam boiler):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Steam capacity kg/h:\n! 100\n! 250\n! 300\n! 400\n! 550\n! 800\n! 1000\n! 1350\n! 2000\n|-\n| '''Area m<sup>2</sup>:'''\n| 15\u201320\n| 30\u201350\n| 50\u201365\n| 60\u201390\n| 80\u2013120\n| 130\u2013180\n| 180\u2013220\n| 220\u2013270\n| 300\u2013400\n|}\n\nThe steaming time depends on soil structure as well as outside temperature and amounts to 1\u20131.5 hours per 10&nbsp;cm steaming depth. Hereby the soil reaches a temperature of about 85&nbsp;\u00b0C. Milling for soil loosening is not recommended since soil structure may become too fine which reduces its penetrability for steam. The usage of spading machines is ideal for soil loosening. The best results can be achieved if the soil is cloddy at greater depth and granulated at lesser depth.\n\nIn practice, working with at least two sheets simultaneously has proven to be highly effective. While one sheet is used for steaming the other one is prepared for steam injection, therefore unnecessary steaming recesses are avoided.\n\n===Depth steaming with vacuum===\nSteaming with vacuum which is induced through a mobile or fixed installed pipe system in the depth of the area to be steamed, is the method that reaches the best penetration. Despite high capital cost, the fixed installation of drainage systems is reasonable for intensively used areas  since steaming depths of up to 80&nbsp;cm can be achieved.\n\nIn contrast to fixed installed drainage systems, pipes in mobile suction systems are on the surface. A central suction pipeline consisting of zinc-coated, fast-coupling pipes are connected in a regular spacing of 1.50 m and the ends of the hoses are pushed into the soil to the desired depth with a special tool.\n\nThe steaming area is covered with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced in the middle of the sheet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. \nAs soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on.  First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward.\n \nDuring the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet.\n     \nAs with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20\u201330 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10&nbsp;cm steaming depth.  The steam requirement is approximately 7\u20138&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.\n    \nThe most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.\n\n====Negative pressure technique====\nNegative pressure technique generates appropriate soil temperature at a 60&nbsp;cm depth and complete control of [[nematode]]s, [[fungi]] and [[weed]]s is achieved. In this technique, the steam is introduced under the steaming sheath and forced to enter the soil profile by a negative pressure. The negative pressure is created by a fan that sucks the air out of the soil through buried perforated [[polypropylene]] pipes. This system requires a permanent installation of perforated pipes into the soil, at a depth of at least 60&nbsp;cm to be protected from [[plough]].<ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/004/Y1809E/y1809e07.htm FAO] Global report on validated alternatives to the use of methyl bromide for soil</ref>\n\n===Steaming with hoods===\n<!-- [[Image:Vollautomat9.jpg|thumb|right|Fully automatic steaming robot with steaming hoods]] -->\n[[Image:haube.jpeg|thumb|right|Half automatic steaming hood with three wings in greenhouse]]\n\nA steaming hood is a mobile device consisting of corrosion-resistant materials such as aluminum, which is put down onto the area to be steamed. In contrast to sheet steaming, cost-intensive working steps such as laying out and weighting the sheets don't occur, however the area steamed per working step is smaller in accordance to the size of the hood.\n\nOutdoors, a hood is positioned either manually or via tractor with a special pre-stressed  4 point suspension arm. Steaming time amounts to 30 min for a penetration down to 25&nbsp;cm depth. Hereby a temperature of 90&nbsp;\u00b0C can be reached. In large stable glasshouses, the hoods are attached to tracks. They are lifted and moved by pneumatic cylinders. Small and medium-sized hoods up to 12 m<sup>2</sup> are lifted manually using a tipping lever or moved electrically with special winches.\n\n===Combined surface and depth injection of steam (Sandwich Steaming)===\n\n[[Image:sandwichdaempfung.jpg|thumb|right|Sandwich steaming machine model Sterilter constructed by Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche equipped with MSD/moeschle steam boiler]]\n\nSandwich steaming, which was developed in a project among DEIAFA, University of Turin (Italy, www.deiafa.unito.it) and Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche (see image), represents a combination of depth and surface steaming, offers an efficient method to induce hot steam into the soil. The steam is simultaneously pushed into the soil from the surface and from the depth. For this purpose, the area, which must be equipped with a deep steaming injection system, is covered with a steaming hood. The steam enters the soil from the top and the bottom at the same time. Sheets are not suitable, since a high pressure up to 30&nbsp;mm water column arises underneath the cover.\n\nSandwich steaming offers several advantages. On the one hand, application of energy can be increased to up to 120&nbsp;kg steam per m<sup>2</sup>/h. In comparison to other steaming methods up to 30% energy savings can be achieved and the usage of fuel (e.g. heating oil) accordingly decreases. The increased application of energy leads to a quick heating of the soil which reduces the loss of heat. On the other hand, only half of the regular steaming time is needed.\n\nComparison of sandwich steaming with other steam injection methods relating to steam output and energy demand(*):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Steaming method\n! Max. steam output\n! Energy demand (*)\n|-\n| '''Sheet steaming'''\n| 6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 100&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| '''Depth steaming (Sheet + vacuum)'''\n| 14&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 120&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| '''Hood steaming (Alu)'''\n| 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 80&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| '''Hood steaming (Steel)\t'''\n| 50&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 75&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n| '''Sandwich steaming'''\n| 120&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>h\n| about 60&nbsp;kg steam/m<sup>3</sup>\n|}\n\n(*) in soil max 30% moisture\n\nClearly, Sandwich steaming reaches the highest steam output at the lowest energy demand.\n\n===Partially integrated sandwich steaming===\nThe partial integrated sandwich steaming is an advanced combined method for steaming merely the areas which shall be planted and purposely leaving out those areas which shall not be used. In order to avoid risk of re-infection of steamed areas with pest from unsteamed areas, beneficial organisms can directly be injected into the hygenized soil via a soil activator (e.g. special compost). The partial sandwich steaming unlocks further potential savings in the steaming process.\n\n==Container / Stack steaming==\nStack steaming is used when thermically treating compost and substrates such as turf. Depending on the amount, the material to be steamed is piled up to 70&nbsp;cm height in steaming boxes or in small dump trailers. Steam is evenly injected via manifolds. For huge amounts, steaming containers and soil boxes are used which are equipped with suction systems to improve steaming results. Midget amounts can be steamed in special small steaming devices.\n\nThe amount of soil steamed should be tuned in a way that steaming time amounts to at most 1.5 h in order to avoid large quantities of condensed water in the bottom layers of the soil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Steam Output kg/h:\n! 100\n! 250\n! 300\n! 400\n! 550\n! 800\n! 1000\n! 1350\n! 2000\n|-\n| '''m<sup>3</sup>/h about:'''\n| 1.0\u20131.5\n| 2.5\u20133.0\n| 3.0\u20133.5\n| 4.0\u20135.0\n| 5.5\u20137.0\n| 8.0\u201310.0\n| 10.0\u201313.0\n| 14.0\u201318.0\n| 20.0\u201325.0\n|}\n\nIn light substrates, such as turf, the performance per hour is significantly higher.\n\n==History==\nModern soil steam sterilization was first discovered in 1888 (by Frank in Germany) and was first commercially used in the United States (by Rudd) in 1893 (Baker 1962). Since then, a wide variety of steam machines have been built to disinfest both commercial greenhouse and nursery field soils (Grossman and Liebman 1995). In the 1950s, for example, steam sterilization technologies expanded from disinfestation of potting soil and greenhouse mixes to commercial production of steam rakes and tractor-drawn steam blades for fumigating small acres of cut flowers and other high-value field crops (Langedijk 1959). Today, even more effective steam technologies are being developed.<ref name=gov/>\n\n==Application of hot steam ==\n* In horticulture as well as nurseries for sterilization of substrates and top soil\n* In agriculture for sterilization and treatment of food waste for pig fattening and heating of molasses\n* In mushroom cultivation for pasteurization of  growing rooms, sterilization of top soil and combined application as heating\n* In wineries as combination boiler for sterilization and cleaning of storage tanks, tempering of mash and for warm water generation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{aut|Quarles, W.}} (1997): STEAM - The Hottest Alternative to Methyl Bromide.

The film is a parable and marked the debut of [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] writer and director [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]]. It is a co-production among companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Italy, France, Belgium and the UK. The film won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for  [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2001.\n\n==Plot== \nTwo wounded soldiers, a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] (\u010ciki, portrayed by [[Branko \u0110uri\u0107]]) and a [[Bosnian Serbs|Bosnian Serb]] (Nino, portrayed by [[Rene Bitorajac]]) are caught between their lines in the no man's land, in a struggle for survival.  The two soldiers confront each other in a trench, where they wait for dark. They trade insults and even find some common ground. Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier (Cera, portrayed by [[Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107]]) who wakes from unconsciousness. A [[land mine]] had been buried beneath him by the Bosnian Serbs; should he make any move, it would be fatal.\n\nA [[French Army|French]] sergeant (Marchand, portrayed by Georges Siatidis), of the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), gets involved in effort to help the three trapped soldiers, despite initial orders to the contrary by high command. UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia was to guard the [[humanitarian aid]] convoys, to remain neutral and act as a mere bystander. Luckily, an [[English people|English]] reporter arrives on scene, bringing media pressure to bear that moves the United Nations high command to swing into action to try to save the soldiers.\n\nA row between the stressed out and fatigued \u010ciki and Nino gradually escalates even after being rescued.

The film is a parable and marked the debut of [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] writer and director [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]]. It is a co-production among companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Italy, France, Belgium and the UK. The film won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for  [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2001.\n\n==Plot== \nTwo wounded soldiers, a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] (\u010ciki, portrayed by [[Branko \u0110uri\u0107]]) and a [[Bosnian Serbs|Bosnian Serb]] (Nino, portrayed by [[Rene Bitorajac]]) are caught between their lines in the no man's land, in a struggle for survival.  The two soldiers confront each other in a trench, where they wait for dark. They trade insults and even find some common ground. Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier (Cera, portrayed by [[Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107]]) who wakes from unconsciousness. A [[land mine]] had been buried beneath him by the Bosnian Serbs; should he make any move, it would be fatal.\n\nA [[French Army|French]] sergeant (Marchand, portrayed by Georges Siatidis), of the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), gets involved in effort to help the three trapped soldiers, despite initial orders to the contrary by high command. UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia was to guard the [[humanitarian aid]] convoys, to remain neutral and act as a mere bystander. Luckily, an [[English people|English]] reporter arrives on scene, bringing media pressure to bear that moves the United Nations high command to swing into action to try to save the soldiers.\n\nA row between the stressed out and fatigued \u010ciki and Nino gradually escalates even after being rescued. Eventually, \u010ciki shoots Nino and is in turn shot by a Peacekeeper. Meanwhile, it is found that the mine cannot be defused. The UNPROFOR high command tries to save face: they lie, saying that Cera has been saved and they leave the area, along with the reporters and everyone else.\n\nIn reality, Cera is left alone and desolate in the trenches, still immobilized by the mine. Meanwhile, the UNPROFOR commander has arranged false information to be passed to both Bosnian and Serb troops, to make them believe their enemies will be trying to reoccupy the trench at night (which each side would try to counter with an [[artillery]] barrage that presumably will kill Cera and obliterate the evidence).\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Branko \u0110uri\u0107]] - \u010ciki\n*[[Rene Bitorajac]] - Nino\n*[[Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107]] - Cera\n*Georges Siatidis -  Sergeant Marchand\n*Serge-Henri Valcke - Captain Dubois\n*Sacha Kremer - Michel\n*Alain Eloy - Pierre\n*[[Mustafa Nadarevi\u0107]] - Older Serbian soldier\n*[[Bogdan Dikli\u0107]] - Serbian officer\n*[[Boro Stjepanovi\u0107]] - Bosnian soldier\n*[[Simon Callow]] - Colonel Soft\n*[[Katrin Cartlidge]] - Jane Livingstone, journalist\n*[[Tanja Ribi\u010d]] - Martha\n*Branko Zavr\u0161an - Deminer\n\n==Accolades==\nSome of the awadrs that the film won are:\n*[[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], 2002 [[74th Academy Awards]]\n*[[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], 2002 [[59th Golden Globe Awards]]\n*Best Screenplay Award, [[European Film Academy]]\n*[[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Screenplay]], [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2001865/year/2001.html |title=Festival de Cannes: No Man's Land |accessdate=2009-10-17|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Wicked Spring]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0283509|No Man's Land}}\n*{{allrovi movie|246243|No Man's Land}}\n*{{mojo title|nomansland|No Man's Land}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|no_mans_land|No Man's Land}}\n*{{metacritic film|no-mans-land|No Man's Land}}\n\n{{Danis Tanovi\u0107}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Awards for ''No Man's Land''\n|list1=\n{{AcademyAwardBestForeignLanguageFilm 2001\u20132020}}\n{{Andr\u00e9 Cavens Award 2001\u20132020}}\n{{C\u00e9sar Award for Best First Feature Film}}\n{{Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film 1990\u20132009}}\n{{Satellite Award Best Foreign Language Film}}\n}}\n{{Bosnian submission for Academy Awards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:No Man's Land}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s war drama films]]\n[[Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:Italian films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:Belgian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:French-language films]]\n[[Category:Best Foreign Language Film Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Bosnian-language films]]\n[[Category:German-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Danis Tanovi\u0107]]\n[[Category:Anti-war films]]\n[[Category:Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Best First Feature Film C\u00e9sar Award winners]]\n[[Category:Bosnian War films]]\n[[Category:Political satire films]]\n[[Category:2000s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about the United Nations]]\n[[Category:French war drama films]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Heart of Sarajevo Award for Best Film winners]]\n[[Category:British war drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s political drama films]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "awadrs->awards -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Land_(2001_film)"}

(Compare with [[pastiche]], which is a \"pasting\" together.)\n\nA collage may sometimes include [[Clipping (publications)|magazine and newspaper clippings]], [[ribbon]]s, [[paint]], bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, [[photograph]]s and other [[found object]]s, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.\n\nThe term ''collage'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early precedents===\nTechniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.<ref name=\"Origins\" /> The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].<ref name=\"Origins\" /> An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}</ref>\nMany institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.<ref>http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview</ref> Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' <ref>[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]</ref> at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].\n\n===Collage and modernism===\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90x144&nbsp;cm, Staatliche Museum, [[Berlin]].]]\nDespite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.\n\nFor example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage \"was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.\".<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage \"Introduction to collage\"]. Tate Gallery website</ref> According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches \"collided with the surface plane of the painting.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works \"gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other,\" according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: \"References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art.\" This juxtaposition of signifiers, \"at once serious and tongue-in-cheek,\" was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: \"Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\n===Collage in painting===\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1913-14, Head (T\u00eate), cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1913-14, ''Head (T\u00eate)'', cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh]]\nCollage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):\n\n\"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\nIn 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e)'',<ref>''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Mus\u00e9e National Picasso Paris</ref> Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.\n\n[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#\u00c9tr\u00e9cissements|etr\u00e9cissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mari\u00ebn]] from a method first explored by Mari\u00ebn. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.\n\nThe [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.\nWesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,<ref>(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)</ref> exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.\n\nAnother technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.\n\n===Collage with wood===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&page_number=5&template_id=1&sort_order=1 MoMA]</ref> part of a series of experimental collages.]] -->\n[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918\u20131986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]</ref> The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.\n\nIn a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/> Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.\n\nIt was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, \"As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/louise-nevelson-sky-cathedral-1958/ |title=Louise Nevelson, Sky Cathedral 1958  |publisher=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81006 |title=Sky Cathedral |work=MoMA Highlights |location=New York |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222</ref> Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.\n\nMuch wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.\n\nFrequently, what is called \"wood collage art\" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable \"[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s\" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)\n\n===Decoupage===\n[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|d\u00e9coup\u00e9e]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]\n{{Main|Decoupage}}\nDecoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].\n\nThere are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].\n\nThe craft became known as d\u00e9coupage in [[France]] (from the verb ''d\u00e9couper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].\n\nThe most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].\n\n===Photomontage===\n{{Main|Photomontage}}\nCollage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.\n[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]\n\n''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white.

G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]\u2019s (1912\u20131988) series of black and white \"photomontage projections\" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8\u00bd \u00d7 11&nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.\n\nThe 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create \"paste-ups\" digitally.\n\nCreating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to \"undo\" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.\n\n===Digital collage===\nDigital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].\n\n===Three-dimensional collage===\nA 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.\n\n===Mosaic===\nIt is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design. Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.\n\n===eCollage===\nThe term \"eCollage\" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools.\n\n===Collage artists===\n<!--NOTE: Please add only existing articles about collage artists.

Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.\n\n===In music===\n[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955\u20131957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]\n{{Main|Sound collage}}\nThe concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that \"[[sound collage|musical collages]]\" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].<ref name=\"timemagazine\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, \"mash-up\" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called \"literature of sound.\" In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).<ref name=\"soundonsound\">{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===In illustration===\nCollage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].\n\n===In artist's books===\n\nCollage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.<ref>https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.\n\nThe [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.\n\n===In fashion design===\nCollage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.\n\n===In film===\n{{main|Collage film}}\nCollage film is traditionally defined as, \u201cA film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.\u201d Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director\u2019s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.\n\n====In post-production====\nThe use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel\u2019s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.\n\n==Legal issues==\nWhen collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.\n\nDue to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].<ref>See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.</ref> Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.\n\nThe copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the \"first sale\" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].<ref>''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)</ref> The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.<ref>See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.</ref> The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.<ref>''Blanch v.

The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.\n\nThe term ''collage'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early precedents===\nTechniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.<ref name=\"Origins\" /> The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].<ref name=\"Origins\" /> An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}</ref>\nMany institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.<ref>http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview</ref> Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' <ref>[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]</ref> at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].\n\n===Collage and modernism===\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90x144&nbsp;cm, Staatliche Museum, [[Berlin]].]]\nDespite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.\n\nFor example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage \"was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.\".<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage \"Introduction to collage\"]. Tate Gallery website</ref> According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches \"collided with the surface plane of the painting.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works \"gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other,\" according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: \"References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art.\" This juxtaposition of signifiers, \"at once serious and tongue-in-cheek,\" was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: \"Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\n===Collage in painting===\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1913-14, Head (T\u00eate), cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1913-14, ''Head (T\u00eate)'', cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh]]\nCollage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):\n\n\"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\nIn 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e)'',<ref>''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Mus\u00e9e National Picasso Paris</ref> Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.\n\n[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#\u00c9tr\u00e9cissements|etr\u00e9cissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mari\u00ebn]] from a method first explored by Mari\u00ebn. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.\n\nThe [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.\nWesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,<ref>(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)</ref> exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.\n\nAnother technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.\n\n===Collage with wood===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&page_number=5&template_id=1&sort_order=1 MoMA]</ref> part of a series of experimental collages.]] -->\n[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918\u20131986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]</ref> The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.\n\nIn a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/> Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.\n\nIt was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, \"As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/louise-nevelson-sky-cathedral-1958/ |title=Louise Nevelson, Sky Cathedral 1958  |publisher=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81006 |title=Sky Cathedral |work=MoMA Highlights |location=New York |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222</ref> Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.\n\nMuch wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.\n\nFrequently, what is called \"wood collage art\" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable \"[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s\" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)\n\n===Decoupage===\n[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|d\u00e9coup\u00e9e]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]\n{{Main|Decoupage}}\nDecoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].\n\nThere are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].\n\nThe craft became known as d\u00e9coupage in [[France]] (from the verb ''d\u00e9couper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].\n\nThe most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].\n\n===Photomontage===\n{{Main|Photomontage}}\nCollage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.\n[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]\n\n''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit.<ref name=tomorrow>[http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm \"This is tomorrow\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063217/http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm |date=2010-01-15 }}, thisistomorrow2.com (scroll to \"image 027TT-1956.jpg\"). Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref> Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.<ref>[http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm \"Just what is it\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121114450/http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, pchelm.com. Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref>\n\nOther methods for combining pictures are also called photomontage, such as Victorian \"combination printing\", the printing from more than one negative on a single piece of printing paper (e.g. [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]\u2019s (1912\u20131988) series of black and white \"photomontage projections\" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8\u00bd \u00d7 11&nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.\n\nThe 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create \"paste-ups\" digitally.\n\nCreating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to \"undo\" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.\n\n===Digital collage===\nDigital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].\n\n===Three-dimensional collage===\nA 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.\n\n===Mosaic===\nIt is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design. Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.\n\n===eCollage===\nThe term \"eCollage\" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools.\n\n===Collage artists===\n<!--NOTE: Please add only existing articles about collage artists.

Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.\n\n===In music===\n[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955\u20131957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]\n{{Main|Sound collage}}\nThe concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that \"[[sound collage|musical collages]]\" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].<ref name=\"timemagazine\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, \"mash-up\" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called \"literature of sound.\" In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).<ref name=\"soundonsound\">{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===In illustration===\nCollage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].\n\n===In artist's books===\n\nCollage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.<ref>https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.\n\nThe [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.\n\n===In fashion design===\nCollage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.\n\n===In film===\n{{main|Collage film}}\nCollage film is traditionally defined as, \u201cA film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.\u201d Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director\u2019s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.\n\n====In post-production====\nThe use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel\u2019s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.\n\n==Legal issues==\nWhen collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.\n\nDue to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].<ref>See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.</ref> Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.\n\nThe copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the \"first sale\" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].<ref>''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)</ref> The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.<ref>See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.</ref> The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.<ref>''Blanch v.

The two triangle-shaped arms form a shroud around the cold target to protect it until they open five seconds before a shot.]]\n\nThe '''National Ignition Facility''' ('''NIF'''), is a large [[laser]]-based [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research device, located at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[Livermore, California]]. NIF uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of [[Fusion power#Fuels|hydrogen fuel]] with the goal of inducing [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. NIF's mission is to achieve [[fusion ignition]] with high [[fusion energy gain factor|energy gain]], and to support [[nuclear weapon]] [[stockpile stewardship|maintenance]] and design by studying the [[equation of state|behavior of matter]] under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.<ref>[https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/ \"About NIF & Photon Science\"], Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</ref> NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.\n\nThe basic concept of all ICF devices is to rapidly collapse a small amount of fuel so the pressure and temperature reach fusion-relevant conditions. NIF does this by heating the outer layer of a small plastic sphere with the world's most powerful [[laser]]. The energy from the laser is so intense that it causes the plastic to explode, squeezing down on the fuel inside. The speed of this process is enormous, with the fuel reaching a peak around 350&nbsp;km/s,<ref>{{ref web |url=https://www.theengineer.co.uk/tracing-the-sources-of-nuclear-fusion/ |first=Stuart |last=Nathan |title=Tracing the sources of nuclear fusion |website=The Engineer}}</ref> raising the density from about that of water to about 100 times that of [[lead]]. The delivery of energy and the [[adiabatic process]] during collapse raises the temperature of the fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees.

The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). The energy of the laser heats the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inward, eventually compressing it into a small point of extremely high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels toward the center of the compressed fuel from all sides. When it reaches the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed to a greater degree. When the temperature and density of that small spot are raised high enough, fusion reactions occur and release energy.<ref name=how>[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ \"How NIF works\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

If this process deposits enough energy in a given area it can cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. However, the fuel is also losing heat through [[x-ray]] losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area, so the rate of alpha heating must be greater than these losses, a condition known as ''bootstrapping''.<ref name=hurricane>{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/climbing-mountain-fusion-ignition-interview-omar-hurricane |title=Climbing the mountain of fusion ignition: an interview with Omar Hurricane |website=LLNL}}</ref> Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel\u2014high enough density and temperature\u2014this bootstrapping process will result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction.

The laser energy also must be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other drivers have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in [[particle accelerator]]s, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.<ref>Per F.

This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an [[ytterbium]]-doped optical [[fiber laser]] known as the Master Oscillator.<ref>P.J. Wisoff et al., ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..146W NIF Injection Laser System]'', Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5341, pages 146\u2013155</ref>  The light from the Master Oscillator is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a [[neodymium]] glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6&nbsp;joules. According to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.<ref>''[http://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the NIF]'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

On the left are the amplifiers and [[Pockels effect|optical switch]], and on the right is the final spatial filter, switchyard and [[optical frequency multiplier|optical frequency converter]].]]\n\nThe main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] by a total of 7,680 [[xenon flash lamp]]s (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a [[capacitor]] bank which stores a total of 422&nbsp;MJ (117&nbsp;kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent thRough the main amplifier section four times, using an [[Pockels effect|optical switch]] located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6&nbsp;J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4&nbsp;MJ.<ref name=how/> Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500&nbsp;TW.\n\nNear the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are ''[[spatial filter]]s''. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a [[photomask|mask]] cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the [[Cyclops laser]], an earlier LLNL experiment.\n\nThe total length of the path the laser beam propagates from one end to the other, including switches, is about {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}. The various optical elements in the beamlines are generally packaged into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), standardized boxes about the size of a vending machine that can be dropped out of the beamline for replacement from below.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.538467 |bibcode=2004SPIE.5341..127L |chapter=NIF laser line-replaceable units (LRUs) |title=Optical Engineering at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory II: The National Ignition Facility |volume=5341 |page=127 |year=2004 |last1=Larson |first1=Doug W. |chapter-url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1410354/ |editor1-last=Lane |editor1-first=Monya A |editor2-last=Wuest |editor2-first=Craig R }}</ref>\n\nAfter the amplification is complete the light is switched back into the beamline, where it runs to the far end of the building to the ''target chamber''.

Wegner et al.,''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..180W NIF final optics system: frequency conversion and beam conditioning]'', Proceedings of SPIE 5341, May 2004, pages 180\u2013189.</ref> These are made of thin sheets (about 1&nbsp;cm thick) cut from a single crystal of [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]. When the 1053&nbsp;nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527&nbsp;nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527&nbsp;nm light and the remaining 1053&nbsp;nm light into 351&nbsp;nm (UV) light. [[Infrared]] (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot [[electrons]] which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat [[time|temporal]] shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8&nbsp;MJ.<ref>Bibeau, Camille; Paul J.

In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually in order to keep the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against those losses. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear ''burn''. Ignition is considered a key requirement if [[fusion power]] is to ever become practical.<ref name=econ/>\n\nNIF is designed primarily to use the ''indirect drive'' method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a [[hohlraum]] (German for \"hollow room\", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense [[X-ray]]s, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the [[OMEGA laser|OMEGA]] and [[Nova laser]]s, validated this approach through the late 1980s.<ref>J.D.

During these meetings, the idea later known as [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of small [[hydrogen bomb]]s in large caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls/>\n\nThere are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium-based fission bomb known as the ''primary'', and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the ''secondary''. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes ignition. The secondary consists of [[lithium deuteride]] fuel, which requires an external neutron source to begin the reaction. This is normally in the form of a small plutonium \"spark plug\" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with D-T gas, removing the need for the spark plug. At that point there is no theoretical smallest size - as the secondary got smaller, so did the amount of energy needed to reach ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls>John Nuckolls, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf \"Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)\"], LLNL, 12 June 1998</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed the outlines of the ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5&nbsp;MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1&nbsp;MJ beam.<ref name=\"EarlyNuckolls\"/> To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5&nbsp;kt releases 2 million MJ in total.<ref>[http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html \"Convert kilotons, to megajoules\"], Unit Juggler</ref><ref>Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, p. 129</ref><ref>John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.</ref>\n\n===ICF program begins===\nWhile Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon designer [[Ray Kidder]] was working on the direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed [[KMS Fusion]] to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now a hot topic and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls/> LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]) or KrF (e.g. [[Nike laser]], [[Naval Research Laboratory]]).\n\nThroughout these early stages of development, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily [[LASNEX]]. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the [[Shiva laser]] project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to [[electron]]s rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.\n\nFurther upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system emerged as the 20-beam 200&nbsp;kJ [[Nova laser]] concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351&nbsp;nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency.<ref name=peer>{{cite techreport |first1=Matthew |last1=McKinzie |first2=Christopher |last2=Paine |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nif2/findings.asp |title=When Peer Review Fails |publisher=NDRC}}</ref> In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30&nbsp;kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.\n\n===Halite and Centurion===\nWith each experiment, the predicted energy needed to reach ignition rose, and it was not clear that post-Nova predictions were any more accurate than earlier ones. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the [[Nevada Test Site]] that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite or Centurion depending on which lab ran it, LLNL or LANL.\n\nEach test was able to simultaneously illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy and the size of the fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted.<ref name=secretadvance>{{cite newspaper |title=Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among Scientists |first=William |last=Broad |date=21 March 1988 |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/21/us/secret-advance-in-nuclear-fusion-spurs-a-dispute-among-scientists.html}}</ref> During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.<ref>John Lindl, \"A strategy for determining the driver requirements for high gain ICF implosions utilizing hydrodynamically equivalent capsules on Nova laser\", Laser Annual Program Report, 1981, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Livermore, CA, UCRL-50055-80/81, pp.2-29-2-57 (unpublished)</ref>\n\nData from the tests suggested that about 10&nbsp;MJ of x-ray energy would be needed to reach ignition.<ref name=secretadvance/><ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Math+society+says+no+to+SDI+funding.-a06540237 \"Laser advance amid pros and con(fusion)s of DOE fusion path\"], Free Online Library, 1988</ref><ref>John Lindl, Rober McCrory and Michael Campbell, [http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~phy189h1/Ignition%20and%20Inertial%20Confinement%20Fusion.pdf \"Progress Toward Ignition and Burn Propagation in Inertial Confinement Fusion\"], ''Physics Today'', September 1992, pp. 32-40.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/10455/|title=Infighting Among Rival Theorists Imperils 'Hot' Fusion Lab Plan|author=|date=|website=The Scientist}}</ref><ref>Phillip Schewe and Ben Stein, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Lindl.txt \"Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Article Announcement\"], ''Physics News'', 25 October 1995</ref> If this energy is supplied by an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original laser energy on the order of 100&nbsp;MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies.<ref name=secretadvance/>\n\nA great debate broke out in the ICF establishment as a result.<ref name=secretadvance/> One group suggested that they attempt to build a laser of this power; [[Leonardo Mascheroni]] and Claude Phipps designed a new type of [[hydrogen fluoride laser]] that was pumped by high-energy [[electron]]s that would be able to reach the 100&nbsp;MJ limit.

LMF would use a driver on the order of 10&nbsp;MJ, delivering fusion yields of between 100 and 1,000&nbsp;MJ. A 1989/90 review of this concept by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] suggested that the LMF was too large a step to make at once, and that fundamental physics issues still needed to be explored. They recommended further experiments before attempting to move to a 10&nbsp;MJ system.

The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept, with a driver of about 1&nbsp;MJ.<ref>Tobin, M.T et all, ''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/578/5735/00218762.pdf?tp=&isnumber=&arnumber=218762 Target area for Nova Upgrade: containing ignition and beyond]'', Fusion Engineering, 1991, pg. 650\u2013655.

The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500&nbsp;TW in a 4&nbsp;ns pulse. The upgrades were expected to allow the new Nova to produce fusion yields of between 2 and 10&nbsp;MJ.<ref name=upgrade/> The initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around $400&nbsp;million, with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999.\n\n===NIF emerges===\nThroughout this period, the ending of the [[Cold War]] led to dramatic changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons.<ref>William Broad, ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D9133DF932A15755C0A962958260 Vast Laser Plan Would Further Fusion and Keep Bomb Experts]'', New York Times, June 21, 1994.

This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.\n\n[[File:Preamplifier at the National Ignition Facility.jpg|left|400px|thumb|The preamplifiers of the National Ignition Facility are the first step in increasing the energy of laser beams as they make their way toward the target chamber.

In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments,<ref>Letter from Charles Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, June 15, 1995</ref>{{efn|It is not clearly stated why Nova Upgrade would be too small for SSMP, no reason is given in the available resources.}} and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1&nbsp;billion,<ref>1.9 Cost (NIF CDR, Chapter 9)</ref> with completion in 2002.\n\nIn spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in several highly critical comments by scientists at other weapons labs, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had \"virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues\" and that \"Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves\".<ref>\"Livermore's costly fusion laser won't fly, scientists say\", Albuquerque Tribune, May 29, 1997, p. 1</ref> A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: \"NIF is worthless ... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period\".<ref>L.

Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing.<ref name=peer/> Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350&nbsp;million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.<ref name=GAO1/>\n\n===Re-baseline and GAO report===\n[[File:Bill Richardson, official DOE photo.png|thumb|Bill Richardson began a review process that brought NIF construction back under control.]]\n\nThroughout this period the problems with NIF were not being reported up the management chain.

However, a number of problems slowed the drive toward ignition-level laser energies in the 1.4 to 1.5 MJ range.\n\nProgress was initially slowed by the potential for damage from overheating due to a concentration of energy on optical components that is greater than anything previously attempted.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=superlaser-national-ignition-facility |title=Superlaser fires a blank |author=Eugenie Samuel Reich  |date=October 18, 2010 |magazine=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=2010-10-02 }}</ref> Other issues included problems layering the fuel inside the targets, and minute quantities of dust being found on the capsule surface.<ref name=kramerreview>David Kramer, [http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html \"NIF overcomes some problems, receives mixed review from its DOE overseer\"], ''Physics Today'', 21 April 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430001208/http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html |date=April 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAs the power was increased and targets of increasing sophistication were used, another problem appeared that was causing an asymmetric implosion. This was eventually traced to minute amounts of water vapor in the target chamber which froze to the windows on the ends of the hohlraums. This was solved by re-designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window.<ref name=\"kramerreview\"/> Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science, visited the lab for an update on the NIC on 23 April, the day after the window problem was announced as solved.

As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced Radiographic Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence.\n\nARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (10<sup>15</sup>) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional radiographic techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world's highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/photons-fusion/2014/may|title= Photons & Fusion Newsletter - May 2014|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= May 2014|website= National Ignition Facility & Photon Science News - Archive - Photons & Fusion Newsletter|publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n\nNIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target to very high precision.

Crandall, Advisor on National Security and Inertial Fusion, Koonin being precluded to chair the review because of a conflict of interest. The review was conducted with the same external reviewers, who had previously served Koonin. Each provided their report independently, with their own estimate of the probability of achieving ignition within the plan, i.e. before December 31, 2012. The conclusion of the review was published on July 19, 2012.<ref name=\"Crandall\">\n{{cite web\n| url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_report_rev5_koonin_2012.pdf\n| title=External Review of the National Ignition Campaign\n| publisher=[[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe previous review dated January 31, 2012, identified a number of experimental improvements that have been completed or are under way.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/> The new report unanimously praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, operations have all been outstanding, however:\n:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging. (Crandall&nbsp;Memo&nbsp;2012,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;2)\n\nFurther, the report members express deep concerns on the gaps between observed performance and ICF simulation codes such that the current codes are of a limited utility going forward. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser-plasma interactions. These effects lead to pressure being one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo page 5 discusses the mix of ablator material and capsule fuel due likely to hydrodynamics instabilities in the outer surface of the ablator.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/>\n\nThe report goes on to suggest that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this increases its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also keep in mind that [[Nd:YAG laser|neodymium lasers]] can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=5}} The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/>\n\n===Ignition fails, focus shifts, LIFE ends===\nThe NIC officially ended on September 30, 2012 without achieving ignition.

NIF uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of [[Fusion power#Fuels|hydrogen fuel]] with the goal of inducing [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. NIF's mission is to achieve [[fusion ignition]] with high [[fusion energy gain factor|energy gain]], and to support [[nuclear weapon]] [[stockpile stewardship|maintenance]] and design by studying the [[equation of state|behavior of matter]] under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.<ref>[https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/ \"About NIF & Photon Science\"], Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</ref> NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.\n\nThe basic concept of all ICF devices is to rapidly collapse a small amount of fuel so the pressure and temperature reach fusion-relevant conditions. NIF does this by heating the outer layer of a small plastic sphere with the world's most powerful [[laser]]. The energy from the laser is so intense that it causes the plastic to explode, squeezing down on the fuel inside. The speed of this process is enormous, with the fuel reaching a peak around 350&nbsp;km/s,<ref>{{ref web |url=https://www.theengineer.co.uk/tracing-the-sources-of-nuclear-fusion/ |first=Stuart |last=Nathan |title=Tracing the sources of nuclear fusion |website=The Engineer}}</ref> raising the density from about that of water to about 100 times that of [[lead]]. The delivery of energy and the [[adiabatic process]] during collapse raises the temperature of the fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees. At these temperatures, fusion processes occur very rapidly, before the energy generated in the fuel causes it to explode outward as well.\n\nConstruction on the NIF began in 1997 but management problems and technical delays slowed progress into the early 2000s. Progress after 2000 was smoother, but compared to initial estimates, NIF was completed five years behind schedule and was almost four times more expensive than originally budgeted.

The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). The energy of the laser heats the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inward, eventually compressing it into a small point of extremely high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels toward the center of the compressed fuel from all sides. When it reaches the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed to a greater degree. When the temperature and density of that small spot are raised high enough, fusion reactions occur and release energy.<ref name=how>[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ \"How NIF works\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

If this process deposits enough energy in a given area it can cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. However, the fuel is also losing heat through [[x-ray]] losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area, so the rate of alpha heating must be greater than these losses, a condition known as ''bootstrapping''.<ref name=hurricane>{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/climbing-mountain-fusion-ignition-interview-omar-hurricane |title=Climbing the mountain of fusion ignition: an interview with Omar Hurricane |website=LLNL}}</ref> Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel\u2014high enough density and temperature\u2014this bootstrapping process will result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction.

The design uses 192 beamlines in a parallel system of flashlamp-pumped, neodymium-doped phosphate glass lasers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Press release: NNSA and LLNL announce first successful integrated experiment at NIF|url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/nnsa-and-llnl-announce-first-successful-integrated-experiment-nif|work=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=6 October 2010|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that the output of the beamlines is uniform, the initial laser light is amplified from a single source in the Injection Laser System (ILS). This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an [[ytterbium]]-doped optical [[fiber laser]] known as the Master Oscillator.<ref>P.J. Wisoff et al., ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..146W NIF Injection Laser System]'', Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5341, pages 146\u2013155</ref>  The light from the Master Oscillator is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a [[neodymium]] glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6&nbsp;joules. According to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.<ref>''[http://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the NIF]'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

On the left are the amplifiers and [[Pockels effect|optical switch]], and on the right is the final spatial filter, switchyard and [[optical frequency multiplier|optical frequency converter]].]]\n\nThe main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] by a total of 7,680 [[xenon flash lamp]]s (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a [[capacitor]] bank which stores a total of 422&nbsp;MJ (117&nbsp;kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the main amplifier section four times, using an [[Pockels effect|optical switch]] located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6&nbsp;J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4&nbsp;MJ.<ref name=how/> Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500&nbsp;TW.\n\nNear the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are ''[[spatial filter]]s''. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a [[photomask|mask]] cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the [[Cyclops laser]], an earlier LLNL experiment.\n\nThe total length of the path the laser beam propagates from one end to the other, including switches, is about {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}.

When the 1053&nbsp;nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527&nbsp;nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527&nbsp;nm light and the remaining 1053&nbsp;nm light into 351&nbsp;nm (UV) light. [[Infrared]] (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot [[electrons]] which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat [[time|temporal]] shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8&nbsp;MJ.<ref>Bibeau, Camille; Paul J.

In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually in order to keep the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against those losses. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear ''burn''. Ignition is considered a key requirement if [[fusion power]] is to ever become practical.<ref name=econ/>\n\nNIF is designed primarily to use the ''indirect drive'' method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a [[hohlraum]] (German for \"hollow room\", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense [[X-ray]]s, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the [[OMEGA laser|OMEGA]] and [[Nova laser]]s, validated this approach through the late 1980s.<ref>J.D.

During these meetings, the idea later known as [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of small [[hydrogen bomb]]s in large caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls/>\n\nThere are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium-based fission bomb known as the ''primary'', and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the ''secondary''. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes ignition. The secondary consists of [[lithium deuteride]] fuel, which requires an external neutron source to begin the reaction. This is normally in the form of a small plutonium \"spark plug\" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with D-T gas, removing the need for the spark plug. At that point there is no theoretical smallest size - as the secondary got smaller, so did the amount of energy needed to reach ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls>John Nuckolls, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf \"Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)\"], LLNL, 12 June 1998</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed the outlines of the ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5&nbsp;MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1&nbsp;MJ beam.<ref name=\"EarlyNuckolls\"/> To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5&nbsp;kt releases 2 million MJ in total.<ref>[http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html \"Convert kilotons, to megajoules\"], Unit Juggler</ref><ref>Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, p. 129</ref><ref>John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.</ref>\n\n===ICF program begins===\nWhile Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon designer [[Ray Kidder]] was working on the direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed [[KMS Fusion]] to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now a hot topic and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls/> LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]) or KrF (e.g. [[Nike laser]], [[Naval Research Laboratory]]).\n\nThroughout these early stages of development, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily [[LASNEX]]. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the [[Shiva laser]] project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to [[electron]]s rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.\n\nFurther upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system emerged as the 20-beam 200&nbsp;kJ [[Nova laser]] concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351&nbsp;nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency.<ref name=peer>{{cite techreport |first1=Matthew |last1=McKinzie |first2=Christopher |last2=Paine |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nif2/findings.asp |title=When Peer Review Fails |publisher=NDRC}}</ref> In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30&nbsp;kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.\n\n===Halite and Centurion===\nWith each experiment, the predicted energy needed to reach ignition rose, and it was not clear that post-Nova predictions were any more accurate than earlier ones. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the [[Nevada Test Site]] that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite or Centurion depending on which lab ran it, LLNL or LANL.\n\nEach test was able to simultaneously illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988.

LMF would use a driver on the order of 10&nbsp;MJ, delivering fusion yields of between 100 and 1,000&nbsp;MJ. A 1989/90 review of this concept by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] suggested that the LMF was too large a step to make at once, and that fundamental physics issues still needed to be explored. They recommended further experiments before attempting to move to a 10&nbsp;MJ system.

The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept, with a driver of about 1&nbsp;MJ.<ref>Tobin, M.T et all, ''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/578/5735/00218762.pdf?tp=&isnumber=&arnumber=218762 Target area for Nova Upgrade: containing ignition and beyond]'', Fusion Engineering, 1991, pg. 650\u2013655.

The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500&nbsp;TW in a 4&nbsp;ns pulse.

As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons.<ref>William Broad, ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D9133DF932A15755C0A962958260 Vast Laser Plan Would Further Fusion and Keep Bomb Experts]'', New York Times, June 21, 1994.

This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.\n\n[[File:Preamplifier at the National Ignition Facility.jpg|left|400px|thumb|The preamplifiers of the National Ignition Facility are the first step in increasing the energy of laser beams as they make their way toward the target chamber.

In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments,<ref>Letter from Charles Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, June 15, 1995</ref>{{efn|It is not clearly stated why Nova Upgrade would be too small for SSMP, no reason is given in the available resources.}} and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1&nbsp;billion,<ref>1.9 Cost (NIF CDR, Chapter 9)</ref> with completion in 2002.\n\nIn spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in several highly critical comments by scientists at other weapons labs, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had \"virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues\" and that \"Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves\".<ref>\"Livermore's costly fusion laser won't fly, scientists say\", Albuquerque Tribune, May 29, 1997, p. 1</ref> A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: \"NIF is worthless ... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period\".<ref>L. Spohn, \"NIF opponents to cite criticism of laser in court battle\", Albuquerque Tribune, June 13, 1997, p. A15.</ref>\n\nA contrasting view was expressed by Victor Reis, assistant secretary for Defense Programs within DOE and the chief architect of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Reis told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee in 1997 that NIF was \"designed to produce, for the first time in a laboratory setting, conditions of temperature and density of matter close to those that occur in the detonation of nuclear weapons. The ability to study the behavior of matter and the transfer of energy and radiation under these conditions is key to understanding the basic physics of nuclear weapons and predicting their performance without underground nuclear testing.<ref>Statement of Dr. Victor Reis, Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs, Department of Energy, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1997 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/Director/reisSASC97.html )</ref> Two JASON panels, which are composed of scientific and technical national security experts, have stated that the NIF is the most scientifically valuable of all programs proposed for science-based stockpile stewardship.<ref>Statement of Federico Pe\u00f1a, Secretary, US Dept of Energy, before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, March 26, 1998 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from {{cite web |url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205200200/http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |archivedate=2011-02-05 }} )</ref>\n\nDespite the initial criticism, Sandia, as well as Los Alamos, provided support in the development of many NIF technologies,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/274120-bKjglv/webviewable/274120.pdf |title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-08|last1=Boyes |first1=J. |last2=Boyer |first2=W. |last3=Chael |first3=J. |last4=Cook |first4=D. |last5=Cook |first5=W. |last6=Downey |first6=T. |last7=Hands |first7=J. |last8=Harjes |first8=C. |last9=Leeper |first9=R. |last10=McKay |first10=P. |last11=Micano |first11=P. |last12=Olson |first12=R. |last13=Porter |first13=J. |last14=Quintenz |first14=J. |last15=Roberts |first15=V. |last16=Savage |first16=M. |last17=Simpson |first17=W. |last18=Seth |first18=A. |last19=Smith |first19=R. |last20=Wavrik |first20=M. |last21=Wilson |first21=M. }}</ref> and both laboratories later became partners with NIF in the National Ignition Campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |title=National Ignition Campaign: Participants, NIF & Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017203631/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Constructing NIF===\n[[File:Beamlet Laser.jpg|thumb|The Beamlet laser tested the design and techniques that would be used on NIF.]]\n[[File:NIF target chamber construction.jpg|thumb|The NIF target chamber was so large it had to be built in sections.]]\nWork on the NIF started with a single beamline demonstrator, Beamlet.

By the time the \"conventional facility\" (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent of the rest of the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.\n\nThere were also unexpected challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Ni\u00f1o weather front dumped two inches of rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just three days before the scheduled concrete foundation pour.

To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed that there was no way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing.<ref name=peer/> Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350&nbsp;million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.<ref name=GAO1/>\n\n===Re-baseline and GAO report===\n[[File:Bill Richardson, official DOE photo.png|thumb|Bill Richardson began a review process that brought NIF construction back under control.]]\n\nThroughout this period the problems with NIF were not being reported up the management chain.

By this time, so sure were the experimenters that ignition would be reached that articles began appearing in science magazines stating that it would be announced only a short time after the article was published. [[Scientific American]] started a 2010 review article with the statement \"Ignition is close now. Within a year or two...\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Moyer |title=Fusion's False Dawn |magazine=Scientific American |date=March 2010 |pages=50\u201357}}</ref>\n\nThe first test was carried out on 8 October 2010 at slightly over 1&nbsp;MJ. However, a number of problems slowed the drive toward ignition-level laser energies in the 1.4 to 1.5 MJ range.\n\nProgress was initially slowed by the potential for damage from overheating due to a concentration of energy on optical components that is greater than anything previously attempted.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=superlaser-national-ignition-facility |title=Superlaser fires a blank |author=Eugenie Samuel Reich  |date=October 18, 2010 |magazine=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=2010-10-02 }}</ref> Other issues included problems layering the fuel inside the targets, and minute quantities of dust being found on the capsule surface.<ref name=kramerreview>David Kramer, [http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html \"NIF overcomes some problems, receives mixed review from its DOE overseer\"], ''Physics Today'', 21 April 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430001208/http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html |date=April 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAs the power was increased and targets of increasing sophistication were used, another problem appeared that was causing an asymmetric implosion. This was eventually traced to minute amounts of water vapor in the target chamber which froze to the windows on the ends of the hohlraums. This was solved by re-designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window.<ref name=\"kramerreview\"/> Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science, visited the lab for an update on the NIC on 23 April, the day after the window problem was announced as solved. On 10 March he had described the NIC as \"a goal of overriding importance for the DOE\" and expressed that progress to date \"was not as rapid as I had hoped\".<ref name=kramerreview/>\n\nNIC shots halted in February 2011, as the machine was turned over to SSMP materials experiments. As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced Radiographic Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence.\n\nARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (10<sup>15</sup>) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional radiographic techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world's highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/photons-fusion/2014/may|title= Photons & Fusion Newsletter - May 2014|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= May 2014|website= National Ignition Facility & Photon Science News - Archive - Photons & Fusion Newsletter|publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n\nNIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target to very high precision.

Koonin]], Under Secretary of Science. The 6th review, May 31, 2012 was chaired by David H. Crandall, Advisor on National Security and Inertial Fusion, Koonin being precluded to chair the review because of a conflict of interest. The review was conducted with the same external reviewers, who had previously served Koonin. Each provided their report independently, with their own estimate of the probability of achieving ignition within the plan, i.e. before December 31, 2012. The conclusion of the review was published on July 19, 2012.<ref name=\"Crandall\">\n{{cite web\n| url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_report_rev5_koonin_2012.pdf\n| title=External Review of the National Ignition Campaign\n| publisher=[[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe previous review dated January 31, 2012, identified a number of experimental improvements that have been completed or are under way.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/> The new report unanimously praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, operations have all been outstanding, however:\n:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging. (Crandall&nbsp;Memo&nbsp;2012,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;2)\n\nFurther, the report members express deep concerns on the gaps between observed performance and ICF simulation codes such that the current codes are of a limited utility going forward. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser-plasma interactions. These effects lead to pressure being one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo page 5 discusses the mix of ablator material and capsule fuel due likely to hydrodynamics instabilities in the outer surface of the ablator.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/>\n\nThe report goes on to suggest that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this increases its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also keep in mind that [[Nd:YAG laser|neodymium lasers]] can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=5}} The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/>\n\n===Ignition fails, focus shifts, LIFE ends===\nThe NIC officially ended on September 30, 2012 without achieving ignition.

The conflict was between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces and pro independence fighters of the [[Malayan Races Liberation Army|Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), the military wing of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP). The war was fought over attempts by communist forces to gain independence for Malaya from the British Empire and to establish a socialist economy. The fighting spanned both the colonial period and the creation of an independent Malaya (1957). Although it was referred to as \"The Emergency\" by colonial authorities, the MNLA referred to it as the \"Anti-British National Liberation War\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Mohamed|last= Amin|editor= Malcolm Caldwell|title=T0he Making of a Neo Colony|year=1977|publisher=Spokesman Books, UK|page=216}}</ref> The conflict was called an \"Emergency\" by the British for insurance purposes, as London-based insurers would not have paid out in instances of civil wars.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small Wars, Faraway Places: Global Insurrection and the Making of the Modern World 1945-1965|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|publisher=Viking - Penguin Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-670-02545-9|location=New York|pages=164}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1948 the [[British Malaya|colonial government]] declared a state of emergency in British Malaya after the killing of three Europeans during attacks on plantations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small Wars Faraway Places: Global Insurrection and the Making of the Modern World 1945-1965|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|publisher=Viking - Penguin Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-670-02545-9|location=New York|pages=163-164}}</ref> Under the leadership of [[Chin Peng]], communist activists regrouped in the Malayan jungles and formed the MNLA to wage a guerrilla war against British colonial rule. Many of the MNLA fighters who fought against British colonialism were former members of the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA) who had been trained and funded by the British years prior to fight against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during the [[Second World War]]. The majority of the support for the communist rebels came from the ethnic Malayan-Chinese population, most of which lived in dire poverty, were subject to racial persecution and were barred from voting in elections. The communist's belief in gender equality allowed many women to join the MNLA and their civilian support network the Min Yuen. However with the exception of the [[Orang Asli]] aboriginals, the MNLA failed to gain any major following from any ethnic groups other than the Malayan-Chinese due to the association of communism with China and long standing racial tensions within Malaya.\n\nAfter the MNLA had established a series of jungle bases, they began conducting raids on British colonial police and military installations. Tin mines and rubber plantations also became frequent targets of communist sabotage in attempts to make the colonial occupation of Malaya too expensive for the British to maintain. British military experiences during the Emergency would lay the groundwork for future anti-insurgency operations, most famously in the [[Vietnam War]] as American forces (largely unsuccessfully) attempted to replicate British strategies used in Malaya. The operational tactics of the Commonwealth troops pioneered the concept of [[Search and destroy]], saw widespread use of [[Agent Orange]]<ref name=\"USE\" /> and popularised the term \"Hearts and Minds\". High emphasis was placed on rapid response units which could respond quickly to guerrilla attacks and the formation of local auxiliary forces. \n\nUnder the [[Briggs Plan]] the British created a system of 400 internment camps called \"[[New village|New villages]]\" to imprison over 400,000 civilians, mostly Chinese but also Indian and Orang Asli, in an attempt to segregate the MNLA guerrillas from the civilian population.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=British Counterinsurgency|last=Newsinger|first=John|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-0-230-29824-8|location=Basingstoke|pages=52}}</ref> The British then attempted to starve the communist guerrillas by implementing a food denial campaign by enforcing food rationing on civilians, killing livestock and using chemical herbicides to destroy rural farmland.<ref name=\":0\" /> Early attempts to defeat the communists included the execution of unarmed villagers, the most infamous case being the [[Batang Kali massacre]] which is often referred to as \"Britain's [[My Lai Massacre|My Lai]]\". \n\nDespite the war ending in 1960, communist leader [[Chin Peng]] renewed the insurgency against the Malaysian government in 1967. This [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)|second phase of the insurgency]] lasted until 1989.\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also|Circumstances prior to the Malayan Emergency}}\n\n===Economic issues===\n{{See also|Banana republic}}\nThe Malayan economy relied on the export of [[tin]] and [[rubber]], and was therefore vulnerable to any shifts in the world market. When the British took control of the Malayan economy, they imposed taxes on some Malayan goods, affecting their traditional industries. This led to an increase in poverty for the Malayan people.<ref name=\"Wendy Khadijah Moore 2004, page 194\">Wendy Khadijah Moore, Malaysia a Pictorial History 1400\u20132004, ed.

Problems included unemployment, low wages, and high levels of food inflation, well above the healthy rate of 2\u20133%. The Malayan Communist Party began to use the failing economy as a tool of propaganda against the British.<!-- The term propaganda implies the message is deceptive or otherwise misleading. If the economy really was failing due to the damage of WWII, is it \"propaganda\" to point out the fact?\nIt would be more correct to say that the weak economy was a factor in the growth of trade union movements led by the communists. --> The British had not addressed the underlying economic problems that were now worse within Malaya than they had ever been.<ref name=\"awm.gov.au\"/> There was considerable labour unrest and a large number of strikes occurred between 1946 and 1948.

Protesters were dealt with harshly, by measures including arrests and deportations. In turn, protesters became increasingly militant. In 1947, alone, the communists in Malaya organised a further 300 strikes.<ref name=\"Eric Stahl 2003\" />\n\nThe British authorities had attempted, immediately after the war, to form the [[Malayan Union]] \u2013 a state where all citizens, Malay, Chinese and Indian, would have equal rights. This was rejected by many ethnic Malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective British control. Consequently, the British withdrew the proposal and for many Chinese in particular this appeared as a betrayal after their community had borne the brunt of fighting the Japanese occupation.\n\n===First incidents===\nThe first shots of the Malayan Emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 June 1948, in the office of the Elphil Estate twenty miles east of the [[Sungai Siput|Sungai Siput town]], [[Perak]]. Three European plantation managers, Arthur Walker (50 yrs, manager), John Allison (55 yrs, manager) and his young assistant, Ian Christian, were killed by three young Chinese men. These planned attacks were to include a fourth European on an estate near Sungai Siput. This attack failed as their target could not arrive to work on time due to his jeep breaking down. More gunmen were sent to kill him but shortly departed after failing to find him. <ref>Souchou Yao. 2016. The Malayan Emergency A small, Distant War. Nordic Institute of Asian Studies Monograph series, no. 133.\n pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nTwo days later (June 18), the British enacted emergency measures into law, first in Perak in response to the Sungai Siput incident. These emergency measures then became country-wide in July. Under these measures many trade unions,  Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and other leftist parties were outlawed. The police were given the power to detain communists and those suspected of assisting them.<!-- They already had this power and used it frequently in the years prior to the Emergency. Why mention this under first incident if it were already a common occurance?  --> \n\n=== Formation of the MNLA ===\nLed by [[Chin Peng]] the remaining Malayan communists retreated to rural areas and formed the [[Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), although their name has commonly been mistranslated as the Malayan Races Liberation Army (MRLA) or the Malayan People's Liberation Army (MPLA). Peng was a veteran anti-fascist and trade unionist who had played an integral role in the MPAJA communist resistance against the Japanese occupation of Malaya during WWII. The MNLA began their war for Malayan independence by targeting the colonial [[natural resource|resource]] extraction industries; mainly the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the British occupation of Malaya. The MNLA attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the British and winning independence by making the colonial occupation too expensive to maintain. The MNLA launched their first guerrilla attacks in the Gua Musang district. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe MNLA was partly a re-formation of the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA), the MCP-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in Malaya against the Japanese occupation. The British had secretly helped form the MPAJA in 1942 and trained them in the use of explosives, firearms and radios. Disbanded in December 1945, the MPAJA officially turned in its weapons to the [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]], although many MPAJA soldiers secretly hid stockpiles of weapons in jungle hideouts. Members who agreed to disband were offered economic incentives. Around 4,000 members rejected these incentives and went underground.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Robert|title=The Malayan Emergency|year=2008|publisher=Pen & Sword Aviation|location=London|page=10}}</ref>\n\n==Guerrilla war==\n[[File:Malayan Emergency Bren Gun.jpg|thumb|upright|Leaflet dropped on Malayan insurgents, urging them to come forward with a [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] gun and receive a [[Malayan dollar|$]]1,000 reward]]\n\nThe MNLA commonly employed guerrilla tactics, sabotaging installations, attacking rubber plantations and destroying transportation and infrastructure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rashid|first=Rehman|year=1993|title=A Malaysian Journey|page=27|isbn=983-99819-1-9}}</ref> Support for the MNLA was mainly based on around 500,000 of the 3.12 million [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] then living in Malaya.

It had a network of contacts within the general population. Besides supplying material, especially food, it was also important to the MNLA as a source of intelligence.{{sfn|Christopher|2013|p=58}}\n\nThe MNLA's camps and hideouts were in the rather inaccessible tropical jungle with limited infrastructure. Most MNLA guerrillas were ethnic Chinese, though there were some Malays, Indonesians and Indians among its members. The MNLA was organised into regiments, although these had no fixed establishments and each encompassed all forces operating in a particular region. The regiments had political sections, [[commissar]]s, instructors and secret service. In the camps, the soldiers attended lectures on [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], and produced political newsletters to be distributed to civilians.{{sfn|Komer|1972|p=7}} The MNLA also stipulated that their soldiers needed official permission for any romantic involvement with civilian women.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, the guerrillas envisaged establishing control in \"liberated areas\" from which the government forces had been driven, but did not succeed in this.{{sfn|Komer|1972|p=9}}\n\n===British response===\n[[File:SC protection team.jpg|thumb|left|Workers on a rubber plantation in Malaya travel to work under the protection of [[Special Constable]]s, whose function was to guard them throughout the working day against attack by communist forces, 1950]]\n\nIn the early months, chaos and lack of direction immobilized the government. On the military front, the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the Chinese rural population. British planters and miners, who bore the brunt of the communist attacks, began to talk about government incompetence and being betrayed by Whitehall.<ref>Souchou Yao. 2016. The Malayan Emergency A Small Distant War. Nordic Institute of Asian Studies Monograph series, no. 133. p. 43.</ref> The initial government strategy was primarily to guard important economic targets, such as mines and plantation estates. Later, in April 1950, General Sir [[Harold Rawdon Briggs|Harold Briggs]], the British Army's Director of Operations was appointed to Malaya. The central tenet of the Briggs' Plan was that the best way to defeat an insurgency, such as the government was facing, was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters amongst the population. The Briggs plan also recognised the inhospitable nature of the Malayan jungle. A major part of the strategy involved targeting the MNLA food supply, which Briggs recognised came from three main sources: camps within the Malayan jungle where land was cleared to provide food, aboriginal jungle dwellers who could supply the MNLA with food gathered within the jungle, and the MNLA supporters within the 'squatter' communities on the edge of the jungle.<ref name=\"O. Tilman 1966 407\u2013419\"/>\n\n[[File:Terrorist in Malaya.jpg|thumb|A wounded insurgent being held and questioned after his capture in 1952]]\n\nThe Briggs Plan was multifaceted, with one aspect which has become particularly well known: the forced relocation of some 500,000 rural Malayans, including 400,000 Chinese, from squatter communities on the fringes of the forests into guarded camps called \"[[new village]]s\". These villages were newly constructed in most cases, and were surrounded by barbed wire, police posts and floodlit areas, meant to keep the inhabitants in and the guerrillas out. At the start of the Emergency, the British had 13 infantry battalions in Malaya, including seven partly formed [[Gurkha]] battalions, three British battalions, two battalions of the [[Royal Malay Regiment]] and a British [[Royal Artillery]] Regiment being used as infantry.<ref name=\"Hack:113\">Karl Hack, ''Defense & Decolonization in South-East Asia'', p. 113.</ref> This force was too small to fight the insurgents effectively, and more infantry battalions were needed in Malaya. The British brought in soldiers from units such as the [[Royal Marines]] and [[King's African Rifles]]. Another effort was a re-formation of the [[Special Air Service]] in 1950 as a specialised reconnaissance, raiding and [[counter-insurgency]] unit.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary of Defence for [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson]], had served in the [[Chindits]] in Burma during World War II. His vast experience in [[jungle warfare]] proved valuable during this period as he was able to build effective civil-military relations and was one of the chief architects of the counter-insurgency plan in Malaya.<ref>Joel E.

Churchill's Conservative Party then regained power in Whitehall. In January 1952, General [[Gerald Templer]] was appointed as British High Commissioner. He is widely credited with turning the situation in favour of the British forces. Some British army units began a \"[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]] campaign\" by giving medical and food aid to Malays and indigenous tribes. At the same time, they put pressure on the MNLA by patrolling the jungle. The MNLA guerrillas were driven deeper into the jungle and denied resources. The MNLA extorted food from the [[Sakai (tribe)|Sakai]] and thereby earned their enmity. Many of the captured guerrillas changed sides. In comparison, the MNLA never released any Britons alive.\n\nDuring Templer's two-year command, 'two-thirds of the guerrillas were wiped out and lost over half their strength, the incident rate fell from 500 to less than 100 per month and the civilian and security force casualties from 200 to less than 40.'<ref>{{cite book | last=Clutterbuck | first=Richard | title=Conflict and violence in Singapore and Malaysia 1945\u201383 | year=1985 | publisher=Graham Brash | location=Singapore}}</ref> Orthodox historiography suggests that Templer changed the situation in the Emergency and his actions and policies were a major part of British success under his command.

This allowed intelligence from all sources to be rapidly evaluated and disseminated, and also allowed all anti-guerrilla measures to be co-ordinated. Each State War Executive Committee, for example, included the State Chief Minister as chairman, the Chief Police Officer, the senior military commander, state home guard officer, state financial officer, state information officer, executive secretary and up to six selected community leaders. The Police, Military and Home Guard representatives and the Secretary formed the operations sub-committee responsible for day-to-day direction of emergency operations.

A typical operation was \"Nassau\", carried out in the [[Kuala Langat]] swamp (excerpt from the Marine Corps School's ''The Guerrilla \u2013 and how to Fight Him''):\n\n{{quote|After several assassinations, a British battalion was assigned to the area. Food control was achieved through a system of rationing, convoys, gate checks and searches. One company began operations in the swamp, about 21 December 1954. On 9 January 1955, full-scale tactical operations began; artillery, mortars and aircraft began harassing fires in the South Swamp. Originally, the plan was to bomb and shell the swamp day and night so that the terrorists would be driven out into ambushes; but the terrorists were well prepared to stay indefinitely. Food parties came out occasionally, but the civil population was too afraid to report them.\n\nPlans were modified; harassing fires were reduced to night-time only. Ambushes continued and patrolling inside the swamp was intensified. Operations of this nature continued for three months without results. Finally on 21 March, an ambush party, after forty-five hours of waiting, succeeded in killing two of eight terrorists. The first two red pins, signifying kills, appeared on the operations map, and local morale rose a little.\n\nAnother month passed before it was learned that the terrorists were making a contact inside the swamp. One platoon established an ambush; one terrorist appeared and was killed. May passed without a contact. In June, a chance meeting by a patrol accounted for one killed and one captured. A few days later, after four fruitless days of patrolling, one platoon en route to camp accounted for two more terrorists. The No. 3 terrorist in the area surrendered and stated that food control was so effective that one terrorist had been murdered in a quarrel over food.\n\nOn 7 July, two additional companies were assigned to the area; patrolling and harassing fires were intensified. Three terrorists surrendered and one of them led a platoon patrol to the terrorist leader's camp. The patrol attacked the camp, killing four, including the leader. Other patrols accounted for four more; by the end of July, twenty-three terrorists remained in the swamp with no food or communications with the outside world...\n\nThis was the nature of operations: 60,000 artillery shells, 30,000 rounds of mortar ammunition, and 2,000 aircraft bombs for 35 terrorists killed or captured. Each one represented 1,500 man-days of patrolling or waiting in ambushes. \"Nassau\" was considered a success for the end of the emergency was one step nearer.<ref>Taber, ''The War of the Flea'', pp.140\u2013141.

CO1030/30</ref> The Government of Singapore issued an identical offer at the same time. [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], as Chief Minister, made good the offer of an amnesty but promised there would be no negotiations with the MNLA.

Those who show that they are genuinely intent to be loyal to the Government of Malaya and to give up their Communist activities will be helped to regain their normal position in society and be reunited with their families. As regards the remainder, restrictions will have to be placed on their liberty but if any of them wish to go to China, their request will be given due consideration.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Prof Madya Dr. Nik Anuar Nik Mahmud, Tunku Abdul Rahman and His Role in the Baling Talks</ref>\n\nFollowing the declaration, an intensive publicity campaign on an unprecedented scale was launched by the government. Alliance Ministers in the Federal Government travelled extensively up and down the country exhorting the people to call upon the communists to lay down their arms and take advantage of the amnesty. Despite the campaign, few Communists surrendered to the authorities. Some critics in the political circles commented that the amnesty was too restrictive and little more than a restatement of the surrender terms which had been in force for a long period. The critics advocated a more realistic and liberal approach of direct negotiations with the MCP to work out a settlement of the issue. Leading officials of the [[Labour Party of Malaya|Labour Party]] had, as part of the settlement, not excluded the possibility of recognition of the MCP as a political organisation. Within the Alliance itself, influential elements in both the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] and [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] were endeavouring to persuade the Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, to hold negotiations with the MCP.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Baling talks and their consequences===\n{{Main|Baling Talks}}\n[[File:Malya Emergency British Artillery.jpg|thumb|right|British artillery firing on an insurgent hide-out in the Malayan jungle, 1955]]\nRealising that his conflict had not come to any fruition, Chin Peng sought a discussion with the ruling British government alongside many Malayan officials in 1955. The talks took place in the Government English School at [[Baling]] on 28 December. Chin Ping walked out from the jungle, and tried to negotiate with the leader of the Federation, but the British Intelligence Service worried that the MCP would regain influence in society. The MCP was represented by [[Chin Peng]], the Secretary-General, [[Rashid Maidin]] and [[Chen Tien]], head of the MCP's Central Propaganda Department; on the other side were three elected national representatives, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], Dato' [[Tan Cheng Lock|Tan Cheng-Lock]] and [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Saul Marshall]], the Chief Minister of Singapore. The meeting was intended to pursue a mutual end to the conflict but the Malayan government representatives, led by Tunku Abdul Rahman, dismissed all of Chin Peng's demands. As a result, the conflict heightened and, in response, [[New Zealand]] sent NZSAS soldiers, [[No. 14 Squadron RNZAF]], [[No. 41 Squadron RNZAF|No. 41 (Bristol Freighter) Squadron RNZAF]] and, later, [[No. 75 Squadron RNZAF]]; other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] members also sent troops to aid the British.\n\nFollowing the failure of the talks, Tunku decided to withdraw the amnesty on 8 February 1956, five months after it had been offered, stating that he would not be willing to meet the Communists again unless they indicated beforehand their desire to see him with a view to making \"a complete surrender\".<ref>MacGillivray to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, 15 March 1956, CO1030/22</ref> Despite the failure of the talks, the MCP made every effort to resume peace talks with the Malayan government, without success. Meanwhile, discussions began in the new Emergency Operations Council to intensify the \"People's War\" against the guerillas. In July 1957, a few weeks before independence, the MCP made another attempt at peace talks, suggesting the following conditions for a negotiated peace:\n* its members should be given privileges enjoyed by citizens; and\n* a guarantee that political as well as armed members of the MCP would not be punished.\n\nThe failure of the talks affected MCP policy. At the same time, the strength of the MNLA and 'Min Yuen' declined to only 1830 members in August 1957. Those who remained faced going into exile, or death in the jungle. Tunku Abdul Rahman, however, did not respond to the MCP's proposals. With the independence of Malaya under Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman on 31 August 1957, the insurrection lost its rationale as a war of colonial liberation. The last serious resistance from MRLA guerrillas ended with a surrender in the [[Telok Anson]] marsh area in 1958. The remaining MRLA forces fled to the [[Thailand|Thai border]] and further east.

Brian Lapping said that there was \"some vicious conduct by the British forces, who routinely beat up Chinese [[Squatting|squatters]] when they refused, or possibly were unable, to give information\" about the insurgents. There were also cases of dead guerrillas being exhibited in public for identification, and to potentially entrap grieving associates. In addition, from 18 June 1948 up until 15 April 1950, 35,000 people were exiled, including those unable to leave the country.<ref>Chin, C. (2012). Dialogues with Chin Peng: New Light on the Malayan Communist Party. Chinese Edition.</ref> The ''Scotsman'' newspaper lauded these tactics as a good practice since \"simple-minded peasants are told and come to believe that the communist leaders are invulnerable\". British forces also [[booby-trapped]] jungle food stores, burned villages and secretly supplied self-detonating grenades and bullets to the insurgents to instantly kill the user. Some civilians and detainees were also shot, either because they attempted to flee from and potentially aid insurgents or simply because they refused to give intelligence to British forces. These tactics strained relations between civilians and British forces in Malaya and were therefore counterproductive in generating the one resource critical in a counterinsurgency, good intelligence.<ref name=\"MAY\">[http://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=polsci_pubs The Other Forgotten War: Understanding Atrocities During the Malayan Emergency]</ref> British troops were often unable to tell the difference between enemy [[combatants]] and [[non-combatant]] [[civilians]] while conducting [[military operations]] through the jungles, due to the fact the guerrillas wore civilian clothing and had support from sympathetic civilian populations.\n\nIn the \"[[Batang Kali massacre]]\", 24 villagers were killed by 7th Platoon, G Company, 2nd [[Scots Guard]]s, after they surrounded a rubber plantation at Sungai Rimoh near [[Batang Kali]] in [[Selangor]] in December 1948.

This is in contrast to Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) where French colonial officials had not been at war against the Japanese, who endeavoured to excite Vietnamese nationalism against France.

This allowed Vietnamese Communist troops safe haven from US ground attacks. The MNLA had only a border with [[Thailand]], where they were forced to take shelter near the end of the conflict.\n\n===Similarities===\nMany tactics used by the Americans in Vietnam were similar to those used by the British in Malaya. Some examples are listed below.\n\n====Agent Orange====\n{{Main|Agent Orange}}\nDuring the Malayan Emergency, Britain was the first nation to employ the use of [[herbicides]] and [[defoliants]] to destroy bushes, food crops, and trees to deprive the insurgents of cover and as part of the food denial campaign in the early 1950s. The [[2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-D]] (Agent Orange) were used to clear [[lines of communication]] and wipe out food crops as part of this strategy and in 1952, [[trioxone]], and mixtures of the aforementioned herbicides, were sent along a number of key roads. From June to October 1952, 1,250 acres of roadside vegetation at possible ambush points were sprayed with defoliant, described as a policy of \"national importance\". The British reported that the use of herbicides and defoliants could be effectively replaced by removing vegetation by hand and the spraying was stopped. However, after this strategy failed, the use of herbicides and defoliants in effort to fight the insurgents was restarted under the command of British General [[Gerald Templer|Sir Gerald Templer]] in February 1953, as a means of destroying food crops grown by communist forces in jungle clearings. [[Helicopters]] and [[fixed-wing aircraft]] despatched [[Trichloroacetic acid|STCA]] and Trioxaone, along with pellets of [[(2-Chlorophenyl)thiourea|chlorophenyl]] [[N,N-Dimethyl-1-naphthylamine]] onto crops such as [[sweet potatoes]] and [[maize]]. Many Commonwealth personnel who handled and/or used Agent Orange during, and in the decades after, the conflict suffered from serious exposure to dioxin and Agent Orange. An estimated 10,000 civilians and insurgents in Malaya also suffered heavily from the effects of the defoliant (though many historians agree it was likely more than this number given that Agent Orange was used on a large scale in the Malayan conflict and unlike the US, the British government manipulated the numbers and kept its secret very tight in fear of negative world public opinion). The prolonged absence of vegetation from defoliation had also resulted in major [[soil erosion]] to areas of Malaya.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pesticide Dilemma in the Third World: A Case Study of Malaysia |pages=23 |publisher=Phoenix Press |year=1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dioxins and Health |pages=145\u2013160 |author=Arnold Schecter, Thomas A.

Mauroni |year=July 2003}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Malayan conflict ended in 1960, the US considered British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a [[law of war|legally accepted tactic of warfare]]. [[US Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] advised [[US President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] that the precedent of using herbicide in warfare had been established by the British through their use of aircraft to spray herbicide and thus destroy enemy crops and thin the thick jungle of northern Malaya.<ref name=\"USE\">{{cite book |title=The Global Politics of Pesticides: Forging Consensus from Conflicting Interests |page=61 |author=Bruce Cumings |year=1998 |publisher=[[Earthscan]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Pamela Sodhy 1991 284\u2013290\"/>\n\n====Aerial bombardment====\nLike the [[US Air Force]] in Vietnam, widespread [[saturation bombardment]] was used by the [[Royal Air Force]] throughout the conflict in Malaya. Britain conducted 4,500 air strikes in the first five years of the Malayan war. Mapping was poor, communications were abysmal, the meteorology was unfavourable and airfields were few. Buzzing likely enemy positions was used (the modern '[[show of force]]'), and the bombing of potential escape routes was also occasionally practised. Author Robert Jackson said that: \"During 1956, some 545,000 lb. of bombs had been dropped on a supposed [guerrilla] encampment...but a lack of accurate pinpoints had nullified the effect. The camp was again attacked at the beginning of May 1957...[dropping] a total of 94,000 lb. of bombs, but because of inaccurate target information this weight of explosive was 250 yards off target. Then, on 15 May...70,000 lb. of bombs were dropped\". \"The attack was entirely successful\", Jackson declares, since \"four terrorists were killed\". The author also notes that a 500&nbsp;lb. nose-fused bomb was employed from August 1948 and had a mean area of effectiveness of 15,000 square feet. \"Another very viable weapon\" was the 20&nbsp;lb. [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation bomb]], a forerunner of [[cluster bombs]]. \"Since a [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] could carry a load of 190, its effect on terrorist morale was considerable\", Jackson states. \"Unfortunately, it was not used in great numbers, despite its excellent potential as a harassing weapon\". On one occasion a [[Avro Lincoln|Lincoln]] bomber \"dropp[ed] its bombs 600 yards short...killing twelve civilians and injuring twenty-six others\". The British reported that bombing jungles was largely a waste of effort due to inaccurate targeting and the inability to confirm if a target was hostile or not. Throughout the 12-year conflict, between 670 and 995 [[non-combatants]] were killed by British RAF bombers.<ref name=\"MAY\" /><ref name=\"Mark Curtis 61\u201371\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=The Malayan Emergency |pages=28\u201334 |author=Robert Jackson |date=August 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Resettlement programme====\nBritain also set up a \"[[Population transfer|resettlement]]\" programme that provided a model for the US's [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] in Vietnam. During the Malayan Emergency, 450 [[new village]]s were created and it is estimated that 470,509 people \u2013 400,000 Chinese \u2013 were [[interned]] in the resettlement program. A key British war measure was inflicting [[collective punishment]]s on villages where people were deemed to be aiding the insurgents. At [[Tanjung Malim|Tanjong Malim]] in March 1952 Templer imposed a twenty-two-hour house [[curfew]], banned everyone from leaving the village, closed the schools, stopped bus services and reduced the rice rations for 20,000 people. The latter measure prompted the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to write to the Colonial Office noting that the \"chronically undernourished Malayan\" might not be able to survive as a result. \"This measure is bound to result in an increase, not only of sickness but also of deaths, particularly amongst the mothers and very young children\". Some people were fined for leaving their homes to use external latrines. In another collective punishment \u2013 at [[Sungai Pelek|Sengei Pelek]] the following month \u2013 measures included a house curfew, a reduction of 40 per cent in the rice ration and the construction of a chain-link fence 22 yards outside the existing barbed wire fence around the town. Officials explained that these measures were being imposed upon the 4,000 villagers \"for their continually supplying food\" to the insurgents and \"because they did not give information to the authorities\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The US-Malaysian nexus: Themes in superpower-small state relations |pages=356\u2013365 |author=Pamela Sodhy |publisher=Institute of Strategic and International Studies, Malaysia |year=1991}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malayan Police patrol.jpg|thumb|190px|Two suspected guerillas after capture by Jungle Squad officers]]\n\n====Search and destroy====\nLike the USA later did in Vietnam, British troops sometimes set fire to villages whose inhabitants were accused of supporting the insurgents, detaining thousands of suspected collaborators, and to deny the insurgents cover. British units that discovered civilians providing assistance to insurgents were to detain and interrogate them, using torture and the threat of violence against family members, to discover the location of insurgent camps. Insurgents had numerous advantages over British forces; they lived in closer proximity to villagers, they sometimes had relatives or close friends in the village, and they were not afraid to threaten violence or torture and murder village leaders as an example to the others, forcing them to assist them with food and information. British forces thus faced a dual threat: the insurgents and the silent network in villages who supported them. While the insurgents rarely sought out contact with British forces, they did use terrorist tactics to intimidate civilians and elicit material support.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} British troops often described the terror of jungle patrols; in addition to watching out for insurgent fighters, they had to navigate difficult terrain and avoid dangerous animals and insects. Many patrols would stay in the jungle for days, even weeks, without encountering the enemy and then, in a brief moment, insurgents would ambush them. British forces, unable to distinguish friend from foe, had to adjust to the constant risk of an insurgent attack. These instances led to the infamous [[Batang Kali massacre|incident at Batang Kali]] where 24 unarmed villagers were [[Batang Kali massacre|killed]] by British troops.<ref name=\"MAY\" /><ref name=\"MAL\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Tugu Negara.jpg|thumb|The [[Tugu Negara|National Monument]] commemorating those who died in Malaysia's struggle for freedom, including the Malayan Emergency.]]\n\nThe [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] of 1963\u201366 arose from tensions between Indonesia and the new British backed [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] that was conceived in the aftermath of the Malayan Emergency.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the coverage of the [[My Lai massacre]] during the [[Vietnam War]] prompted the initiation of investigations in the UK concerning alleged war crimes perpetrated by British forces during the Emergency, such as the [[Batang Kali massacre]].

The conflict was between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces and pro independence fighters of the [[Malayan Races Liberation Army|Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), the military wing of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP). The war was fought over attempts by communist forces to gain independence for Malaya from the British Empire and to establish a socialist economy. The fighting spanned both the colonial period and the creation of an independent Malaya (1957). Although it was referred to as \"The Emergency\" by colonial authorities, the MNLA referred to it as the \"Anti-British National Liberation War\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Mohamed|last= Amin|editor= Malcolm Caldwell|title=T0he Making of a Neo Colony|year=1977|publisher=Spokesman Books, UK|page=216}}</ref> The conflict was called an \"Emergency\" by the British for insurance purposes, as London-based insurers would not have paid out in instances of civil wars.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small Wars, Faraway Places: Global Insurrection and the Making of the Modern World 1945-1965|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|publisher=Viking - Penguin Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-670-02545-9|location=New York|pages=164}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1948 the [[British Malaya|colonial government]] declared a state of emergency in British Malaya after the killing of three Europeans during attacks on plantations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small Wars Faraway Places: Global Insurrection and the Making of the Modern World 1945-1965|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|publisher=Viking - Penguin Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-670-02545-9|location=New York|pages=163-164}}</ref> Under the leadership of [[Chin Peng]], communist activists regrouped in the Malayan jungles and formed the MNLA to wage a guerrilla war against British colonial rule. Many of the MNLA fighters who fought against British colonialism were former members of the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA) who had been trained and funded by the British years prior to fight against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during the [[Second World War]]. The majority of the support for the communist rebels came from the ethnic Malayan-Chinese population, most of which lived in dire poverty, were subject to racial persecution and were barred from voting in elections. The communist's belief in gender equality allowed many women to join the MNLA and their civilian support network the Min Yuen. However with the exception of the [[Orang Asli]] aboriginals, the MNLA failed to gain any major following from any ethnic groups other than the Malayan-Chinese due to the association of communism with China and long standing racial tensions within Malaya.\n\nAfter the MNLA had established a series of jungle bases, they began conducting raids on British colonial police and military installations. Tin mines and rubber plantations also became frequent targets of communist sabotage in attempts to make the colonial occupation of Malaya too expensive for the British to maintain. British military experiences during the Emergency would lay the groundwork for future anti-insurgency operations, most famously in the [[Vietnam War]] as American forces (largely unsuccessfully) attempted to replicate British strategies used in Malaya. The operational tactics of the Commonwealth troops pioneered the concept of [[Search and destroy]], saw widespread use of [[Agent Orange]]<ref name=\"USE\" /> and popularised the term \"Hearts and Minds\". High emphasis was placed on rapid response units which could respond quickly to guerrilla attacks and the formation of local auxiliary forces. \n\nUnder the [[Briggs Plan]] the British created a system of 400 internment camps called \"[[New village|New villages]]\" to imprison over 400,000 civilians, mostly Chinese but also Indian and Orang Asli, in an attempt to segregate the MNLA guerrillas from the civilian population.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=British Counterinsurgency|last=Newsinger|first=John|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-0-230-29824-8|location=Basingstoke|pages=52}}</ref> The British then attempted to starve the communist guerrillas by implementing a food denial campaign by enforcing food rationing on civilians, killing livestock and using chemical herbicides to destroy rural farmland.<ref name=\":0\" /> Early attempts to defeat the communists included the execution of unarmed villagers, the most infamous case being the [[Batang Kali massacre]] which is often referred to as \"Britain's [[My Lai Massacre|My Lai]]\". \n\nDespite the war ending in 1960, communist leader [[Chin Peng]] renewed the insurgency against the Malaysian government in 1967. This [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)|second phase of the insurgency]] lasted until 1989.\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also|Circumstances prior to the Malayan Emergency}}\n\n===Economic issues===\n{{See also|Banana republic}}\nThe Malayan economy relied on the export of [[tin]] and [[rubber]], and was therefore vulnerable to any shifts in the world market. When the British took control of the Malayan economy, they imposed taxes on some Malayan goods, affecting their traditional industries. This led to an increase in poverty for the Malayan people.<ref name=\"Wendy Khadijah Moore 2004, page 194\">Wendy Khadijah Moore, Malaysia a Pictorial History 1400\u20132004, ed.

Problems included unemployment, low wages, and high levels of food inflation, well above the healthy rate of 2\u20133%. The Malayan Communist Party began to use the failing economy as a tool of propaganda against the British.<!-- The term propaganda implies the message is deceptive or otherwise misleading. If the economy really was failing due to the damage of WWII, is it \"propaganda\" to point out the fact?\nIt would be more correct to say that the weak economy was a factor in the growth of trade union movements led by the communists. --> The British had not addressed the underlying economic problems that were now worse within Malaya than they had ever been.<ref name=\"awm.gov.au\"/> There was considerable labour unrest and a large number of strikes occurred between 1946 and 1948. One example of this was a 24-hour general strike organised by the MCP on 29 January 1946.<ref name=\"Eric Stahl 2003\">Eric Stahl, \"Doomed from the Start: A New Perspective on the Malayan Insurgency\" (master's thesis, 2003)</ref> During this time, the British administration was attempting to organise Malaya's economy, as revenue from Malaya's tin and rubber industries was important to Britain's own post-war recovery. Protesters were dealt with harshly, by measures including arrests and deportations. In turn, protesters became increasingly militant. In 1947, alone, the communists in Malaya organised a further 300 strikes.<ref name=\"Eric Stahl 2003\" />\n\nThe British authorities had attempted, immediately after the war, to form the [[Malayan Union]] \u2013 a state where all citizens, Malay, Chinese and Indian, would have equal rights. This was rejected by many ethnic Malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective British control. Consequently, the British withdrew the proposal and for many Chinese in particular this appeared as a betrayal after their community had borne the brunt of fighting the Japanese occupation.\n\n===First incidents===\nThe first shots of the Malayan Emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 June 1948, in the office of the Elphil Estate twenty miles east of the [[Sungai Siput|Sungai Siput town]], [[Perak]]. Three European plantation managers, Arthur Walker (50 yrs, manager), John Allison (55 yrs, manager) and his young assistant, Ian Christian, were killed by three young Chinese men. These planned attacks were to include a fourth European on an estate near Sungai Siput. This attack failed as their target could not arrive to work on time due to his jeep breaking down. More gunmen were sent to kill him but shortly departed after failing to find him. <ref>Souchou Yao. 2016. The Malayan Emergency A small, Distant War. Nordic Institute of Asian Studies Monograph series, no. 133.\n pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nTwo days later (June 18), the British enacted emergency measures into law, first in Perak in response to the Sungai Siput incident. These emergency measures then became country-wide in July. Under these measures many trade unions,  Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and other leftist parties were outlawed. The police were given the power to detain communists and those suspected of assisting them.<!-- They already had this power and used it frequently in the years prior to the Emergency. Why mention this under first incident if it were already a common occurance?  --> \n\n=== Formation of the MNLA ===\nLed by [[Chin Peng]] the remaining Malayan communists retreated to rural areas and formed the [[Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), although their name has commonly been mistranslated as the Malayan Races Liberation Army (MRLA) or the Malayan People's Liberation Army (MPLA). Peng was a veteran anti-fascist and trade unionist who had played an integral role in the MPAJA communist resistance against the Japanese occupation of Malaya during WWII. The MNLA began their war for Malayan independence by targeting the colonial [[natural resource|resource]] extraction industries; mainly the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the British occupation of Malaya. The MNLA attacked these industries in the hopes of bakrupting the British and winning independence by making the colonial occupation too expensive to maintain. The MNLA launched their first guerrilla attacks in the Gua Musang district. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe MNLA was partly a re-formation of the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA), the MCP-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in Malaya against the Japanese occupation. The British had secretly helped form the MPAJA in 1942 and trained them in the use of explosives, firearms and radios. Disbanded in December 1945, the MPAJA officially turned in its weapons to the [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]], although many MPAJA soldiers secretly hid stockpiles of weapons in jungle hideouts. Members who agreed to disband were offered economic incentives. Around 4,000 members rejected these incentives and went underground.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Robert|title=The Malayan Emergency|year=2008|publisher=Pen & Sword Aviation|location=London|page=10}}</ref>\n\n==Guerrilla war==\n[[File:Malayan Emergency Bren Gun.jpg|thumb|upright|Leaflet dropped on Malayan insurgents, urging them to come forward with a [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] gun and receive a [[Malayan dollar|$]]1,000 reward]]\n\nThe MNLA commonly employed guerrilla tactics, sabotaging installations, attacking rubber plantations and destroying transportation and infrastructure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rashid|first=Rehman|year=1993|title=A Malaysian Journey|page=27|isbn=983-99819-1-9}}</ref> Support for the MNLA was mainly based on around 500,000 of the 3.12 million [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] then living in Malaya.

The MNLA gained the support of the Chinese because they were denied the equal right to vote in elections, had no land rights to speak of, and were usually very poor.{{sfn|Christopher|2013|p=53}} The MNLA's supply organisation was called \"Min Yuen\" (Mass Organisation). It had a network of contacts within the general population. Besides supplying material, especially food, it was also important to the MNLA as a source of intelligence.{{sfn|Christopher|2013|p=58}}\n\nThe MNLA's camps and hideouts were in the rather inaccessible tropical jungle with limited infrastructure. Most MNLA guerrillas were ethnic Chinese, though there were some Malays, Indonesians and Indians among its members. The MNLA was organised into regiments, although these had no fixed establishments and each encompassed all forces operating in a particular region. The regiments had political sections, [[commissar]]s, instructors and secret service. In the camps, the soldiers attended lectures on [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], and produced political newsletters to be distributed to civilians.{{sfn|Komer|1972|p=7}} The MNLA also stipulated that their soldiers needed official permission for any romantic involvement with civilian women.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, the guerrillas envisaged establishing control in \"liberated areas\" from which the government forces had been driven, but did not succeed in this.{{sfn|Komer|1972|p=9}}\n\n===British response===\n[[File:SC protection team.jpg|thumb|left|Workers on a rubber plantation in Malaya travel to work under the protection of [[Special Constable]]s, whose function was to guard them throughout the working day against attack by communist forces, 1950]]\n\nIn the early months, chaos and lack of direction immobilized the government. On the military front, the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the Chinese rural population. British planters and miners, who bore the brunt of the communist attacks, began to talk about government incompetence and being betrayed by Whitehall.<ref>Souchou Yao. 2016. The Malayan Emergency A Small Distant War. Nordic Institute of Asian Studies Monograph series, no. 133. p. 43.</ref> The initial government strategy was primarily to guard important economic targets, such as mines and plantation estates. Later, in April 1950, General Sir [[Harold Rawdon Briggs|Harold Briggs]], the British Army's Director of Operations was appointed to Malaya. The central tenet of the Briggs' Plan was that the best way to defeat an insurgency, such as the government was facing, was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters amongst the population. The Briggs plan also recognised the inhospitable nature of the Malayan jungle. A major part of the strategy involved targeting the MNLA food supply, which Briggs recognised came from three main sources: camps within the Malayan jungle where land was cleared to provide food, aboriginal jungle dwellers who could supply the MNLA with food gathered within the jungle, and the MNLA supporters within the 'squatter' communities on the edge of the jungle.<ref name=\"O. Tilman 1966 407\u2013419\"/>\n\n[[File:Terrorist in Malaya.jpg|thumb|A wounded insurgent being held and questioned after his capture in 1952]]\n\nThe Briggs Plan was multifaceted, with one aspect which has become particularly well known: the forced relocation of some 500,000 rural Malayans, including 400,000 Chinese, from squatter communities on the fringes of the forests into guarded camps called \"[[new village]]s\". These villages were newly constructed in most cases, and were surrounded by barbed wire, police posts and floodlit areas, meant to keep the inhabitants in and the guerrillas out. At the start of the Emergency, the British had 13 infantry battalions in Malaya, including seven partly formed [[Gurkha]] battalions, three British battalions, two battalions of the [[Royal Malay Regiment]] and a British [[Royal Artillery]] Regiment being used as infantry.<ref name=\"Hack:113\">Karl Hack, ''Defense & Decolonization in South-East Asia'', p. 113.</ref> This force was too small to fight the insurgents effectively, and more infantry battalions were needed in Malaya. The British brought in soldiers from units such as the [[Royal Marines]] and [[King's African Rifles]]. Another effort was a re-formation of the [[Special Air Service]] in 1950 as a specialised reconnaissance, raiding and [[counter-insurgency]] unit.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary of Defence for [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson]], had served in the [[Chindits]] in Burma during World War II. His vast experience in [[jungle warfare]] proved valuable during this period as he was able to build effective civil-military relations and was one of the chief architects of the counter-insurgency plan in Malaya.<ref>Joel E.

Churchill's Conservative Party then regained power in Whitehall. In January 1952, General [[Gerald Templer]] was appointed as British High Commissioner. He is widely credited with turning the situation in favour of the British forces. Some British army units began a \"[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]] campaign\" by giving medical and food aid to Malays and indigenous tribes. At the same time, they put pressure on the MNLA by patrolling the jungle. The MNLA guerrillas were driven deeper into the jungle and denied resources. The MNLA extorted food from the [[Sakai (tribe)|Sakai]] and thereby earned their enmity. Many of the captured guerrillas changed sides. In comparison, the MNLA never released any Britons alive.\n\nDuring Templer's two-year command, 'two-thirds of the guerrillas were wiped out and lost over half their strength, the incident rate fell from 500 to less than 100 per month and the civilian and security force casualties from 200 to less than 40.'<ref>{{cite book | last=Clutterbuck | first=Richard | title=Conflict and violence in Singapore and Malaysia 1945\u201383 | year=1985 | publisher=Graham Brash | location=Singapore}}</ref> Orthodox historiography suggests that Templer changed the situation in the Emergency and his actions and policies were a major part of British success under his command.

This allowed intelligence from all sources to be rapidly evaluated and disseminated, and also allowed all anti-guerrilla measures to be co-ordinated. Each State War Executive Committee, for example, included the State Chief Minister as chairman, the Chief Police Officer, the senior military commander, state home guard officer, state financial officer, state information officer, executive secretary and up to six selected community leaders. The Police, Military and Home Guard representatives and the Secretary formed the operations sub-committee responsible for day-to-day direction of emergency operations. The operations subcommittees as a whole made joint decisions.<ref>Conduct of Anti-Terrorist Operations in Malaya, Director of Operations, Malaya, 1958, Chapter III: Own Forces</ref>\n\n===Nature of warfare===\n[[File:The Malayan Emergency 1948-1960 MAL35.jpg|thumb|Malayan Police conducting a patrol around the [[Belum-Temengor|Temenggor]], 1953]]\n\nThe British Army soon realised that clumsy sweeps by large formations were unproductive.<ref>Nagl (2002), pp.67\u201370</ref> Instead, platoons or sections carried out patrols and laid ambushes, based on intelligence (from informers, surrendered MNLA personnel, aerial reconnaissance, etc.).  A typical operation was \"Nassau\", carried out in the [[Kuala Langat]] swamp (excerpt from the Marine Corps School's ''The Guerrilla \u2013 and how to Fight Him''):\n\n{{quote|After several assassinations, a British battalion was assigned to the area. Food control was achieved through a system of rationing, convoys, gate checks and searches. One company began operations in the swamp, about 21 December 1954. On 9 January 1955, full-scale tactical operations began; artillery, mortars and aircraft began harassing fires in the South Swamp. Originally, the plan was to bomb and shell the swamp day and night so that the terrorists would be driven out into ambushes; but the terrorists were well prepared to stay indefinitely. Food parties came out occasionally, but the civil population was too afraid to report them.\n\nPlans were modified; harassing fires were reduced to night-time only. Ambushes continued and patrolling inside the swamp was intensified. Operations of this nature continued for three months without results. Finally on 21 March, an ambush party, after forty-five hours of waiting, succeeded in killing two of eight terrorists. The first two red pins, signifying kills, appeared on the operations map, and local morale rose a little.\n\nAnother month passed before it was learned that the terrorists were making a contact inside the swamp. One platoon established an ambush; one terrorist appeared and was killed. May passed without a contact. In June, a chance meeting by a patrol accounted for one killed and one captured. A few days later, after four fruitless days of patrolling, one platoon en route to camp accounted for two more terrorists. The No. 3 terrorist in the area surrendered and stated that food control was so effective that one terrorist had been murdered in a quarrel over food.\n\nOn 7 July, two additional companies were assigned to the area; patrolling and harassing fires were intensified. Three terrorists surrendered and one of them led a platoon patrol to the terrorist leader's camp. The patrol attacked the camp, killing four, including the leader. Other patrols accounted for four more; by the end of July, twenty-three terrorists remained in the swamp with no food or communications with the outside world...\n\nThis was the nature of operations: 60,000 artillery shells, 30,000 rounds of mortar ammunition, and 2,000 aircraft bombs for 35 terrorists killed or captured. Each one represented 1,500 man-days of patrolling or waiting in ambushes. \"Nassau\" was considered a success for the end of the emergency was one step nearer.<ref>Taber, ''The War of the Flea'', pp.140\u2013141.

CO1030/30</ref> The Government of Singapore issued an identical offer at the same time. [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], as Chief Minister, made good the offer of an amnesty but promised there would be no negotiations with the MNLA. The terms of the amnesty were:\n* Those of you who come in and surrender will not be prosecuted for any offence connected with the Emergency, which you have committed under Communist direction, either before this date or in ignorance of this declaration.\n* You may surrender now and to whom you like including to members of the public.\n* There will be no general \"ceasefire\" but the security forces will be on alert to help those who wish to accept this offer and for this purpose local \"ceasefire\" will be arranged.\n* The Government will conduct investigations on those who surrender. Those who show that they are genuinely intent to be loyal to the Government of Malaya and to give up their Communist activities will be helped to regain their normal position in society and be reunited with their families. As regards the remainder, restrictions will have to be placed on their liberty but if any of them wish to go to China, their request will be given due consideration.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Prof Madya Dr. Nik Anuar Nik Mahmud, Tunku Abdul Rahman and His Role in the Baling Talks</ref>\n\nFollowing the declaration, an intensive publicity campaign on an unprecedented scale was launched by the government. Alliance Ministers in the Federal Government travelled extensively up and down the country exhorting the people to call upon the communists to lay down their arms and take advantage of the amnesty. Despite the campaign, few Communists surrendered to the authorities. Some critics in the political circles commented that the amnesty was too restrictive and little more than a restatement of the surrender terms which had been in force for a long period. The critics advocated a more realistic and liberal approach of direct negotiations with the MCP to work out a settlement of the issue. Leading officials of the [[Labour Party of Malaya|Labour Party]] had, as part of the settlement, not excluded the possibility of recognition of the MCP as a political organisation. Within the Alliance itself, influential elements in both the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] and [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] were endeavouring to persuade the Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, to hold negotiations with the MCP.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Baling talks and their consequences===\n{{Main|Baling Talks}}\n[[File:Malya Emergency British Artillery.jpg|thumb|right|British artillery firing on an insurgent hide-out in the Malayan jungle, 1955]]\nRealising that his conflict had not come to any fruition, Chin Peng sought a discussion with the ruling British government alongside many Malayan officials in 1955. The talks took place in the Government English School at [[Baling]] on 28 December. Chin Ping walked out from the jungle, and tried to negotiate with the leader of the Federation, but the British Intelligence Service worried that the MCP would regain influence in society. The MCP was represented by [[Chin Peng]], the Secretary-General, [[Rashid Maidin]] and [[Chen Tien]], head of the MCP's Central Propaganda Department; on the other side were three elected national representatives, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], Dato' [[Tan Cheng Lock|Tan Cheng-Lock]] and [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Saul Marshall]], the Chief Minister of Singapore. The meeting was intended to pursue a mutual end to the conflict but the Malayan government representatives, led by Tunku Abdul Rahman, dismissed all of Chin Peng's demands. As a result, the conflict heightened and, in response, [[New Zealand]] sent NZSAS soldiers, [[No. 14 Squadron RNZAF]], [[No. 41 Squadron RNZAF|No. 41 (Bristol Freighter) Squadron RNZAF]] and, later, [[No. 75 Squadron RNZAF]]; other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] members also sent troops to aid the British.\n\nFollowing the failure of the talks, Tunku decided to withdraw the amnesty on 8 February 1956, five months after it had been offered, stating that he would not be willing to meet the Communists again unless they indicated beforehand their desire to see him with a view to making \"a complete surrender\".<ref>MacGillivray to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, 15 March 1956, CO1030/22</ref> Despite the failure of the talks, the MCP made every effort to resume peace talks with the Malayan government, without success. Meanwhile, discussions began in the new Emergency Operations Council to intensify the \"People's War\" against the guerillas. In July 1957, a few weeks before independence, the MCP made another attempt at peace talks, suggesting the following conditions for a negotiated peace:\n* its members should be given privileges enjoyed by citizens; and\n* a guarantee that political as well as armed members of the MCP would not be punished.\n\nThe failure of the talks affected MCP policy. At the same time, the strength of the MNLA and 'Min Yuen' declined to only 1830 members in August 1957. Those who remained faced going into exile, or death in the jungle. Tunku Abdul Rahman, however, did not respond to the MCP's proposals. With the independence of Malaya under Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman on 31 August 1957, the insurrection lost its rationale as a war of colonial liberation. The last serious resistance from MRLA guerrillas ended with a surrender in the [[Telok Anson]] marsh area in 1958. The remaining MRLA forces fled to the [[Thailand|Thai border]] and further east. On 31 July 1960 the Malayan government declared the state of emergency was over, and Chin Peng left south Thailand for Beijing where he was accommodated by the Chinese authorities in the International Liaison Bureau, where many other Southeast Asian Communist Party leaders were housed.\n\n==Casualties==\nDuring the conflict, security forces killed 6,710 MRLA guerrillas and captured 1,287, while 2,702 guerrillas surrendered during the conflict, and approximately 500 more did so at its conclusion. 1,345 Malayan troops and police were killed during the fighting,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/my_polic.html |title=Royal Malaysian Police (Malaysia) |publisher=Crwflags.com |accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref> as well as 519 Commonwealth personnel.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IY9MDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT52&lpg=PT52&dq=519+Commonwealth+2,478+civilians#v=onepage&q=519%20Commonwealth%202,478%20civilians&f=false|title=Long Tan: The Start of a Lifelong Battle|last=Smith|first=Harry|date=2015-08-01|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|isbn=9781922132321|language=en}}</ref> 2,478 civilians were killed, with another 810 recorded as missing.<ref name=\"Smith\"/><!-- No page numbers?\nThe citation includes a link to a google books site which shows me where the casualty numbers are, but this strange book appears to have no page numbers.\nHow are we supposed to cite a book with no page numbers? -->\n\n==War crimes==\n{{Main|List of war crimes#1948.E2.80.931960:_Malayan_Emergency|l1=List of war crimes \u00a7 1948-1960: Malayan Emergency|Bukit Kepong incident}}\n[[War crimes]] have been broadly defined by the [[Nuremberg Principles]] as \"violations of the [[laws or customs of war]],\" which includes [[massacres]], [[bomb]]ings of civilian targets, [[terrorism]], [[mutilation]], [[torture]], and the murder of [[detainees]] and [[prisoners of war]].

Brian Lapping said that there was \"some vicious conduct by the British forces, who routinely beat up Chinese [[Squatting|squatters]] when they refused, or possibly were unable, to give information\" about the insurgents. There were also cases of dead guerrillas being exhibited in public for identification, and to potentially entrap grieving associates. In addition, from 18 June 1948 up until 15 April 1950, 35,000 people were exiled, including those unable to leave the country.<ref>Chin, C. (2012). Dialogues with Chin Peng: New Light on the Malayan Communist Party. Chinese Edition.</ref> The ''Scotsman'' newspaper lauded these tactics as a good practice since \"simple-minded peasants are told and come to believe that the communist leaders are invulnerable\". British forces also [[booby-trapped]] jungle food stores, burned villages and secretly supplied self-detonating grenades and bullets to the insurgents to instantly kill the user. Some civilians and detainees were also shot, either because they attempted to flee from and potentially aid insurgents or simply because they refused to give intelligence to British forces. These tactics strained relations between civilians and British forces in Malaya and were therefore counterproductive in generating the one resource critical in a counterinsurgency, good intelligence.<ref name=\"MAY\">[http://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=polsci_pubs The Other Forgotten War: Understanding Atrocities During the Malayan Emergency]</ref> British troops were often unable to tell the difference between enemy [[combatants]] and [[non-combatant]] [[civilians]] while conducting [[military operations]] through the jungles, due to the fact the guerrillas wore civilian clothing and had support from sympathetic civilian populations.\n\nIn the \"[[Batang Kali massacre]]\", 24 villagers were killed by 7th Platoon, G Company, 2nd [[Scots Guard]]s, after they surrounded a rubber plantation at Sungai Rimoh near [[Batang Kali]] in [[Selangor]] in December 1948.

This is in contrast to Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) where French colonial officials had not been at war against the Japanese, who endeavoured to excite Vietnamese nationalism against France.

This allowed Vietnamese Communist troops safe haven from US ground attacks. The MNLA had only a border with [[Thailand]], where they were forced to take shelter near the end of the conflict.\n\n===Similarities===\nMany tactics used by the Americans in Vietnam were similar to those used by the British in Malaya. Some examples are listed below.\n\n====Agent Orange====\n{{Main|Agent Orange}}\nDuring the Malayan Emergency, Britain was the first nation to employ the use of [[herbicides]] and [[defoliants]] to destroy bushes, food crops, and trees to deprive the insurgents of cover and as part of the food denial campaign in the early 1950s. The [[2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-D]] (Agent Orange) were used to clear [[lines of communication]] and wipe out food crops as part of this strategy and in 1952, [[trioxone]], and mixtures of the aforementioned herbicides, were sent along a number of key roads. From June to October 1952, 1,250 acres of roadside vegetation at possible ambush points were sprayed with defoliant, described as a policy of \"national importance\". The British reported that the use of herbicides and defoliants could be effectively replaced by removing vegetation by hand and the spraying was stopped. However, after this strategy failed, the use of herbicides and defoliants in effort to fight the insurgents was restarted under the command of British General [[Gerald Templer|Sir Gerald Templer]] in February 1953, as a means of destroying food crops grown by communist forces in jungle clearings. [[Helicopters]] and [[fixed-wing aircraft]] despatched [[Trichloroacetic acid|STCA]] and Trioxaone, along with pellets of [[(2-Chlorophenyl)thiourea|chlorophenyl]] [[N,N-Dimethyl-1-naphthylamine]] onto crops such as [[sweet potatoes]] and [[maize]]. Many Commonwealth personnel who handled and/or used Agent Orange during, and in the decades after, the conflict suffered from serious exposure to dioxin and Agent Orange. An estimated 10,000 civilians and insurgents in Malaya also suffered heavily from the effects of the defoliant (though many historians agree it was likely more than this number given that Agent Orange was used on a large scale in the Malayan conflict and unlike the US, the British government manipulated the numbers and kept its secret very tight in fear of negative world public opinion). The prolonged absence of vegetation from defoliation had also resulted in major [[soil erosion]] to areas of Malaya.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pesticide Dilemma in the Third World: A Case Study of Malaysia |pages=23 |publisher=Phoenix Press |year=1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dioxins and Health |pages=145\u2013160 |author=Arnold Schecter, Thomas A.

Mauroni |year=July 2003}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Malayan conflict ended in 1960, the US considered British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a [[law of war|legally accepted tactic of warfare]]. [[US Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] advised [[US President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] that the precedent of using herbicide in warfare had been established by the British through their use of aircraft to spray herbicide and thus destroy enemy crops and thin the thick jungle of northern Malaya.<ref name=\"USE\">{{cite book |title=The Global Politics of Pesticides: Forging Consensus from Conflicting Interests |page=61 |author=Bruce Cumings |year=1998 |publisher=[[Earthscan]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Pamela Sodhy 1991 284\u2013290\"/>\n\n====Aerial bombardment====\nLike the [[US Air Force]] in Vietnam, widespread [[saturation bombardment]] was used by the [[Royal Air Force]] throughout the conflict in Malaya. Britain conducted 4,500 air strikes in the first five years of the Malayan war. Mapping was poor, communications were abysmal, the meteorology was unfavourable and airfields were few. Buzzing likely enemy positions was used (the modern '[[show of force]]'), and the bombing of potential escape routes was also occasionally practised. Author Robert Jackson said that: \"During 1956, some 545,000 lb. of bombs had been dropped on a supposed [guerrilla] encampment...but a lack of accurate pinpoints had nullified the effect. The camp was again attacked at the beginning of May 1957...[dropping] a total of 94,000 lb. of bombs, but because of inaccurate target information this weight of explosive was 250 yards off target. Then, on 15 May...70,000 lb. of bombs were dropped\". \"The attack was entirely successful\", Jackson declares, since \"four terrorists were killed\". The author also notes that a 500&nbsp;lb. nose-fused bomb was employed from August 1948 and had a mean area of effectiveness of 15,000 square feet. \"Another very viable weapon\" was the 20&nbsp;lb. [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation bomb]], a forerunner of [[cluster bombs]]. \"Since a [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] could carry a load of 190, its effect on terrorist morale was considerable\", Jackson states. \"Unfortunately, it was not used in great numbers, despite its excellent potential as a harassing weapon\". On one occasion a [[Avro Lincoln|Lincoln]] bomber \"dropp[ed] its bombs 600 yards short...killing twelve civilians and injuring twenty-six others\". The British reported that bombing jungles was largely a waste of effort due to inaccurate targeting and the inability to confirm if a target was hostile or not. Throughout the 12-year conflict, between 670 and 995 [[non-combatants]] were killed by British RAF bombers.<ref name=\"MAY\" /><ref name=\"Mark Curtis 61\u201371\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=The Malayan Emergency |pages=28\u201334 |author=Robert Jackson |date=August 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Resettlement programme====\nBritain also set up a \"[[Population transfer|resettlement]]\" programme that provided a model for the US's [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] in Vietnam. During the Malayan Emergency, 450 [[new village]]s were created and it is estimated that 470,509 people \u2013 400,000 Chinese \u2013 were [[interned]] in the resettlement program. A key British war measure was inflicting [[collective punishment]]s on villages where people were deemed to be aiding the insurgents. At [[Tanjung Malim|Tanjong Malim]] in March 1952 Templer imposed a twenty-two-hour house [[curfew]], banned everyone from leaving the village, closed the schools, stopped bus services and reduced the rice rations for 20,000 people. The latter measure prompted the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to write to the Colonial Office noting that the \"chronically undernourished Malayan\" might not be able to survive as a result. \"This measure is bound to result in an increase, not only of sickness but also of deaths, particularly amongst the mothers and very young children\". Some people were fined for leaving their homes to use external latrines. In another collective punishment \u2013 at [[Sungai Pelek|Sengei Pelek]] the following month \u2013 measures included a house curfew, a reduction of 40 per cent in the rice ration and the construction of a chain-link fence 22 yards outside the existing barbed wire fence around the town. Officials explained that these measures were being imposed upon the 4,000 villagers \"for their continually supplying food\" to the insurgents and \"because they did not give information to the authorities\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The US-Malaysian nexus: Themes in superpower-small state relations |pages=356\u2013365 |author=Pamela Sodhy |publisher=Institute of Strategic and International Studies, Malaysia |year=1991}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malayan Police patrol.jpg|thumb|190px|Two suspected guerillas after capture by Jungle Squad officers]]\n\n====Search and destroy====\nLike the USA later did in Vietnam, British troops sometimes set fire to villages whose inhabitants were accused of supporting the insurgents, detaining thousands of suspected collaborators, and to deny the insurgents cover. British units that discovered civilians providing assistance to insurgents were to detain and interrogate them, using torture and the threat of violence against family members, to discover the location of insurgent camps. Insurgents had numerous advantages over British forces; they lived in closer proximity to villagers, they sometimes had relatives or close friends in the village, and they were not afraid to threaten violence or torture and murder village leaders as an example to the others, forcing them to assist them with food and information. British forces thus faced a dual threat: the insurgents and the silent network in villages who supported them. While the insurgents rarely sought out contact with British forces, they did use terrorist tactics to intimidate civilians and elicit material support.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} British troops often described the terror of jungle patrols; in addition to watching out for insurgent fighters, they had to navigate difficult terrain and avoid dangerous animals and insects. Many patrols would stay in the jungle for days, even weeks, without encountering the enemy and then, in a brief moment, insurgents would ambush them. British forces, unable to distinguish friend from foe, had to adjust to the constant risk of an insurgent attack. These instances led to the infamous [[Batang Kali massacre|incident at Batang Kali]] where 24 unarmed villagers were [[Batang Kali massacre|killed]] by British troops.<ref name=\"MAY\" /><ref name=\"MAL\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Tugu Negara.jpg|thumb|The [[Tugu Negara|National Monument]] commemorating those who died in Malaysia's struggle for freedom, including the Malayan Emergency.]]\n\nThe [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] of 1963\u201366 arose from tensions between Indonesia and the new British backed [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] that was conceived in the aftermath of the Malayan Emergency.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the coverage of the [[My Lai massacre]] during the [[Vietnam War]] prompted the initiation of investigations in the UK concerning alleged war crimes perpetrated by British forces during the Emergency, such as the [[Batang Kali massacre]].
