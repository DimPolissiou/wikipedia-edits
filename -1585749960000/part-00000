It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries.<ref name=\"hogg2002\">Hogg, Ian (2002). ''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''.

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] variant of the FAL was redesigned from FN's [[metre|metrical]] FAL into British [[imperial units]] and was produced under licence as the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1946, the first FAL prototype was completed. It was designed to fire the intermediate [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge developed and used by the forces of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]] (with the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]]). After testing this prototype in 1948, the [[British Army]] urged FN to build additional prototypes, including one in [[bullpup]] configuration, chambered for their new [[.280 British]] [7x43mm] caliber intermediate cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|title=FN FAL (Belgium)|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117172148/http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After evaluating the single bullpup prototype, FN decided to return instead to their original, conventional design for future production.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/>\n\nIn 1950, the United Kingdom presented the redesigned FN rifle and the British [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], both in .280 British calibre, to the United States for comparison testing against the favoured [[United States Army]] design of the time\u2014Earle Harvey's T25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html|title=Earl Harvey's T-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325165934/http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html |archivedate= 25 March 2012|work=powmadeak47.com}}</ref> It was hoped that a common cartridge and rifle could be standardized for issue to the armies of all NATO member countries. After this testing was completed, U.S. Army officials suggested that FN should redesign their rifle to fire the U.S. prototype \".30 Light Rifle\" cartridge. FN decided to hedge their bets with the U.S., and in 1951 even made a deal that the U.S. could produce FALs royalty-free, given that the UK appeared to be favouring their own EM-2.\n\nThis decision appeared to be correct when the British Army decided to adopt the EM-2 (as Rifle No.9 Mk1) and .280 British cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/> This decision was later rescinded after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost the 1951 General Election and [[Winston Churchill]] returned as Prime Minister. It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that there was a [[quid pro quo]] agreement between Churchill and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] in 1952 that the British accept the .30 Light Rifle cartridge as NATO standard in return for the U.S. acceptance of the FN FAL as NATO standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|title=The FN FAL Was Almost America's Battle Rifle|first=War Is|last=Boring|date=5 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506202808/https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The .30 Light Rifle cartridge was in fact later standardized as the 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO; however, the U.S. insisted on continued rifle tests. The FAL chambered for the .30 Light Rifle went up against the redesigned T25 (now redesignated as the T47), and an M1 Garand variant, the T44. Eventually, the T44 won, becoming the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. However, in the meantime, most other NATO countries were evaluating and selecting the FAL.\n\nFN created what is possibly the classic post-war [[battle rifle]]. Formally introduced by its designer [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]] in 1951, and produced two years later, it has been described as the \"Right Arm of the Free World.\"{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=5}} The FAL battle rifle has its [[Warsaw Pact]] counterpart in the [[AKM]], each being fielded by dozens of countries and produced in many of them. A few, such as Israel and South Africa, manufactured and issued both designs at various times. Unlike the Soviet AKM assault rifle, the FAL utilized a heavier full-power [[rifle]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]].\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:PISTONM16.gif|thumb|left|Short-stroke gas piston, the action used on the FAL.]]\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|L1A1 British FAL variant field stripped.]]\n\nThe FAL operates by means of a [[gas-operated]] [[Firearm action|action]] very similar to that of the Russian [[SVT-40]]. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], and the locking mechanism is what is known as a ''tilting breechblock''. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] much like the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolts]] of the Russian [[SKS]] [[carbine]] and French [[MAS-49]] series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of [[rifle grenade]]s and manual operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|title=Tuning the FAL's Gas System|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112160722/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] versions of the FAL, the [[recoil]] spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.<ref name=\"popeneker\">Popeneker, Maxim & Williams, Anthony (2005). ''Assault Rifle''. The Crowood Press Ltd. {{ISBN|1-86126-700-2}}.</ref>\nFor field stripping the FAL can be opened. During opening the rifle pivots between the trigger guard and magazine well to give access to the action and piston system. This opening method causes a suboptimal iron sight line as the rear and front sight elements of the sight line are fixed to two different movable subassemblies.\n\nFAL rifles have also been manufactured in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with [[bipod]]s, although some light barrel models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.\n\nAmong other 7.62\u00d751mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had relatively light recoil, due to the user-adjustable gas system being able to be tuned via a regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to bleed off. The regulator is an adjustable gas port opening that adjusts the rifle to function reliably with various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, making the FAL not ammunition specific. In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref> Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from FN FAL -->\n\n===FN production variants===\n\nDepending on the variant and the country of adoption, the FAL was issued as either [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] only or [[selective fire|select-fire]] (capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes).\n\n====LAR 50.41 & 50.42 (FAL HBAR & FALO)====\n* Also known as FALO as an abbreviation from the French ''Fusil Automatique Lourd'';\n* Heavy barrel for sustained fire with a 30-round magazine as a [[squad automatic weapon]];\n* Known in Canada as the C2A1, it was their primary squad automatic weapon until it was phased out during the 1980s in favor of the [[FN Minimi|C9]], which has better accuracy and higher ammunition capacity than the C2;\n* Known to the Australian Army as the L2A1, it was replaced by the FN Minimi.

Although the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]] \"bullpup\" did well, American observers protested that the small-bore .280-caliber round lacked the power and range of a medium-bore .30-caliber round. British observers in return claimed the experimental American [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|.30-caliber T65 round]] [7.62\u00d751mm] was too powerful to control in automatic fire. Britain was forced to abandon the promising .280 round and adopt the American-designed .30-caliber T65 as the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The EM-2 couldn't be rechambered for the longer and more powerful cartridge and the Americans didn't yet have a working service rifle of their own. Britain and Canada adopted the Belgian 7.62mm FN FAL instead as the L1 ''Self-Loading Rifle'' (SLR).\n* '''FAL .280 Experimental Automatic Carbine, Short Model (1951)''': A [[Bullpup|bullpup-frame]] version of the FAL chambered in .280 British designed to compete with the British EM-1 and EM-2 bullpup rifles.

The first 20,000 were manufactured by ''Fabrique Nationale d\u2019Armes de Guerre''-Herstal Belgique, but later the StG58 was manufactured under licence by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] (now [[Steyr Mannlicher]]), and was formerly the standard rifle of the [[Austrian Armed Forces|''\u00d6sterreichisches Bundesheer'']] (Austrian Federal Army). It is essentially a user-customized version of the FAL and is still in use, mainly as a drill weapon in the Austrian forces. It was selected in a 1958 competition, beating the Spanish [[CETME]] and American [[Armalite AR-10|AR-10]].\n\n[[File:West German FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Two West German soldiers on a joint exercise in 1960. West Germany used the FN FAL designated as G1.]]\n\nMost StG 58s featured a folding bipod, and differ from the FAL by using a plastic [[stock (firearms)|stock]] rather than wood in order to reduce weight in the later production rifles (although some of the early FN-built production rifles did come with wooden stocks). The rifle can be distinguished from its Belgian and Argentine counterparts by its combination [[flash suppressor]] and [[grenade launcher]]. The foregrip was a two-part steel pressing.\n\nSteyr-built StG 58s had a hammer forged barrel that was considered to be the best barrel fitted to any FAL. Some StG58s had modifications made to the fire mode selector so that the fully automatic option was removed, leaving the selector with only safe and single-shot positions. The StG 58 was replaced by the [[Steyr AUG]] in 1977, although the StG 58 served with many units as the primary service rifle through the mid-1980s.\n\n====Olin/Winchester FAL====\nA semi-automatic, twin-barrel variant chambered in the 5.56mm Duplex round during [[Project SALVO]].

The FAL was also exported to many other countries, such as [[Venezuela]], where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL is the amount of work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting bolt mechanism tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 19.JPG|thumb|Weapons in the [[Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]]]]\n\nThe Argentine Armed Forces officially adopted the FN FAL in 1955, but the first FN made examples did not arrive in Argentina until the autumn of 1958. Subsequently, in 1960, licensed production of FALs began and continued until the mid-to-late 1990s, when production ceased. In 2010, a project to modernize all existing FAL and to produce an unknown number of them was approved. This project was called FAL M5.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nArgentine FALs were produced by the government-owned arsenal FM (Fabricaciones Militares) at the F\u00e1brica Militar de Armas Port\u00e1tiles \"Domingo Matheu\" (FMAP \"DM\") in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The acronym \"FAL\" was kept, its translation being \"Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Liviano\", (Light Automatic Rifle). Production weapons included \"Standard\" and \"Para\" (folding buttstock) versions. Military rifles were produced with the full auto fire option. The rifles were usually known as the FM FAL, for the \"Fabricaciones Militares\" brand name (FN and FM have a long-standing licensing and manufacturing agreement). A heavy barrel version, known as the ''FAP'' (''Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado'', or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon. The Argentine 'heavy barrel' FAL, also used by several other nations, was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode.\n\n[[Image:Bayoneta de FAL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|FAL [[bayonet]].]]\n\nA version of the FALMP III chambered in the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the early 1980s. It used M16 type magazines but one version called the FALMP III 5.56mm Type 2 used [[Steyr AUG]] magazines. The [[FARA 83]] (Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablica Argentina) was to replace the Argentine military's FAL rifles. The design borrowed features from the FAL such as the gas system and folding stock. It seems to have been also influenced to some degree by other rifles (the Beretta AR70/223, M16, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]]). An estimated quantity of between 2,500 and 3,000 examples were produced for field testing, but military spending cuts killed the project in the mid-1980s.\n\nThere was also a semi-automatic\u2013only version, the ''FSL'', intended for the civilian market. Legislation changes in 1995 (namely, the enactment of ''Presidential Decree N\u00ba 64/95'') imposed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on \"semi-automatic assault weapons\". Today, it can take up to two years to obtain a permit for the ownership of an FSL. The FSL was offered with full or folding stocks, plastic furniture and orthoptic sights.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Soldadosargesperandodesembarco.jpg|thumb|right|Argentine soldiers armed with FAL, Falklands War]]\n\nArgentine FALs saw action during the [[Falklands War]] (Falklands-Malvinas/South Atlantic War), and in different peace-keeping operations such as in Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia. Rosario-made FALs are known to have been exported to Bolivia (in 1971), Colombia, Croatia (during the wars in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s), Honduras, Nigeria (this is unconfirmed, most Nigerian FALs are from FN in Belgium or are British-made L1A1s), Peru, and Uruguay (which reportedly took delivery of some Brazilian IMBEL-made FALs as well).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Deactivated Argentinean FALs from the many thousands captured during the Falklands War are used by UK forces as part of the soldier's load on some training courses run over public land in the UK.\n\nThe [[Argentine Marine Corps]], a branch of the Argentine Navy, has replaced the FN/FM FAL in front line units, adopting the U.S. M16A2. The Argentine Army has expressed its desire to acquire at least 1,500 new rifles chambered for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/U.S. M855 (.223 Remington) cartridge, to be used primarily by its peacekeeping troops on overseas deployments.\n\nThe US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) secretly purchased several thousand Argentine FAL rifles in 1981, which were supplied to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] rebel group. These rifles have since appeared throughout Central America in use with other organizations.\n\nThese rifles are currently being modernized to a new standard, the FAL M5 (or FAL V), which uses polymer parts to reduce weight, and has [[Picatinny rails]] and optic mounts for carrying accessories, that created these variants:\n* '''FAMTD''': ''Fusil Argentino Modelo Tirador Destacado - Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Pesado'' (Argentine Designated Marksman Rifle - Heavy Barrel), [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] variant.

Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the ''[[IMBEL|Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil]]'' (IMBEL), in [[Itajub\u00e1]] in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22&nbsp;mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model \"D\" carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon.[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26607172042).jpg|left|thumb|[[Caatinga]] soldier of the Brazilian Army.]]\nBrazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56\u00d745mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the [[Military Police]]. Its new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use [[STANAG magazine]]s, but have different buttstocks. The MD-2 features an FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.\n\nHowever, Brazil's current service weapon is a Brazilian FAL-based assault rifle in 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm versions, with Assault Rifle and Carbine variants, including a Sniper and CQB rifle, called the [[IMBEL A2|IA2]], also produced by IMBEL.\n\nAlong with the IA2, MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, Brazil produces the M964A1/Pelopes (Special Operations Platoon), with an 11\" barrel, 3-point sling and a [[Picatinny rail]] with a [[tactical flashlight]] and sight.<ref>BASTOS, Carlos Stephani.

These weapons were intended for the ''[[German Federal Police|Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (border guard) and not the nascent ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (army), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956, however, West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. FN made the rifles between April 1957 and May 1958. G1s served in the West German ''Bundeswehr'' for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before they were replaced by the Spanish [[CETME]] Modelo 58 rifle in 1959 (which was extensively reworked into the later [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] rifle). The G1 featured a pressed metal handguard identical to the ones used on the Austrian Stg. 58, as well as the Dutch and Greek FALs, this being slightly slimmer than the standard wood or plastic handguards, and featuring horizontal lines running almost their entire length. G1s were also fitted with a unique removable prong flash hider, adding another external distinction. The main reason for the replacement of the G1 in Germany was the refusal of the Belgians to grant a license for production of the weapon in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|title=Europe|website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427012535/http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after their withdrawal from German service. Of note is the fact that the G1 was the first FAL variant with the 3mm lower sights specifically requested by Germany, previous versions having the taller Commonwealth-type sights also seen on Israeli models.\n\n===Greece===\nFN FAL rifles produced in Belgium were adopted by the Greek Army before the adoption of HK G3A3s rifles produced under license by [[Hellenic Arms Industry]] (\u0395\u0392\u039f). For a few years, FN FAL rifles were also produced under license by the Greek [[PYRKAL]] (\u03a0\u03a5\u03a1\u039a\u0391\u039b) factory. FN FAL and FALO rifles were in use by the Greek Army Special Forces and [[IV Army Corps (Greece)|IV Army Corps]] from 1973 till 1999, and are still in use by the Greek Coast Guard.<ref name=Sazanidis>Sazanidis {{page needed|date=January 2019}}</ref><ref name=HAGS>''Hellenic Army General Staff / Army History Directorate''</ref>\n\n===Israel===\n[[File:Israeli Heavy Barrel FAL, note the hinged buttplate.jpg|thumb|Israeli Heavy Barrel FAL. Note the hinged butt plate.]]\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) had to overcome several [[Military logistics|logistics problems]] which were a result of the wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]]-produced [[Uzi]] submachine gun. To replace the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar 98k]] and some British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name ''Rov've Mitta'enn'' or ''Romat'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\"\u05d8), an abbreviation of \"Self-Loading Rifle\". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the ''Makle'a Kal'', or ''Makleon'') was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward perforated sheet metal section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the [[BT/AT 52|AT 52]] which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.<ref name=\"Cashner2013gren\">{{harvnb|Cashner|2013|pp=21\u201322|ps=:\"''The IDF has long been fond of the rifle grenade. For night assaults on prepared defensive positions, Israeli infantry often crept to within rifle grenade range. The assault was started with a volley of grenades onto the enemy positions intended to stun them and put their heads down, immediately followed by the infantry assault before their opponents could recover... As far back as the 1960s, S.L.A. Marshall noted: \"Israel's infantry prefers the rifle-fired antitank grenade to the bazooka for shock effect on a group or bunker.

During the [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973 it was still in front-line service as the standard Israeli rifle, though increasing criticism eventually led to the phasing-out of the weapon.

The FAL was originally designed to handle intermediate cartridges, but in an attempt to secure US favor for the rifle, the FAL was redesigned to use the newly developed 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The US tested several variants of the FAL to replace the M1 Garand. These rifles were tested against the T44, essentially an updated version of the basic Garand design.<ref name=\"STE\">Stevens, R. Blake, ''The FAL Rifle'', Collector Grade Publications, {{ISBN|0-88935-168-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88935-168-4}} (1993)</ref> Despite the T44 and T48 showing performing similarly in trials,<ref name=\"STE\"/> the T44 was, for several reasons, selected and the US formally adopted the T44 as the [[M14 rifle|M14 service rifle]].\n\n[[File:Century Arms FN FAL.jpg|thumb|left|Century Arms FN-FAL rifle built from an [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|L1A1]] parts kit]]\nDuring the late 1980s and 1990s, many countries decommissioned the FAL from their armories and sold them ''en masse'' to United States importers as surplus. The rifles were imported to the United States as fully automatic guns. Once in the U.S., the FAL's were \"de-militarized\" (upper receiver destroyed) to eliminate the rifles' character as an automatic rifle, as stipulated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA 68 currently prohibits the importation of foreign-made full-automatic rifles prior to the enactment of the Gun Control Act; semiautomatic versions of the same firearm were legal to import until the Semiautomatic Assault Rifle Ban of 1989). Thousands of the resulting \"parts kits\" were sold at generally low prices ($90 \u2013 $250) to hobbyists. The hobbyists rebuilt the parts kits to legal and functional semi-automatic rifles on new semi-automatic upper receivers. FAL rifles are still commercially available from a few domestic firms in semi-auto configuration: Entreprise Arms, DSArms, and [[Century International Arms]]. Century Arms created a semi-automatic version L1A1 with an [[IMBEL]] upper receiver and surplus British [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] inch-pattern parts, while DSArms used Steyr-style metric-pattern FAL designs (this standard-metric difference means the Century Arms and DSArms firearms are not made from fully interchangeable batches of parts).\n\n===Venezuela===\nUntil recently, the FAL was the main service rifle of the Venezuelan army, made under license by [[CAVIM]].<ref name=\"CAVIM\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|title=A Recurrent Latin American Nightmare|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|author=Pablo Dreyfus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045713/http://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The first batch of rifles to arrive in Venezuela were chambered in [[.280 British#Variants|7\u00d749mm]] (also known as 7&nbsp;mm Liviano or 7&nbsp;mm Venezuelan). Essentially a [[7\u00d757mm]] round shortened to intermediate length, this caliber was jointly developed by Venezuelan and Belgian engineers motivated by a global move towards intermediate calibers. The Venezuelans, who had been exclusively using the 7\u00d757mm round in their light and medium weapons since the turn of the 20th century, felt it was a perfect platform on which to base a calibre tailored to the particular rigours of the Venezuelan terrain.\n\nEventually the plan was dropped despite having ordered millions of rounds and thousands of weapons of this caliber. As the Cold War escalated, the military command felt it necessary to align with NATO despite not being a member, resulting in the adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and the rechambering of the 5,000 or so FAL rifles that had already arrived in 7\u00d749mm by 1955-56.\n\nVenezuela has bought 100,000 [[AK-103]] assault rifles from Russia in order to replace the old FALs.<ref name=\"CAVIM\"/> Although the full shipment arrived by the end of 2006, the FAL will remain in service with the Venezuelan Reserve Forces and the Territorial Guard.\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Patrol Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[British Army]] patrol crossing a stream during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]].

During the [[Falklands War]], the FN FAL was used by both sides. The FAL was used by the Argentine armed forces and the L1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR), a semi-automatic only version of the FAL, was used by the armed forces of the UK and other Commonwealth nations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ten Combat Rifles|url=http://military.discovery.com/tv-shows/combat-countdown/top-10-combat-rifles.htm|publisher=Military Channel|accessdate=12 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127212217/http://military.discovery.com/tv-shows/combat-countdown/top-10-combat-rifles.htm|archive-date=27 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Mau Mau Uprising]]:<ref name=\"Encyclopedie\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Contre les Mau Mau|language=fr |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die des armes : Les forces arm\u00e9es du monde|publisher=Atlas|year=1986|pages=2764\u20132766|volume=XII|number=139.

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] variant of the FAL was redesigned from FN's [[metre|metrical]] FAL into British [[imperial units]] and was produced under licence as the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1946, the first FAL prototype was completed. It was designed to fire the intermediate [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge developed and used by the forces of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]] (with the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]]). After testing this prototype in 1948, the [[British Army]] urged FN to build additional prototypes, including one in [[bullpup]] configuration, chambered for their new [[.280 British]] [7x43mm] caliber intermediate cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|title=FN FAL (Belgium)|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117172148/http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After evaluating the single bullpup prototype, FN decided to return instead to their original, conventional design for future production.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/>\n\nIn 1950, the United Kingdom presented the redesigned FN rifle and the British [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], both in .280 British calibre, to the United States for comparison testing against the favoured [[United States Army]] design of the time\u2014Earle Harvey's T25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html|title=Earl Harvey's T-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325165934/http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html |archivedate= 25 March 2012|work=powmadeak47.com}}</ref> It was hoped that a common cartridge and rifle could be standardized for issue to the armies of all NATO member countries. After this testing was completed, U.S. Army officials suggested that FN should redesign their rifle to fire the U.S. prototype \".30 Light Rifle\" cartridge. FN decided to hedge their bets with the U.S., and in 1951 even made a deal that the U.S. could produce FALs royalty-free, given that the UK appeared to be favouring their own EM-2.\n\nThis decision appeared to be correct when the British Army decided to adopt the EM-2 (as Rifle No.9 Mk1) and .280 British cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/> This decision was later rescinded after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost the 1951 General Election and [[Winston Churchill]] returned as Prime Minister. It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that there was a [[quid pro quo]] agreement between Churchill and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] in 1952 that the British accept the .30 Light Rifle cartridge as NATO standard in return for the U.S. acceptance of the FN FAL as NATO standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|title=The FN FAL Was Almost America's Battle Rifle|first=War Is|last=Boring|date=5 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506202808/https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The .30 Light Rifle cartridge was in fact later standardized as the 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO; however, the U.S. insisted on continued rifle tests. The FAL chambered for the .30 Light Rifle went up against the redesigned T25 (now redesignated as the T47), and an M1 Garand variant, the T44. Eventually, the T44 won, becoming the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. However, in the meantime, most other NATO countries were evaluating and selecting the FAL.\n\nFN created what is possibly the classic post-war [[battle rifle]]. Formally introduced by its designer [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]] in 1951, and produced two years later, it has been described as the \"Right Arm of the Free World.\"{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=5}} The FAL battle rifle has its [[Warsaw Pact]] counterpart in the [[AKM]], each being fielded by dozens of countries and produced in many of them. A few, such as Israel and South Africa, manufactured and issued both designs at various times. Unlike the Soviet AKM assault rifle, the FAL utilized a heavier full-power [[rifle]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]].\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:PISTONM16.gif|thumb|left|Short-stroke gas piston, the action used on the FAL.]]\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|L1A1 British FAL variant field stripped.]]\n\nThe FAL operates by means of a [[gas-operated]] [[Firearm action|action]] very similar to that of the Russian [[SVT-40]]. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], and the locking mechanism is what is known as a ''tilting breechblock''. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] much like the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolts]] of the Russian [[SKS]] [[carbine]] and French [[MAS-49]] series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of [[rifle grenade]]s and manual operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|title=Tuning the FAL's Gas System|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112160722/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] versions of the FAL, the [[recoil]] spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.<ref name=\"popeneker\">Popeneker, Maxim & Williams, Anthony (2005). ''Assault Rifle''. The Crowood Press Ltd. {{ISBN|1-86126-700-2}}.</ref>\nFor field stripping the FAL can be opened. During opening the rifle pivots between the trigger guard and magazine well to give access to the action and piston system. This opening method causes a suboptimal iron sight line as the rear and front sight elements of the sight line are fixed to two different movable subassemblies.\n\nFAL rifles have also been manufactured in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with [[bipod]]s, although some light barrel models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.\n\nAmong other 7.62\u00d751mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had relatively light recoil, due to the user-adjustable gas system being able to be tuned via a regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to bleed off. The regulator is an adjustable gas port opening that adjusts the rifle to function reliably with various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, making the FAL not ammunition specific. In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref> Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from FN FAL -->\n\n===FN production variants===\n\nDepending on the variant and the country of adoption, the FAL was issued as either [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] only or [[selective fire|select-fire]] (capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes).\n\n====LAR 50.41 & 50.42 (FAL HBAR & FALO)====\n* Also known as FALO as an abbreviation from the French ''Fusil Automatique Lourd'';\n* Heavy barrel for sustained fire with a 30-round magazine as a [[squad automatic weapon]];\n* Known in Canada as the C2A1, it was their primary squad automatic weapon until it was phased out during the 1980s in favor of the [[FN Minimi|C9]], which has better accuracy and higher ammunition capacity than the C2;\n* Known to the Australian Army as the L2A1, it was replaced by the FN Minimi.

Although the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]] \"bullpup\" did well, American observers protested that the small-bore .280-caliber round lacked the power and range of a medium-bore .30-caliber round. British observers in return claimed the experimental American [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|.30-caliber T65 round]] [7.62\u00d751mm] was too powerful to control in automatic fire. Britain was forced to abandon the promising .280 round and adopt the American-designed .30-caliber T65 as the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The EM-2 couldn't be rechambered for the longer and more powerful cartridge and the Americans didn't yet have a working service rifle of their own.

The first 20,000 were manufactured by ''Fabrique Nationale d\u2019Armes de Guerre''-Herstal Belgique, but later the StG58 was manufactured under licence by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] (now [[Steyr Mannlicher]]), and was formerly the standard rifle of the [[Austrian Armed Forces|''\u00d6sterreichisches Bundesheer'']] (Austrian Federal Army). It is essentially a user-customized version of the FAL and is still in use, mainly as a drill weapon in the Austrian forces. It was selected in a 1958 competition, beating the Spanish [[CETME]] and American [[Armalite AR-10|AR-10]].\n\n[[File:West German FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Two West German soldiers on a joint exercise in 1960. West Germany used the FN FAL designated as G1.]]\n\nMost StG 58s featured a folding bipod, and differ from the FAL by using a plastic [[stock (firearms)|stock]] rather than wood in order to reduce weight in the later production rifles (although some of the early FN-built production rifles did come with wooden stocks). The rifle can be distinguished from its Belgian and Argentine counterparts by its combination [[flash suppressor]] and [[grenade launcher]]. The foregrip was a two-part steel pressing.\n\nSteyr-built StG 58s had a hammer forged barrel that was considered to be the best barrel fitted to any FAL. Some StG58s had modifications made to the fire mode selector so that the fully automatic option was removed, leaving the selector with only safe and single-shot positions. The StG 58 was replaced by the [[Steyr AUG]] in 1977, although the StG 58 served with many units as the primary service rifle through the mid-1980s.\n\n====Olin/Winchester FAL====\nA semi-automatic, twin-barrel variant chambered in the 5.56mm Duplex round during [[Project SALVO]].

It comes with a 406&nbsp;mm (16&nbsp;in), 457&nbsp;mm (18&nbsp;in) or 533&nbsp;mm (21&nbsp;in) barrel, an [[Hiduminium|aluminum-alloy]] lower receiver, and improved [[Glass-filled polymer|Glass-filled]] [[Nylon]] furniture. Civilian models are semi-automatic, but military and Law Enforcement clients can procure select-fire models that have a fully automatic [[cyclic rate]] of 750 rounds/minute. The DSA-58 can use any metric-measurement FAL magazines, which come in 5, 10, 20 or 30-round capacities.\n* The '''DSA-58 OSW (''Operational Specialist Weapon'')''' is an assault carbine version of the paratrooper model of the FAL.

The FAL was also exported to many other countries, such as [[Venezuela]], where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL is the amount of work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting bolt mechanism tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 19.JPG|thumb|Weapons in the [[Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]]]]\n\nThe Argentine Armed Forces officially adopted the FN FAL in 1955, but the first FN made examples did not arrive in Argentina until the autumn of 1958. Subsequently, in 1960, licensed production of FALs began and continued until the mid-to-late 1990s, when production ceased. In 2010, a project to modernize all existing FAL and to produce an unknown number of them was approved. This project was called FAL M5.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nArgentine FALs were produced by the government-owned arsenal FM (Fabricaciones Militares) at the F\u00e1brica Militar de Armas Port\u00e1tiles \"Domingo Matheu\" (FMAP \"DM\") in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The acronym \"FAL\" was kept, its translation being \"Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Liviano\", (Light Automatic Rifle). Production weapons included \"Standard\" and \"Para\" (folding buttstock) versions. Military rifles were produced with the full auto fire option. The rifles were usually known as the FM FAL, for the \"Fabricaciones Militares\" brand name (FN and FM have a long-standing licensing and manufacturing agreement). A heavy barrel version, known as the ''FAP'' (''Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado'', or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon. The Argentine 'heavy barrel' FAL, also used by several other nations, was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode.\n\n[[Image:Bayoneta de FAL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|FAL [[bayonet]].]]\n\nA version of the FALMP III chambered in the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the early 1980s. It used M16 type magazines but one version called the FALMP III 5.56mm Type 2 used [[Steyr AUG]] magazines. The [[FARA 83]] (Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablica Argentina) was to replace the Argentine military's FAL rifles. The design borrowed features from the FAL such as the gas system and folding stock. It seems to have been also influenced to some degree by other rifles (the Beretta AR70/223, M16, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]]). An estimated quantity of between 2,500 and 3,000 examples were produced for field testing, but military spending cuts killed the project in the mid-1980s.\n\nThere was also a semi-automatic\u2013only version, the ''FSL'', intended for the civilian market. Legislation changes in 1995 (namely, the enactment of ''Presidential Decree N\u00ba 64/95'') imposed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on \"semi-automatic assault weapons\". Today, it can take up to two years to obtain a permit for the ownership of an FSL. The FSL was offered with full or folding stocks, plastic furniture and orthoptic sights.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Soldadosargesperandodesembarco.jpg|thumb|right|Argentine soldiers armed with FAL, Falklands War]]\n\nArgentine FALs saw action during the [[Falklands War]] (Falklands-Malvinas/South Atlantic War), and in different peace-keeping operations such as in Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia. Rosario-made FALs are known to have been exported to Bolivia (in 1971), Colombia, Croatia (during the wars in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s), Honduras, Nigeria (this is unconfirmed, most Nigerian FALs are from FN in Belgium or are British-made L1A1s), Peru, and Uruguay (which reportedly took delivery of some Brazilian IMBEL-made FALs as well).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Deactivated Argentinean FALs from the many thousands captured during the Falklands War are used by UK forces as part of the soldier's load on some training courses run over public land in the UK.\n\nThe [[Argentine Marine Corps]], a branch of the Argentine Navy, has replaced the FN/FM FAL in front line units, adopting the U.S. M16A2. The Argentine Army has expressed its desire to acquire at least 1,500 new rifles chambered for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/U.S. M855 (.223 Remington) cartridge, to be used primarily by its peacekeeping troops on overseas deployments.\n\nThe US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) secretly purchased several thousand Argentine FAL rifles in 1981, which were supplied to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] rebel group. These rifles have since appeared throughout Central America in use with other organizations.\n\nThese rifles are currently being modernized to a new standard, the FAL M5 (or FAL V), which uses polymer parts to reduce weight, and has [[Picatinny rails]] and optic mounts for carrying accessories, that created these variants:\n* '''FAMTD''': ''Fusil Argentino Modelo Tirador Destacado - Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Pesado'' (Argentine Designated Marksman Rifle - Heavy Barrel), [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] variant.

Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the ''[[IMBEL|Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil]]'' (IMBEL), in [[Itajub\u00e1]] in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22&nbsp;mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model \"D\" carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon.[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26607172042).jpg|left|thumb|[[Caatinga]] soldier of the Brazilian Army.]]\nBrazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56\u00d745mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the [[Military Police]]. Its new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use [[STANAG magazine]]s, but have different buttstocks. The MD-2 features an FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.\n\nHowever, Brazil's current service weapon is a Brazilian FAL-based assault rifle in 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm versions, with Assault Rifle and Carbine variants, including a Sniper and CQB rifle, called the [[IMBEL A2|IA2]], also produced by IMBEL.\n\nAlong with the IA2, MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, Brazil produces the M964A1/Pelopes (Special Operations Platoon), with an 11\" barrel, 3-point sling and a [[Picatinny rail]] with a [[tactical flashlight]] and sight.<ref>BASTOS, Carlos Stephani.

These weapons were intended for the ''[[German Federal Police|Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (border guard) and not the nascent ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (army), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956, however, West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. FN made the rifles between April 1957 and May 1958. G1s served in the West German ''Bundeswehr'' for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before they were replaced by the Spanish [[CETME]] Modelo 58 rifle in 1959 (which was extensively reworked into the later [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] rifle). The G1 featured a pressed metal handguard identical to the ones used on the Austrian Stg. 58, as well as the Dutch and Greek FALs, this being slightly slimmer than the standard wood or plastic handguards, and featuring horizontal lines running almost their entire length. G1s were also fitted with a unique removable prong flash hider, adding another external distinction. The main reason for the replacement of the G1 in Germany was the refusal of the Belgians to grant a license for production of the weapon in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|title=Europe|website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427012535/http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after their withdrawal from German service.

Note the hinged butt plate.]]\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) had to overcome several [[Military logistics|logistics problems]] which were a result of the wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]]-produced [[Uzi]] submachine gun. To replace the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar 98k]] and some British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name ''Rov've Mitta'enn'' or ''Romat'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\"\u05d8), an abbreviation of \"Self-Loading Rifle\". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the ''Makle'a Kal'', or ''Makleon'') was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward perforated sheet metal section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the [[BT/AT 52|AT 52]] which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.<ref name=\"Cashner2013gren\">{{harvnb|Cashner|2013|pp=21\u201322|ps=:\"''The IDF has long been fond of the rifle grenade.

As far back as the 1960s, S.L.A. Marshall noted: \"Israel's infantry prefers the rifle-fired antitank grenade to the bazooka for shock effect on a group or bunker.

Following that country's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] in 1965, new rifles could not be readily procured from the UK, so Belgian FNs and South African R1s were imported instead.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The older L1s subsequently completed their service with the [[British South Africa Police]] and to a lesser extent territorial troops in the [[Rhodesia Regiment]] .<ref name=\"Fireforce\">{{cite book |last=Chris Cocks|authorlink=|title=Fireforce: One Man's War in the Rhodesian Light Infantry|edition=July 1, 2001|pages=139\u2013141 |publisher=Covos Day|isbn= 1-919874-32-1|date=2002-04-03}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], security forces fitted some standard FNs with customised [[flash suppressor]]s to reduce recoil on fully automatic fire. Rhodesian Security Forces seldom ever used the FN on automatic fire and were trained to use a \"double tap\" on semi-automatic in combat, as automatic fire was considered a total waste of ammunition. However, a few soldiers rejected these devices, which they claimed upset the balance of their weapons during close action.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/> In this theatre, the FN was generally considered superior to the Soviet [[AK-47|Kalashnikovs]] or [[SKS]] carbines carried by communist-backed [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|PF]] insurgents.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/>\n\nTrade sanctions and the gradual erosion of South African support in the 1970s led to serious part shortages.<ref name=\"SmithGB\">{{cite book|author= Smith, Ian|title=The Great Betrayal|pages=74\u201375|publisher= Blake Publishing Ltd.|location=London|year=1997|isbn=1-85782-176-9}}</ref> Consequently, shipments of [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3s]] were accepted from Portugal, although the security forces considered these less reliable than the FAL.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/> Following [[Robert Mugabe]]'s ascension to power in 1980, Rhodesia's remaining FNs were passed on to [[Zimbabwe]], its successor state.<ref name=\"jones2009\">Jones, Richard D.

The FAL was originally designed to handle intermediate cartridges, but in an attempt to secure US favor for the rifle, the FAL was redesigned to use the newly developed 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The US tested several variants of the FAL to replace the M1 Garand. These rifles were tested against the T44, essentially an updated version of the basic Garand design.<ref name=\"STE\">Stevens, R.

The rifles were imported to the United States as fully automatic guns. Once in the U.S., the FAL's were \"de-militarized\" (upper receiver destroyed) to eliminate the rifles' character as an automatic rifle, as stipulated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA 68 currently prohibits the importation of foreign-made full-automatic rifles prior to the enactment of the Gun Control Act; semiautomatic versions of the same firearm were legal to import until the Semiautomatic Assault Rifle Ban of 1989). Thousands of the resulting \"parts kits\" were sold at generally low prices ($90 \u2013 $250) to hobbyists. The hobbyists rebuilt the parts kits to legal and functional semi-automatic rifles on new semi-automatic upper receivers. FAL rifles are still commercially available from a few domestic firms in semi-auto configuration: Entreprise Arms, DSArms, and [[Century International Arms]]. Century Arms created a semi-automatic version L1A1 with an [[IMBEL]] upper receiver and surplus British [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] inch-pattern parts, while DSArms used Steyr-style metric-pattern FAL designs (this standard-metric difference means the Century Arms and DSArms firearms are not made from fully interchangeable batches of parts).\n\n===Venezuela===\nUntil recently, the FAL was the main service rifle of the Venezuelan army, made under license by [[CAVIM]].<ref name=\"CAVIM\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|title=A Recurrent Latin American Nightmare|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|author=Pablo Dreyfus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045713/http://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The first batch of rifles to arrive in Venezuela were chambered in [[.280 British#Variants|7\u00d749mm]] (also known as 7&nbsp;mm Liviano or 7&nbsp;mm Venezuelan). Essentially a [[7\u00d757mm]] round shortened to intermediate length, this caliber was jointly developed by Venezuelan and Belgian engineers motivated by a global move towards intermediate calibers. The Venezuelans, who had been exclusively using the 7\u00d757mm round in their light and medium weapons since the turn of the 20th century, felt it was a perfect platform on which to base a calibre tailored to the particular rigours of the Venezuelan terrain.\n\nEventually the plan was dropped despite having ordered millions of rounds and thousands of weapons of this caliber. As the Cold War escalated, the military command felt it necessary to align with NATO despite not being a member, resulting in the adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and the rechambering of the 5,000 or so FAL rifles that had already arrived in 7\u00d749mm by 1955-56.\n\nVenezuela has bought 100,000 [[AK-103]] assault rifles from Russia in order to replace the old FALs.<ref name=\"CAVIM\"/> Although the full shipment arrived by the end of 2006, the FAL will remain in service with the Venezuelan Reserve Forces and the Territorial Guard.\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Patrol Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[British Army]] patrol crossing a stream during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]].

The cooking of [[Istanbul]], [[Bursa]], [[Izmir]], and rest of the [[Asia Minor]] region inherits many elements of [[Ottoman court]] [[cuisine]], with a lighter use of spices, a preference for rice over [[bulgur]], [[kofte]]s and a wider availability of vegetable stews (''t\u00fcrl\u00fc''), [[eggplant]], stuffed [[dolma]]s and fish. The cuisine of the [[Black Sea Region]] uses fish extensively, especially the [[European anchovy|Black Sea anchovy]] (''hamsi'') and includes [[maize]] dishes. The cuisine of the southeast (e.g. [[Urfa]], [[Gaziantep]], and [[Adana]]) is famous for its variety of [[kebab]]s, ''[[meze]]s'' and dough-based desserts such as ''[[baklava]]'', ''[[\u015f\u00f6biyet]]'', ''[[Kanafeh|kaday\u0131f]]'', and ''[[k\u00fcnefe]]''.\n\nEspecially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees grow abundantly, [[olive oil]] is the major type of oil used for cooking.<ref name=\"multiple\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |title=Ethnic Cuisine - Turkey by Terrie Wright Chrones |access-date=2007-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429005226/http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |archive-date=2007-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The cuisines of the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]] and [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] regions are rich in vegetables, herbs, and fish. [[Central Anatolia]] has many famous specialties, such as ''[[ke\u015fkek]]'', ''[[mant\u0131]]'' (especially from [[Kayseri]]) and ''[[g\u00f6zleme]]''. Food names directly cognate with ''mant\u0131'' are found also in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] (''[[mantou]]'' or steamed bun) and [[Korean cuisine]] (''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]'').\n\nA specialty's name sometimes includes that of a city or region, either in or outside of Turkey, and may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between ''Urfa kebap'' and ''[[Adana kebap]]'' is the thickness of the skewer and the amount of hot pepper that the kebab contains. ''Urfa kebap'' is less spicy and thicker than ''Adana kebap''. Although meat-based foods such as kebabs are the mainstay in Turkish cuisine as presented in foreign countries, native Turkish meals largely center around [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, and [[bread]].\n\n== Culinary customs ==\n\n=== Breakfast ===\n[[File:Simit-2x.JPG|thumb|right|[[Simit]], a circular bread with sesame seeds, is a common breakfast item in Turkey.]]\n\nTurks usually prefer a rich breakfast. A typical Turkish [[breakfast]] consists of cheese (''[[beyaz peynir]]'', ''[[ka\u015far]]'' etc.), butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, and [[kaymak]], [[Sujuk|sucuk]] (a spicy Turkish sausage, can be eaten with eggs), ''[[past\u0131rma]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'', ''[[simit]]'', ''[[po\u011fa\u00e7a]]'' and soups are eaten as a morning meal in Turkey. A specialty for breakfast is called [[Menemen (food)|menemen]], which is prepared with tomatoes, green peppers, onion,  olive oil and eggs. Invariably, [[Turkish tea]] is served at breakfast. The Turkish word for breakfast, ''kahvalt\u0131'', means \"before coffee\" (''kahve'', 'coffee'; ''alt\u0131'', 'under').\n\n=== Homemade food ===\nHomemade food is still preferred by Turkish people. Although the newly introduced way of life pushes the new generation to eat out; Turkish people generally prefer to eat at home. A typical meal starts with soup (especially in wintertime), followed by a dish made of vegetables or legumes boiled in a pot (typically with meat or [[Mincing|minced]] meat), often with or before rice or [[bulgur]] [[pilav]] accompanied by a salad or [[cac\u0131k]] (diluted cold yogurt dish with garlic, salt, and cucumber slices). In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (''[[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131]] yemekler'') instead of the soup, either before or after the main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or fish plate.\n\n=== Restaurants ===\n[[File:Akcaabatkofte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ak\u00e7aabat meatballs]].]]\nAlthough fast food is gaining popularity and many major foreign fast food chains have opened all over Turkey, Turkish people still rely primarily on the rich and extensive dishes of Turkish cuisine. In addition, some traditional Turkish foods, especially ''[[Kofta|k\u00f6fte]]'', ''[[Doner kebab|d\u00f6ner]]'', ''[[kokore\u00e7]]'', ''[[kumpir]]'' ''midye tava'' ''b\u00f6rek'' and ''g\u00f6zleme'', are often served as fast food in Turkey. Eating out has always been common in large commercial cities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whiting | first=Dominic |year=2000 |title=Turkey Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Cz4zG73sHgC&pg=PA56&dq=lokanta |publisher=Footprint Handbooks |page=56 |isbn=978-1-900949-85-9 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> ''Esnaf lokantas\u0131'' (meaning restaurants for shopkeepers and tradesmen) are widespread, serving traditional Turkish home cooking at affordable prices.\n\n=== Summer cuisine ===\nIn the hot Turkish summer, a meal often consists of fried vegetables such as eggplant (aubergine) and peppers or potatoes served with yogurt or tomato sauce. [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] and [[\u00e7\u0131lb\u0131r]] are typical summer dishes, based on eggs. Sheep cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and melons also make a light summer meal. Those who like helva for dessert prefer ''summer helva'', which is lighter and less sweet than the regular one.\n\n=== Key ingredients ===\nFrequently used ingredients in Turkish specialties include: lamb, beef, rice, fish, [[eggplant]]s, [[bell pepper|green peppers]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[lentil]]s, [[bean]]s, [[zucchini]]s and [[tomato]]es. Nuts, especially [[pistachio]]s, [[chestnut]]s, [[almond]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, and [[walnut]]s, together with spices, have a special place in Turkish cuisine, and are used extensively in desserts or eaten separately. [[Semolina]] flour is used to make a cake called [[Basbousa|''revani'']] and [[Halva|''irmik helvasi'']].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|+Commonly used spices and flavorings:\n!Name\n!Turkish\n!Used in\n!References\n|-\n|[[Allspice]]\n|''Yenibahar'' or ''Dolma bahar''\n|[[Dolma]], vegetables, rice, fish\n|<ref name=akin>{{Cite book| publisher = Abrams| isbn = 978-1-61312-871-8| last = Akin| first = Engin| title = Essential Turkish Cuisine| date = 2015-10-06}}</ref><ref name=basan>{{Cite book| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-15617-6| last = Basan| first = Ghillie| title = Classic Turkish Cooking| date = 1997-04-15}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Anise]]\n|''Anason''\n|[[Peksimet]], [[rak\u0131]], used to season nut and dried fruit mixtures in both sweet and savory dishes\n|<ref name=akin /><ref name=basan />\n|-\n|[[Black pepper]]\n|''Kara biber''\n|egg dishes, meat dishes, [[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]]\n|<ref name=akin />\n|-\n|[[Cardamom]]\n|''Kakule''\n|Rarely used, mostly in coffee.

[[Beyaz peynir]] and [[yogurt]] are part of many dishes including [[b\u00f6rek]], [[manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[kebab]] and [[Tzatziki|cacik]].\n\n=== Oils and fats ===\n[[Butter]] or [[margarine]], [[olive oil]], [[sunflower oil]], [[canola oil]], and [[corn oil]] are widely used for cooking. [[Sesame]], [[hazelnut]], [[peanut]] and [[walnut]] oils are used as well. ''Kuyruk ya\u011f\u0131'' ([[tail fat]] of [[sheep]]) is sometimes used in kebabs and meat dishes.\n\n=== Fruit ===\nThe rich and diverse flora of Turkey means that fruit is varied, abundant and cheap. In Ottoman cuisine, fruit frequently accompanied meat as a side dish. [[Plum]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[pear]]s, [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, and [[ficus|fig]]s, along with many kinds of [[citrus]] are the most frequently used fruit, either fresh or dried, in Turkish cuisine. For example, ''[[compote|komposto]]'' (compote) or ''[[ho\u015faf]]'' (from Persian ''khosh \u00e2b'', literally meaning \"nice water\") are among the main side dishes to meat or pilav. ''[[Dolma]]'' and pilaf usually contain currants or raisins. ''Etli yaprak sarma'' (vine leaves stuffed with meat and rice) used to be cooked with sour plums in Ottoman cuisine. Turkish desserts do not normally contain fresh fruit, but may contain dried varieties.\n\n[[Image:\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131 with b\u00f6rek.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131]] with Borek]]\nEggplant ({{lang-tr|patl\u0131can}}) has a special place in the Turkish cuisine.\n\n=== Meats ===\n\nIn some regions, meat, which was mostly eaten only at wedding ceremonies or during the ''Kurban Bayram\u0131'' (''[[Eid ul-Adha]]'') as ''etli pilav'' ([[pilaf]] with meat), has become part of the daily diet since the introduction of industrial production. [[Veal]], formerly shunned, is now widely consumed.\n\nThe main use of meat in cooking remains the combination of ground meat and [[vegetable]], with names such as ''[[k\u0131ymal\u0131]] fasulye'' (beans with ground meat) or ''k\u0131ymal\u0131 \u0131spanak'' (spinach with ground meat, which is sometimes served with [[yogurt]]).\n\nAlternatively, in coastal towns cheap fish such as ''sardalya'' (sardines) or ''hamsi'' (anchovies) are widely available, as well as many others with seasonal availability. Poultry consumption, almost exclusively of chicken and eggs, is common. Milk-fed [[Domestic sheep|lambs]], once the most popular source of meat in Turkey, comprise a small part of contemporary consumption. ''Kuzu \u00e7evirme'', cooking milk-fed lamb on a spit, once an important ceremony, is rarely seen.\n\n== Dishes and foods ==\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n[[File:Fresh ayran.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Fresh Ayran with a head of foam]]\n\n[[Yogurt]] is an important element in Turkish cuisine.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> In fact, the English word yogurt or yoghurt derives from the Turkish word ''yo\u011furt''. Yogurt can accompany almost all meat dishes (kebabs, k\u00f6fte), vegetable dishes (especially fried eggplant, courgette, spinach with minced meat etc.), ''meze'' and a specialty called ''mant\u0131'' (folded triangles of dough containing minced meat). In villages, yogurt is regularly eaten with rice or bread. A thicker, higher-fat variety, ''s\u00fczme yo\u011furt'' or \"strained yogurt\", is made by straining the yogurt curds from the [[whey]]. One of the most common Turkish drinks, ''[[ayran]]'', is made from yogurt. Also, yogurt is often used in the preparation of cakes, some soups and pastries.\n\n==== Cheeses ====\n[[File:Kaschkawal Kashkaval \u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b Balkank\u00e4se Sofia IMG 7650.JPG|thumb|''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' cheese]]\n[[File:Otlu tulum peyniri.jpg|thumb|Varieties of ''[[Tulum cheese|tulum]]'': center \"Otlu tulum peyniri\", or Tulum with herbs, in [[Ankara]]]]\n\nTurkey produces many varieties of [[cheese]], mostly from [[domestic sheep|sheep]]'s milk. In general, these cheeses are not long matured, with a comparatively low fat content. The production of many kinds of cheese is local to particular regions. There are 193 different cheeses in Turkey, but only 8 of these cheeses have geographical indication.<ref>https://www.goturkeytourism.com/things-to-do/10-awesome-turkish-cheeses-you-have-to-taste.html</ref>\n\n* ''[[Beyaz peynir]]'' is a salty [[brined cheese]] taking its name from its white color (\"white cheese\"). It is similar to ''[[feta]]'' but not as strong. This is produced in styles ranging from unmatured cheese curds to a quite strong mature version. It has many varieties due to source of milk, region ([[Ezine, \u00c7anakkale|Ezine]] or [[Turkish Thrace|Thrace]]) and production methods (classic or cultured). It is eaten plain (e.g. as part of the traditional Turkish breakfast), used in salads, and incorporated into cooked foods such as ''[[Menemen (food)|menemen]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'' and ''[[Pita|pide]]''.\n* ''[[\u00c7erkez peyniri]]'', means \"[[Circassians|Circassian]] cheese\". It has two variations, smoked or non-smoked.\n* ''[[\u00c7\u00f6kelek]]'' is dried [[cottage cheese]]. There are many regional varieties of ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek''. Some are eaten fresh while others are preserved, either by storage in goatskin bags or pottery jars, or by drying in the sun. \n* ''[[Kurut]]'' and ''ke\u015f'' are regional names for dried bricks of yogurt made from low-fat milk or from ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek'' made from buttermilk.<ref name=KCheese>{{Cite web| url=http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115070211/http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=15 January 2013| title=Turkish Cheeses| accessdate=2007-12-07| date=2 June 2005}}</ref>\n* ''[[Kars gravyer cheese|Gravyer]]'' is produced in Turkey as well. Among others, [[Kars]] is famous for this type of cheese.\n* ''[[Hellim]]'' is a salty, firm-textured goat cheese, generally with some mint added, made in [[Northern Cyprus]]. In Turkey, it is common to fry ''hellim'' in a pan in some olive oil.\n* ''[[Ka\u015far]]'' is Turkey's other ubiquitous cheese, a moderately fatty sheep's cheese similar to the Greek ''[[kasseri]]'', sometimes marketed as \"Turkish cheddar\", being closer in consistency and taste to mild [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar-style cheese]] than other Turkish cheeses. Less matured ''ka\u015far'', called fresh ''ka\u015far'', is widely consumed as well. Two varieties are popular [[Kars]] and Thrace.\n* ''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' is a wheel-shaped yellow sheep's cheese, similar to fresh ''ka\u015far''. The name comes from Romanian word ''ca\u0219caval'', which bears the Italian structure of ''caciocavallo''. \n* ''[[Lor (food)|Lor]]'' is the other type of unsalted whey cheese, similarly made from the whey left over from ''ka\u015far'' or ''strained yogurt'' manufacture. ''Lor'' is used in traditional foods and desserts made from unsalted cheese like \"ek\u015fimik\" and ''h\u00f6\u015fmerim''\n* ''[[Mihali\u00e7 Peyniri|Mihali\u00e7 peyniri]]'' or ''Kelle peyniri'' is a hard sheep's cheese that can be grated, like [[Parmesan cheese]]. Sometimes goat or cow milk is used. It is a specialty from Karacabey, a town in Bursa province which was called Mihali\u00e7 during Byzantine and Ottoman period. Mostly it is produced from non-pastorized milk and processed by salt.\n* ''[[Braided cheese|\u00d6rg\u00fc peyniri]]'', \"[[braided cheese]]\", is a specialty from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].\n* ''[[Van herbed cheese|Otlu peynir]]''[[Van herbed cheese]] (\"herbed cheese\") is produced in many areas, chiefly in East Anatolia. Traditionally sheep's or goat's milk is used, but more recently cow's milk ''otlu peynir'' has been produced. The type of herb used varies by region: in Van [[Ramsons|wild garlic]] is traditional; Bitlis ''otlu peynir'' contains a damp-loving herb known as ''sof otu''. In other areas horse mint (''[[Mentha longifolia]]'') and ''[[Pimpinella rhodentha]]'' are used.<ref name=KCheese/>\n* ''[[Tulum (cheese)|Tulum]]'' is a mostly sheep's curd molded in an animal skin bag called as tulum. There are regional varieties of ''tulum peynir'' in such areas as \u0130zmir, \u00d6demi\u015f and Erzincan.<ref name=KCheese/> And each of tulum cheese have very different characteristics.\n\n=== Soups ===\nA Turkish meal usually starts with a thin [[soup]] (''\u00e7orba''). Soups are usually named after their main ingredient, the most common types being; mercimek ([[lentil]]) \u00e7orbas\u0131, yogurt, or [[wheat]] (often mashed) called [[tarhana]] \u00e7orbas\u0131. Delicacy soups are the ones that are usually not the part of the daily diet, such as [[\u0130\u015fkembe soup]] and [[pa\u00e7a]] \u00e7orbas\u0131, although the latter also used to be consumed as a nutritious winter meal. Before the popularisation of the typical Turkish breakfast, soup was the default morning meal for some people.\nThe most common soups in Turkish cuisine are:\n[[File:Tuzlama.jpg|thumb|''Tuzlama'', a [[tripe soup]] from Turkey.]]\n[[File:Sulu k\u00f6fte.jpg|thumb|[[Sulu k\u00f6fte]]]]\n[[File:Ezogelin soup, bread, and water.jpg|thumb|[[Ezogelin soup]]]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Anal\u0131 k\u0131zl\u0131 soup]]''\n* ''[[Yayla \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' \n* ''[[Ash reshteh|Eri\u015fte a\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Bu\u011fday a\u015f\u0131]]''/''[[Ayran soup|Ayran \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' (which is served cold)\n* ''[[Chorba|Corba]]''\n* ''Domates \u00e7orbas\u0131 '' ([[tomato soup]])\n* ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn \u00e7orbas\u0131'' (wedding soup)\n* ''[[Ek\u015fi A\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Ezogelin soup|Ezogelin \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n* ''[[\u0130\u015fkembe \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' \n* ''[[Keledo\u015f]]''\n* ''Lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131'' ([[cabbage]] soup)\n* ''[[Mahluta]]''\n* ''Mercimek \u00e7orbas\u0131'' ([[lentil soup]])\n* ''[[Pa\u00e7a]]''\n* ''[[Paz\u0131]]''\n* ''[[\u015eehriye]]''\n* [[Sheep's sorrel soup]]\n* ''[[Sulu k\u00f6fte]]''\n* ''[[Sumak a\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Tarhana \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n* ''Tavuk'' ([[chicken soup]], with almond becomes \"Bademli Tavuk\")\n* [[Toyga soup]]\n* ''Trabzon [[Fish soup|Bal\u0131k]] \u00e7orbas\u0131''\n* ''[[Tutma\u00e7]]'' (lentil dish with noodles)\n* ''[[Y\u00fcks\u00fck \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Bread ===\n* [[Bazlama]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* ''M\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi'' ([[corn bread]])\n* [[Lavash|Lava\u015f]]\n* [[Poga\u010da|Po\u011fa\u00e7a]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]] (a broad, round and flat bread made of wheat flour)\n* [[Simit]] (known as \"''gevrek''\" in Izmir, another type of ring-shaped bread covered with sesame seeds.

[[Su b\u00f6re\u011fi]], made with boiled [[yufka]]/[[phyllo]] layers, cheese and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. [[Cheburek|\u00c7i\u011f b\u00f6rek]] (also known as ''Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi'') is fried and stuffed with minced meat. [[Kol b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is another well-known type of b\u00f6rek that takes its name from its shape, as do [[fincan]] (coffee cup), [[muska (pastry)|muska]] (talisman), [[G\u00fcl b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (rose) or [[Sigara b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (cigarette).

[[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is a sweet type of b\u00f6rek, widespread in the [[Black Sea region]].\n\n[[Po\u011fa\u00e7a]] is the label name for dough based salty pastries. Likewise [[\u00e7\u00f6rek]] is another label name used for both sweet and salty pastries.\n\n[[G\u00f6zleme]] is a food typical in rural areas, made of [[lavash]] bread or phyllo dough folded around a variety of fillings such as spinach, cheese and parsley, minced meat or potatoes and cooked on a large griddle (traditionally [[sa\u010d]]).\n\n[[Katmer]] is another traditional rolled out dough. It can be salty or sweet according to the filling. Katmer with [[pistachio]] and [[kaymak]] is a sweet food and one of the most popular breakfast items in [[Gaziantep]].\n\n[[Lahmacun]] (meaning dough with meat in Arabic) is a thin flatbread covered with a layer of spiced minced meat, tomato, pepper, onion or garlic.\n\n[[Pita|Pide]], which can be made with minced meat (together with onion, chopped tomatoes, parsley and spices), [[kasseri|kashar]] cheese, spinach, white cheese, pieces of meat, braised meat ([[kavurma]]), sucuk, past\u0131rma or/and eggs put on rolled-out dough, is one of the most common traditional stone-baked Turkish specialities.\n\n[[A\u00e7ma]] is a soft bread found in most parts of Turkey.

The combination of meat-filled dough with yogurt differentiates it from other dumplings such as tortellini, ravioli, and Chinese wonton. Mant\u0131 is usually eaten as a main dish.

A large variety of vegetables are used, such as [[spinach]], [[leek]], [[cauliflower]], [[artichoke]], [[cabbage]], [[celery]], [[eggplant]], green and red [[bell pepper]]s, [[Green bean|string bean]] and [[jerusalem artichoke]]. A typical vegetable dish is prepared with a base of chopped onions, carrots saut\u00e9ed first in olive oil and later with tomatoes or [[tomato paste]]. The vegetables and hot water will then be added. Quite frequently a spoon of rice and lemon juice is also added. Vegetable dishes usually tend to be served with its own water (the cooking water) thus often called in colloquial Turkish ''sulu yemek'' (literally \"a dish with juice\"). Minced meat can also be added to a vegetable dish but vegetable dishes that are cooked with olive oil ''([[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131lar]])'' are often served cold and do not contain meat. Spinach, leek, string bean and artichoke with olive oil are among the most widespread dishes in Turkey.\n\n[[Dolma]] is the name used for stuffed vegetables. Like the vegetables cooked with olive oil as described above dolma with olive oil does not contain meat. Many vegetables are stuffed, most typically green peppers (''biber dolmas\u0131''), eggplants, tomatoes, or [[zucchini]]/courgettes (''kabak dolmas\u0131''), vine leaves (''yaprak dolmas\u0131''). If vine leaves are used, they are first pickled in brine. However, dolma is not limited to these common types; many other vegetables and fruits are stuffed with a meat or rice mixture. For example, artichoke dolma (''[[enginar dolmas\u0131]]'') is an Aegean region specialty. Fillings used in dolma may consist of parts of the vegetable carved out for preparation, rice with spices or minced meat.\n\n[[Mercimek k\u00f6fte]], although being named k\u00f6fte, does not contain any meat. Instead, red lentil is used as the major ingredient together with spring onion, tomato paste etc.\n\n[[Imam bayildi]] is a version of [[karn\u0131yar\u0131k]] with no minced meat inside. It can be served as a meze as well.\n\nFried eggplant and pepper is a common summer dish in Turkey. It is served with yogurt or tomato sauce and garlic.\n\n[[M\u00fccver]] is prepared with grated squash/courgette or potatoes, egg, onion, dill or cheese and flour. It can be either fried or cooked in the oven.\n\n[[Pilaf]] can be served either as a side dish or main dish but ''bulgur pilav\u0131'' (pilav made of boiled and pounded wheat - ''bulgur'') is also widely eaten. The dishes made with ''kuru fasulye'' ([[Common bean#White beans|white beans]]), ''nohut'' ([[chickpea]]s), ''mercimek'' ([[lentil]]s), ''b\u00f6r\u00fclce'' ([[black-eyed pea]]s), etc., combined with onion, vegetables, minced meat, tomato paste and rice, have always been common due to being economical and nutritious.\n\n[[Tur\u015fu]] is pickle made with brine, usually with the addition of garlic. It is often enjoyed as an appetizer. It is made with a large variety of vegetables, from cucumber to courgette. In the towns on the Aegean coast, the water of [[tur\u015fu]] is consumed as a drink. It comes from the Persian \"Torshi\", which refers to pickled \"Torsh\" (sour) vegetables.\n\n=== Egg dishes ===\n[[File:MenemenIstanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] (left) as part of a Turkish breakfast]]\n* [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] consists of scrambled eggs cooked in tomato, green pepper, and can be onion and garlic.\n* [[\u00c7\u0131lb\u0131r]] is another traditional Turkish food made with poached eggs, yogurt and oil.\n* ''Ispanakl\u0131 yumurta'' consists of eggs with spinach and onion.\n* Kaygana can be described as something of a cross between the pancake and the omelet in Ottoman cuisine. It used to be served with cheese, honey, crushed nuts, or eggplant. However, it is almost forgotten in the big cities of Turkey.\n\n=== Meze and salads ===\n[[File:Turkish Meze Plate.jpg|thumb|200px|A plate of Turkish meze]]\n[[Image:Cacik.jpg|thumb|200px|A bowl of [[Cac\u0131k]], the original form of seasoned, diluted [[yogurt]] with chopped cucumber, eaten throughout the former Ottoman world, under different names, like the [[tarator]] and [[tzatziki]] of the [[Balkans]].]]\n[[Image:Piyaz 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of piyaz]]\n[[Image:Kisir.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of [[k\u0131s\u0131r]] decorated with green [[olive]] and [[cucumber]] pieces]]\n[[Image:Bira ve \u00e7oban salata.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[\u00c7oban salatas\u0131]]]]\n\n[[Meze]] is a selection of food served as the appetizer course with or without drinks.

Dolma and sarma has a special place in Turkish cuisine. It can be eaten either as a meze or a main dish. It can be cooked either as a vegetable dish or meat dish. If a meat mixture is put in, it is usually served hot with yogurt and spices such as oregano and red pepper powder with oil. If the mixture is only vegan recipe it should only have olive oil rice or bulgur and some nuts and raisins inside especially blackcurrant.\n\n[[Zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 yaprak sarmas\u0131]] (stuffed leaves with olive oil) is the sarma made with vine leaves stuffed with a rice-spice mixture and cooked with olive oil. This type of dolma does not contain meat, is served cold and also referred to as ''[[sarma (food)|sarma]]'', which means \"wrapping\" in Turkish. [[Dried fruit]] such as blackcurant; raisins, figs or cherries and cinnamon and allspice used to be added into the mixture to sweeten ''zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 dolma'' in Ottoman cuisine. [[Vine leaves]] (''yaprak'') could be filled not only with rice and spices but also with meat and rice, ''[[etli yaprak sarma]]'', in which case it was often served hot with yogurt. The word ''sarma'' is also used for some types of desserts, such as [[f\u0131st\u0131k sarma]] (wrapped pistachio).\n\n[[Melon]] dolma along with [[quince]] or [[apple]] dolma was one of the palace's specialties (raw melon stuffed with minced meat, onion, rice, almonds, cooked in an oven). In contemporary Turkey, a wide variety of dolma is prepared. Although it is not possible to give an exhaustive list of dolma recipes, [[courgette]] (\"kabak\"), [[aubergine]] (\"patl\u0131can\"), [[tomato]] (\"domates\"), [[pumpkin]] (\"balkaba\u011f\u0131\"), [[Capsicum|pepper]] (\"biber\"), [[cabbage]] (\"lahana\") (black or white cabbage), [[chard]] (\"paz\u0131\") and [[mussel]] (\"midye\") dolma constitute the most common types. Instead of dried cherries in the palace cuisine, currants are usually added to the filling of dolma cooked in olive oil. A different type of dolma is [[mumbar]] dolmas\u0131, for which the membrane of intestines of sheep is filled up with a spicy rice-nut mixture.\n\n=== Meat dishes ===\n[[Image:Karn\u0131yar\u0131k.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Karn\u0131yar\u0131k]]]]\n[[Image:Kokore\u00e7.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Kokore\u00e7]] cooking on a spit]]\n[[Image:Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in Espoo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A plate of Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in [[Tapiola]], [[Espoo]], Finland.]]\n* Consisted of chicken or lean veal, D\u00f6ner kebap is a common Turkish fast food.\n* Tantuni (similar to ''d\u00fcr\u00fcm'', meat cut in very small pieces, served with lavash, a specialty from the [[Mersin]] province of Turkey)\n* Kuzu g\u00fcve\u00e7 (lamb cooked in earthenware casserole)\n* Past\u0131rmal\u0131 [[kuru fasulye]] (white kidney bean stew with [[past\u0131rma]])\n* [[Kuzu kapama]] (spring lamb stewed)\n* Ha\u015flama (boiled lamb with vegetables and lemon juice)\n* [[Kavurma]] which means frying, roasting or parching in Turkish, is generally used for roasted lamb or a variety of fried meat dishes. \u00c7oban kavurma is a variety of it, prepared with diced lamb with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers and herbs.

[[Kad\u0131nbudu k\u00f6fte]] is another traditional speciality; minced meat is mixed with cooked rice and fried. [[I\u00e7li k\u00f6fte]] can be described as a shell of \"bulgur\" filled with onion, minced meat and nuts.

Fish are grilled, fried or cooked slowly by the ''bu\u011fulama'' (poaching) method. ''Bu\u011fulama'' is fish with lemon and parsley, covered while cooking so that it will be cooked with steam. The term ''pil\u00e2ki'' is also used for fish cooked with various vegetables, including onion in the oven. In the Black Sea region, fish are usually fried with thick corn flour. Fish are also eaten cold; as smoked (isleme) or dried (\u00e7iroz), canned, salted or pickled (l\u00e2kerda). Fish is also cooked in salt or in dough in Turkey. Paz\u0131da Levrek is a seafood speciality which consists of [[European seabass|sea bass]] cooked in [[chard]] leaves. In fish restaurants, it is possible to find other fancy fish varieties like ''bal\u0131k dolma'' (stuffed fish), ''bal\u0131k iskender'' (inspired by [[\u0130skender kebap]]), fishballs or fish en papillote. [[Fish soup]] prepared with vegetables, onion and flour is common in coastal towns and cities. In [[Istanbul]]'s [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] and other coastal districts, grilled fish served in bread with tomatoes, herbs and onion is a popular fast food. In the inner parts of Turkey, [[trout]] ''alabal\u0131k''  is common as it is the main type of freshwater fish. Popular seafood mezes at coastlines include stuffed mussels, fried [[mussel]] and fried ''kalamar'' ([[Squid (food)|squid]]) with [[tarator]] sauce.\n\nPopular sea fish in Turkey include:<ref>English names for fish from [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Penguin, 1972. {{ISBN|0-14-046174-4}}</ref> \n[[Image:Trachurus trachurus fish 7218 Nevit.JPG|thumb|Istavrit on display at a fish market]]\n* [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]] ''hamsi''\n* [[Sardine (food)|sardine]] ''sardalya''\n* [[bonito]] ''palamut''\n* [[gilt-head bream]] ''\u00e7upra'' or ''\u00e7ipura''\n* [[red mullet]] ''barbun(ya)''\n* [[sea bass]] ''levrek''\n* [[Merlangius merlangus|whiting]] or ''bakalyaro''\n* [[haddock]] ''mezgit''\n* [[swordfish]] ''k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 bal\u0131g\u0131''\n* [[turbot]] ''kalkan''\n* [[Pagellus bellottii|red pandora]] ''mercan'' \n* [[Trachurus|Jack mackerel]] 'istavrit'\n* [[Epinephelus|white grouper]] ''lagos''\n* [[bluefish]] ''l\u00fcfer''\n\n=== Desserts ===\n{{see also|List of Turkish desserts}}\n[[File:Baklava - Turkish special, 80-ply.JPEG|thumb|right|230px|[[Baklava]] is prepared on large trays and cut into a variety of shapes.]]\n[[Image:Firinda s\u00fctla\u00e7.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''S\u00fctla\u00e7'', or Turkish [[rice pudding]].]]\n[[File:T Honey.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Turkish delight]].]]\n[[File:Kazandibi.JPG|thumb|right|230px|\n[[Kazandibi]], means the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface.]]\n[[File:Wasserweltfest 2012 - T\u00fcrkische Mehlspeise.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[\u015eekerpare]].]]\nOne of the world-renowned desserts of Turkish cuisine is [[baklava]]. Baklava is made either with pistachios or walnuts. Turkish cuisine has a range of baklava-like desserts which include [[\u015f\u00f6biyet]], [[b\u00fclb\u00fcl yuvas\u0131]], [[saray sarmas\u0131]], [[S\u00fctl\u00fc Nuriye|s\u00fctl\u00fc nuriye]], and [[sar\u0131 burma]].\n\n[[Kadaif]] ('Kaday\u0131f') is a common Turkish dessert that employs shredded yufka. There are different types of [[kadaif]]: tel (wire) or [[Burma (dessert)|Burma]] (wring) kaday\u0131f, both of which can be prepared with either walnuts or pistachios.\n\nAlthough carrying the label \"kaday\u0131f\", [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] is totally different from \"tel kaday\u0131f\". [[K\u00fcnefe]] and [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] are rich in syrup and butter, and are usually served with [[kaymak]] (clotted/scrambled butter). K\u00fcnefe contains wire kaday\u0131f with a layer of melted cheese in between and it is served hot with pistachios or walnuts.\n\nAmong milk-based desserts, the most popular ones are [[muhallebi]], [[su muhallebisi]], [[s\u00fctla\u00e7]] (rice pudding), [[ke\u015fk\u00fcl]], [[kazandibi]] (meaning the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface), and [[tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc]] (a sweet, gelatinous, milk pudding dessert quite similar to kazandibi, to which very thinly peeled chicken breast is added to give a chewy texture). A speciality from the Mediterranean region is [[haytal\u0131]], which consists of pieces of starch pudding and ice cream (or crushed ice) put in rose water sweetened with syrup.\n\n[[Halva|Helva]] (halva): [[un helvas\u0131]] (flour helva is usually cooked after someone has died), [[irmik helvas\u0131]] (cooked with semolina and pine nuts), [[yaz helvas\u0131]] (made from walnut or almond<ref>Nevin Hal\u0131c\u0131 - Sufi cuisine</ref>), [[tahin helvas\u0131]] (crushed sesame seeds), [[kos helva]], [[pi\u015fmaniye]] (floss halva).\n\nOther popular desserts include; [[Revani]] (with semolina and starch), [[\u015fekerpare]], [[kalburabasma]], [[dilber duda\u011f\u0131]], [[vezir parma\u011f\u0131]], [[han\u0131m g\u00f6be\u011fi]], [[Kemal Pasha dessert|kemalpa\u015fa]], [[tulumba]], [[zerde]], [[h\u00f6\u015fmerim]], [[paluze]], [[irmik tatl\u0131s\u0131/peltesi]], [[lokma]].\n\n[[G\u00fclla\u00e7]] is a dessert typically served at Ramadan, which consists of very thin, large dough layers put in milk and rose water, served with pomegranate seeds and walnuts. A story is told that in the kitchens of the Palace, those extra thin dough layers were prepared with \"prayers\", as it was believed that if one did not pray while opening phyllo dough, it would never be possible to obtain such thin layers.\n\n[[Ashure|A\u015fure]] can be described as a sweet soup containing boiled beans, wheat and dried fruits. Sometimes cinnamon and rose water is added when being served. According to legend, it was first cooked on [[Noah's Ark]] and contained seven different ingredients in one dish. All the Anatolian peoples have cooked and are still cooking a\u015fure especially during the month of Muharrem.\n\nSome traditional Turkish desserts are fruit-based: ''ayva tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[quince]]), ''incir tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[Common fig|fig]]), ''kabak tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pumpkin]]), ''elma tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[apple]]) and ''armut tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pear]]). Fruits are cooked in a pot or in an oven with sugar, carnations and cinnamon (without adding water). After being chilled, they are served with walnuts or pistachios and [[kaymak]].\n\nHomemade cookies/biscuits are commonly called [[kurabiye]] in Turkish. The most common types are [[ac\u0131badem kurabiyesi]] (prepared only with eggs, sugar and almonds), [[un kurabiyesi]] (flour kurabiye) and cevizli kurabiye (kurabiye with walnuts). Another dough based dessert is [[ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi]].\n\n[[Tahin-pekmez]] is a traditional combination especially in rural areas. Tahin is [[tahini|sesame paste]] and pekmez is grape syrup. These are sold separately and mixed before consumption.\n\n[[Lokum]] ([[Turkish delight]]), which was eaten for digestion after meals and called \"rahat hulkum\" in the Ottoman era, is another well-known sweet/candy with a range of varieties.\n\n[[Cezerye]], [[cevizli (walnut) sucuk]] (named after its sucuk/sujuk like shape, also known as [[Churchkhela]] in Circassian region) and [[pestil]] (fruit pestils) are among other common sweets.\n\n[[Marzipan]] ''badem ezmesi'' or ''f\u0131st\u0131k ezmesi'' (made of ground pistachios) is another common confection in Turkey.\n\nAnother jelly like Turkish sweet is [[macun]]. [[Mesir macunu]] of [[Manisa]]/[[\u0130zmir]] (which was also called \"nevruziye\" as this macun was distributed on the first day of spring in the Ottoman Palace) contains 41 different spices. It is still believed that \"mesir macunu\" is good for health and has healing effects. As with lokum, [[nane macunu]] (prepared with mint) used to be eaten as a digestive after heavy meals. Herbs and flowers having curative effects were grown in the gardens of Topkap\u0131 under the control of the chief doctor \"hekimba\u015f\u0131\" and pharmacists of the Palace who used those herbs for preparing special types of [[macun]] and [[Sharbat|sherbet]].<ref>Marianna Yerasimos, Ottoman cuisine</ref>\n\nThere are also several types of ice creams based on [[salep]] powder or [[Cornstarch]] with [[Rose water]] such as [[Dondurma]] (Turkish gum ice cream), dried fruit ice cream, ice cream rose petals.\n\nDried fruit, used in dolma, pilav, meat dishes and other desserts is also eaten with almonds or walnuts as a dessert. Figs, grapes, apricots are the most widespread dried fruits.\n\n''Kaymak'' (clotted cream-butter) is often served with desserts to cut through their sweetness.\n\n[[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee]], with or without sugar, is usually served after dinner or more rarely together with desserts.\n\n=== Street food ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Mara\u015f dondurmas\u0131 in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Dondurma]]\n[[File:Macun in Turkey.jpg|thumb|Macun]]\n* [[Dondurma]]\n* fried mussels, stuffed mussels ''midye''\n* fresh walnuts ''taze ceviz''\n* g\u00f6zleme a very thin stuffed flat bred similar to [[paratha]], fillings can include any combination of spiced potato, feta, spinach and ground meat \n* kokore\u00e7\n* kumpir a baked potato served with ''ka\u015far'' cheese and many other toppings\n* [[lokma]]\n* roasted corn ''k\u00f6zde m\u0131s\u0131r''\n* roasted chesnuts ''kestane''\n* simit\n* [[Macun]]\n\n== Beverages ==\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n{{See also|Turkish wine|Alcohol laws of Turkey}}\n[[File:Turkish wine regions map.png|thumb|300px|Wine-producing regions in Turkey.]]\nAlthough the majority of Turks profess the Islamic religion, [[alcoholic beverage]]s are as widely available as anywhere. However, some Turks abstain from drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]]. [[Rak\u0131]] (pronounced [\u027ea\u02c8k\u026f]) is the most popular alcoholic drink in Turkey. It is considered as the national alcoholic beverage of Turkey. There are a few local brands of [[lager]] such as Bomonti, Marmara34 and [[Efes Beverage Group|Efes Pilsen]] and a small selection of international beers that are produced in Turkey such as Skol, [[Beck's]], [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]], [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]], [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg Brewery|Tuborg]].\n\nThere are a variety of local [[wine]]s produced by Turkish brands such as [[Sevilen group|Sevilen]], [[Kavakl\u0131dere (wine)|Kavakl\u0131dere]], Doluca, Corvus, Kayra, Pamukkale and Diren which are getting more popular with the change of climatic conditions that affect the production of wine. A range of grape varieties are grown in Turkey. For the production of red wine, the following types of grapes are mainly used; in the Marmara Region, [[Pinot noir]], [[Adakaras\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Semillion]], [[Kuntra]], [[Gamay]], [[Cinsault]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Carignane]], [[\u00c7alkaras\u0131]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Alicante Bouschet]]; in the Black Sea Region and the eastern part of the country, [[\u00d6k\u00fczg\u00f6z\u00fc]], [[Bo\u011fazkere]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Kalecik Karas\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]; in the Mediterranean Region, [[Sergi Karas\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]. As for white wine, the grapes can be listed as follows; in the Marmara Region, [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling]], [[Semillion]], [[Beylerce]], [[Yap\u0131ncak]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] and [[semillion]]; in the Black Sea Region, [[Narince (grape)|Narince]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Emir (grape)|Emir]], [[Hasandede]] (for further info http://www.hayyam.com/uzumler/index.php{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}). In addition to mass production, it is quite popular to produce wines in private farms and sell them in the locality. Visitors can find different \"home made\" wines in Central Anatolia (Kapadokya/[[Cappadocia]] region - [[Nev\u015fehir]]), the Aegean coast ([[Sel\u00e7uk]] and [[Bozcaada]] (an island in the Aegean Sea)).\n\n=== Non-alcoholic beverages ===\n[[Image:Rize tea.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Turkish tea]]]]\n[[File:Turkishcoffee.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Turkish coffee]]]]\nAt breakfast and all day long Turkish people drink [[black tea]] (''\u00e7ay''). Tea is made with two teapots in Turkey. Strong bitter tea made in the upper pot is diluted by adding boiling water from the lower. [[Turkish coffee]] (''kahve'') is usually served after meals or with dessert.\n\n[[Ayran]] (yogurt drink) is the most common cold beverage, which may accompany almost all dishes in Turkey, except those with fish and other seafood. It's a mix of yogurt and water, similar to [[lassi]]. It may be served with salt, according to taste.\n\n[[\u015ealgam suyu]] (mild or spicy fermented red carrot juice) is another important non-alcoholic beverage that is usually combined with kebabs or served together with [[rak\u0131]].\n\n[[Boza]] is a traditional winter drink, which is also known as millet wine (served cold with cinnamon and sometimes with [[leblebi]]).\n\n[[Sahlep]] is another favorite in winter (served hot with cinnamon). Sahlep is extracted from the roots of wild orchids and may be used in Turkish ice cream as well. This was a popular drink in western Europe before coffee was brought from Africa and came to be widely known.\n\n''Limonata'' (lemonade) is very popular. It is traditionally served with baklava and other sweets. Sometimes lemonade is served with strawberry flavoring. This is called ''\u00e7\u0131lekl\u0131 l\u0131monata''.\n\n[[Sherbet (Middle Eastern drink)|Sherbet]] (Turkish ''\u015ferbet,'' pronounced {{IPA-tr|\u0283e\u027e\u02c8bet|}}) is a syrup which can be made from any of a wide variety of ingredients, especially fruits, flowers, or herbs. Examples include pears, quinces, strawberries, apples, [[cornelian cherry]], pomegranates, oranges, rose petals, rose hips, or licorice and spices.  Sherbet is drunk diluted with cold water.\n\nIn classical Turkish cuisine, [[ho\u015faf]] (from the Persian \"Khosh-ab\", meaning \"fresh water\") alternatively accompanies meat dishes and ''pilav'' ([[pilaf]]).\n\n=== Related cuisines ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Greek cuisine]]\n* [[Albanian cuisine]]\n* [[Balkan cuisine]]\n* [[Central Asian cuisine]]\n* [[Levantine cuisine]]\n* [[Middle Eastern cuisine]]\n* [[Mongolian cuisine]]\n* [[Ottoman cuisine]]\n* [[Caucasian cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Food|Turkey}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Baklava]]\n* [[Doner kebap]]\n* [[\u0130skender kebap]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* [[Kadaif]]\n* [[Kumpir]]\n* [[Mangal (barbecue)|Mangal]]\n* [[Manti (dumpling)|Mant\u0131]]\n* [[Meze]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]]\n* [[Turkish coffee]]\n* [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|Turkish rak\u0131]]\n* [[Turkish tea]]\n* [[List of stuffed dishes#Turkish stuffed dishes|Turkish stuffed dishes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Budak, S\u00fcheyl, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184656/http://www.nadirkitap.com/antakya-mutfagi-suheyl-budak-kitap3618320.html ''Antakya Mutfa\u011f\u0131''], Hatay 2008, {{oclc|705454123}} (1996 edition)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927145106/http://blog.kitchenguerilla.com/2011/03/antakya-cuisine-with-suheyl-budak-and-75-ladies/?lang=en Antakya-cuisine with S\u00fcheyl Budak and 75 ladies]\n* G\u00fcrsoy, Deniz, ''Turkish Cuisine in Historical Perspective'', Istanbul, 2006, {{ISBN|975-329-564-2}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Konya Yemek K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc ve Konya Yemekleri'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-6021-16-0}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Sufi Cuisine'', Saqi 2005.\n* Lambraki, Mirsini & Ak\u0131n, Engin, ''Ayn\u0131 Sofrada \u0130ki \u00dclke, T\u00fcrk ve Yunan Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-458-484-2}}.\n* [[Claudia Roden|Roden, Claudia]], ''A New Book of Middle Eastern Food'', 2000, {{ISBN|0-14-046588-X}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Halk Mutfa\u011f\u0131m\u0131z Geleneksel Tatlar\u0131m\u0131zdan Se\u00e7meler'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-98180-2-7}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Turkish Cuisine'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-285-114-2}}\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & S\u00fct, Uyuyunca, ''T\u00fcrkiye Peynirleri'', Istanbul, {{ISBN|975-363-755-1}}.\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & Silivrim, Kaymak, ''T\u00fcrkiye'nin Yo\u011furtlar\u0131'', Istanbul 2007, {{ISBN|978-975-08-1276-7}}.\n* Yerasimos, Marianna, ''Osmanl\u0131 Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2002;

The cooking of [[Istanbul]], [[Bursa]], [[Izmir]], and rest of the [[Asia Minor]] region inherits many elements of [[Ottoman court]] [[cuisine]], with a lighter use of spices, a preference for rice over [[bulgur]], [[kofte]]s and a wider availability of vegetable stews (''t\u00fcrl\u00fc''), [[eggplant]], stuffed [[dolma]]s and fish. The cuisine of the [[Black Sea Region]] uses fish extensively, especially the [[European anchovy|Black Sea anchovy]] (''hamsi'') and includes [[maize]] dishes. The cuisine of the southeast (e.g. [[Urfa]], [[Gaziantep]], and [[Adana]]) is famous for its variety of [[kebab]]s, ''[[meze]]s'' and dough-based desserts such as ''[[baklava]]'', ''[[\u015f\u00f6biyet]]'', ''[[Kanafeh|kaday\u0131f]]'', and ''[[k\u00fcnefe]]''.\n\nEspecially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees grow abundantly, [[olive oil]] is the major type of oil used for cooking.<ref name=\"multiple\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |title=Ethnic Cuisine - Turkey by Terrie Wright Chrones |access-date=2007-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429005226/http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |archive-date=2007-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The cuisines of the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]] and [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] regions are rich in vegetables, herbs, and fish. [[Central Anatolia]] has many famous specialties, such as ''[[ke\u015fkek]]'', ''[[mant\u0131]]'' (especially from [[Kayseri]]) and ''[[g\u00f6zleme]]''. Food names directly cognate with ''mant\u0131'' are found also in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] (''[[mantou]]'' or steamed bun) and [[Korean cuisine]] (''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]'').\n\nA specialty's name sometimes includes that of a city or region, either in or outside of Turkey, and may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between ''Urfa kebap'' and ''[[Adana kebap]]'' is the thickness of the skewer and the amount of hot pepper that the kebab contains. ''Urfa kebap'' is less spicy and thicker than ''Adana kebap''. Although meat-based foods such as kebabs are the mainstay in Turkish cuisine as presented in foreign countries, native Turkish meals largely center around [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, and [[bread]].\n\n== Culinary customs ==\n\n=== Breakfast ===\n[[File:Simit-2x.JPG|thumb|right|[[Simit]], a circular bread with sesame seeds, is a common breakfast item in Turkey.]]\n\nTurks usually prefer a rich breakfast. A typical Turkish [[breakfast]] consists of cheese (''[[beyaz peynir]]'', ''[[ka\u015far]]'' etc.), butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, and [[kaymak]], [[Sujuk|sucuk]] (a spicy Turkish sausage, can be eaten with eggs), ''[[past\u0131rma]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'', ''[[simit]]'', ''[[po\u011fa\u00e7a]]'' and soups are eaten as a morning meal in Turkey. A specialty for breakfast is called [[Menemen (food)|menemen]], which is prepared with tomatoes, green peppers, onion,  olive oil and eggs. Invariably, [[Turkish tea]] is served at breakfast. The Turkish word for breakfast, ''kahvalt\u0131'', means \"before coffee\" (''kahve'', 'coffee'; ''alt\u0131'', 'under').\n\n=== Homemade food ===\nHomemade food is still preferred by Turkish people. Although the newly introduced way of life pushes the new generation to eat out; Turkish people generally prefer to eat at home. A typical meal starts with soup (especially in wintertime), followed by a dish made of vegetables or legumes boiled in a pot (typically with meat or [[Mincing|minced]] meat), often with or before rice or [[bulgur]] [[pilav]] accompanied by a salad or [[cac\u0131k]] (diluted cold yogurt dish with garlic, salt, and cucumber slices). In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (''[[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131]] yemekler'') instead of the soup, either before or after the main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or fish plate.\n\n=== Restaurants ===\n[[File:Akcaabatkofte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ak\u00e7aabat meatballs]].]]\nAlthough fast food is gaining popularity and many major foreign fast food chains have opened all over Turkey, Turkish people still rely primarily on the rich and extensive dishes of Turkish cuisine. In addition, some traditional Turkish foods, especially ''[[Kofta|k\u00f6fte]]'', ''[[Doner kebab|d\u00f6ner]]'', ''[[kokore\u00e7]]'', ''[[kumpir]]'' ''midye tava'' ''b\u00f6rek'' and ''g\u00f6zleme'', are often served as fast food in Turkey. Eating out has always been common in large commercial cities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whiting | first=Dominic |year=2000 |title=Turkey Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Cz4zG73sHgC&pg=PA56&dq=lokanta |publisher=Footprint Handbooks |page=56 |isbn=978-1-900949-85-9 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> ''Esnaf lokantas\u0131'' (meaning restaurants for shopkeepers and tradesmen) are widespread, serving traditional Turkish home cooking at affordable prices.\n\n=== Summer cuisine ===\nIn the hot Turkish summer, a meal often consists of fried vegetables such as eggplant (aubergine) and peppers or potatoes served with yogurt or tomato sauce. [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] and [[\u00e7\u0131lb\u0131r]] are typical summer dishes, based on eggs. Sheep cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and melons also make a light summer meal. Those who like helva for dessert prefer ''summer helva'', which is lighter and less sweet than the regular one.\n\n=== Key ingredients ===\nFrequently used ingredients in Turkish specialties include: lamb, beef, rice, fish, [[eggplant]]s, [[bell pepper|green peppers]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[lentil]]s, [[bean]]s, [[zucchini]]s and [[tomato]]es. Nuts, especially [[pistachio]]s, [[chestnut]]s, [[almond]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, and [[walnut]]s, together with spices, have a special place in Turkish cuisine, and are used extensively in desserts or eaten separately. [[Semolina]] flour is used to make a cake called [[Basbousa|''revani'']] and [[Halva|''irmik helvasi'']].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|+Commonly used spices and flavorings:\n!Name\n!Turkish\n!Used in\n!References\n|-\n|[[Allspice]]\n|''Yenibahar'' or ''Dolma bahar''\n|[[Dolma]], vegetables, rice, fish\n|<ref name=akin>{{Cite book| publisher = Abrams| isbn = 978-1-61312-871-8| last = Akin| first = Engin| title = Essential Turkish Cuisine| date = 2015-10-06}}</ref><ref name=basan>{{Cite book| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-15617-6| last = Basan| first = Ghillie| title = Classic Turkish Cooking| date = 1997-04-15}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Anise]]\n|''Anason''\n|[[Peksimet]], [[rak\u0131]], used to season nut and dried fruit mixtures in both sweet and savory dishes\n|<ref name=akin /><ref name=basan />\n|-\n|[[Black pepper]]\n|''Kara biber''\n|egg dishes, meat dishes, [[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]]\n|<ref name=akin />\n|-\n|[[Cardamom]]\n|''Kakule''\n|Rarely used, mostly in coffee.

[[Beyaz peynir]] and [[yogurt]] are part of many dishes including [[b\u00f6rek]], [[manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[kebab]] and [[Tzatziki|cacik]].\n\n=== Oils and fats ===\n[[Butter]] or [[margarine]], [[olive oil]], [[sunflower oil]], [[canola oil]], and [[corn oil]] are widely used for cooking. [[Sesame]], [[hazelnut]], [[peanut]] and [[walnut]] oils are used as well. ''Kuyruk ya\u011f\u0131'' ([[tail fat]] of [[sheep]]) is sometimes used in kebabs and meat dishes.\n\n=== Fruit ===\nThe rich and diverse flora of Turkey means that fruit is varied, abundant and cheap. In Ottoman cuisine, fruit frequently accompanied meat as a side dish. [[Plum]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[pear]]s, [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, and [[ficus|fig]]s, along with many kinds of [[citrus]] are the most frequently used fruit, either fresh or dried, in Turkish cuisine. For example, ''[[compote|komposto]]'' (compote) or ''[[ho\u015faf]]'' (from Persian ''khosh \u00e2b'', literally meaning \"nice water\") are among the main side dishes to meat or pilav. ''[[Dolma]]'' and pilaf usually contain currants or raisins. ''Etli yaprak sarma'' (vine leaves stuffed with meat and rice) used to be cooked with sour plums in Ottoman cuisine. Turkish desserts do not normally contain fresh fruit, but may contain dried varieties.\n\n[[Image:\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131 with b\u00f6rek.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131]] with Borek]]\nEggplant ({{lang-tr|patl\u0131can}}) has a special place in the Turkish cuisine.\n\n=== Meats ===\n\nIn some regions, meat, which was mostly eaten only at wedding ceremonies or during the ''Kurban Bayram\u0131'' (''[[Eid ul-Adha]]'') as ''etli pilav'' ([[pilaf]] with meat), has become part of the daily diet since the introduction of industrial production. [[Veal]], formerly shunned, is now widely consumed.\n\nThe main use of meat in cooking remains the combination of ground meat and [[vegetable]], with names such as ''[[k\u0131ymal\u0131]] fasulye'' (beans with ground meat) or ''k\u0131ymal\u0131 \u0131spanak'' (spinach with ground meat, which is sometimes served with [[yogurt]]).\n\nAlternatively, in coastal towns cheap fish such as ''sardalya'' (sardines) or ''hamsi'' (anchovies) are widely available, as well as many others with seasonal availability. Poultry consumption, almost exclusively of chicken and eggs, is common. Milk-fed [[Domestic sheep|lambs]], once the most popular source of meat in Turkey, comprise a small part of contemporary consumption. ''Kuzu \u00e7evirme'', cooking milk-fed lamb on a spit, once an important ceremony, is rarely seen.\n\n== Dishes and foods ==\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n[[File:Fresh ayran.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Fresh Ayran with a head of foam]]\n\n[[Yogurt]] is an important element in Turkish cuisine.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> In fact, the English word yogurt or yoghurt derives from the Turkish word ''yo\u011furt''. Yogurt can accompany almost all meat dishes (kebabs, k\u00f6fte), vegetable dishes (especially fried eggplant, courgette, spinach with minced meat etc.), ''meze'' and a specialty called ''mant\u0131'' (folded triangles of dough containing minced meat). In villages, yogurt is regularly eaten with rice or bread. A thicker, higher-fat variety, ''s\u00fczme yo\u011furt'' or \"strained yogurt\", is made by straining the yogurt curds from the [[whey]]. One of the most common Turkish drinks, ''[[ayran]]'', is made from yogurt. Also, yogurt is often used in the preparation of cakes, some soups and pastries.\n\n==== Cheeses ====\n[[File:Kaschkawal Kashkaval \u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b Balkank\u00e4se Sofia IMG 7650.JPG|thumb|''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' cheese]]\n[[File:Otlu tulum peyniri.jpg|thumb|Varieties of ''[[Tulum cheese|tulum]]'': center \"Otlu tulum peyniri\", or Tulum with herbs, in [[Ankara]]]]\n\nTurkey produces many varieties of [[cheese]], mostly from [[domestic sheep|sheep]]'s milk. In general, these cheeses are not long matured, with a comparatively low fat content. The production of many kinds of cheese is local to particular regions. By the tent\n\n* ''[[Beyaz peynir]]'' is a salty [[brined cheese]] taking its name from its white color (\"white cheese\"). It is similar to ''[[feta]]'' but not as strong. This is produced in styles ranging from unmatured cheese curds to a quite strong mature version. It has many varieties due to source of milk, region ([[Ezine, \u00c7anakkale|Ezine]] or [[Turkish Thrace|Thrace]]) and production methods (classic or cultured). It is eaten plain (e.g. as part of the traditional Turkish breakfast), used in salads, and incorporated into cooked foods such as ''[[Menemen (food)|menemen]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'' and ''[[Pita|pide]]''.\n* ''[[\u00c7erkez peyniri]]'', means \"[[Circassians|Circassian]] cheese\". It has two variations, smoked or non-smoked.\n* ''[[\u00c7\u00f6kelek]]'' is dried [[cottage cheese]]. There are many regional varieties of ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek''. Some are eaten fresh while others are preserved, either by storage in goatskin bags or pottery jars, or by drying in the sun. \n* ''[[Kurut]]'' and ''ke\u015f'' are regional names for dried bricks of yogurt made from low-fat milk or from ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek'' made from buttermilk.<ref name=KCheese>{{Cite web| url=http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115070211/http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=15 January 2013| title=Turkish Cheeses| accessdate=2007-12-07| date=2 June 2005}}</ref>\n* ''[[Kars gravyer cheese|Gravyer]]'' is produced in Turkey as well. Among others, [[Kars]] is famous for this type of cheese.\n* ''[[Hellim]]'' is a salty, firm-textured goat cheese, generally with some mint added, made in [[Northern Cyprus]]. In Turkey, it is common to fry ''hellim'' in a pan in some olive oil.\n* ''[[Ka\u015far]]'' is Turkey's other ubiquitous cheese, a moderately fatty sheep's cheese similar to the Greek ''[[kasseri]]'', sometimes marketed as \"Turkish cheddar\", being closer in consistency and taste to mild [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar-style cheese]] than other Turkish cheeses. Less matured ''ka\u015far'', called fresh ''ka\u015far'', is widely consumed as well. Two varieties are popular [[Kars]] and Thrace.\n* ''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' is a wheel-shaped yellow sheep's cheese, similar to fresh ''ka\u015far''. The name comes from Romanian word ''ca\u0219caval'', which bears the Italian structure of ''caciocavallo''. \n* ''[[Lor (food)|Lor]]'' is the other type of unsalted whey cheese, similarly made from the whey left over from ''ka\u015far'' or ''strained yogurt'' manufacture. ''Lor'' is used in traditional foods and desserts made from unsalted cheese like \"ek\u015fimik\" and ''h\u00f6\u015fmerim''\n* ''[[Mihali\u00e7 Peyniri|Mihali\u00e7 peyniri]]'' or ''Kelle peyniri'' is a hard sheep's cheese that can be grated, like [[Parmesan cheese]]. Sometimes goat or cow milk is used. It is a specialty from Karacabey, a town in Bursa province which was called Mihali\u00e7 during Byzantine and Ottoman period. Mostly it is produced from non-pastorized milk and processed by salt.\n* ''[[Braided cheese|\u00d6rg\u00fc peyniri]]'', \"[[braided cheese]]\", is a specialty from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].\n* ''[[Van herbed cheese|Otlu peynir]]''[[Van herbed cheese]] (\"herbed cheese\") is produced in many areas, chiefly in East Anatolia. Traditionally sheep's or goat's milk is used, but more recently cow's milk ''otlu peynir'' has been produced. The type of herb used varies by region: in Van [[Ramsons|wild garlic]] is traditional; Bitlis ''otlu peynir'' contains a damp-loving herb known as ''sof otu''. In other areas horse mint (''[[Mentha longifolia]]'') and ''[[Pimpinella rhodentha]]'' are used.<ref name=KCheese/>\n* ''[[Tulum (cheese)|Tulum]]'' is a mostly sheep's curd molded in an animal skin bag called as tulum. There are regional varieties of ''tulum peynir'' in such areas as \u0130zmir, \u00d6demi\u015f and Erzincan.<ref name=KCheese/> And each of tulum cheese have very different characteristics.\n\n=== Soups ===\nA Turkish meal usually starts with a thin [[soup]] (''\u00e7orba''). Soups are usually named after their main ingredient, the most common types being; mercimek ([[lentil]]) \u00e7orbas\u0131, yogurt, or [[wheat]] (often mashed) called [[tarhana]] \u00e7orbas\u0131. Delicacy soups are the ones that are usually not the part of the daily diet, such as [[\u0130\u015fkembe soup]] and [[pa\u00e7a]] \u00e7orbas\u0131, although the latter also used to be consumed as a nutritious winter meal. Before the popularisation of the typical Turkish breakfast, soup was the default morning meal for some people.\nThe most common soups in Turkish cuisine are:\n[[File:Tuzlama.jpg|thumb|''Tuzlama'', a [[tripe soup]] from Turkey.]]\n[[File:Sulu k\u00f6fte.jpg|thumb|[[Sulu k\u00f6fte]]]]\n[[File:Ezogelin soup, bread, and water.jpg|thumb|[[Ezogelin soup]]]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Anal\u0131 k\u0131zl\u0131 soup]]''\n* ''[[Yayla \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' \n* ''[[Ash reshteh|Eri\u015fte a\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Bu\u011fday a\u015f\u0131]]''/''[[Ayran soup|Ayran \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' (which is served cold)\n* ''[[Chorba|Corba]]''\n* ''Domates \u00e7orbas\u0131 '' ([[tomato soup]])\n* ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn \u00e7orbas\u0131'' (wedding soup)\n* ''[[Ek\u015fi A\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Ezogelin soup|Ezogelin \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n* ''[[\u0130\u015fkembe \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' \n* ''[[Keledo\u015f]]''\n* ''Lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131'' ([[cabbage]] soup)\n* ''[[Mahluta]]''\n* ''Mercimek \u00e7orbas\u0131'' ([[lentil soup]])\n* ''[[Pa\u00e7a]]''\n* ''[[Paz\u0131]]''\n* ''[[\u015eehriye]]''\n* [[Sheep's sorrel soup]]\n* ''[[Sulu k\u00f6fte]]''\n* ''[[Sumak a\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Tarhana \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n* ''Tavuk'' ([[chicken soup]], with almond becomes \"Bademli Tavuk\")\n* [[Toyga soup]]\n* ''Trabzon [[Fish soup|Bal\u0131k]] \u00e7orbas\u0131''\n* ''[[Tutma\u00e7]]'' (lentil dish with noodles)\n* ''[[Y\u00fcks\u00fck \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Bread ===\n* [[Bazlama]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* ''M\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi'' ([[corn bread]])\n* [[Lavash|Lava\u015f]]\n* [[Poga\u010da|Po\u011fa\u00e7a]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]] (a broad, round and flat bread made of wheat flour)\n* [[Simit]] (known as \"''gevrek''\" in Izmir, another type of ring-shaped bread covered with sesame seeds.

[[Su b\u00f6re\u011fi]], made with boiled [[yufka]]/[[phyllo]] layers, cheese and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. [[Cheburek|\u00c7i\u011f b\u00f6rek]] (also known as ''Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi'') is fried and stuffed with minced meat. [[Kol b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is another well-known type of b\u00f6rek that takes its name from its shape, as do [[fincan]] (coffee cup), [[muska (pastry)|muska]] (talisman), [[G\u00fcl b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (rose) or [[Sigara b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (cigarette).

[[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is a sweet type of b\u00f6rek, widespread in the [[Black Sea region]].\n\n[[Po\u011fa\u00e7a]] is the label name for dough based salty pastries. Likewise [[\u00e7\u00f6rek]] is another label name used for both sweet and salty pastries.\n\n[[G\u00f6zleme]] is a food typical in rural areas, made of [[lavash]] bread or phyllo dough folded around a variety of fillings such as spinach, cheese and parsley, minced meat or potatoes and cooked on a large griddle (traditionally [[sa\u010d]]).\n\n[[Katmer]] is another traditional rolled out dough. It can be salty or sweet according to the filling. Katmer with [[pistachio]] and [[kaymak]] is a sweet food and one of the most popular breakfast items in [[Gaziantep]].\n\n[[Lahmacun]] (meaning dough with meat in Arabic) is a thin flatbread covered with a layer of spiced minced meat, tomato, pepper, onion or garlic.\n\n[[Pita|Pide]], which can be made with minced meat (together with onion, chopped tomatoes, parsley and spices), [[kasseri|kashar]] cheese, spinach, white cheese, pieces of meat, braised meat ([[kavurma]]), sucuk, past\u0131rma or/and eggs put on rolled-out dough, is one of the most common traditional stone-baked Turkish specialities.\n\n[[A\u00e7ma]] is a soft bread found in most parts of Turkey.

The combination of meat-filled dough with yogurt differentiates it from other dumplings such as tortellini, ravioli, and Chinese wonton. Mant\u0131 is usually eaten as a main dish.

A large variety of vegetables are used, such as [[spinach]], [[leek]], [[cauliflower]], [[artichoke]], [[cabbage]], [[celery]], [[eggplant]], green and red [[bell pepper]]s, [[Green bean|string bean]] and [[jerusalem artichoke]]. A typical vegetable dish is prepared with a base of chopped onions, carrots saut\u00e9ed first in olive oil and later with tomatoes or [[tomato paste]]. The vegetables and hot water will then be added. Quite frequently a spoon of rice and lemon juice is also added. Vegetable dishes usually tend to be served with its own water (the cooking water) thus often called in colloquial Turkish ''sulu yemek'' (literally \"a dish with juice\"). Minced meat can also be added to a vegetable dish but vegetable dishes that are cooked with olive oil ''([[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131lar]])'' are often served cold and do not contain meat. Spinach, leek, string bean and artichoke with olive oil are among the most widespread dishes in Turkey.\n\n[[Dolma]] is the name used for stuffed vegetables. Like the vegetables cooked with olive oil as described above dolma with olive oil does not contain meat. Many vegetables are stuffed, most typically green peppers (''biber dolmas\u0131''), eggplants, tomatoes, or [[zucchini]]/courgettes (''kabak dolmas\u0131''), vine leaves (''yaprak dolmas\u0131''). If vine leaves are used, they are first pickled in brine. However, dolma is not limited to these common types; many other vegetables and fruits are stuffed with a meat or rice mixture. For example, artichoke dolma (''[[enginar dolmas\u0131]]'') is an Aegean region specialty. Fillings used in dolma may consist of parts of the vegetable carved out for preparation, rice with spices or minced meat.\n\n[[Mercimek k\u00f6fte]], although being named k\u00f6fte, does not contain any meat. Instead, red lentil is used as the major ingredient together with spring onion, tomato paste etc.\n\n[[Imam bayildi]] is a version of [[karn\u0131yar\u0131k]] with no minced meat inside. It can be served as a meze as well.\n\nFried eggplant and pepper is a common summer dish in Turkey. It is served with yogurt or tomato sauce and garlic.\n\n[[M\u00fccver]] is prepared with grated squash/courgette or potatoes, egg, onion, dill or cheese and flour. It can be either fried or cooked in the oven.\n\n[[Pilaf]] can be served either as a side dish or main dish but ''bulgur pilav\u0131'' (pilav made of boiled and pounded wheat - ''bulgur'') is also widely eaten. The dishes made with ''kuru fasulye'' ([[Common bean#White beans|white beans]]), ''nohut'' ([[chickpea]]s), ''mercimek'' ([[lentil]]s), ''b\u00f6r\u00fclce'' ([[black-eyed pea]]s), etc., combined with onion, vegetables, minced meat, tomato paste and rice, have always been common due to being economical and nutritious.\n\n[[Tur\u015fu]] is pickle made with brine, usually with the addition of garlic. It is often enjoyed as an appetizer. It is made with a large variety of vegetables, from cucumber to courgette. In the towns on the Aegean coast, the water of [[tur\u015fu]] is consumed as a drink. It comes from the Persian \"Torshi\", which refers to pickled \"Torsh\" (sour) vegetables.\n\n=== Egg dishes ===\n[[File:MenemenIstanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] (left) as part of a Turkish breakfast]]\n* [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] consists of scrambled eggs cooked in tomato, green pepper, and can be onion and garlic.\n* [[\u00c7\u0131lb\u0131r]] is another traditional Turkish food made with poached eggs, yogurt and oil.\n* ''Ispanakl\u0131 yumurta'' consists of eggs with spinach and onion.\n* Kaygana can be described as something of a cross between the pancake and the omelet in Ottoman cuisine. It used to be served with cheese, honey, crushed nuts, or eggplant. However, it is almost forgotten in the big cities of Turkey.\n\n=== Meze and salads ===\n[[File:Turkish Meze Plate.jpg|thumb|200px|A plate of Turkish meze]]\n[[Image:Cacik.jpg|thumb|200px|A bowl of [[Cac\u0131k]], the original form of seasoned, diluted [[yogurt]] with chopped cucumber, eaten throughout the former Ottoman world, under different names, like the [[tarator]] and [[tzatziki]] of the [[Balkans]].]]\n[[Image:Piyaz 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of piyaz]]\n[[Image:Kisir.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of [[k\u0131s\u0131r]] decorated with green [[olive]] and [[cucumber]] pieces]]\n[[Image:Bira ve \u00e7oban salata.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[\u00c7oban salatas\u0131]]]]\n\n[[Meze]] is a selection of food served as the appetizer course with or without drinks.

Dolma and sarma has a special place in Turkish cuisine. It can be eaten either as a meze or a main dish. It can be cooked either as a vegetable dish or meat dish. If a meat mixture is put in, it is usually served hot with yogurt and spices such as oregano and red pepper powder with oil. If the mixture is only vegan recipe it should only have olive oil rice or bulgur and some nuts and raisins inside especially blackcurrant.\n\n[[Zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 yaprak sarmas\u0131]] (stuffed leaves with olive oil) is the sarma made with vine leaves stuffed with a rice-spice mixture and cooked with olive oil. This type of dolma does not contain meat, is served cold and also referred to as ''[[sarma (food)|sarma]]'', which means \"wrapping\" in Turkish. [[Dried fruit]] such as blackcurant; raisins, figs or cherries and cinnamon and allspice used to be added into the mixture to sweeten ''zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 dolma'' in Ottoman cuisine. [[Vine leaves]] (''yaprak'') could be filled not only with rice and spices but also with meat and rice, ''[[etli yaprak sarma]]'', in which case it was often served hot with yogurt. The word ''sarma'' is also used for some types of desserts, such as [[f\u0131st\u0131k sarma]] (wrapped pistachio).\n\n[[Melon]] dolma along with [[quince]] or [[apple]] dolma was one of the palace's specialties (raw melon stuffed with minced meat, onion, rice, almonds, cooked in an oven). In contemporary Turkey, a wide variety of dolma is prepared.

Instead of dried cherries in the palace cuisine, currants are usually added to the filling of dolma cooked in olive oil.

Fish are grilled, fried or cooked slowly by the ''bu\u011fulama'' (poaching) method. ''Bu\u011fulama'' is fish with lemon and parsley, covered while cooking so that it will be cooked with steam. The term ''pil\u00e2ki'' is also used for fish cooked with various vegetables, including onion in the oven. In the Black Sea region, fish are usually fried with thick corn flour. Fish are also eaten cold; as smoked (isleme) or dried (\u00e7iroz), canned, salted or pickled (l\u00e2kerda). Fish is also cooked in salt or in dough in Turkey. Paz\u0131da Levrek is a seafood speciality which consists of [[European seabass|sea bass]] cooked in [[chard]] leaves. In fish restaurants, it is possible to find other fancy fish varieties like ''bal\u0131k dolma'' (stuffed fish), ''bal\u0131k iskender'' (inspired by [[\u0130skender kebap]]), fishballs or fish en papillote. [[Fish soup]] prepared with vegetables, onion and flour is common in coastal towns and cities. In [[Istanbul]]'s [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] and other coastal districts, grilled fish served in bread with tomatoes, herbs and onion is a popular fast food. In the inner parts of Turkey, [[trout]] ''alabal\u0131k''  is common as it is the main type of freshwater fish. Popular seafood mezes at coastlines include stuffed mussels, fried [[mussel]] and fried ''kalamar'' ([[Squid (food)|squid]]) with [[tarator]] sauce.\n\nPopular sea fish in Turkey include:<ref>English names for fish from [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Penguin, 1972. {{ISBN|0-14-046174-4}}</ref> \n[[Image:Trachurus trachurus fish 7218 Nevit.JPG|thumb|Istavrit on display at a fish market]]\n* [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]] ''hamsi''\n* [[Sardine (food)|sardine]] ''sardalya''\n* [[bonito]] ''palamut''\n* [[gilt-head bream]] ''\u00e7upra'' or ''\u00e7ipura''\n* [[red mullet]] ''barbun(ya)''\n* [[sea bass]] ''levrek''\n* [[Merlangius merlangus|whiting]] or ''bakalyaro''\n* [[haddock]] ''mezgit''\n* [[swordfish]] ''k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 bal\u0131g\u0131''\n* [[turbot]] ''kalkan''\n* [[Pagellus bellottii|red pandora]] ''mercan'' \n* [[Trachurus|Jack mackerel]] 'istavrit'\n* [[Epinephelus|white grouper]] ''lagos''\n* [[bluefish]] ''l\u00fcfer''\n\n=== Desserts ===\n{{see also|List of Turkish desserts}}\n[[File:Baklava - Turkish special, 80-ply.JPEG|thumb|right|230px|[[Baklava]] is prepared on large trays and cut into a variety of shapes.]]\n[[Image:Firinda s\u00fctla\u00e7.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''S\u00fctla\u00e7'', or Turkish [[rice pudding]].]]\n[[File:T Honey.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Turkish delight]].]]\n[[File:Kazandibi.JPG|thumb|right|230px|\n[[Kazandibi]], means the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface.]]\n[[File:Wasserweltfest 2012 - T\u00fcrkische Mehlspeise.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[\u015eekerpare]].]]\nOne of the world-renowned desserts of Turkish cuisine is [[baklava]]. Baklava is made either with pistachios or walnuts. Turkish cuisine has a range of baklava-like desserts which include [[\u015f\u00f6biyet]], [[b\u00fclb\u00fcl yuvas\u0131]], [[saray sarmas\u0131]], [[S\u00fctl\u00fc Nuriye|s\u00fctl\u00fc nuriye]], and [[sar\u0131 burma]].\n\n[[Kadaif]] ('Kaday\u0131f') is a common Turkish dessert that employs shredded yufka. There are different types of [[kadaif]]: tel (wire) or [[Burma (dessert)|Burma]] (wring) kaday\u0131f, both of which can be prepared with either walnuts or pistachios.\n\nAlthough carrying the label \"kaday\u0131f\", [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] is totally different from \"tel kaday\u0131f\". [[K\u00fcnefe]] and [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] are rich in syrup and butter, and are usually served with [[kaymak]] (clotted/scrambled butter). K\u00fcnefe contains wire kaday\u0131f with a layer of melted cheese in between and it is served hot with pistachios or walnuts.\n\nAmong milk-based desserts, the most popular ones are [[muhallebi]], [[su muhallebisi]], [[s\u00fctla\u00e7]] (rice pudding), [[ke\u015fk\u00fcl]], [[kazandibi]] (meaning the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface), and [[tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc]] (a sweet, gelatinous, milk pudding dessert quite similar to kazandibi, to which very thinly peeled chicken breast is added to give a chewy texture). A speciality from the Mediterranean region is [[haytal\u0131]], which consists of pieces of starch pudding and ice cream (or crushed ice) put in rose water sweetened with syrup.\n\n[[Halva|Helva]] (halva): [[un helvas\u0131]] (flour helva is usually cooked after someone has died), [[irmik helvas\u0131]] (cooked with semolina and pine nuts), [[yaz helvas\u0131]] (made from walnut or almond<ref>Nevin Hal\u0131c\u0131 - Sufi cuisine</ref>), [[tahin helvas\u0131]] (crushed sesame seeds), [[kos helva]], [[pi\u015fmaniye]] (floss halva).\n\nOther popular desserts include; [[Revani]] (with semolina and starch), [[\u015fekerpare]], [[kalburabasma]], [[dilber duda\u011f\u0131]], [[vezir parma\u011f\u0131]], [[han\u0131m g\u00f6be\u011fi]], [[Kemal Pasha dessert|kemalpa\u015fa]], [[tulumba]], [[zerde]], [[h\u00f6\u015fmerim]], [[paluze]], [[irmik tatl\u0131s\u0131/peltesi]], [[lokma]].\n\n[[G\u00fclla\u00e7]] is a dessert typically served at Ramadan, which consists of very thin, large dough layers put in milk and rose water, served with pomegranate seeds and walnuts. A story is told that in the kitchens of the Palace, those extra thin dough layers were prepared with \"prayers\", as it was believed that if one did not pray while opening phyllo dough, it would never be possible to obtain such thin layers.\n\n[[Ashure|A\u015fure]] can be described as a sweet soup containing boiled beans, wheat and dried fruits. Sometimes cinnamon and rose water is added when being served. According to legend, it was first cooked on [[Noah's Ark]] and contained seven different ingredients in one dish. All the Anatolian peoples have cooked and are still cooking a\u015fure especially during the month of Muharrem.\n\nSome traditional Turkish desserts are fruit-based: ''ayva tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[quince]]), ''incir tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[Common fig|fig]]), ''kabak tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pumpkin]]), ''elma tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[apple]]) and ''armut tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pear]]). Fruits are cooked in a pot or in an oven with sugar, carnations and cinnamon (without adding water). After being chilled, they are served with walnuts or pistachios and [[kaymak]].\n\nHomemade cookies/biscuits are commonly called [[kurabiye]] in Turkish. The most common types are [[ac\u0131badem kurabiyesi]] (prepared only with eggs, sugar and almonds), [[un kurabiyesi]] (flour kurabiye) and cevizli kurabiye (kurabiye with walnuts). Another dough based dessert is [[ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi]].\n\n[[Tahin-pekmez]] is a traditional combination especially in rural areas. Tahin is [[tahini|sesame paste]] and pekmez is grape syrup. These are sold separately and mixed before consumption.\n\n[[Lokum]] ([[Turkish delight]]), which was eaten for digestion after meals and called \"rahat hulkum\" in the Ottoman era, is another well-known sweet/candy with a range of varieties.\n\n[[Cezerye]], [[cevizli (walnut) sucuk]] (named after its sucuk/sujuk like shape, also known as [[Churchkhela]] in Circassian region) and [[pestil]] (fruit pestils) are among other common sweets.\n\n[[Marzipan]] ''badem ezmesi'' or ''f\u0131st\u0131k ezmesi'' (made of ground pistachios) is another common confection in Turkey.\n\nAnother jelly like Turkish sweet is [[macun]]. [[Mesir macunu]] of [[Manisa]]/[[\u0130zmir]] (which was also called \"nevruziye\" as this macun was distributed on the first day of spring in the Ottoman Palace) contains 41 different spices. It is still believed that \"mesir macunu\" is good for health and has healing effects. As with lokum, [[nane macunu]] (prepared with mint) used to be eaten as a digestive after heavy meals. Herbs and flowers having curative effects were grown in the gardens of Topkap\u0131 under the control of the chief doctor \"hekimba\u015f\u0131\" and pharmacists of the Palace who used those herbs for preparing special types of [[macun]] and [[Sharbat|sherbet]].<ref>Marianna Yerasimos, Ottoman cuisine</ref>\n\nThere are also several types of ice creams based on [[salep]] powder or [[Cornstarch]] with [[Rose water]] such as [[Dondurma]] (Turkish gum ice cream), dried fruit ice cream, ice cream rose petals.\n\nDried fruit, used in dolma, pilav, meat dishes and other desserts is also eaten with almonds or walnuts as a dessert. Figs, grapes, apricots are the most widespread dried fruits.\n\n''Kaymak'' (clotted cream-butter) is often served with desserts to cut through their sweetness.\n\n[[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee]], with or without sugar, is usually served after dinner or more rarely together with desserts.\n\n=== Street food ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Mara\u015f dondurmas\u0131 in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Dondurma]]\n[[File:Macun in Turkey.jpg|thumb|Macun]]\n* [[Dondurma]]\n* fried mussels, stuffed mussels ''midye''\n* fresh walnuts ''taze ceviz''\n* g\u00f6zleme a very thin stuffed flat bred similar to [[paratha]], fillings can include any combination of spiced potato, feta, spinach and ground meat \n* kokore\u00e7\n* kumpir a baked potato served with ''ka\u015far'' cheese and many other toppings\n* [[lokma]]\n* roasted corn ''k\u00f6zde m\u0131s\u0131r''\n* roasted chesnuts ''kestane''\n* simit\n* [[Macun]]\n\n== Beverages ==\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n{{See also|Turkish wine|Alcohol laws of Turkey}}\n[[File:Turkish wine regions map.png|thumb|300px|Wine-producing regions in Turkey.]]\nAlthough the majority of Turks profess the Islamic religion, [[alcoholic beverage]]s are as widely available as anywhere. However, some Turks abstain from drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]]. [[Rak\u0131]] (pronounced [\u027ea\u02c8k\u026f]) is the most popular alcoholic drink in Turkey. It is considered as the national alcoholic beverage of Turkey. There are a few local brands of [[lager]] such as Bomonti, Marmara34 and [[Efes Beverage Group|Efes Pilsen]] and a small selection of international beers that are produced in Turkey such as Skol, [[Beck's]], [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]], [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]], [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg Brewery|Tuborg]].\n\nThere are a variety of local [[wine]]s produced by Turkish brands such as [[Sevilen group|Sevilen]], [[Kavakl\u0131dere (wine)|Kavakl\u0131dere]], Doluca, Corvus, Kayra, Pamukkale and Diren which are getting more popular with the change of climatic conditions that affect the production of wine. A range of grape varieties are grown in Turkey. For the production of red wine, the following types of grapes are mainly used; in the Marmara Region, [[Pinot noir]], [[Adakaras\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Semillion]], [[Kuntra]], [[Gamay]], [[Cinsault]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Carignane]], [[\u00c7alkaras\u0131]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Alicante Bouschet]]; in the Black Sea Region and the eastern part of the country, [[\u00d6k\u00fczg\u00f6z\u00fc]], [[Bo\u011fazkere]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Kalecik Karas\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]; in the Mediterranean Region, [[Sergi Karas\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]. As for white wine, the grapes can be listed as follows; in the Marmara Region, [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling]], [[Semillion]], [[Beylerce]], [[Yap\u0131ncak]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] and [[semillion]]; in the Black Sea Region, [[Narince (grape)|Narince]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Emir (grape)|Emir]], [[Hasandede]] (for further info http://www.hayyam.com/uzumler/index.php{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}). In addition to mass production, it is quite popular to produce wines in private farms and sell them in the locality. Visitors can find different \"home made\" wines in Central Anatolia (Kapadokya/[[Cappadocia]] region - [[Nev\u015fehir]]), the Aegean coast ([[Sel\u00e7uk]] and [[Bozcaada]] (an island in the Aegean Sea)).\n\n=== Non-alcoholic beverages ===\n[[Image:Rize tea.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Turkish tea]]]]\n[[File:Turkishcoffee.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Turkish coffee]]]]\nAt breakfast and all day long Turkish people drink [[black tea]] (''\u00e7ay''). Tea is made with two teapots in Turkey. Strong bitter tea made in the upper pot is diluted by adding boiling water from the lower. [[Turkish coffee]] (''kahve'') is usually served after meals or with dessert.\n\n[[Ayran]] (yogurt drink) is the most common cold beverage, which may accompany almost all dishes in Turkey, except those with fish and other seafood. It's a mix of yogurt and water, similar to [[lassi]]. It may be served with salt, according to taste.\n\n[[\u015ealgam suyu]] (mild or spicy fermented red carrot juice) is another important non-alcoholic beverage that is usually combined with kebabs or served together with [[rak\u0131]].\n\n[[Boza]] is a traditional winter drink, which is also known as millet wine (served cold with cinnamon and sometimes with [[leblebi]]).\n\n[[Sahlep]] is another favorite in winter (served hot with cinnamon). Sahlep is extracted from the roots of wild orchids and may be used in Turkish ice cream as well. This was a popular drink in western Europe before coffee was brought from Africa and came to be widely known.\n\n''Limonata'' (lemonade) is very popular. It is traditionally served with baklava and other sweets. Sometimes lemonade is served with strawberry flavoring. This is called ''\u00e7\u0131lekl\u0131 l\u0131monata''.\n\n[[Sherbet (Middle Eastern drink)|Sherbet]] (Turkish ''\u015ferbet,'' pronounced {{IPA-tr|\u0283e\u027e\u02c8bet|}}) is a syrup which can be made from any of a wide variety of ingredients, especially fruits, flowers, or herbs. Examples include pears, quinces, strawberries, apples, [[cornelian cherry]], pomegranates, oranges, rose petals, rose hips, or licorice and spices.  Sherbet is drunk diluted with cold water.\n\nIn classical Turkish cuisine, [[ho\u015faf]] (from the Persian \"Khosh-ab\", meaning \"fresh water\") alternatively accompanies meat dishes and ''pilav'' ([[pilaf]]).\n\n=== Related cuisines ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Greek cuisine]]\n* [[Albanian cuisine]]\n* [[Balkan cuisine]]\n* [[Central Asian cuisine]]\n* [[Levantine cuisine]]\n* [[Middle Eastern cuisine]]\n* [[Mongolian cuisine]]\n* [[Ottoman cuisine]]\n* [[Caucasian cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Food|Turkey}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Baklava]]\n* [[Doner kebap]]\n* [[\u0130skender kebap]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* [[Kadaif]]\n* [[Kumpir]]\n* [[Mangal (barbecue)|Mangal]]\n* [[Manti (dumpling)|Mant\u0131]]\n* [[Meze]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]]\n* [[Turkish coffee]]\n* [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|Turkish rak\u0131]]\n* [[Turkish tea]]\n* [[List of stuffed dishes#Turkish stuffed dishes|Turkish stuffed dishes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Budak, S\u00fcheyl, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184656/http://www.nadirkitap.com/antakya-mutfagi-suheyl-budak-kitap3618320.html ''Antakya Mutfa\u011f\u0131''], Hatay 2008, {{oclc|705454123}} (1996 edition)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927145106/http://blog.kitchenguerilla.com/2011/03/antakya-cuisine-with-suheyl-budak-and-75-ladies/?lang=en Antakya-cuisine with S\u00fcheyl Budak and 75 ladies]\n* G\u00fcrsoy, Deniz, ''Turkish Cuisine in Historical Perspective'', Istanbul, 2006, {{ISBN|975-329-564-2}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Konya Yemek K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc ve Konya Yemekleri'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-6021-16-0}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Sufi Cuisine'', Saqi 2005.\n* Lambraki, Mirsini & Ak\u0131n, Engin, ''Ayn\u0131 Sofrada \u0130ki \u00dclke, T\u00fcrk ve Yunan Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-458-484-2}}.\n* [[Claudia Roden|Roden, Claudia]], ''A New Book of Middle Eastern Food'', 2000, {{ISBN|0-14-046588-X}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Halk Mutfa\u011f\u0131m\u0131z Geleneksel Tatlar\u0131m\u0131zdan Se\u00e7meler'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-98180-2-7}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Turkish Cuisine'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-285-114-2}}\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & S\u00fct, Uyuyunca, ''T\u00fcrkiye Peynirleri'', Istanbul, {{ISBN|975-363-755-1}}.\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & Silivrim, Kaymak, ''T\u00fcrkiye'nin Yo\u011furtlar\u0131'', Istanbul 2007, {{ISBN|978-975-08-1276-7}}.\n* Yerasimos, Marianna, ''Osmanl\u0131 Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2002; published in English as ''500 Years of Ottoman Cuisine''.\n* Zubaida, Sami & Tapper, Richard, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London and New York, 1994 and 2000, {{ISBN|1-86064-603-4}}.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{cookbook}}\n{{Cookbook|Turkish Cooking}}\n* Turkish Cultural Foundation - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090301190825/http://www.turkish-cuisine.org/english/index.php Turkish Cuisine Portal]\n* [[Cornucopia (magazine)|Cornucopia]] recipe index - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090412033714/http://www.cornucopia.net/cookerylisting.html Cookery Listing]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131224173614/http://www.studyinturkey.org/en/discover-turkey/experience-turkey/turkish-cousine/ \"Turkish Cousine\" (Study In Turkey)]\n\n{{Turkey topics}}\n{{Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{European topic|| cuisine}}\n{{Mediterranean cuisine}}\n{{Middle Eastern cuisine}}\n{{cuisines}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turkish Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Turkish cuisine| ]]\n", "name_user": "Ail Subway", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCheeses", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_cuisine"}

The son of [[Archduke Otto of Austria (1865\u20131906)|Archduke Otto of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]], Charles became [[heir presumptive]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] after his uncle [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated in 1914]]. In 1911, he married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. He made secret attempts to negotiate Austria-Hungary's exit from the [[World War I|First World War]] but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles' intention to preserve the empire by transforming it into a federal union, Austria-Hungary headed rapidly towards complete dissolution; [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] were proclaimed and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] declared to cease her monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 he was formally dethroned by the Austrian Parliament and exiled to Switzerland.\n\nCharles spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; both failed due to a lack of support from Hungary's [[Regent of Hungary|regent]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he soon fell ill and died of [[respiratory failure]] in 1922.\n\n[[beatification|Beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, Charles is known to the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Blessed Karl of Austria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emperorcharles.org |title=Blessed Karl of Austria |publisher=Emperorcharles.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kaiser Karl I as a child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|Charles as a child, c.1889]]\n\nCharles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of [[Persenbeug-Gottsdorf|Persenbeug]], in [[Lower Austria]]. His parents were [[Archduke Otto Franz of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]]. At the time, his great-uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] reigned as [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Upon the death of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolph]] in 1889, the Emperor's brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new [[heir presumptive]].\n\nArchduke Charles was reared a devout [[Catholic]]. He spent his early years wherever his father's regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in [[Vienna]] and [[Reichenau an der Rax]]. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906-08 as an officer chiefly in [[Prague]], where he studied [[Law]] and [[Political Science]] concurrently with his military duties.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922 |last=Pribram |first=Alfred Francis | wstitle=Charles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various [[Bohemia]]n garrison towns. Charles' relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.<ref name=eb/>\n\n== Marriage ==\n[[File:Hochzeit Erzh Karl und Zita Schwarzau 1911c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles and Zita's wedding, {{nowr|21 October 1911}}]]\nIn 1911, Charles married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]]. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his [[Dragoon]] regiment was stationed at [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem-Star\u00e1 Boleslav|Brand\u00fds nad Labem]] in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at [[Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b|Franzensbad]].<ref name = \"Beeche\">Beeche.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nIt was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|5}} Due to Franz Ferdinand's [[morganatic marriage]] in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession. As a result, the Emperor pressured Charles to marry. Zita not only shared Charles' devout Catholicism, but also an impeccable royal lineage.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\">{{cite book|last=Brook-Shepherd|first=G.|date=1991|title=The Last Empress: The Life and Times of Zita of Austria-Hungary, 1892\u20131989|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780002158619}}</ref>{{rp|16}} Zita later recalled:\n\n{{quote|We were of course glad to meet again and became close friends. On my side feelings developed gradually over the next two years. He seemed to have made his mind up much more quickly, however, and became even more keen when, in the autumn of 1910, rumours spread about that I had got engaged to a distant Spanish relative, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]].\n\nOn hearing this, the Archduke came down post haste from his regiment at Brandeis and sought out his [step]grandmother, [[Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal|Archduchess Maria Theresa]], who was also my aunt and the natural confidante in such matters. He asked if the rumor was true and when told it was not, he replied, \"Well, I had better hurry in any case or she will get engaged to someone else.\"<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|8}}}}\n\nArchduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore, the Italian winter residence of Zita's parents, and asked for her hand; on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{Rp|8}} Charles and Zita were married at the Bourbon-Parma castle of Schwarzau in Austria on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\"/>{{Rp|19}} Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]] was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children followed in the next decade.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\nCharles became heir presumptive after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, the event which precipitated [[World War I]]. Only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to his crown in affairs of state. But the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the war at headquarters at [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], but exercised no military influence.<ref name=eb/>\n\nCharles then became a ''[[List of Austrian field marshals|Feldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]ns and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]ns.<ref name=eb/>\n\n==Reign==\n\n[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|King Charles IV taking his [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|coronation oath]] at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]], [[Budapest]], 30 December 1916]]\n[[File:Karlfamily.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the recently crowned King Charles IV and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Queen Zita]] with their son [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]]]]\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 after the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.  \nOn 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the whole army, succeeding [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich]]. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made.<ref>David Stevenson, \"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\" ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65-86.</ref> Foreign minister [[Ottokar Czernin|Graf Czernin]] was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] published letters signed by him.  This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally.<ref>Edward P. Keleher, \"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.</ref>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with much tension between ethnic groups. As part of his [[Fourteen Points]], U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe new foreign minister Baron [[Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz|Istvan Buri\u00e1n]] asked for an armistice 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state.  The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian.  Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and [[Trieste]] was to have a special status. However, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied four days later that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, autonomy inside the Empire for the nationalities was no longer enough. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|independent South Slav state]] 29 October 1918.\n\n===Trialism and Croatia===\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Karl favored the creation of a third Croatian political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia]] with [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Rijeka]]<ref name=\"Karlova zavjernica\">(Hrvatska) Krunidbena zavjernica Karla IV. hrvatskom Saboru 28. prosinca 1916.

One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles' political future became uncertain.  On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles' realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the [[German Austria]]n State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.\n\n== <span id=\"Proclamations\"></span>Proclamations of November 1918 ==\n[[File:Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Karl I. 11.11.1918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of 11 November 1918]]\nOn the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and \"relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.\"<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=C.

On the same day, the Imperial Family left [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] and moved to Castle [[Eckartsau]], east of Vienna. On 13 November, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation\u2014the Eckartsau Proclamation\u2014for Hungary.\n\nAlthough it has widely been cited as an \"abdication\", the word itself was never used in either proclamation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gomb\u00e1s|first=I.|date=2002|title=Kings and Queens of Hungary, Princes of Transylvania|location=Budapest|publisher=Corvina|isbn=9789631347593}}</ref> Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word ''abdication'' in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him.

An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]].\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that \"whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since 11 November is null and void for me and my House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Portisch|first=H.|date=1989|title=\u00d6sterreich I: die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik|language=de|location=Vienna|publisher=Kremayr & Scheriau|isbn=9783218004855|page=117}}</ref> The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this \"Manifesto of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]\" at this time\u2014it had been dispatched only to King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and to [[Pope Benedict XV]] through diplomatic channels\u2014and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor's departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe [[Austrian Parliament]] responded on 3 April with the [[Habsburg Law]], which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] at [[Lake Constance]], and later moved to Ch\u00e2teau de [[Prangins]] at [[Lake Geneva]] on 20 May.\n\n==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==\n{{main|Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne}}\nEncouraged by Hungarian royalists (\"legitimists\"), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary's [[regent]], [[Admiral]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] (the last commander of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial and Royal Navy]]), refused to support Charles' restoration. Horthy's action was declared \"treasonous\" by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy's actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, [[Little Entente|neighbouring countries]] had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne. Later in 1921, the Hungarian parliament formally nullified the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], an act that effectively dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\n==Exile in Madeira, Portugal and death==\n[[File:Karl Grabmal Monte.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles I in Madeira]]\nAfter the second failed attempt at restoration in Hungary, Charles and his pregnant wife Zita were arrested and quarantined at [[Tihany Abbey]].

The son of [[Archduke Otto of Austria (1865\u20131906)|Archduke Otto of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]], Charles became [[heir presumptive]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] after his uncle [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated in 1914]]. In 1911, he married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. He made secret attempts to negotiate Austria-Hungary's exit from the [[World War I|First World War]] but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles' intention to preserve the empire by transforming it into a federal union, Austria-Hungary headed rapidly towards complete dissolution; [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] were proclaimed and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] declared to cease her monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 he was formally dethroned by the Austrian Parliament and exiled to Switzerland.\n\nCharles spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; both failed due to a lack of support from Hungary's [[Regent of Hungary|regent]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he soon fell ill and died of [[respiratory failure]] in 1922.\n\n[[beatification|Beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, Charles is known to the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Blessed Karl of Austria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emperorcharles.org |title=Blessed Karl of Austria |publisher=Emperorcharles.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kaiser Karl I as a child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|Charles as a child, c.1889]]\n\nCharles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of [[Persenbeug-Gottsdorf|Persenbeug]], in [[Lower Austria]]. His parents were [[Archduke Otto Franz of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]]. At the time, his great-uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] reigned as [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Upon the death of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolph]] in 1889, the Emperor's brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new [[heir presumptive]].\n\nArchduke Charles was reared a devout [[Catholic]]. He spent his early years wherever his father's regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in [[Vienna]] and [[Reichenau an der Rax]]. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906-08 as an officer chiefly in [[Prague]], where he studied [[Law]] and [[Political Science]] concurrently with his military duties.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922 |last=Pribram |first=Alfred Francis | wstitle=Charles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various [[Bohemia]]n garrison towns. Charles' relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.<ref name=eb/>\n\n== Marriage ==\n[[File:Hochzeit Erzh Karl und Zita Schwarzau 1911c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles and Zita's wedding, {{nowr|21 October 1911}}]]\nIn 1911, Charles married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]]. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his [[Dragoon]] regiment was stationed at [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem-Star\u00e1 Boleslav|Brand\u00fds nad Labem]] in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at [[Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b|Franzensbad]].<ref name = \"Beeche\">Beeche.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nIt was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|5}} Due to Franz Ferdinand's [[morganatic marriage]] in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession.

Seven more children followed in the next decade.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\nCharles became heir presumptive after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, the event which precipitated [[World War I]]. Only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to his crown in affairs of state. But the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the war at headquarters at [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], but exercised no military influence.<ref name=eb/>\n\nCharles then became a ''[[List of Austrian field marshals|Feldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]ns and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]ns.<ref name=eb/>\n\n==Reign==\n\n[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|King Charles IV taking his [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|coronation oath]] at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]], [[Budapest]], 30 December 1916]]\n[[File:Karlfamily.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the recently crowned King Charles IV and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Queen Zita]] with their son [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]]]]\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 after the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.  \nOn 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the whole army, succeeding [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich]]. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made.<ref>David Stevenson, \"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\" ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65-86.</ref> Foreign minister [[Ottokar Czernin|Graf Czernin]] was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] published letters signed by him.  This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally.<ref>Edward P. Keleher, \"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.</ref>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with much tension between ethnic groups. As part of his [[Fourteen Points]], U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe new foreign minister Baron [[Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz|Istvan Buri\u00e1n]] asked for an armistice 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state.  The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian.  Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and [[Trieste]] was to have a special status. However, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied four days later that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, autonomy inside the Empire for the nationalities was no longer enough. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|independent South Slav state]] 29 October 1918.\n\n===Trialism and Croatia===\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Karl favored the creation of a third Croatian political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia]] with [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Rijeka]]<ref name=\"Karlova zavjernica\">(Hrvatska) Krunidbena zavjernica Karla IV. hrvatskom Saboru 28. prosinca 1916.

One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles' political future became uncertain.  On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles' realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the [[German Austria]]n State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.\n\n== <span id=\"Proclamations\"></span>Proclamations of November 1918 ==\n[[File:Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Karl I. 11.11.1918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of 11 November 1918]]\nOn the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and \"relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.\"<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=C.

On the same day, the Imperial Family left [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] and moved to Castle [[Eckartsau]], east of Vienna. On 13 November, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation\u2014the Eckartsau Proclamation\u2014for Hungary.\n\nAlthough it has widely been cited as an \"abdication\", the word itself was never used in either proclamation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gomb\u00e1s|first=I.|date=2002|title=Kings and Queens of Hungary, Princes of Transylvania|location=Budapest|publisher=Corvina|isbn=9789631347593}}</ref> Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word ''abdication'' in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him. Privately, Charles left no doubt that he believed himself to be the rightful emperor. He wrote to [[Friedrich Gustav Piffl]], the [[Archbishop of Vienna]]: \"I did not abdicate, and never will&nbsp;[...] I see my manifesto of 11 November as the equivalent to a cheque which a street thug has forced me to issue at gunpoint&nbsp;[...] I do not feel bound by it in any way whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"Scheidl\">{{cite news|last=Werner|first=H.

An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]].\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that \"whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since 11 November is null and void for me and my House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Portisch|first=H.|date=1989|title=\u00d6sterreich I: die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik|language=de|location=Vienna|publisher=Kremayr & Scheriau|isbn=9783218004855|page=117}}</ref> The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this \"Manifesto of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]\" at this time\u2014it had been dispatched only to King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and to [[Pope Benedict XV]] through diplomatic channels\u2014and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor's departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe [[Austrian Parliament]] responded on 3 April with the [[Habsburg Law]], which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] at [[Lake Constance]], and later moved to Ch\u00e2teau de [[Prangins]] at [[Lake Geneva]] on 20 May.\n\n==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==\n{{main|Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne}}\nEncouraged by Hungarian royalists (\"legitimists\"), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary's [[regent]], [[Admiral]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] (the last commander of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial and Royal Navy]]), refused to support Charles' restoration. Horthy's action was declared \"treasonous\" by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy's actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, [[Little Entente|neighbouring countries]] had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne. Later in 1921, the Hungarian parliament formally nullified the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], an act that effectively dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\n==Exile in Madeira, Portugal and death==\n[[File:Karl Grabmal Monte.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles I in Madeira]]\nAfter the second failed attempt at restoration in Hungary, Charles and his pregnant wife Zita were arrested and quarantined at [[Tihany Abbey]].

In the interwar years he was celebrated in Austria as a military hero. When Nazi Germany took over it made his memory into that of a traitor. For decades after 1945, both popular interest and academic interest in the 1914\u20131918 war practically disappeared.

Although the plan seemed unattainable due to the severity of the war thus far, it had been appealing to the Catholic Emperor Charles I, who could have seen it as his duty as Apostolic King of Hungary to carry out the Church's will, or as a way to preserve his throne in the years to come.

His chief concern was to follow the Christian vocation to holiness also in his political actions. For this reason, his thoughts turned to social assistance.\n\nThe ''cause'' or campaign for his canonization began in 1949, when the testimony of his holiness was collected in the [[Archdiocese of Vienna]]. In 1954, the cause was opened and he was declared \"servant of God\", the first step in the process.

He was the second son of [[Hugh&nbsp;IV of Cyprus]], the first by his second wife Alice of Ibelin. He was also invested as titular [[Count of Tripoli]] when young, in 1346. He was the greatest King of Cyprus on a military basis, where he had great success. He was unable to complete many plans, due to internal disputes that culminated in his assassination at the hands of three of his own knights.\n\n==Early life and crowning==\nPeter was born in [[Nicosia]] in 1328. Hugh's heir apparent was his first born son, Guy, who had married [[Marie of Bourbon, Latin Empress|Marie of Bourbon]]. Guy died before his father, however; and though his son, also named Hugh, demanded the throne, Peter was crowned King of Cyprus by [[Guy of Ibelin, bishop of Limassol]] in the Cathedral of [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]] on 24 November 1359.{{sfn|Richard|1950|p=98\u2013133}}\n\nIn 1349 he traveled secretly to Europe with his brother John. This upset their father who sent ships to find his sons and bring them back. When they were brought back, he imprisoned them for leaving without his permission.\n\nUpon the expulsion of the Holy Roman Empire from Palestine a hundred years before, Cyprus became the stronghold of Christianity in the [[Middle East]]. Peter understood the importance of his kingdom, and believed that his mission was to fight Islam. He had ambitions to retake the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to which the house of [[Lusignan]] yet pretended. Peter was crowned as titular [[King of Jerusalem]] in [[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque|Saint Nicholas Cathedral]] in [[Famagusta]] on 5 April 1360, succeeding his father.\n[[File:Armoiries Chypre J\u00e9rusalem.svg|thumb|150px|coat-of-arms of Lusignan of Cyprus and Jerusalem]]\n\n==Marriages==\nSoon after 28 June 1342 he married Eschiva de Montfort (d. before 1350),{{sfn|Edbury|1991|p=146}} only daughter and heiress of Humphrey de Montfort (1305 &ndash; 24 June 1326), [[Officers of the Kingdom of Cyprus#Constable|Constable of Cyprus]] and titular Lord of [[Toron]], and Eschive d'Ibelin. Eschiva died before 1350 while Peter was still a teenager and the marriage was childless.\n\nIn 1353 he married [[Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Cyprus|Eleanor of Aragon-Gandia]] (1333 &ndash; 26 December 1416 in [[Barcelona]] and buried there),{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=308}} daughter of Pedro, Infante of Aragon, Conde de Ribagorza, Ampurias y Prades, [[Seneschal]] of [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]], and Jeanne de Foix (died before November 1358).<br> Eleanor was crowned Queen of Cyprus on 24 November 1358 and [[Queen consort of Jerusalem|Queen of Jerusalem]] on 5 April 1360.\n\nHis passion for his second wife was much remarked upon by chroniclers; the chronicle of Machairas tells us how Peter always slept with Eleanora's night-dress in his arms:\n\n:\"[S]o for the love which [King Peter] had promised that, wherever he was, he would take [Queen Eleanora's] shift to lay it at night in his arms when he slept, and he made his chamberlain always bring with him the queen's shift, and had him put it in his bed.\"{{sfn|Bolger|Serwint|2002|p=157}}\n\n==Children==\nHe had three children from his second marriage to Eleanor:\n*[[Peter II of Cyprus|Peter II of Lusignan]] (c. 1357\u20131382),{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=370}} succeeded him as King of Cyprus and Jerusalem\n*[[Mary/Mariette or Margaret of Lusignan]] (ca. 1360 &ndash; ca. 1397), once engaged to [[Carlo Visconti]] and married in 1385 to her cousin James/Jacques de Lusignan (d. 1395/1397), titular [[Count of Tripoli]], son of [[John of Lusignan]] and wife [[Alix d'Ibelin]], and had issue\n*[[Eschiva of Lusignan]] (d. before 1369), died young\nAs [[Peter II of Cyprus]] remained heirless, the crown of Cyprus was passed to his uncle [[James I of Cyprus]], son of [[Hugh IV of Cyprus]] and [[Alix of Ibelin]].\n\n==Wars against the Turks==\n[[File:Araldiz GEDA 26 076.png|thumb|Order of the Sword (1347)]]\nNeighboring Muslim powers were potentially a great threat to Cyprus, the last Christian Crusader stronghold on the mainland of the Near East having been wiped out with the [[Fall of Acre]] in 1291. At the moment a new Islamic power had recently come to the fore, but the expanding [[Ottomans]] had their eye fixed on what remained of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In addition, they were primarily a land power, and for the moment the remaining Latin Christian entities in the region could hold their own on the seas. Along with the [[Knights of Saint John]] (the Hospitallers) the kings of Cyprus were the main inheritors of the Crusading tradition. Peter founded the chivalric Order of the Sword in 1347, which was dedicated to the recovery of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Boulton|1987|p=241-249}}\n\nThe royal family were in fact the titular kings of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, who had fled to the island just off the coast of the Levant. Reduced as they were, this Crusader heritage continued in the form of sea-borne raids, and were remarkably successful given their limited resources.\n\nUnlike his father, Peter decided to embrace this tradition and began with in a raid on [[Korikos]], a fortified harbour in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. His primary focus of activity was along the coast of [[Asia Minor]], since the Christian Armenians in Cilicia had strong relations with the Kingdom of Cyprus via marriage ties. In January 1360, the residents of Korikos sent their representatives to Cyprus to ask for protection, since their city was threatened by the Turks. Peter sent some of his men led by the knight Roberto de Luisignan. The Turks were unable to break the Cypriot siege of Korikos.\n\nThe siege of Korikos was seen as a threat by Muslim leaders of Asia Minor and they allied against Peter, planning to attack him on his home island. They attacked Cyprus with many ships but Peter obtained aid from the Knights of Saint John from Rhodes. Other help came from the Pope and even from pirates. In July 1361, Peter mustered a fleet of 120 ships. With his force, Peter attacked Asia Minor, continuing his policy of preemptive attacks. On 23 August 1361, Cypriot forces landed in Antalya and Peter conquered the city after a siege on 24 August 1361. After this victory, the remaining emirs of the region offered Peter an annual tribute. Peter accepted the offer and sent his flags, coats of arms and symbols to be raised in many cities of Asia Minor. He stayed in Antalya until 8 September 1361. Then he went to other cities, some of whose emirs knelt to him, gave him presents, keys to castles and many other gifts. He returned with his trophies to Cyprus on 22 September 1361.\n\nThe emir of Antalya, [[Beylik of Teke|Teke]], after he lost his city, took a large army and after many attacks tried to occupy his city. After hard fighting, Cypriots managed to keep the city and also to siege the guard in the region of Myrres.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n==Tour of Europe==\nMeanwhile, King Peter still faced a serious problem of his recognition as holder of the throne of Cyprus, since his nephew Hugh, went to the Pope to ask for the throne with the support of the [[King of France]]. Since Peter had sent nobles as his representatives to the Pope to support him without result, he resolved to visit the Pope himself. At the end of October 1362, he left from [[Paphos]] to [[Rhodes]] and then to [[Venice]] and he was accepted there with honour. He went to [[Avignon]] and visited the Pope together with the claimant of the throne of Cyprus. Peter was recognised as King and Hugh agreed a high annual benefit, solving the problem.\n\nTaking advantage of his trip in Europe, he tried to convince powerful rulers to strengthen him by organizing a great crusade to liberate the [[Holy Land]] and the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] which belonged to him. That issue was discussed with the newly elected [[Pope]], after the death of the previous incumbent. For the same reason he travelled to the [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]]. During his visit in England the historical [[Banquet of the Five Kings]] took place.\n\nHe also visited some powerful cities like [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Prague]] and [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]], where he participated in a [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w|gathering of monarchs]] where guests of the Polish king were [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], King [[Louis I of Hungary]], King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]], [[Siemowit III of Masovia]], [[Bolko II of \u015awidnica]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk]], [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], [[Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania]], [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania]], [[Otto V, Duke of Bavaria]] and [[Louis VI the Roman]] . During the festivities in Krak\u00f3w King Peter achieved a feat of [[chivalry]] - he won the royal [[Tournament (medieval)]].  Also travelled on,  meeting several monarchs in [[London]], at the meeting of kings  of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Denmark]]. Everywhere he went he was accepted with honours and expensive presents, however he did not manage to persuade those monarchs to compete in a new Pan-European and Pan-Christian crusade in the [[Middle East]].\n\nMeanwhile, Cyprus was governed by Prince John, brother of Peter who remained as vice-King, and faced many problems, such as the epidemics of 1363, which killed many residents of Cyprus (one of them was Eschiva, Peter's sister). The Turks who heard that the Cypriot people were dying, began new raids and pillages on the island.  At the same time an episode between Cypriots and Genoese navies in Famagusta became a political issue and resulted in many fights and killings. Peter who happened to be in Genoa, negotiated and signed a treaty with the Genoese declaring what rights the Genoese colonists of Cyprus could have.\n\n==Alexandria Crusade==\n{{Main|Alexandrian Crusade}}\n\nHis father Hugh attempted to stop his desire to lead a new crusade and retake [[Jerusalem]], but upon his death Peter began his plans in earnest. He travelled through [[Europe]] attempting to garner support for his expeditions and on 11 October 1365 he led a mixed Cypriot and Western force of Crusaders (on 70 ships) to sack [[Alexandria]] (see [[Alexandrian Crusade]]). However, the European knights refused to follow him to attack [[Cairo]], and he was obliged to return to Cyprus, the only permanent result of his expedition being the enmity of the Sultan of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]].  Reprisals followed against Christian merchants in Syria and Egypt, and [[Pope Urban V]] advised Peter to make peace with the Sultan after unsuccessfully attempting to raise support among the European monarchs.\n\n==Attacks on Lebanon and Syria==\nPeter continued his crusade, this time aiming to attack [[Beirut]]. However his military operations ended after intervention of the Venetians willing to offer Peter high compensations for his military preparations, in order to not attack [[Damascus]]. He crusaded and raided [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in January 1366, before the terms of service of his European reinforcements could expire. He attempted to again raise a force in Europe in 1368, but was unsuccessful. Urban V again counseled peace, and Peter was compelled to join the Pope and the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in making a peace treaty with Egypt.\n\nThe commerce with Middle East, benefited Cyprus a lot, and because of Peter, Famagusta was one of the richest cities in the Mediterranean during his time. Also some financier friends of Peter were rich tradesmen from Famagusta, who could influence him. But the Sultan could no longer tolerate the insult of the capture of Alexandria and could not accept a friendly arrangement with Peter. So the attack against Tripoli was a clear message to the Sultan; either he agreed a peace and could begin to trade, or he would suffer continued attacks. The sultan wanted to create a movement of distraction, so he strengthened the emirs of Asia Minor and assembled an army to attack Korikos. Peter reinforced the garrison in Korikos with fresh troops and they repulsed the Turkish attack. In May 1367, the garrison in Antalya revolted because of the delayed payment of their wages. Peter immediately sailed there and imposed order, decapitating the ring leaders of the revolt.\n\nAfter all of this it was finally agreed to make peace with the Sultan of Cairo, although it proved impossible to be signed. So in 1367 there were other attacks on the Syrian coast, recapture and pillaging of Tripoli and other cities across the Syrian coast. As [[Leontios Makhairas]] writes, the reason that Peter could not keep Tripoli was because the city did not have walls. Among the other cities pillaged by Cypriots was [[Latakia]]. So the peace with the sultan was difficult.\n\n==Finances==\nFor all of his trips around [[Europe]] and of the wars, he needed a lot of money. Despite the high state income he needed to gain even more money, thus he gave to Cypriot serfs the right to buy their freedoms. By this rule, many Cypriots were benefited. Another source of income were his raids on the Islamic Levant.\n\n==Death==\nWhile in [[Rome]], he received an appeal from the barons of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]], nominating him as King and imploring him to deliver their country. He returned to Cyprus, but was rapidly plunged into domestic troubles. Queen Eleanor had been unfaithful during his long absences in Europe, and he retaliated by tyrannizing her favorite nobles, alienating even his brothers. On 17 January 1369 he was [[assassinated]] by three of his own knights, in his own bed at the Palace of La Cava, [[Nicosia]].\n\nDespite the harshness that brought a premature end to his life, his knight-errantry and crusading zeal led him to be regarded as the epitome of [[chivalry]]. He was buried in the church of St. Dominic's of Nicosia, the traditional burial place of the Kings of Cyprus. He was succeeded by his son [[Peter II of Cyprus|Peter II]].\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Then he went to other cities, some of whose emirs knelt to him, gave him presents, keys to castles and many other gifts. He returned with his trophies to Cyprus on 22 September 1361.\n\nThe emir of Antalya, [[Beylik of Teke|Teke]], after he lost his city, took a large army and after many attacks tried to occupy his city. After hard fighting, Cypriots managed to keep the city and also to siege the guard in the region of Myrres.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n==Tour of Europe==\nMeanwhile, King Peter still faced a serious problem of his recognition as holder of the throne of Cyprus, since his nephew Hugh, went to the Pope to ask for the throne with the support of the [[King of France]]. Since Peter had sent nobles as his representatives to the Pope to support him without result, he resolved to visit the Pope himself. At the end of October 1362, he left from [[Paphos]] to [[Rhodes]] and then to [[Venice]] and he was accepted there with honour. He went to [[Avignon]] and visited the Pope together with the claimant of the throne of Cyprus. Peter was recognised as King and Hugh agreed a high annual benefit, solving the problem.\n\nTaking advantage of his trip in Europe, he tried to convince powerful rulers to strengthen him by organizing a great crusade to liberate the [[Holy Land]] and the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] which belonged to him. That issue was discussed with the newly elected [[Pope]], after the death of the previous incumbent. For the same reason he travelled to the [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]]. During his visit in England the historical [[Banquet of the Five Kings]] took place.\n\nHe also visited some powerful cities like [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Prague]] and [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]], where he participated in a [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w|gathering of monarchs]] where guests of the Polish king were [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], King [[Louis I of Hungary]], King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]], [[Siemowit III of Masovia]], [[Bolko II of \u015awidnica]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk]], [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], [[Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania]], [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania]], [[Otto V, Duke of Bavaria]] and [[Louis VI the Roman]] . During the festivities in Krak\u00f3w King Peter achieved a feat of [[chivalry]] - he won the royal [[Tournament (medieval)]].  Also travelled on,  meeting several monarchs in [[London]], at the meeting of kings  of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Denmark]]. Everywhere he went he was accepted with honours and expensive presents, however he did not manage to persuade those monarchs to compete in a new Pan-European and Pan-Christian crusade in the [[Middle East]].\n\nMeanwhile, Cyprus was governed by Prince John, brother of Peter who remained as vice-King, and faced many problems, such as the epidemics of 1363, which killed many residents of Cyprus (one of them was Eschiva, Peter's sister). The Turks who heard that the Cypriot people were dying, began new raids and pillages on the island.  At the same time an episode between Cypriots and Genoese navies in Famagusta became a political issue and resulted in many fights and killings. Peter who happened to be in Genoa, negotiated and signed a treaty with the Genoese declaring what rights the Genoese colonists of Cyprus could have.\n\n==Alexandria Crusade==\n{{Main|Alexandrian Crusade}}\n\nHis father Hugh attempted to stop his desire to lead a new crusade and retake [[Jerusalem]], but upon his death Peter began his plans in earnest. He travelled through [[Europe]] attempting to garner support for his expeditions and on 11 October 1365 he led a mixed Cypriot and Western force of Crusaders (on 70 ships) to sack [[Alexandria]] (see [[Alexandrian Crusade]]). However, the European knights refused to follow him to attack [[Cairo]], and he was obliged to return to Cyprus, the only permanent result of his expedition being the enmity of the Sultan of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]].  Reprisals followed against Christian merchants in Syria and Egypt, and [[Pope Urban V]] advised Peter to make peace with the Sultan after unsuccessfully attempting to raise support among the European monarchs.\n\n==Attacks on Lebanon and Syria==\nPeter continued his crusade, this time aiming to attack [[Beirut]]. However his military operations ended after intervention of the Venetians willing to offer Peter high compensations for his military preparations, in order to not attack [[Damascus]]. He crusaded and raided [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in January 1366, before the terms of service of his European reinforcements could expire. He attempted to again raise a force in Europe in 1368, but was unsuccessful. Urban V again counseled peace, and Peter was compelled to join the Pope and the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in making a peace treaty with Egypt.\n\nThe commerce with Middle East, benefited Cyprus a lot, and because of Peter, Famagusta was one of the richest cities in the Mediterranean during his time. Also some financier friends of Peter were rich tradesmen from Famagusta, who could influence him. But the Sultan could no longer tolerate the insult of the capture of Alexandria and could not accept a friendly arrangement with Peter. So the attack against Tripoli was a clear message to the Sultan; either he agreed a peace and could begin to trade, or he would suffer continued attacks. The sultan wanted to create a movement of distraction, so he strengthened the emirs of Asia Minor and assembled an army to attack Korikos. Peter reinforced the garrison in Korikos with fresh troops and they repulsed the Turkish attack. In May 1367, the garrison in Antalya revolted because of the delayed payment of their wages. Peter immediately sailed there and imposed order, decapitating the ring leaders of the revolt.\n\nAfter all of this it was finally agreed to make peace with the Sultan of Cairo, although it proved impossible to be signed. So in 1367 there were other attacks on the Syrian coast, recapture and pillaging of Tripoli and other cities across the Syrian coast. As [[Leontios Makhairas]] writes, the reason that Peter could not keep Tripoli was because the city did not have walls. Among the other cities pillaged by Cypriots was [[Latakia]]. So the peace with the sultan was difficult.\n\n==Finances==\nFor all of his trips around [[Europe]] and of the wars, he needed a lot of money. Despite the high state income he needed to gain even more money, thus he gave to Cypriot serfs the right to buy their freedoms. By this rule, many Cypriots were benefited. Another source of income were his raids on the Islamic Levant.\n\n==Death==\nWhile in [[Rome]], he received an appeal from the barons of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]], nominating him as King and imploring him to deliver their country. He returned to Cyprus, but was rapidly plunged into domestic troubles. Queen Eleanor had been unfaithful during his long absences in Europe, and he retaliated by tyrannizing her favorite nobles, alienating even his brothers. On 17 January 1369 he was [[assassinated]] by three of his own knights, in his own bed at the Palace of La Cava, [[Nicosia]].\n\nDespite the harshness that brought a premature end to his life, his knight-errantry and crusading zeal led him to be regarded as the epitome of [[chivalry]]. He was buried in the church of St. Dominic's of Nicosia, the traditional burial place of the Kings of Cyprus. He was succeeded by his son [[Peter II of Cyprus|Peter II]].\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
