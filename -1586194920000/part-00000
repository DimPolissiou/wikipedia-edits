In 1865, after the [[Confederate States of America]] were defeated in the [[American Civil War]], [[General William Tecumseh Sherman]] issued [[Special Field Orders, No. 15]] to both \"assure the harmony of action in the area of operations\"<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA252324&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf \"Harmony of Action\" \u2013 Sherman as an Army Group Commander]</ref> and to solve problems caused by the masses of freed slaves, a temporary plan granting each freed family [[Forty acres and a mule|forty acres of tillable land]] in the sea islands and around Charleston, South Carolina for the exclusive use of black people who had been enslaved. The army also had a number of unneeded [[mule]]s which were given to settlers. Around 40,000 freed slaves were settled on 400,000 acres (1,600&nbsp;km\u00b2) in Georgia and South Carolina. However, President [[Andrew Johnson]] reversed the order after [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] was assassinated, the land was returned to its previous owners, and the blacks were forced to leave. In 1867, [[Thaddeus Stevens]] sponsored a bill for the redistribution of land to African Americans, but it was not passed.\n\n[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] came to an end in 1877 without the issue of reparations having been addressed. Thereafter, a deliberate movement of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and oppression arose in southern states. [[Jim Crow laws]] passed in some southeastern states to reinforce the existing inequality that slavery had produced. In addition white extremist organizations such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] engaged in a massive campaign of terrorism throughout the Southeast in order to keep African Americans in their prescribed social place. For decades this assumed inequality and injustice was ruled on in court decisions and debated in public discourse.\n\nIn one anomalous case, a former slave named [[Henrietta Wood]] successfully sued for compensation after having been kidnapped from the [[Slave states and free states|free state]] of [[Ohio]] and sold into slavery in [[Mississippi]]. After the American Civil War, she was freed and returned to [[Cincinnati]], where she won her case in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]] in 1878, receiving $2,500 in damages. Though the verdict was a national news story, it did not prompt any trend toward additional similar cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/henrietta-wood-sued-reparations-won-180972845/|title=In 1870, Henrietta Wood Sued for Reparations&nbsp;\u2013 and Won|last=McDaniel|first=W.

Various estimates have been given if such payments were to be made. ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' estimated that the total of reparations due was about \"$97 trillion, based on 222,505,049 hours of forced labor between 1619 and 1865, regardless the United States wasn't a recognized independent country until after the Revolutionary War in 1787, compounded at 6% interest through 1993\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nlpc.org/wp-content/uploads/files/Reparationsbook.pdf |title=The Case Against Slave Reparations |first1=Peter |last1=Flaherty |first2=John |last2=Carlisle |date=October 2004 |publisher=[[National Legal and Policy Center]] |page=1 |accessdate=December 20, 2018 }}</ref> Should all or part of this amount be paid to the descendants of slaves in the United States, the current U.S. government would only pay a fraction of that cost, since it has been in existence only since 1789.\n\nThe Rev. M.J. Divine, better known as [[Father Divine]], was one of the earliest leaders to argue clearly for \"retroactive compensation\" and the message was spread via International Peace Mission publications. On July 28, 1951, Father Divine issued a \"peace stamp\" bearing the text: \"Peace! All nations and peoples who have suppressed and oppressed the under-privileged, they will be obliged to pay the African slaves and their descendants for all uncompensated servitude and for all unjust compensation, whereby they have been unjustly deprived of compensation on the account of previous condition of servitude and the present condition of servitude.

On March 8, 2000, [[Reuters]] News Service reported that Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, a law school graduate, initiated a one-woman campaign making a historic demand for [[restitution]] and apologies from modern companies that played a direct role in enslaving Africans. [[Aetna]] Inc. was her first target because of their practice of writing life insurance policies on the lives of enslaved Africans with slave owners as the beneficiaries. In response to Farmer-Paellmann's demand, Aetna Inc. issued a public apology, and the \"corporate restitution movement\" was born.{{Nonspecific|date=December 2008}}\n\nBy 2002, nine lawsuits were filed around the country coordinated by Farmer-Paellmann and the Restitution Study Group\u2014a New York non-profit. The litigation included 20 plaintiffs, demanding restitution from 20 companies from the banking, insurance, textile, railroad, and tobacco industries. The cases were consolidated under 28 U.S.C. 1407<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|28|1407}}</ref> to [[Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation|multidistrict litigation]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]]. The district court dismissed the lawsuits [[Prejudice (law)|''with'' prejudice]], and the claimants appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]].\n\nOn December 13, 2006, that court, in an opinion written by Judge [[Richard Posner]], modified the district court's judgment to be a dismissal ''without'' prejudice, affirmed the majority of the district court's judgment, and reversed the portion of the district court's judgment dismissing the plaintiffs' [[consumer protection]] claims, [[Remand (court procedure)|remanding]] the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.<ref>http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/Z100WR3H.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref> Thus, the plaintiffs may bring the lawsuit again, but must clear considerable [[Civil procedure|procedural]] and substantive hurdles first:\n<blockquote>If one or more of the defendants violated a state law by transporting slaves in 1850, and the plaintiffs can establish standing to sue, prove the violation despite its antiquity, establish that the law was intended to provide a remedy (either directly or by providing the basis for a common law action for conspiracy, conversion, or restitution) to lawfully enslaved persons or their descendants, identify their ancestors, quantify damages incurred, and persuade the court to toll the statute of limitations, there would be no further obstacle to the grant of relief.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=In re African-American Slave Descendants Litig.|vol=471|reporter=F.3d|opinion=754|pinpoint=759|court=7th Cir.|year=2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn October 2000, California passed the Slavery Era Disclosure Law requiring insurance companies doing business there to report on their role in slavery. The disclosure legislation, introduced by Senator [[Tom Hayden]], is the prototype for similar laws passed in 12 states around the United States.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nThe [[NAACP]] has called for more of such legislation at local and corporate levels. It quotes Dennis C. Hayes, [[CEO]] of the NAACP, as saying, \"Absolutely, we will be pursuing reparations from companies that have historical ties to slavery and engaging all parties to come to the table.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=July 12, 2005|url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20050712-120944-7745r.htm|title=NAACP to target private business|newspaper=The Washington Times |access-date=November 15, 2017}}</ref> [[Brown University]], whose namesake family was involved in the slave trade, has also established a committee to explore the issue of reparations.

No compensation was given to the descendants of affected individuals though.\n\n* The [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] transferred land, federal money, and a portion of oil revenues to native Alaskans.\n* The [[Apology Resolution]] of 1993 apologized for the overthrow of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], but gave no compensation.\n\nU.S. state governments have made reparations in some specific circumstances:\n* Virginia established a compensation fund for victims of involuntary sterilization in 2015.<ref>[http://dbhds.virginia.gov/developmental-services/victimsofeugenics Victims of Eugenics Sterilization Compensation Program]</ref>\n\nOther countries have also opted to pay reparations for past grievances, such as:\n* Reparations for the [[Holocaust]], including the [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany]] and various programs under the [[Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany]].\n\n==Arguments against reparations==\n\n===Relocation of injustice===\nThe principal argument against reparations is that their cost would not be imposed upon the perpetrators of slavery, nor confined to those who can be shown to be the specific indirect beneficiaries of slavery, but would simply be indiscriminately borne by taxpayers ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. Those making this argument often add that the descendants of white [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and soldiers in the [[Union Army]] might be taxed to fund reparations despite the sacrifices their [[ancestors]] already made to end slavery.\n\nIn the case of Public Lands, European colonizers forcibly relocated<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Indian.html|title=Indian Removal Act: Primary Documents in American History |publisher=Virtual Programs & Services, Library of Congress |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> many Southeastern [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.

Curto, have made important contributions to the global understanding of the African side of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. By arguing that African merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves, many historians argue for African agency: that Africans were not just enslaved by whites, because some Africans were willing participants in the slave trade.

Washington]] wrote,\n\n:I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the Southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race. No one section of our country was wholly responsible for its introduction ... Having once got its tentacles fastened on to the economic and social life of the Republic, it was no easy matter for the country to relieve itself of the institution. Then, when we rid ourselves of prejudice, or racial feeling, and look facts in the face, we must acknowledge that, notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of slavery, the ten million Negroes inhabiting this country, who themselves or whose ancestors went through the school of American slavery, are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe. ... This I say, not to justify slavery\u2014on the other hand, I condemn it as an institution, as we all know that in America it was established for selfish and financial reasons, and not from a missionary motive\u2014but to call attention to a fact, and to show how [[Divine Providence|Providence]] so often uses men and institutions to accomplish a purpose. When persons ask me in these days how, in the midst of what sometimes seem hopelessly discouraging conditions, I can have such faith in the future of my race in this country, I remind them of the wilderness through which and out of which, a good Providence has already led us.<ref>[http://www.alcyone.com/max/lit/slavery/i.html \"Chapter 1: A slave among slaves\", ''Up From Slavery''.]</ref>\n\n[[Conservative]] commentator [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]] writes,\n\n:The claim for reparations is premised on the false assumption that only whites have benefited from slavery. If slave labor created wealth for Americans, then obviously it has created wealth for black Americans as well, including the descendants of slaves. The [[GNP]] of black America is so large that it makes the African-American community the 10th most prosperous \"nation\" in the world. American blacks on average enjoy [[per capita income]]s in the range of twenty to fifty times that of blacks living in any of the African nations from which they were taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=1153|archive-url=https://archive.today/20020720154151/http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=1153|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 20, 2002|title=Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Blacks is a Bad Idea for Blacks \u2013 and Racist Too|website=www.frontpagemag.com|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Legal argument against reparations===\nMany legal experts point to the fact that slavery was not illegal in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/amistad/slavery.html|title=Amistad case \u2013 The law of slavery, circa 1841|website=www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> prior to the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (ratified in 1865). Thus, there is no legal foundation for compensating the descendants of slaves for the crime against their ancestors when, in strictly legal terms, no crime was committed. Chattel slavery is now considered to be highly immoral, though it was perfectly legal at the time. \n\nSome areas of the South had communities of freedman, such as existed in Savannah, Charleston and New Orleans, while in the North, for example, former slaves lived as freedman both before and after the creation of the United States in 1788. For example, in 1667 Dutch colonists freed some of their slaves and gave them property in what is now Manhattan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/310_grant.html|title=Land Grant |series=PBS: History Detectives |publisher=PBS |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemaninstitute.com/BCF%20Manhattanphoto.htm|title=Black History Matters \u2013 Manhattan Land Grant (1667) |publisher=Freeman Institute |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> The descendants of Groote and Christina Manuell\u2014two of those freed slaves\u2014can trace their family's history as freedman back to the child of Groote and Christina, Nicolas Manuell, whom they consider their family's first freeborn African American. In 1712, the British, then in control of New York, prohibited blacks from inheriting land, effectively ending property ownership for this family. While this is only one example out of thousands of enslaved persons, it does mean that not all slavery reparations can be determined by racial self-identification alone; reparations would have to include a determination of the free or slave status of one's African-American ancestors, as well as when and by whom they were enslaved and denied rights such as property ownership. Because of slavery, the original African heritage has been blended with the American experience, the same as it has been for generations of immigrants from other countries. For this reason, determining a \"fair share\" of reparations would be an impossible task.\n\nAnother legal argument against reparations for slavery from a legal standpoint (as opposed to a moral standpoint) is that the statute of limitations for filing lawsuits has long since passed. Thus, courts are prohibited from granting relief. This has been used effectively in several suits, including \"In re African American Slave Descendants\", which dismissed a high-profile suit against a number of businesses with ties to slavery.<ref>{{cite web |title=In re: African-American Slave Descents Ligation |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1446515.html |website=Case Law |accessdate=July 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Additional arguments and opinions===\nA suggested anti-reparations argument is that reparations payments based on race alone could be perceived by nearly everyone as an injustice, embittering many, and inevitably setting back race relations. In this view, apologetic feelings some whites may hold because of slavery and past [[civil rights]] injustices would, to a significant extent, be replaced by anger.\n\nThe [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], among other groups and individuals, has suggested that reparations would make racism worse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Greenhut |first1=Steven |title=Reparations Are More Likely to Divide the Nation Than Heal It |url=https://reason.com/2019/04/05/reparations-likely-to-divide-not-heal/ |website=Reason|date=2019-04-05 }}</ref>\n\nOne publication against reparations is [[David Horowitz]], ''Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery'' (2002).

In 1865, after the [[Confederate States of America]] were defeated in the [[American Civil War]], [[General William Tecumseh Sherman]] issued [[Special Field Orders, No. 15]] to both \"assure the harmony of action in the area of operations\"<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA252324&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf \"Harmony of Action\" \u2013 Sherman as an Army Group Commander]</ref> and to solve problems caused by the masses of freed slaves, a temporary plan granting each freed family [[Forty acres and a mule|forty acres of tillable land]] in the sea islands and around Charleston, South Carolina for the exclusive use of black people who had been enslaved. The army also had a number of unneeded [[mule]]s which were given to settlers. Around 40,000 freed slaves were settled on 400,000 acres (1,600&nbsp;km\u00b2) in Georgia and South Carolina. However, President [[Andrew Johnson]] reversed the order after [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] was assassinated, the land was returned to its previous owners, and the blacks were forced to leave. In 1867, [[Thaddeus Stevens]] sponsored a bill for the redistribution of land to African Americans, but it was not passed.\n\n[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] came to an end in 1877 without the issue of reparations having been addressed. Thereafter, a deliberate movement of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and oppression arose in southern states. [[Jim Crow laws]] passed in some southeastern states to reinforce the existing inequality that slavery had produced. In addition white extremist organizations such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] engaged in a massive campaign of terrorism throughout the Southeast in order to keep African Americans in their prescribed social place. For decades this assumed inequality and injustice was ruled on in court decisions and debated in public discourse.\n\nIn one anomalous case, a former slave named [[Henrietta Wood]] successfully sued for compensation after having been kidnapped from the [[Slave states and free states|free state]] of [[Ohio]] and sold into slavery in [[Mississippi]]. After the American Civil War, she was freed and returned to [[Cincinnati]], where she won her case in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]] in 1878, receiving $2,500 in damages. Though the verdict was a national news story, it did not prompt any trend toward additional similar cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/henrietta-wood-sued-reparations-won-180972845/|title=In 1870, Henrietta Wood Sued for Reparations&nbsp;\u2013 and Won|last=McDaniel|first=W.

M.J. Divine, better known as [[Father Divine]], was one of the earliest leaders to argue clearly for \"retroactive compensation\" and the message was spread via International Peace Mission publications. On July 28, 1951, Father Divine issued a \"peace stamp\" bearing the text: \"Peace! All nations and peoples who have suppressed and oppressed the under-privileged, they will be obliged to pay the African slaves and their descendants for all uncompensated servitude and for all unjust compensation, whereby they have been unjustly deprived of compensation on the account of previous condition of servitude and the present condition of servitude.

On March 8, 2000, [[Reuters]] News Service reported that Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, a law school graduate, initiated a one-woman campaign making a historic demand for [[restitution]] and apologies from modern companies that played a direct role in enslaving Africans. [[Aetna]] Inc. was her first target because of their practice of writing life insurance policies on the lives of enslaved Africans with slave owners as the beneficiaries. In response to Farmer-Paellmann's demand, Aetna Inc. issued a public apology, and the \"corporate restitution movement\" was born.{{Nonspecific|date=December 2008}}\n\nBy 2002, nine lawsuits were filed around the country coordinated by Farmer-Paellmann and the Restitution Study Group\u2014a New York non-profit.

No compensation was given to the descendants of affected individuals though.\n\n* The [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] transferred land, federal money, and a portion of oil revenues to native Alaskans.\n* The [[Apology Resolution]] of 1993 apologized for the overthrow of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], but gave no compensation.\n\nU.S. state governments have made reparations in some specific circumstances:\n* Virginia established a compensation fund for victims of involuntary sterilization in 2015.<ref>[http://dbhds.virginia.gov/developmental-services/victimsofeugenics Victims of Eugenics Sterilization Compensation Program]</ref>\n\nOther countries have also opted to pay reparations for past grievances, such as:\n* Reparations for the [[Holocaust]], including the [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany]] and various programs under the [[Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany]].\n\n==Arguments against reparations==\n\n===Relocation of injustice===\nThe principal argument against reparations is that their cost would not be imposed upon the perpetrators of slavery, nor confined to those who can be shown to be the specific indirect beneficiaries of slavery, but would simply be indiscriminately borne by taxpayers ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. Those making this argument often add that the descendants of white [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and soldiers in the [[Union Army]] might be taxed to fund reparations despite the sacrifices their [[ancestors]] already made to end slavery.\n\nIn the case of Public Lands, European colonizers forcibly relocated<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Indian.html|title=Indian Removal Act: Primary Documents in American History |publisher=Virtual Programs & Services, Library of Congress |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> many Southeastern [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. One argument against reparations is that in assigning public lands to African-Americans for the enslavement of their ancestors, a greater and further wrong would be committed against the Southeastern Native Americans<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html |title=Indian removal |publisher=PBS |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> who have ancestral claims and treaty rights to that same land.{{Nonspecific|date=December 2008}}\n\nIn addition, several historians, such as Jo\u00e3o C. Curto, have made important contributions to the global understanding of the African side of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. By arguing that African merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves, many historians argue for African agency: that Africans were not just enslaved by whites, because some Africans were willing participants in the slave trade. This implies a shared responsibility.<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=13661080113274 Jo\u00e3o C.

Washington]] wrote,\n\n:I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the Southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race. No one section of our country was wholly responsible for its introduction ... Having once got its tentacles fastened on to the economic and social life of the Republic, it was no easy matter for the country to relieve itself of the institution. Then, when we rid ourselves of prejudice, or racial feeling, and look facts in the face, we must acknowledge that, notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of slavery, the ten million Negroes inhabiting this country, who themselves or whose ancestors went through the school of American slavery, are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe. ... This I say, not to justify slavery\u2014on the other hand, I condemn it as an institution, as we all know that in America it was established for selfish and financial reasons, and not from a missionary motive\u2014but to call attention to a fact, and to show how [[Divine Providence|Providence]] so often uses men and institutions to accomplish a purpose. When persons ask me in these days how, in the midst of what sometimes seem hopelessly discouraging conditions, I can have such faith in the future of my race in this country, I remind them of the wilderness through which and out of which, a good Providence has already led us.<ref>[http://www.alcyone.com/max/lit/slavery/i.html \"Chapter 1: A slave among slaves\", ''Up From Slavery''.]</ref>\n\n[[Conservative]] commentator [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]] writes,\n\n:The claim for reparations is premised on the false assumption that only whites have benefited from slavery. If slave labor created wealth for Americans, then obviously it has created wealth for black Americans as well, including the descendants of slaves. The [[GNP]] of black America is so large that it makes the African-American community the 10th most prosperous \"nation\" in the world. American blacks on average enjoy [[per capita income]]s in the range of twenty to fifty times that of blacks living in any of the African nations from which they were taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=1153|archive-url=https://archive.today/20020720154151/http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=1153|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 20, 2002|title=Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Blacks is a Bad Idea for Blacks \u2013 and Racist Too|website=www.frontpagemag.com|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Legal argument against reparations===\nMany legal experts point to the fact that slavery was not illegal in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/amistad/slavery.html|title=Amistad case \u2013 The law of slavery, circa 1841|website=www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> prior to the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (ratified in 1865). Thus, there is no legal foundation for compensating the descendants of slaves for the crime against their ancestors when, in strictly legal terms, no crime was committed. Chattel slavery is now considered to be highly immoral, though it was perfectly legal at the time. \n\nSome areas of the South had communities of freedman, such as existed in Savannah, Charleston and New Orleans, while in the North, for example, former slaves lived as freedman both before and after the creation of the United States in 1788. For example, in 1667 Dutch colonists freed some of their slaves and gave them property in what is now Manhattan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/310_grant.html|title=Land Grant |series=PBS: History Detectives |publisher=PBS |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemaninstitute.com/BCF%20Manhattanphoto.htm|title=Black History Matters \u2013 Manhattan Land Grant (1667) |publisher=Freeman Institute |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> The descendants of Groote and Christina Manuell\u2014two of those freed slaves\u2014can trace their family's history as freedman back to the child of Groote and Christina, Nicolas Manuell, whom they consider their family's first freeborn African American. In 1712, the British, then in control of New York, prohibited blacks from inheriting land, effectively ending property ownership for this family. While this is only one example out of thousands of enslaved persons, it does mean that not all slavery reparations can be determined by racial self-identification alone; reparations would have to include a determination of the free or slave status of one's African-American ancestors, as well as when and by whom they were enslaved and denied rights such as property ownership. Because of slavery, the original African heritage has been blended with the American experience, the same as it has been for generations of immigrants from other countries. For this reason, determining a \"fair share\" of reparations would be an impossible task.\n\nAnother legal argument against reparations for slavery from a legal standpoint (as opposed to a moral standpoint) is that the statute of limitations for filing lawsuits has long since passed. Thus, courts are prohibited from granting relief. This has been used effectively in several suits, including \"In re African American Slave Descendants\", which dismissed a high-profile suit against a number of businesses with ties to slavery.<ref>{{cite web |title=In re: African-American Slave Descents Ligation |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1446515.html |website=Case Law |accessdate=July 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Additional arguments and opinions===\nA suggested anti-reparations argument is that reparations payments based on race alone could be perceived by nearly everyone as an injustice, embittering many, and inevitably setting back race relations. In this view, apologetic feelings some whites may hold because of slavery and past [[civil rights]] injustices would, to a significant extent, be replaced by anger.\n\nThe [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], among other groups and individuals, has suggested that reparations would make racism worse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Greenhut |first1=Steven |title=Reparations Are More Likely to Divide the Nation Than Heal It |url=https://reason.com/2019/04/05/reparations-likely-to-divide-not-heal/ |website=Reason|date=2019-04-05 }}</ref>\n\nOne publication against reparations is [[David Horowitz]], ''Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery'' (2002).

[[John Cunliffe (author)|John Cunliffe]] wrote the original treatment and scripts, and it was directed by animator [[Ivor Wood]], who also worked on ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]'', [[Paddington (1975 TV series)|Paddington]], and ''[[The Herbs]]''. Following the success of the first season, and that of several TV specials in between, a second season of 13 episodes was produced by the same crew in 1996. Here, Pat had a family for the first time. A new version of the series has been produced by [[Cosgrove Hall]] from September 2004, which expanded on many aspects of the original series.  For the first time in the programme's history, ''Postman Pat'' was no longer sponsored by the [[Royal Mail]], which previously had used the show as a marketing vehicle for them. This link was dropped in November 2000, with the Royal Mail spokesman saying the character no longer fitted in with the company's \"corporate image.\" <ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1031114.stm \"Postman Pat gets the Sack\"], 19 Nov 2000.</ref>\n\n==Episode list==\nThe episode number follows the first broadcast order.\n\n===1981 TV Series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! width=\"8%\" | Episode #\n! width=\"8%\" | Series #\n! width=\"23%\" | Episode Title\n! width=\"18%\" | Original airdate\n|-\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=Postman Pat's Finding Day\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|16|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat calls to the Post Office and today most of the post is for Katy and Tom because it is their birthday.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Postman Pat and the Magpie Hen\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|23|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat stops for a picnic lunch near Thompson Ground halfway through his round and a hen steals his sandwich and keys.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Postman Pat's Secret Birthday\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|30|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat always thought he had managed to keep the date of his birthday to himself.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=4\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=Pat's Rainy Day\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|10|07|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=It was a heavy rainy day in Greendale.

Linda was introduced by new executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] as part of the Carter family. The introduction of Dyer and Bright was part of a large cast shake-up planned by new executive producer Treadwell-Collins in an attempt to improve ratings. Bright previously auditioned for the role of [[Tanya Branning]] in 2006, but the part was given to [[Jo Joyner]].<ref name=\"Bright auditioned for Tanya Branning role\">{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/eastenders-kellie-bright-made-albert-2919481|title=EastEnders' Kellie Bright made her Albert Square debut more than 25 years ago|last=Hodgson|first=Claire|date=13 December 2013|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref> Linda became landlady of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] and moved there with her family from her mother's pub in Watford.

Linda departed the series on 25 December 2016 although she made two separate guest appearances on 16 March 2017 and 30 June 2017. She returned full-time on 7 August 2017.\n\nLinda's storylines include her feud with [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), coming to terms with her youngest son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny]] ([[Sam Strike]]/[[Ted Reilly]]) being [[Homosexuality|gay]], being [[rape]]d by Mick's brother [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) and coping in the aftermath, giving birth to a premature baby after falling down the stairs, suffering from [[bulimia nervosa]], being in denial of the possibility that her baby son [[Ollie Carter]] could have brain damage, leaving to care for her mother [[Elaine Peacock]] ([[Maria Friedman]]) following her [[stroke]], discovering that Mick kissed their daughter-in-law [[Whitney Dean|Whitney Carter]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) and revealing that she has secretly battled [[cervical cancer]] before being involved in an ambulance crash when Johnny is shot, [[perverting the course of justice]] when [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) is shot leading to her being falsely accused of [[attempted murder]], coping with Ollie's diagnosis of [[autism]], battling with [[alcoholism]], shooting [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]) to pretend that he has been murdered by [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) and splitting with Mick as a result of her alcoholism.\n\n==Storylines==\nLinda first appears when her partner [[Mick Carter]]'s ([[Danny Dyer]]) sisters, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), visit her mother [[Elaine Peacock]]'s ([[Maria Friedman]]) pub in [[Watford]], where Linda and her family are living. They intend to ask Mick for a loan but Linda rejects them as Mick is not around. As revenge, Tina steals the money from a bingo jar but Shirley returns it, proving her honesty to Mick, and also recommends [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] as a potential pub of their own on [[Albert Square]] in [[Walford]], where Shirley lives. Mick purchases the pub from [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), who is at first unaware of his identity, and Mick, Linda, their son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]) and their [[bulldog]], [[Lady Di (EastEnders)|Lady Di]] (Hot Lips), move in and start trading. Linda continues to clash with Shirley, who moves in with them, and she befriends [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) over their mutual dislike of Shirley. Linda and Mick receive an invite to their daughter [[Nancy Carter]]'s ([[Maddy Hill]]) wedding to [[Wayne Ladlow]] ([[Malachi Kirby]]), a troublemaker, but they disapprove so Mick forcibly removes her from the wedding service. In the following argument, Nancy reveals that Johnny is gay, and has been hiding his sexuality in fear of how his parents will react. Linda refuses to accept that he is gay and encourages him to date [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), who shows an interest in him. Mick, along with Shirley and Tina, visit their estranged father [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) for money, and reunite with him in the process. He moves into the pub when he breaks his ankle and becomes immobile, and, despite initially clashing with him, Linda warms to having him around.\n\nLinda's friendship with Sharon comes under strain when Sharon reveals plans to open a new bar in Walford, named \"The Albert\". Realising it will be in direct competition to The Queen Vic, she plots to get inside knowledge about the bar, convincing Johnny to take a job there. However, Johnny likes the job and tells her that he does not want to feed information to her. Linda and Mick's eldest son, [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), returns from Afghanistan, where he has been serving in the army. He is grieving for a comrade he has lost, and Linda is a comfort and support to him. Shirley's estranged son [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) comes to Walford, and although he continues to share a troubled relationship with his mother, he is welcomed by Mick and Linda into the family. Dean develops feelings for Linda, which she is at first unaware of, but discovers when he gropes her buttocks at a photoshoot for his new salon. She warns him that it is inappropriate but does not tell Mick out of fear of angering him.\n\nTina encourages Johnny to embrace his sexuality, inviting him to [[gay pride]] in London. Linda continues to be uncomfortable with this, and attempts to sabotage his plans by making him work. However, he realises what she is doing and in the ensuing argument he leaves home. Stan takes Linda to his old flat where Johnny is staying, and, after some tough love from Stan about her past, she apologises to Johnny and drops him off at gay pride, giving him her blessing. The following week, Linda has a party for her birthday, and Lee returns permanently from Afghanistan in time for the celebrations. After the party, Linda and Mick have a heart to heart, and he asks her to marry him properly, but she declines, determined to keep up the pretence to their children that they are already married. This conversation is overheard by Dean, who agrees to keep quiet.\n\nLinda supports Mick when he participates in a swimming gala for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]), despite being fearful of water. Mick conquers his fears, but on the way home he is arrested for [[soliciting]] a [[prostitute]]. He tells Linda that the police are making a mistake as it was in fact his friend [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), that was speaking with the prostitute; he pulled over merely to see what was going on. Stan's girlfriend, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) overhears the conversation and accompanies Linda to Mick's hearing, and Linda is devastated when he pleads guilty to protect Ian, who is going through a tough time following the death of his daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Linda agrees to keep quiet, but Cora has a change of heart about supporting Linda and reveals Mick's offence to the whole pub, running his name through the mud. Unable to cope with the negative social stigma surrounding her family, Linda demands that Mick reveals the truth, but he refuses, wanting to keep his word to Ian. However, the truth is revealed when the prostitute, who is revealed to be Cora's estranged daughter [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]), bumps into Ian's partner [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and reveals the truth. Denise visits Linda, struggling with the revelation, and Linda lies that she only just found out about Ian's actions. Ian however reveals the truth to Denise, who accuses Linda of attention seeking. One evening, Dean kisses Linda but she slaps him. Distraught over the upset that Mick's actions have brought her family, Linda leaves Walford to stay with Elaine in Watford. She returns, reconciling with Mick, before Sharon and Phil's wedding. When Sharon suggests that Dean's advances towards Linda were encouraged, both drunk, they have a bitter row in the pub. Then Sharon tells Nancy about the kiss, so Nancy accuses Dean and Linda of having an affair.\n\nShirley flees from Walford after the wedding, leaving Dean upset. Mick asks Linda to comfort him, but, misunderstanding her reassurance and very drunk, Dean rapes her. She becomes very withdrawn, telling nobody and refusing to be intimate with Mick. Trying to get to the bottom of what is going on, he calls Linda's mother, Elaine, asking her to visit The Vic to help him understand her behaviour. Elaine makes some progress before leaving again. Mick theorises that Linda is pregnant when she vomits at the smell of lavender bath soap, and she, is horrified to discover he is correct, when she takes a test. She lies to Mick about the result and plans to have an abortion, but Mick finds out and she agrees to keep the baby. She is disturbed when Dean finds out, and tries to hang onto the belief that the baby is Mick's. [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) bumps into Linda who asks her about her relationship with Dean, Linda nearly admits that Dean raped her however she is stopped from doing so when they are interrupted by Dean. However, Stacey grows suspicious, and when Linda unexpectedly gets scared when Dean is around, Stacey surmises that Dean raped her and confronts Linda. When Stacey depicts how she felt after her rape, Linda accepts that he did. Johnny announces he is leaving Walford to travel with Gianluca, although initially upset, Linda decides to support him.\n\nLinda, feeling increasingly threatened by Dean, turns down Mick's Christmas Day proposal before stunning Mick by revealing the rape. Later that day he confronts Dean who lies, saying that he and Linda were having an affair. Mick attacks Dean forcing Shirley's revelation\u2014Dean is his brother. Linda eavesdrops while Mick, Tina, Shirley, Babe and Stan argue, only to hear Mick deny that Dean is part of the family. Mick tells them that Dean raped Linda, but she overhears. Without saying anything, Linda leaves the pub. Mick leaves messages on her voicemail to ask her to come home and Elaine returns her to the pub. When she attempts to find solace in Sharon's home, Mick joins her, and she says they should not let what happened get in the way of their relationship. They are about to return to the pub when Mick has second thoughts and he decides to take Linda away for a break.  When they return a few weeks later, they find Shirley helping to run the pub so Mick asks her to leave. When Mick accompanies her to the police station, Linda reports Dean for rape. She then fills Nancy and Lee in on recent events, having already told Elaine and Sharon. Dean is arrested by the police but released after questioning and accuses Linda of lying. Linda proposes to Mick who accepts. The next day, Nancy confesses to her that Mick choked Dean unconscious in the cellar and is being secretive about what happened. Elaine returns for Mick and Linda's engagement party, while Linda confronts Mick, who assures her that he did not kill Dean, although, later, Nancy tries to tell Shirley something about Dean, but collapses on the ground before she can do so. After Elaine returns for Linda's five-month scan the day after, Linda confesses to her her fears that the baby may not be Mick's. Linda organises a romantic picnic as a fresh start for her and Mick. Linda is devastated to learn that Dean will not be charged due to lack of evidence. Linda pleads with Dean to admit he raped her but just as she seems to be making leeway, Mick interrupts.\n\nLinda falls down the stairs, causing her to go into premature labour. She gives birth to a healthy son, [[Ollie Carter]] (Jack Tilley). Linda confronts a delusional Dean when he insists on meeting the baby, believing that Ollie is his son. Mick discovers that he, Linda and Ollie share the same blood type, but Dean does not, meaning Dean cannot be the father. Linda and Mick agree they should marry soon. On her return home with Mick and Ollie, Linda snubs an apologetic Dean's attempt to shake her hand. When Linda and Nancy return from holiday, Linda learns that Lee has been suffering from depression, and she encourages him to take his medication. Elaine moves in temporarily, which initially causes consternation when she interferes with running the pub. Mick arranges for Linda to go to a wedding fair in Birmingham, and when she returns, she discovers that Mick and Shirley have been seeing each other in secret, which upsets Linda. After making herself sick one day, she tells Mick she cannot get married. Eventually, she tells him she hates herself and, because of Dean, she feels the same way she did when she suffered from [[bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] after her father died, and has been making herself sick again. However, she agrees to marry Mick with his support. When Dean attempts to rape his fianc\u00e9e [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), Linda encourages her to report this to the police. During a heated exchange with Linda where Shirley is present, Dean admits that he raped Linda. Stunned, Linda tells Mick, while Dean goes into hiding, where he sees one of Mick and Linda's wedding invites. On New Year's Day 2016, Dean goes to the wedding venue and attempts to drown Shirley, jumping into the lake with her. Mick fights with Dean in the lake and he is knocked unconscious. Mick rescues him and resuscitates him, and he is arrested for the attempted rape of Roxy.  Afterwards, Linda and Mick marry. When they return from their honeymoon, Whitney kisses Mick, saying she has feelings for him, so he tells Linda what happened. Linda tells Whitney to keep away from Mick and not to give up on Lee.\n\nNancy and Lee have an argument, which causes Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) to fall off his highchair. Mick and Linda do not witness this, and when Mick insists they should get Ollie to hospital, Linda states he seems fine, but she later finds Ollie is not breathing. She successfully resuscitates him, only for him to suffer a seizure. Ollie is taken to hospital where a doctor tells the Carters that he could have brain damage after a head injury. Linda, in denial about the severity of Ollie's condition, argues with Mick, especially when he blames Nancy for the incident, however, she soon realises that Mick is right about Ollie having changed when he does not respond to her in the usual way. Linda is delighted by Johnny's (now played by [[Ted Reilly]]) return but saddened by Nancy's departure. Linda is devastated when Dean is acquitted but tells Mick she has become a strong person and that their relationship has become stronger. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a [[miscarriage]] but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. The Carters are traumatised by a violent robbery on The Queen Vic, during which Linda's favourite necklace is stolen. Linda is inspired to make Christmas great as a result, and is overjoyed when Ollie takes his first steps. Linda is devastated to learn that Elaine has had a stroke in Spain on Christmas Eve, and she flies out there with Johnny to support her mother. Later, Johnny returns to Walford while Linda relocates with Elaine to Watford to aid her mother's recovery. Mick visits Linda and informs her that Babe has caused the pub to be fined \u00a320,000 because of her selling alcohol illegally outside of licensing hours. When Mick struggles to cope with the pub's mounting debts, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to leave. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument, although they make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Linda then sends [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) to work in The Queen Vic as a bar manager. With Lady Di needing an expensive operation and mounting debts, Shirley convinces Linda to sell the freehold of The Queen Vic, and they agree not to tell Mick. Linda signs the paperwork and Shirley forges Mick's signature. Linda returns to Walford for her birthday and meets [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]), The Queen Vic's business consultant sent by the freeholder, Grafton Hill, and with the changes, she feels that The Queen Vic is not her home. She leaves again in the middle of the night, saying Elaine has fallen, but she is fine and Linda tells Elaine that she could not talk to Mick.\n\nTwo months later, Mick phones Linda, telling her to come back home or else there will be nothing to come back to. When Linda and Ollie (now played by Harry Farr) return, she is surprised when she discovers the amount of changes that have happened. When Linda discovers that Mick has been fighting in the pub, Shirley tells her that he has struggled with her prolonged absence and Linda admits that she has neglected him. When Linda is seemingly about to tell Mick about her secret, Mick admits to her that he is in love with someone else. Linda realises it is Whitney and throws her out, while Mick begs her not to give up on their marriage. Linda agrees to reconcile but is furious when Mick admits he paid Whitney off, so she slaps him. Following a conversation with Fi, Linda offers Whitney her job back but she also defies Fi by rehiring [[Tracey (EastEnders)|Tracey]] ([[Jane Slaughter]]). After confiding in Denise about Mick's infatuation, Denise tells Linda that she saw Mick and Whitney kiss several months previously. Linda then learns that Fi nearly kissed Mick. Linda considers leaving Walford with Ollie, however, she talks to [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and reveals that Elaine's stroke was not severe and she recovered relatively quickly, but that Linda stayed away from Walford because she had been diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] while caring for Elaine. Jack accompanies Linda to a check-up where she is told that there are no signs of cancer in her body but there is a chance it could come back, so she is unsure if she should tell Mick, but she does so. They go on holiday to rekindle their marriage and when they return, Linda is delighted that Whitney and Woody are emigrating, but Woody leaves without Whitney, so Linda is annoyed. Mick asks Linda to renew their wedding vows and she accepts, though has doubts after seeing Mick comforting Whitney. The Carters attempt to raise money after Grafton Hill tell them they need to pay \u00a360,000 in repair costs or face eviction, though Fi tells them she has reduced it to \u00a350,000. They raise the money but Fi's father, [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), reveals he now owns the business and Fi denies reducing the debt. Willmott-Brown gives an eviction notice to the Carters, giving them a month to leave. After Willmott-Brown collapses from a heart attack, Fi gives the Carters a chance to buy back the freehold for The Queen Vic for \u00a3150,000. Linda rejects this offer, calling it unrealistic and telling her that her family will get their comeuppance. However, Mick is determined to find the money to keep the pub and signs up to participate in a robbery with [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]) and his gang on New Year's Day 2018.  Linda is distraught when Mick is shot by [[Callum \"Halfway\" Highway]] ([[Tony Clay]]), an army friend of Lee's during the robbery. However, Mick recovers with the help of Linda, Shirley, [[Mariam Ahmed]] (Indira Joshi) and a remorseful Halfway, who offers to help out at the pub. Several days later, Mick finds an expensive ring in Halfway's possession and interrogates Halfway, who admits he stole it from the robbery. Halfway gives the ring to the Carters, who then give the ring to Fi in exchange for the freehold for the pub. However, Aidan becomes suspicious of this and attempts to blackmail Mick into letting him use the pub for drug dealing. Aidan steps up his demands, repeatedly forcing him to accept money for these drug deals despite Linda returning it. The Carters decide to flee Walford to escape Aidan, who shows up and beats Mick up for not giving into his demands. However, Phil stops Aidan at the last minute and pressures him into leaving Walford or he'll reveal to the police that he killed Fi's brother [[Luke Browning]] (Adam Astill). Aidan calls off the drug deals, giving the Carters back control of The Queen Vic.\n\nHalfway's brother and Mick's longtime friend, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]), arrives. Tina reveals that he abused her and another person [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Dylan Box|Dylan Box]] ([[Ricci Harnett]]) when they were teenagers, and she attacks him. Stuart seeks revenge on the Carters and one night, Stuart is shot in The Queen Vic. Linda initially thinks Mick shot Stuart so she dumps the gun in the canal after she finds it in the bar but she is seen by [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]). Mick tells Linda he is innocent and she worries whether she did the right thing, though Mick reassures her. The next day, Linda is arrested for Stuart's attempted murder. However, when Stuart regains consciousness, he tells the police that Mick shot him, and Mick is arrested and remanded. Linda ends their relationship when he admits he started smothering Stuart and tells Stuart she believes that Mick shot him. Linda and Stuart begin meeting regularly and become close despite the family's protests. She tells the family she thinks Mick is guilty, throws away her wedding rings, and later throws the family out, then allows Stuart to move in, and calls a solicitor to begin divorce proceedings from Mick. When Shirley breaks into the pub to confront Linda over being manipulated by Stuart, Linda calls the police and they arrest Shirley. She is released the next day and attacks Stuart. Linda takes Shirley aside and secretly shows her that she has hidden her wedding rings in her bra: her close friendship with Stuart is actually part of a bigger plan to help get Mick out of prison as she still loves Mick and believes he is innocent. Linda then attempts to seduce Stuart to record a confession from him, but he finds the  recording device. After he attempts to rape her, Linda gets him to confess that Mick did not shoot him, but he is unaware that she has a second recording device in her hair. Following this, Stuart is arrested for perverting the course of justice but is quickly released after he blames Dylan, this annoys and worries Linda that Mick might not be released, she hears a sound in the barrel stall and while investigating comes face to face with Mick.\n\nMonths later, Linda develops a [[Alcoholism|stress-induced drinking disorder]]. She is arrested after crashing into a parent's car during the school run and, failing a breathalyser test, faces a court summons, also a driving ban which she keeps secret from Mick, unfortunately she reverts back to drinking alcohol, anxious about telling him. On Christmas Eve, Linda gets drunk and insults [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) and Mick, mocking him about his [[panic attack]]s, which Ollie witnesses. Linda walks out and passes out in the gardens, being awoken by Lee, who has returned for Christmas. She spends the next day in hospital but discharges herself, in the need of a drink. Linda passes out in the back of a van and when she wakes up hungover, she finds herself at an abandoned warehouse where [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) has been ordered by [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden) to kill Keanu, in revenge for Keanu having an affair with and impregnating his stepmother, Sharon. As Ben wants evidence of Keanu's murder on a burner phone and, growing tired of Martin's uncertainty, Linda shoots Keanu in the shoulder herself. He survives and they follow Linda's plan of staging Keanu's murder, with Martin disposing of the evidence and both of them keeping quiet. Linda later invites Sharon to live with the Carters but her guilt grows, especially when Keanu's mother [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]) becomes convinced that Phil has killed him, causing her to drink heavily again. On New Year's Eve, she goes to Karen's party and gets excessively drunk, leading to her almost exposing the events of Christmas Day, kicking Sharon out, flirting with [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and almost being raped by a stranger after going to his hotel room. After she phones him, Martin, turning up outside The Queen Vic, forcefully warns her in the nearby alleyway against revealing the events of Christmas Day or they are \"both dead\".\n\nMick later finds out about the hotel and confronts Linda, who claims she cannot remember anything but gets herself tested for [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]]s. Linda later gets drunk and confesses to Sharon that Keanu is still alive; she continues to taunt Martin over this, with him growing more worried that she will reveal everything. Linda's alcoholism continues to spiral out of control, resulting in her slapping Sharon and social services intervening as Ollie's schoolteachers notice him becoming extremely unhappy. After almost setting fire to the kitchen and potentially endangering Ollie with her behaviour, Shirley tries to drown Linda, who breaks down. Shirley then urges her to attend therapy for her alcoholism or face never seeing Ollie again. However, Linda continues her drinking and thinks that the family are all against her. Linda later kicks off and produces divorce papers telling Mick that their marriage is over, to his horror.\n\nAfter Linda gives a drunken speech in front of everyone at the Vic one night, humiliating Mick, he tells her he\u2019ll see her in court. The day of the boat party, which is being held to celebrate the Vic winning best pub, Linda and Shirley fight when Shirley notices Linda drinking as they prepare to leave. Shirley urges Linda to realize that she still loves Mick and that she should try to save her marriage. As they get ready to board the bus, Linda sees Mick and Whitney talking and assumes they\u2019re having an affair. Unbeknownst to her, Whitney has asked Mick for help after her accidental murder of Leo King. Linda drinks Mo\u2019s vodka on the bus en route to the boat and arrives drunk, which leads to her announcing in front of everyone that Mick and Whitney are having an affair. She later goes down to the boat\u2019s kitchen and sees a bottle of wine on a shelf, but as she climbs to reach for it the boat crash happens and she falls. Her ankle gets stuck and she gets knocked out, and later when water begins to pour in Mick arrives and hears her cries for help. Mick can\u2019t get Linda\u2019s foot out and Linda tells him to leave her and to think of their kids, but Mick says he\u2019s staying with her. As the boat fills with more water, Mick decides to break Linda\u2019s ankle to free her and he and Linda later appear in the Thames with Mick holding on to an unconscious Linda. They are rescued by Stuart and Rainie who are on a life boat, and Linda regains consciousness. Once they reach the dock with all the other passengers, Linda is devastated as she sees Dennis being declared dead by paramedics who failed to resuscitate him. Mick, Linda and Tina later arrive home to the Vic where Linda finally admits that she is an alcoholic and that she wants to get help, choosing her marriage and Mick over alcohol.\n\nThe day after the boat crash Mick tells Linda about Whitney calling him for help after her accidental murder of Leo as he is worried now that Whitney has confessed. Linda questions why he didn\u2019t call the police considering it was in self-defence. Mick later tells police he invited Whitney to the party as a distraction but doesn\u2019t reveal he knew about the murder. Linda makes a costume for Ollie for World Book Day and he wins 2nd place, delighting Linda. She also puts up a chart marking the days of being sober and gets rid of all her hidden bottles of alcohol throughout the house. While getting a coffee she runs into Sharon and offers to help her care for her newborn son.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Pink dressing gown EastEnders.jpg|thumb|Pink dressing gown costume from ''EastEnders'', said to belong to the character of Linda but usually worn by her husband [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), including for their wedding, on display at the ''EastEnders'' Meet and Greet event.]]\n\n===Casting and introduction===\nLinda was introduced as the wife of [[Mick Carter]], played by [[Danny Dyer]], the brother of established character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who has appeared in ''EastEnders'' since 2006.

Linda departed the series on 25 December 2016 although she made two separate guest appearances on 16 March 2017 and 30 June 2017. She returned full-time on 7 August 2017.\n\nLinda's storylines include her feud with [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), coming to terms with her youngest son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny]] ([[Sam Strike]]/[[Ted Reilly]]) being [[Homosexuality|gay]], being [[rape]]d by Mick's brother [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) and coping in the aftermath, giving birth to a premature baby after falling down the stairs, suffering from [[bulimia nervosa]], being in denial of the possibility that her baby son [[Ollie Carter]] could have brain damage, leaving to care for her mother [[Elaine Peacock]] ([[Maria Friedman]]) following her [[stroke]], discovering that Mick kissed their daughter-in-law [[Whitney Dean|Whitney Carter]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) and revealing that she has secretly battled [[cervical cancer]] before being involved in an ambulance crash when Johnny is shot, [[perverting the course of justice]] when [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) is shot leading to her being falsely accused of [[attempted murder]], coping with Ollie's diagnosis of [[autism]], battling with [[alcoholism]], shooting [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]) to pretend that he has been murdered by [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) and splitting with Mick as a result of her alcoholism.\n\n==Storylines==\nLinda first appears when her partner [[Mick Carter]]'s ([[Danny Dyer]]) sisters, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), visit her mother [[Elaine Peacock]]'s ([[Maria Friedman]]) pub in [[Watford]], where Linda and her family are living. They intend to ask Mick for a loan but Linda rejects them as Mick is not around. As revenge, Tina steals the money from a bingo jar but Shirley returns it, proving her honesty to Mick, and also recommends [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] as a potential pub of their own on [[Albert Square]] in [[Walford]], where Shirley lives. Mick purchases the pub from [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), who is at first unaware of his identity, and Mick, Linda, their son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]) and their [[bulldog]], [[Lady Di (EastEnders)|Lady Di]] (Hot Lips), move in and start trading. Linda continues to clash with Shirley, who moves in with them, and she befriends [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) over their mutual dislike of Shirley. Linda and Mick receive an invite to their daughter [[Nancy Carter]]'s ([[Maddy Hill]]) wedding to [[Wayne Ladlow]] ([[Malachi Kirby]]), a troublemaker, but they disapprove so Mick forcibly removes her from the wedding service. In the following argument, Nancy reveals that Johnny is gay, and has been hiding his sexuality in fear of how his parents will react. Linda refuses to accept that he is gay and encourages him to date [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), who shows an interest in him. Mick, along with Shirley and Tina, visit their estranged father [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) for money, and reunite with him in the process. He moves into the pub when he breaks his ankle and becomes immobile, and, despite initially clashing with him, Linda warms to having him around.\n\nLinda's friendship with Sharon comes under strain when Sharon reveals plans to open a new bar in Walford, named \"The Albert\". Realising it will be in direct competition to The Queen Vic, she plots to get inside knowledge about the bar, convincing Johnny to take a job there. However, Johnny likes the job and tells her that he does not want to feed information to her. Linda and Mick's eldest son, [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), returns from Afghanistan, where he has been serving in the army. He is grieving for a comrade he has lost, and Linda is a comfort and support to him. Shirley's estranged son [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) comes to Walford, and although he continues to share a troubled relationship with his mother, he is welcomed by Mick and Linda into the family. Dean develops feelings for Linda, which she is at first unaware of, but discovers when he gropes her buttocks at a photoshoot for his new salon. She warns him that it is inappropriate but does not tell Mick out of fear of angering him.\n\nTina encourages Johnny to embrace his sexuality, inviting him to [[gay pride]] in London. Linda continues to be uncomfortable with this, and attempts to sabotage his plans by making him work. However, he realises what she is doing and in the ensuing argument he leaves home. Stan takes Linda to his old flat where Johnny is staying, and, after some tough love from Stan about her past, she apologises to Johnny and drops him off at gay pride, giving him her blessing. The following week, Linda has a party for her birthday, and Lee returns permanently from Afghanistan in time for the celebrations. After the party, Linda and Mick have a heart to heart, and he asks her to marry him properly, but she declines, determined to keep up the pretence to their children that they are already married. This conversation is overheard by Dean, who agrees to keep quiet.\n\nLinda supports Mick when he participates in a swimming gala for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]), despite being fearful of water. Mick conquers his fears, but on the way home he is arrested for [[soliciting]] a [[prostitute]]. He tells Linda that the police are making a mistake as it was in fact his friend [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), that was speaking with the prostitute; he pulled over merely to see what was going on. Stan's girlfriend, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) overhears the conversation and accompanies Linda to Mick's hearing, and Linda is devastated when he pleads guilty to protect Ian, who is going through a tough time following the death of his daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Linda agrees to keep quiet, but Cora has a change of heart about supporting Linda and reveals Mick's offence to the whole pub, running his name through the mud. Unable to cope with the negative social stigma surrounding her family, Linda demands that Mick reveals the truth, but he refuses, wanting to keep his word to Ian. However, the truth is revealed when the prostitute, who is revealed to be Cora's estranged daughter [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]), bumps into Ian's partner [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and reveals the truth. Denise visits Linda, struggling with the revelation, and Linda lies that she only just found out about Ian's actions. Ian however reveals the truth to Denise, who accuses Linda of attention seeking. One evening, Dean kisses Linda but she slaps him. Distraught over the upset that Mick's actions have brought her family, Linda leaves Walford to stay with Elaine in Watford. She returns, reconciling with Mick, before Sharon and Phil's wedding. When Sharon suggests that Dean's advances towards Linda were encouraged, both drunk, they have a bitter row in the pub. Then Sharon tells Nancy about the kiss, so Nancy accuses Dean and Linda of having an affair.\n\nShirley flees from Walford after the wedding, leaving Dean upset. Mick asks Linda to comfort him, but, misunderstanding her reassurance and very drunk, Dean rapes her. She becomes very withdrawn, telling nobody and refusing to be intimate with Mick. Trying to get to the bottom of what is going on, he calls Linda's mother, Elaine, asking her to visit The Vic to help him understand her behaviour. Elaine makes some progress before leaving again. Mick theorises that Linda is pregnant when she vomits at the smell of lavender bath soap, and she, is horrified to discover he is correct, when she takes a test. She lies to Mick about the result and plans to have an abortion, but Mick finds out and she agrees to keep the baby. She is disturbed when Dean finds out, and tries to hang onto the belief that the baby is Mick's. [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) bumps into Linda who asks her about her relationship with Dean, Linda nearly admits that Dean raped her however she is stopped from doing so when they are interrupted by Dean. However, Stacey grows suspicious, and when Linda unexpectedly gets scared when Dean is around, Stacey surmises that Dean raped her and confronts Linda. When Stacey depicts how she felt after her rape, Linda accepts that he did. Johnny announces he is leaving Walford to travel with Gianluca, although initially upset, Linda decides to support him.\n\nLinda, feeling increasingly threatened by Dean, turns down Mick's Christmas Day proposal before stunning Mick by revealing the rape. Later that day he confronts Dean who lies, saying that he and Linda were having an affair. Mick attacks Dean forcing Shirley's revelation\u2014Dean is his brother. Linda eavesdrops while Mick, Tina, Shirley, Babe and Stan argue, only to hear Mick deny that Dean is part of the family. Mick tells them that Dean raped Linda, but she overhears. Without saying anything, Linda leaves the pub. Mick leaves messages on her voicemail to ask her to come home and Elaine returns her to the pub. When she attempts to find solace in Sharon's home, Mick joins her, and she says they should not let what happened get in the way of their relationship. They are about to return to the pub when Mick has second thoughts and he decides to take Linda away for a break.  When they return a few weeks later, they find Shirley helping to run the pub so Mick asks her to leave. When Mick accompanies her to the police station, Linda reports Dean for rape. She then fills Nancy and Lee in on recent events, having already told Elaine and Sharon. Dean is arrested by the police but released after questioning and accuses Linda of lying. Linda proposes to Mick who accepts. The next day, Nancy confesses to her that Mick choked Dean unconscious in the cellar and is being secretive about what happened. Elaine returns for Mick and Linda's engagement party, while Linda confronts Mick, who assures her that he did not kill Dean, although, later, Nancy tries to tell Shirley something about Dean, but collapses on the ground before she can do so. After Elaine returns for Linda's five-month scan the day after, Linda confesses to her her fears that the baby may not be Mick's. Linda organises a romantic picnic as a fresh start for her and Mick. Linda is devastated to learn that Dean will not be charged due to lack of evidence. Linda pleads with Dean to admit he raped her but just as she seems to be making leeway, Mick interrupts.\n\nLinda falls down the stairs, causing her to go into premature labour. She gives birth to a healthy son, [[Ollie Carter]] (Jack Tilley). Linda confronts a delusional Dean when he insists on meeting the baby, believing that Ollie is his son. Mick discovers that he, Linda and Ollie share the same blood type, but Dean does not, meaning Dean cannot be the father. Linda and Mick agree they should marry soon. On her return home with Mick and Ollie, Linda snubs an apologetic Dean's attempt to shake her hand. When Linda and Nancy return from holiday, Linda learns that Lee has been suffering from depression, and she encourages him to take his medication. Elaine moves in temporarily, which initially causes consternation when she interferes with running the pub. Mick arranges for Linda to go to a wedding fair in Birmingham, and when she returns, she discovers that Mick and Shirley have been seeing each other in secret, which upsets Linda. After making herself sick one day, she tells Mick she cannot get married. Eventually, she tells him she hates herself and, because of Dean, she feels the same way she did when she suffered from [[bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] after her father died, and has been making herself sick again. However, she agrees to marry Mick with his support. When Dean attempts to rape his fianc\u00e9e [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), Linda encourages her to report this to the police. During a heated exchange with Linda where Shirley is present, Dean admits that he raped Linda. Stunned, Linda tells Mick, while Dean goes into hiding, where he sees one of Mick and Linda's wedding invites. On New Year's Day 2016, Dean goes to the wedding venue and attempts to drown Shirley, jumping into the lake with her. Mick fights with Dean in the lake and he is knocked unconscious. Mick rescues him and resuscitates him, and he is arrested for the attempted rape of Roxy.  Afterwards, Linda and Mick marry. When they return from their honeymoon, Whitney kisses Mick, saying she has feelings for him, so he tells Linda what happened. Linda tells Whitney to keep away from Mick and not to give up on Lee.\n\nNancy and Lee have an argument, which causes Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) to fall off his highchair. Mick and Linda do not witness this, and when Mick insists they should get Ollie to hospital, Linda states he seems fine, but she later finds Ollie is not breathing. She successfully resuscitates him, only for him to suffer a seizure. Ollie is taken to hospital where a doctor tells the Carters that he could have brain damage after a head injury. Linda, in denial about the severity of Ollie's condition, argues with Mick, especially when he blames Nancy for the incident, however, she soon realises that Mick is right about Ollie having changed when he does not respond to her in the usual way. Linda is delighted by Johnny's (now played by [[Ted Reilly]]) return but saddened by Nancy's departure. Linda is devastated when Dean is acquitted but tells Mick she has become a strong person and that their relationship has become stronger. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a [[miscarriage]] but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. The Carters are traumatised by a violent robbery on The Queen Vic, during which Linda's favourite necklace is stolen. Linda is inspired to make Christmas great as a result, and is overjoyed when Ollie takes his first steps. Linda is devastated to learn that Elaine has had a stroke in Spain on Christmas Eve, and she flies out there with Johnny to support her mother. Later, Johnny returns to Walford while Linda relocates with Elaine to Watford to aid her mother's recovery. Mick visits Linda and informs her that Babe has caused the pub to be fined \u00a320,000 because of her selling alcohol illegally outside of licensing hours. When Mick struggles to cope with the pub's mounting debts, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to leave. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument, although they make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Linda then sends [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) to work in The Queen Vic as a bar manager. With Lady Di needing an expensive operation and mounting debts, Shirley convinces Linda to sell the freehold of The Queen Vic, and they agree not to tell Mick. Linda signs the paperwork and Shirley forges Mick's signature. Linda returns to Walford for her birthday and meets [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]), The Queen Vic's business consultant sent by the freeholder, Grafton Hill, and with the changes, she feels that The Queen Vic is not her home. She leaves again in the middle of the night, saying Elaine has fallen, but she is fine and Linda tells Elaine that she could not talk to Mick.\n\nTwo months later, Mick phones Linda, telling her to come back home or else there will be nothing to come back to. When Linda and Ollie (now played by Harry Farr) return, she is surprised when she discovers the amount of changes that have happened. When Linda discovers that Mick has been fighting in the pub, Shirley tells her that he has struggled with her prolonged absence and Linda admits that she has neglected him. When Linda is seemingly about to tell Mick about her secret, Mick admits to her that he is in love with someone else. Linda realises it is Whitney and throws her out, while Mick begs her not to give up on their marriage. Linda agrees to reconcile but is furious when Mick admits he paid Whitney off, so she slaps him. Following a conversation with Fi, Linda offers Whitney her job back but she also defies Fi by rehiring [[Tracey (EastEnders)|Tracey]] ([[Jane Slaughter]]). After confiding in Denise about Mick's infatuation, Denise tells Linda that she saw Mick and Whitney kiss several months previously. Linda then learns that Fi nearly kissed Mick. Linda considers leaving Walford with Ollie, however, she talks to [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and reveals that Elaine's stroke was not severe and she recovered relatively quickly, but that Linda stayed away from Walford because she had been diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] while caring for Elaine. Jack accompanies Linda to a check-up where she is told that there are no signs of cancer in her body but there is a chance it could come back, so she is unsure if she should tell Mick, but she does so. They go on holiday to rekindle their marriage and when they return, Linda is delighted that Whitney and Woody are emigrating, but Woody leaves without Whitney, so Linda is annoyed. Mick asks Linda to renew their wedding vows and she accepts, though has doubts after seeing Mick comforting Whitney. The Carters attempt to raise money after Grafton Hill tell them they need to pay \u00a360,000 in repair costs or face eviction, though Fi tells them she has reduced it to \u00a350,000. They raise the money but Fi's father, [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), reveals he now owns the business and Fi denies reducing the debt. Willmott-Brown gives an eviction notice to the Carters, giving them a month to leave. After Willmott-Brown collapses from a heart attack, Fi gives the Carters a chance to buy back the freehold for The Queen Vic for \u00a3150,000. Linda rejects this offer, calling it unrealistic and telling her that her family will get their comeuppance. However, Mick is determined to find the money to keep the pub and signs up to participate in a robbery with [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]) and his gang on New Year's Day 2018.  Linda is distraught when Mick is shot by [[Callum \"Halfway\" Highway]] ([[Tony Clay]]), an army friend of Lee's during the robbery. However, Mick recovers with the help of Linda, Shirley, [[Mariam Ahmed]] (Indira Joshi) and a remorseful Halfway, who offers to help out at the pub. Several days later, Mick finds an expensive ring in Halfway's possession and interrogates Halfway, who admits he stole it from the robbery. Halfway gives the ring to the Carters, who then give the ring to Fi in exchange for the freehold for the pub. However, Aidan becomes suspicious of this and attempts to blackmail Mick into letting him use the pub for drug dealing. Aidan steps up his demands, repeatedly forcing him to accept money for these drug deals despite Linda returning it. The Carters decide to flee Walford to escape Aidan, who shows up and beats Mick up for not giving into his demands. However, Phil stops Aidan at the last minute and pressures him into leaving Walford or he'll reveal to the police that he killed Fi's brother [[Luke Browning]] (Adam Astill). Aidan calls off the drug deals, giving the Carters back control of The Queen Vic.\n\nHalfway's brother and Mick's longtime friend, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]), arrives. Tina reveals that he abused her and another person [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Dylan Box|Dylan Box]] ([[Ricci Harnett]]) when they were teenagers, and she attacks him. Stuart seeks revenge on the Carters and one night, Stuart is shot in The Queen Vic. Linda initially thinks Mick shot Stuart so she dumps the gun in the canal after she finds it in the bar but she is seen by [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]). Mick tells Linda he is innocent and she worries whether she did the right thing, though Mick reassures her. The next day, Linda is arrested for Stuart's attempted murder. However, when Stuart regains consciousness, he tells the police that Mick shot him, and Mick is arrested and remanded. Linda ends their relationship when he admits he started smothering Stuart and tells Stuart she believes that Mick shot him. Linda and Stuart begin meeting regularly and become close despite the family's protests. She tells the family she thinks Mick is guilty, throws away her wedding rings, and later throws the family out, then allows Stuart to move in, and calls a solicitor to begin divorce proceedings from Mick. When Shirley breaks into the pub to confront Linda over being manipulated by Stuart, Linda calls the police and they arrest Shirley. She is released the next day and attacks Stuart. Linda takes Shirley aside and secretly shows her that she has hidden her wedding rings in her bra: her close friendship with Stuart is actually part of a bigger plan to help get Mick out of prison as she still loves Mick and believes he is innocent. Linda then attempts to seduce Stuart to record a confession from him, but he finds the  recording device. After he attempts to rape her, Linda gets him to confess that Mick did not shoot him, but he is unaware that she has a second recording device in her hair. Following this, Stuart is arrested for perverting the course of justice but is quickly released after he blames Dylan, this annoys and worries Linda that Mick might not be released, she hears a sound in the barrel stall and while investigating comes face to face with Mick.\n\nMonths later, Linda develops a [[Alcoholism|stress-induced drinking disorder]]. She is arrested after crashing into a parent's car during the school run and, failing a breathalyser test, faces a court summons, also a driving ban which she keeps secret from Mick, unfortunately she reverts back to drinking alcohol, anxious about telling him. On Christmas Eve, Linda gets drunk and insults [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) and Mick, mocking him about his [[panic attack]]s, which Ollie witnesses. Linda walks out and passes out in the gardens, being awoken by Lee, who has returned for Christmas. She spends the next day in hospital but discharges herself, in the need of a drink. Linda passes out in the back of a van and when she wakes up hungover, she finds herself at an abandoned warehouse where [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) has been ordered by [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden) to kill Keanu, in revenge for Keanu having an affair with and impregnating his stepmother, Sharon. As Ben wants evidence of Keanu's murder on a burner phone and, growing tired of Martin's uncertainty, Linda shoots Keanu in the shoulder herself. He survives and they follow Linda's plan of staging Keanu's murder, with Martin disposing of the evidence and both of them keeping quiet. Linda later invites Sharon to live with the Carters but her guilt grows, especially when Keanu's mother [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]) becomes convinced that Phil has killed him, causing her to drink heavily again. On New Year's Eve, she goes to Karen's party and gets excessively drunk, leading to her almost exposing the events of Christmas Day, kicking Sharon out, flirting with [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and almost being raped by a stranger after going to his hotel room. After she phones him, Martin, turning up outside The Queen Vic, forcefully warns her in the nearby alleyway against revealing the events of Christmas Day or they are \"both dead\".\n\nMick later finds out about the hotel and confronts Linda, who claims she cannot remember anything but gets herself tested for [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]]s. Linda later gets drunk and confesses to Sharon that Keanu is still alive; she continues to taunt Martin over this, with him growing more worried that she will reveal everything. Linda's alcoholism continues to spiral out of control, resulting in her slapping Sharon and social services intervening as Ollie's schoolteachers notice him becoming extremely unhappy. After almost setting fire to the kitchen and potentially endangering Ollie with her behaviour, Shirley tries to drown Linda, who breaks down. Shirley then urges her to attend therapy for her alcoholism or face never seeing Ollie again. However, Linda continues her drinking and thinks that the family are all against her. Linda later kicks off and produces divorce papers telling Mick that their marriage is over, to his horror.\n\nAfter Linda gives a drunken speech in front of everyone at the Vic one night, humiliating Mick, he tells her he\u2019ll see her in court. The day of the boat party, which is being held to celebrate the Vic winning best pub, Linda and Shirley fight when Shirley notices Linda drinking as they prepare to leave. Shirley urges Linda to realize that she still loves Mick and that she should try to save her marriage. As they get ready to board the bus, Linda sees Mick and Whitney talking and assumes they\u2019re having an affair. Unbeknownst to her, Whitney has asked Mick for help after her accidental murder of Leo King. Linda drinks Mo\u2019s vodka on the bus en route to the boat and arrives drunk, which leads to her announcing in front of everyone that Mick and Whitney are having an affair. She later goes down to the boat\u2019s kitchen and sees a bottle of wine on a shelf, but as she climbs to reach for it the boat crash happens and she falls. Her ankle gets stuck and she gets knocked out, and later when water begins to pour in Mick arrives and hears her cries for help. Mick can\u2019t get Linda\u2019s foot out and Linda tells him to leave her and to think of their kids, but Mick says he\u2019s staying with her. As the boat fills with more water, Mick decides to break Linda\u2019s ankle to free her and he and Linda later appear in the Thames with Mick holding on to an unconscious Linda. They are rescued by Stuart and Rainie who are on a life boat, and Linda regains consciousness. Once they reach the dock with all the other passengers, Linda is devastated as she sees Dennis being declared dead by paramedics who failed to resuscitate him. Mick, Linda and Tina later arrive home to the Vic where Linda finally admits that she is an alcoholic and that she wants to get help, choosing her marriage and Mick over alcohol.\n\nThe day after the boat crash Mick tells Linda about Whitney calling him for help after her accidental murder of Leo as he is worried now that Whitney has confessed. Linda questions why he didn\u2019t call the police considering it was in self-defence. Mick later tells police he invited Whitney to the party as a distraction but doesn\u2019t reveal he knew about the murder. Linda makes a costume for Ollie for World Book Day and he wins 2nd place, delighting Linda. She also puts up a chart marking the days of being sober and gets rid of all her hidden bottles of alcohol throughout the house. While getting a coffee she runs into Sharon and offers to help her care for her newborn son.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Pink dressing gown EastEnders.jpg|thumb|Pink dressing gown costume from ''EastEnders'', said to belong to the character of Linda but usually worn by her husband [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), including for their wedding, on display at the ''EastEnders'' Meet and Greet event.]]\n\n===Casting and introduction===\nLinda was introduced as the wife of [[Mick Carter]], played by [[Danny Dyer]], the brother of established character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who has appeared in ''EastEnders'' since 2006.
