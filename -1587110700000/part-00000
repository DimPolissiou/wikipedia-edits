The film is based on the 2006 [[Cowboys & Aliens (comics)|graphic novel of the same name]] created by [[Scott Mitchell Rosenberg]]. The plot revolves around an [[amnesia]]c outlaw (Craig), a wealthy cattleman (Ford), and a mysterious traveler (Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople [[Alien abduction|abducted]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]]. The screenplay was written by [[Roberto Orci]], [[Alex Kurtzman]], [[Damon Lindelof]], [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]], based on a screen story by the latter two along with [[Steve Oedekerk]]. The film was produced by [[Brian Grazer]], [[Ron Howard]], Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with [[Steven Spielberg]] and Favreau serving as [[executive producer]]s.\n\nThe project began development in April 1997, when [[Universal Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]] bought film rights to a concept [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] by Rosenberg, former president at [[Malibu Comics]], which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of $163 million, filming for ''Cowboys & Aliens'' began in June 2010, in [[New Mexico]] and [[California]]. Despite studio pressure to release the film in [[3D film|3-D]], Favreau chose to film traditionally and in [[anamorphic format]] ([[widescreen]] picture on standard [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]]) to further a \"classic movie feel\".<ref name=fxguide /> Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's \"inherently comic\" title and premise.<ref name=\"question\" /> The film's aliens were designed to be \"cool and captivating\",<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place.\n\n''Cowboys & Aliens'' premiered at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2011 San Diego Comic-Con]] and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on {{nowrap|July 29}}, 2011. The film was considered to be a financial disappointment, taking $174.8 million in box office receipts on a $163 million budget. ''Cowboys & Aliens'' received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting while criticizing other aspects.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1873 [[New Mexico Territory]], a man ([[Daniel Craig]]) awakens injured in the desert with a strange metal bracelet attached to his left wrist and no memory. He wanders into the town of Absolution, where [[preacher]] Meacham ([[Clancy Brown]]) treats his wound. [[Sheriff]] John Taggart ([[Keith Carradine]]) recognizes the stranger as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan and attempts to arrest him. Jake nearly escapes, but a woman named Ella Swenson ([[Olivia Wilde]]) knocks him out. Taggart and his men prepare to transport both Jake and petulant young drunkard Percy Dolarhyde ([[Paul Dano]]) to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] for trial.\n\nPercy's father, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde ([[Harrison Ford]]), a ruthless [[Cowman (profession)|cattle baron]], arrives with armed men and demands Percy be released. He also wants Jake, who stolen gold from him. During the standoff, alien craft begin attacking the town. Percy, Taggart, and other townsfolk are abducted by long, whip-like feelers hanging from the bottom of the ships. Jake's bracelet inexplicably activates and transforms, becoming a [[directed energy weapon|weapon]]; he shoots down a ship, ending the attack.\n\nDolarhyde, Ella, and other townsfolk form a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] to track an injured alien that escaped from the downed ship. Meanwhile, Jake travels to an abandoned cabin and, in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins the posse. During the evening, they come upon a capsized [[Paddle wheel ship|paddle wheel]] [[steamboat]] that the aliens apparently dumped far from any large river. They camp inside it; during the night the alien kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.\n\nBy morning, most of the posse has deserted, and Jake's former gang attacks the rest. Jake, who stole the gang's loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control but is foiled. The aliens attack again and abduct Ella. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash in a river. The pilot survives the crash and attacks Ella, fatally wounding her, before Jake kills it with his wrist-blaster.\n\nThe remaining posse is captured by [[Chiricahua people|Chiricahua Apache]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], who blame them for the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and emerges from the fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had traveled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens - who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments on them - have superior weaponry and are far stronger and more durable than humans; only Jake's wrist weapon or a well-aimed shot with a rifle can kill them with a single shot. Ella tells them that the previous attackers were just scouts.\n\nShe also claims Jake holds the secret to the aliens' whereabouts and argues that they must defeat the aliens before the invaders exterminate all life on Earth. After taking medicine offered by the Apaches' [[medicine man]], Jake's memory returns. He recalls watching Alice get [[vivisection|vivisected]] and [[Euthanasia|euthanized]]; he escaped by stealing the bracelet encasing his wrist. He also remembers the location of the aliens' base of operations: their landed [[Mother ship#In popular culture|mother ship]]. \n\nArmed with this knowledge, they plan to siege the alien base. Jake leaves to persuade his old gang to join the fight while Dolarhyde takes command of the original group and the Apaches. After the combined groups maneuver the aliens into a ground battle, Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him, and both men escape from the ship after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death. The ship takes off as the remaining aliens flee Earth, but Ella stays on board to end the threat: she sacrifices herself by entering the ship's core and turning Jake's wrist weapon into a bomb; it detonates, obliterating the ship.\n\nWith the aliens gone, the rescued townsfolk begin remembering their pasts. Still a wanted man, Jake chooses to leave; the sheriff and Dolarhyde decide to claim he was killed in the invasion. The citizens intend to rebuild their town.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Jake Lonergan, an [[amnesia]]c [[Outlaw (stock character)|outlaw]].\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde, a powerful [[Cowman (profession)|cattleman]]\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Ella Swenson, a mysterious traveler who aids Lonergan.\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Doc, owner of Absolution's local saloon (when he isn't tending to patients).\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow's trouble-making son.\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Meacham, Absolution's [[preacher]] and [[Physician|doctor]] (when the real one is too busy tending bar).\n* [[Keith Carradine]] as Sheriff John Taggart, Absolution's sheriff.\n* [[Noah Ringer]] as Emmett Taggart, John Taggart's grandson.\n* [[Adam Beach]] as Nat Colorado, Dolarhyde's Native American right-hand man.\n* [[Abigail Spencer]] as Alice, Jake's lost love.\n* [[Ana de la Reguera]] as Mar\u00eda, Absolution's saloon maid and Doc's wife.\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Hunt, a bandit and friend of Lonergan.\n* [[Julio Cedillo]] as Bronc, a Mexican bandit.\n* [[David O'Hara]] as Pat Dolan, Lonergan's former gang-member.\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Roy Murphy\n* [[Raoul Trujillo]] as [[Baishan (Apache)|Black Knife]], the Chiricahua Apache chief.\n* Paul Ortega as Apache [[Medicine man|Medicine Man]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and casting===\n{{multiple image|total_width=270|image1=Daniel Craig - Film Premiere \"Spectre\" 007 - on the Red Carpet in Berlin (22387409720) (cropped).jpg|image2=Harrison Ford by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|alt1=A head shot of a light-haired man in a suit|alt2=A head shot of an older man with gray hair, wearing dark sunglasses|footer=[[Daniel Craig]] and [[Harrison Ford]] portray two of the film's protagonists.

And it was a real unveiling of the creature, little by little, and using lighting and camera work and music to make it a very subjective experience. And so we tried to preserve that here.\"<ref name=\"moviefone\" /> In designing the film's aliens, ILM was careful to make the creatures \"cool and captivating\".<ref name=\"Desowitz\"/> Guyett stated that they adopted a similar approach to that of ''[[District 9]]'':\n\n[[File:Yellow fungus in Cowboys & Aliens.png|thumb|alt=A reptilian creature in a desert landscape, impaled by multiple arrows, having wounds secreting a dark-colored blood and growing a yellow fungus|An alien with wounds covered in a yellow fungus.

You were drawn into their world a bit and their idiosyncrasies had an immediate impact: they ate cat food. But those details overwhelm certain design aspects, so I was striving to find some behavior that fit in well with the Western genre, where you have people in very arduous conditions fighting the elements. And I thought that the irony of all this was that the aliens turn up and it could be more exaggerated for them. They're frontiersmen in a way: traveling to another place and having to deal with all the adversities of the climate. And in our case, we played up the fact that they weren't comfortable in our world. There are flies all around them; they don't like the light; and when they were wounded and exposed, a strange fungus grows around them.<ref name=\"Desowitz\">{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2011/08/03/ilm_talks_cowboys_aliens_visual_effects/ |title=ILM Talks Cowboys & Aliens Visual Effects |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |publisher=[[indieWire]] |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2011-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812130129/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2011/08/03/ilm_talks_cowboys_aliens_visual_effects/ |archivedate=2011-08-12 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe use of anamorphic widescreen (rather than shooting full-frame \"flat\" and cropping later) gave ILM no extra room to re-frame shots; it was a challenge to show both nine-foot-tall aliens and smaller humans in the same space. Instead, Guyett said, they shot more areas in case portions of the shots were lost. In filming the gun battle between the cowboys and aliens, in which the aliens move at twice the speed of the humans, actors were required to ride through the scene on horseback and shoot at men in gray suits and three-foot-tall hats; they aimed at faces drawn by Jon Favreau on the top of the hats. A big challenge for ILM's [[texture artist]]s was to show the aliens in both a dark cave environment and harsh sunlight. The creatures were rendered in high resolution for close-ups; dirt and wounds were added to the aliens to emphasize the injuries they sustained in battle. After Favreau requested that the aliens experience a very unpleasant biological reaction to being wounded on Earth, the texture team created a yellow fungus-like look on the scars of the aliens. To design the fungus, texture supervisor Martin Murphy searched the Internet for real pictures of mold and growth on trees and eventually designed a \"fried egg pattern\".<ref name=fxguide /> The heads of the aliens were based on those of [[sea turtle]]s, after Favreau encountered sea turtles during a trip to [[Hawaii]].<ref name=OuterSpaceIcon />\n\nAt the suggestion of Steven Spielberg,<ref name=commentary /> an \"[[\u00fcber]]-alien\" was also designed.<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> It was unclear if the red scar Jake gives the \u00fcber-alien after escaping [[vivisection]] would be enough of an identifier to distinguish it from other aliens, so the creature was redesigned<ref name=commentary /> with translucent, pale skin due to the lack of time spent outside.<ref name=OuterSpaceIcon /> Favreau described the \u00fcber-alien as more fleshy and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] than the other aliens<ref name=commentary6>Favreau, 1:44:45-1:45:27</ref> and Murphy commented, \"There are some parts of him like his arm that you can see into. It's almost like glass or ice or gelatiny surface that blends into a dryer area. The {{sic}} there's pieces of him that are more like a soft-shell crab or shiny and wet.\"<ref name=fxguide />\n\nIn addition to the aliens, other visual effects were required for the speeders, the alien spaceship, its interior, environment re-creations, and the [[head-up display]] for Jake's arm gauntlet. For the invasion of the town of Absolution, both practical laser lighting and fire effects were utilized, along with practical ships and effects enhancements. ILM artists had to enhance the initial look of the alien \"bolos\", the cables used to abduct people, with renderings such as extra lights, after viewers thought the studio had failed to \"paint out\" the cables in the film\u2019s first trailer. For a scene in which Jake and Ella ride on a speeder, the actors were filming on a practical mock-up against bluescreen; they were digitally replaced in wider shots.<ref name=fxguide/>\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''Cowboys & Aliens'', Director Jon Favreau sought a plausible approach to how humans from the late [[19th century]] could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry. He said, \"It was very well laid out, well planned, and there were a lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step.\"<ref name=\"west\" /> The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, \"It's very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you're in ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''.\"<ref name=\"west\">{{cite news | last=Kaye | first=Don | url=http://movies.msn.com/paralleluniverse/cowboys-and-aliens-editing/story/across-the-universe/?icid=MOVIES2&GT1=MOVIES2 | title=Go West | publisher=[[https://msnbc.com]] | date=December 13, 2010 | access-date=April 27, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224356/http://movies.msn.com/paralleluniverse/cowboys-and-aliens-editing/story/across-the-universe/?icid=MOVIES2&GT1=MOVIES2 | archive-date=March 25, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Favreau cited the works of [[John Ford]] and [[Sergio Leone]] as sources of inspiration as well as ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.<ref name=\"know\" /> Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own,<ref name=\"west\" /> referencing ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'', and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.<ref name=\"know\" /> He said of both genres, \"It's about finding the intersection of those two genres . . . If you do it right, it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before.\"<ref name=\"west\" />\n\nIn the Americas, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] nations were severely damaged by [[Europe|European]] [[settlers]], specifically because of the Europeans' advanced military technology. Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation \"in the frustration of not having the technology to allow you to prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side.\"<ref name=\"sneak\" /> In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of [[Manifest Destiny]]. Favreau also said of the premise, \"It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western up in a very classic way and then turns it on its ear.\"<ref name=\"sneak\" /> When the aliens appear, the film becomes a [[road movie]] in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens. Favreau compared the gathering to ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation.<ref>{{cite web | last=Vejvoda | first=Jim | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/115/1158107p1.html | title=We've Seen Some Cowboys & Aliens | website=[[IGN]] | date=March 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe character of Meacham also presents an unconventional take on [[Christianity|Christian]] principles to support the film's main theme of redemption.

But it doesn't.\" He criticized the aliens, which he said \"don't rate as characters\", existing as \"moving blobs you shoot at in a video game.\"<ref name=\"ReviewTHR\"/> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt's sentiments that the \"potential hamminess\" of the premise is offset by the cast, particularly Craig through a \"mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity.\" He considered however, that Wilde had the opposite effect, stating she \"appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars\". Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying \"beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play\" and concluded that \"a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best.\"<ref name=\"ReviewVariety\"/> Nick Pinkerton of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said the Western elements of the film were \"lovingly\" handled but felt the science aspects a \"gimmick\" and \"much more standard fare\" in comparison. He added that \"Ford, enlivened by dude garb, seems to enjoy himself in front of a camera for the first time in decades\".<ref name=\"ReviewVillageVoice\"/>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, writing that \"as preposterous moneymakers go, it's ambitious and well-made. The acting from the large cast is of a high standard, Craig and Ford were more or less born into their roles, and director Jon Favreau actually develops his characters and gives them things to do, instead of posing them in front of special effects.\" He lamented however that the film was not a pure Western, saying of the aliens, \"[T]here is more genuine suspense when [Percy Dolarhyde] starts shooting up the town than when countless aliens appear\".<ref name=\"ReviewEbert\"/> ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''{{'}}s Andrew O'Hehir offered a mixed response, claiming the film to be well made and clever, and singling out Craig and Ford for their performances. O'Hehir was, however, critical of the combination of western and science-fiction elements, calling it \"a mediocre western clumsily welded to a mediocre alien shoot-'em-up\".<ref name=\"ReviewSalon\"/>\n\n''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]''{{'}}s Nick Schager reacted negatively, stating \"''Cowboys & Aliens'' [[Mashup (book)|mashes up]] genres with a staunch dedication to getting everything wrong, making sure that each scene is more inane than the one that preceded it\"; giving the film one star out of four. Schager continued \"''Cowboys & Aliens''{{'}}s western accoutrements are [...] so false as to be stunning, with every steely-eyed glare from Craig's Man With No Memory, every confrontation between his Jake and Ford's grizzled Dolarhyde, and every silhouetted horseback ride across a sunset range seeming like a wan approximation of a familiar genre staple. [...] Favreau's visuals have an inauthentic and bland blockbuster sheen, and his actors are similarly afflicted with a case of [[poseur]]-itis (Craig's affected silent-type glowering, Ford's gruff racism, or Wilde's blank, wide-eyed stares), failing to deliver a single believable line-reading or gesture.\"<ref name=\"slant\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n''Cowboys & Aliens'' received five nominations.

The film is based on the 2006 [[Cowboys & Aliens (comics)|graphic novel of the same name]] created by [[Scott Mitchell Rosenberg]]. The plot revolves around an [[amnesia]]c outlaw (Craig), a wealthy cattleman (Ford), and a mysterious traveler (Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople [[Alien abduction|abducted]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]]. The screenplay was written by [[Roberto Orci]], [[Alex Kurtzman]], [[Damon Lindelof]], [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]], based on a screen story by the latter two along with [[Steve Oedekerk]]. The film was produced by [[Brian Grazer]], [[Ron Howard]], Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with [[Steven Spielberg]] and Favreau serving as [[executive producer]]s.\n\nThe project began development in April 1997, when [[Universal Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]] bought film rights to a concept [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] by Rosenberg, former president at [[Malibu Comics]], which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of $163 million, filming for ''Cowboys & Aliens'' began in June 2010, in [[New Mexico]] and [[California]]. Despite studio pressure to release the film in [[3D film|3-D]], Favreau chose to film traditionally and in [[anamorphic format]] ([[widescreen]] picture on standard [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]]) to further a \"classic movie feel\".<ref name=fxguide /> Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's \"inherently comic\" title and premise.<ref name=\"question\" /> The film's aliens were designed to be \"cool and captivating\",<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place.\n\n''Cowboys & Aliens'' premiered at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2011 San Diego Comic-Con]] and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on {{nowrap|July 29}}, 2011. The film was considered to be a financial disappointment, taking $174.8 million in box office receipts on a $163 million budget. ''Cowboys & Aliens'' received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting while criticizing other aspects.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1873 [[New Mexico Territory]], a man ([[Daniel Craig]]) awakens injured in the desert with a strange metal bracelet attached to his left wrist and no memory. He wanders into the town of Absolution, where [[preacher]] Meacham ([[Clancy Brown]]) treats his wound. [[Sheriff]] John Taggart ([[Keith Carradine]]) recognizes the stranger as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan and attempts to arrest him. Jake nearly escapes, but a woman named Ella Swenson ([[Olivia Wilde]]) knocks him out. Taggart and his men prepare to transport both Jake and petulant young drunkard Percy Dolarhyde ([[Paul Dano]]) to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] for trial.\n\nPercy's father, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde ([[Harrison Ford]]), a ruthless [[Cowman (profession)|cattle baron]], arrives with armed men and demands Percy be released. He also wants Jake, who stolen gold from him. During the standoff, alien craft begin attacking the town. Percy, Taggart, and other townsfolk are abducted by long, whip-like feelers hanging from the bottom of the ships. Jake's bracelet inexplicably activates and transforms, becoming a [[directed energy weapon|weapon]]; he shoots down a ship, ending the attack.\n\nDolarhyde, Ella, and other townsfolk form a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] to track an injured alien that escaped from the downed ship. Meanwhile, Jake travels to an abandoned cabin and, in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins the posse. During the evening, they come upon a capsized [[Paddle wheel ship|paddle wheel]] [[steamboat]] that the aliens apparently dumped far from any large river. They camp inside it; during the night the alien kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.\n\nBy morning, most of the posse has deserted, and Jake's former gang attacks the rest. Jake, who stole the gang's loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control but is foiled. The aliens attack again and abduct Ella. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash in a river. The pilot survives the crash and attacks Ella, fatally wounding her, before Jake kills it with his wrist-blaster.\n\nThe remaining posse is captured by [[Chiricahua people|Chiricahua Apache]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], who blame them for the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and emerges from the fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had traveled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens - who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments on them - have superior weaponry and are far stronger and more durable than humans; only Jake's wrist weapon or a well-aimed shot with a rifle can kill them with a single shot. Ella tells them that the previous attackers were just scouts.\n\nShe also claims Jake holds the secret to the aliens' whereabouts and argues that they must defeat the aliens before the invaders exterminate all life on Earth. After taking medicine offered by the Apaches' [[medicine man]], Jake's memory returns. He recalls watching Alice get [[vivisection|vivisected]] and [[Euthanasia|euthanized]]; he escaped by stealing the bracelet encasing his wrist. He also remembers the location of the aliens' base of operations: their landed [[Mother ship#In popular culture|mother ship]]. \n\nArmed with this knowledge, they plan to siege the alien base. Jake leaves to persuade his old gang to join the fight while Dolarhyde takes command of the original group and the Apaches. After the combined groups maneuver the aliens into a ground battle, Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him, and both men escape from the ship after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death.

And it was a real unveiling of the creature, little by little, and using lighting and camera work and music to make it a very subjective experience. And so we tried to preserve that here.\"<ref name=\"moviefone\" /> In designing the film's aliens, ILM was careful to make the creatures \"cool and captivating\".<ref name=\"Desowitz\"/> Guyett stated that they adopted a similar approach to that of ''[[District 9]]'':\n\n[[File:Yellow fungus in Cowboys & Aliens.png|thumb|alt=A reptilian creature in a desert landscape, impaled by multiple arrows, having wounds secreting a dark-colored blood and growing a yellow fungus|An alien with wounds covered in a yellow fungus.

You were drawn into their world a bit and their idiosyncrasies had an immediate impact: they ate cat food. But those details overwhelm certain design aspects, so I was striving to find some behavior that fit in well with the Western genre, where you have people in very arduous conditions fighting the elements. And I thought that the irony of all this was that the aliens turn up and it could be more exaggerated for them. They're frontiersmen in a way: traveling to another place and having to deal with all the adversities of the climate. And in our case, we played up the fact that they weren't comfortable in our world. There are flies all around them; they don't like the light; and when they were wounded and exposed, a strange fungus grows around them.<ref name=\"Desowitz\">{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2011/08/03/ilm_talks_cowboys_aliens_visual_effects/ |title=ILM Talks Cowboys & Aliens Visual Effects |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |publisher=[[indieWire]] |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2011-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812130129/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2011/08/03/ilm_talks_cowboys_aliens_visual_effects/ |archivedate=2011-08-12 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe use of anamorphic widescreen (rather than shooting full-frame \"flat\" and cropping later) gave ILM no extra room to re-frame shots; it was a challenge to show both nine-foot-tall aliens and smaller humans in the same space. Instead, Guyett said, they shot more areas in case portions of the shots were lost. In filming the gun battle between the cowboys and aliens, in which the aliens move at twice the speed of the humans, actors were required to ride through the scene on horseback and shoot at men in gray suits and three-foot-tall hats; they aimed at faces drawn by Jon Favreau on the top of the hats. A big challenge for ILM's [[texture artist]]s was to show the aliens in both a dark cave environment and harsh sunlight. The creatures were rendered in high resolution for close-ups; dirt and wounds were added to the aliens to emphasize the injuries they sustained in battle. After Favreau requested that the aliens experience a very unpleasant biological reaction to being wounded on Earth, the texture team created a yellow fungus-like look on the scars of the aliens. To design the fungus, texture supervisor Martin Murphy searched the Internet for real pictures of mold and growth on trees and eventually designed a \"fried egg pattern\".<ref name=fxguide /> The heads of the aliens were based on those of [[sea turtle]]s, after Favreau encountered sea turtles during a trip to [[Hawaii]].<ref name=OuterSpaceIcon />\n\nAt the suggestion of Steven Spielberg,<ref name=commentary /> an \"[[\u00fcber]]-alien\" was also designed.<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> It was unclear if the red scar Jake gives the \u00fcber-alien after escaping [[vivisection]] would be enough of an identifier to distinguish it from other aliens, so the creature was redesigned<ref name=commentary /> with translucent, pale skin due to the lack of time spent outside.<ref name=OuterSpaceIcon /> Favreau described the \u00fcber-alien as more fleshy and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] than the other aliens<ref name=commentary6>Favreau, 1:44:45-1:45:27</ref> and Murphy commented, \"There are some parts of him like his arm that you can see into. It's almost like glass or ice or gelatiny surface that blends into a dryer area. The {{sic}} there's pieces of him that are more like a soft-shell crab or shiny and wet.\"<ref name=fxguide />\n\nIn addition to the aliens, other visual effects were required for the speeders, the alien spaceship, its interior, environment re-creations, and the [[head-up display]] for Jake's arm gauntlet. For the invasion of the town of Absolution, both practical laser lighting and fire effects were utilized, along with practical ships and effects enhancements. ILM artists had to enhance the initial look of the alien \"bolos\", the cables used to abduct people, with renderings such as extra lights, after viewers thought the studio had failed to \"paint out\" the cables in the film\u2019s first trailer.

He said, \"It was very well laid out, well planned, and there were a lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step.\"<ref name=\"west\" /> The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, \"It's very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you're in ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''.\"<ref name=\"west\">{{cite news | last=Kaye | first=Don | url=http://movies.msn.com/paralleluniverse/cowboys-and-aliens-editing/story/across-the-universe/?icid=MOVIES2&GT1=MOVIES2 | title=Go West | publisher=[[https://msnbc.com]] | date=December 13, 2010 | access-date=April 27, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224356/http://movies.msn.com/paralleluniverse/cowboys-and-aliens-editing/story/across-the-universe/?icid=MOVIES2&GT1=MOVIES2 | archive-date=March 25, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Favreau cited the works of [[John Ford]] and [[Sergio Leone]] as sources of inspiration as well as ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.<ref name=\"know\" /> Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own,<ref name=\"west\" /> referencing ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'', and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.<ref name=\"know\" /> He said of both genres, \"It's about finding the intersection of those two genres . . .

Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation \"in the frustration of not having the technology to allow you to prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side.\"<ref name=\"sneak\" /> In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of [[Manifest Destiny]]. Favreau also said of the premise, \"It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western up in a very classic way and then turns it on its ear.\"<ref name=\"sneak\" /> When the aliens appear, the film becomes a [[road movie]] in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens.

Even the slightest goofiness, the tiniest touch of camp, and the whole thing would blow sky high. But it doesn't.\" He criticized the aliens, which he said \"don't rate as characters\", existing as \"moving blobs you shoot at in a video game.\"<ref name=\"ReviewTHR\"/> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt's sentiments that the \"potential hamminess\" of the premise is offset by the cast, particularly Craig through a \"mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity.\" He considered however, that Wilde had the opposite effect, stating she \"appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars\". Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying \"beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play\" and concluded that \"a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best.\"<ref name=\"ReviewVariety\"/> Nick Pinkerton of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said the Western elements of the film were \"lovingly\" handled but felt the science aspects a \"gimmick\" and \"much more standard fare\" in comparison. He added that \"Ford, enlivened by dude garb, seems to enjoy himself in front of a camera for the first time in decades\".<ref name=\"ReviewVillageVoice\"/>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, writing that \"as preposterous moneymakers go, it's ambitious and well-made. The acting from the large cast is of a high standard, Craig and Ford were more or less born into their roles, and director Jon Favreau actually develops his characters and gives them things to do, instead of posing them in front of special effects.\" He lamented however that the film was not a pure Western, saying of the aliens, \"[T]here is more genuine suspense when [Percy Dolarhyde] starts shooting up the town than when countless aliens appear\".<ref name=\"ReviewEbert\"/> ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''{{'}}s Andrew O'Hehir offered a mixed response, claiming the film to be well made and clever, and singling out Craig and Ford for their performances. O'Hehir was, however, critical of the combination of western and science-fiction elements, calling it \"a mediocre western clumsily welded to a mediocre alien shoot-'em-up\".<ref name=\"ReviewSalon\"/>\n\n''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]''{{'}}s Nick Schager reacted negatively, stating \"''Cowboys & Aliens'' [[Mashup (book)|mashes up]] genres with a staunch dedication to getting everything wrong, making sure that each scene is more inane than the one that preceded it\"; giving the film one star out of four. Schager continued \"''Cowboys & Aliens''{{'}}s western accoutrements are [...] so false as to be stunning, with every steely-eyed glare from Craig's Man With No Memory, every confrontation between his Jake and Ford's grizzled Dolarhyde, and every silhouetted horseback ride across a sunset range seeming like a wan approximation of a familiar genre staple. [...] Favreau's visuals have an inauthentic and bland blockbuster sheen, and his actors are similarly afflicted with a case of [[poseur]]-itis (Craig's affected silent-type glowering, Ford's gruff racism, or Wilde's blank, wide-eyed stares), failing to deliver a single believable line-reading or gesture.\"<ref name=\"slant\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n''Cowboys & Aliens'' received five nominations.

After the group signed with [[TVT Records]], the song was re-released through the label later that year as the B-side to their second single, ''\"4 My Click\"''. \"4 My Click\" featured [[Mic Geronimo]] and became popular on [[pirate radio]], eventually receiving airplay on [[Yo! MTV Raps]]. Plans for the release of the group's eponymous debut studio album were brought to a halt in 1995 after Chris Black was sentenced to five years in prison and the group was dropped from TVT, which led to their third single ''\"She Swallowed It\"'' never officially being released, however it was later bootlegged.

He also had a brief cameo in the video for \"Walk In New York\" by Queens hardcore rap group Onyx. Later in 1997, Irv Gotti was granted his own imprint from Def Jam, known as [[Murder Inc. Records]]. Ja Rule was promoted as the label's flagship artist, and he continued to make guest appearances on songs by other artists, including [[Method Man]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Nas]], DMX, [[LL Cool J]] and [[Dru Hill]]. He later appeared on Jay-Z's 1998 hit single \"[[Can I Get A...]]\", for which he wrote the hook.

Records]]. 50 Cent claimed that the feud began in 1999 after Ja Rule spotted him with a man who robbed him of his jewelry and also because of Ja Rule \"trying to be Tupac\".<ref name=\"http://hiphopdx.com\"/> However, Ja Rule claimed the conflict stemmed from a video shoot in [[Queens]] because 50 Cent did not like Ja Rule \"getting so much love\" from the neighborhood,<ref name=\"MTV News\"/> 50 Cent indirectly confirmed this in an interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', where 50 Cent states he was upset with Ja Rule for being under the aegis of [[Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff]].<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\"/> A confrontation occurred in Atlanta in which Ja Rule claims he struck  50 Cent with a baseball bat, later his crew stepping in to beat up 50 Cent.<ref name=\"hiphopdx.com\"/> Another confrontation occurred while in a [[The Hit Factory|New York studio]] where rapper [[Black Child (rapper)|Black Child]], a Murder Inc. artist, stabbed 50 Cent, causing a wound requiring four [[surgical suture|stitches]].<ref name=MTV/>\n\nIn his book, 50 Cent details how Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff tried to resolve the conflict between him and Ja Rule. Allegedly, McGriff asked 50 Cent to leave them alone because of the money involved. 50 Cent insinuated the conflict had something to do with the shooting where he was ambushed and shot.\n\nSince then, Black Child and other Murder Inc. rappers such as [[Caddillac Tah (rapper)|Cadillac Tah]] publicly insulted 50 Cent with \"There's a Snitch in the Club\" by Cadillac Tah, and \"The Real Wanksta\" by Black Child. In both songs, Black Child details violent actions directed toward 50 Cent.<ref name=MTV/> The exchange of insult tracks released from both parties culminated in Ja Rule's ''[[Blood in My Eye]]'', which was an album that returned additional insults to 50 Cent. Because of the ongoing feud between the two, 50 Cent's labelmates [[Eminem]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Obie Trice]], [[D12]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and the rest of the members of [[G-Unit]], also became involved and released tracks which insulted Ja Rule.<ref name=MTV/>\n\nJa Rule later released ''[[R.U.L.E.]]'' which included the successful single \"New York\", featuring [[Jadakiss]] and Fat Joe, in which Ja Rule obliquely attacked 50 Cent. This single prompted 50 Cent to enter a feud with the two featured artists, reflected in his response, \"[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]\".\n\nAlthough it seemed that the feud was over, Ja Rule returned with a track titled \"21 Gunz\".<ref name=illseed>{{cite web|date= April 2006|url= http://www.allhiphop.com/rumors/?ID=1002|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060504185544/http://www.allhiphop.com/rumors/?ID=1002|archivedate= 2006-05-04|title= Hip-Hop Rumors: Kay Slay Doll, Ja Rule, Happy 1,000Th To Illseed!|website= Allhiphop.com|accessdate=25 July 2007}}</ref> In response, [[Lloyd Banks]] and 50 Cent released the track \"Return of Ja Fool\" on Lloyd Banks' mixtape ''Mo Money in the Bank Pt. 4, Gang Green Season Starts Now''.<ref name=illseed/>\n\nIn an interview with MTV, Ja Rule stated, in reference to his album, ''[[The Mirror (Ja Rule album)|The Mirror]]'':\n\n{{quote|There was a lot of things I wanted to say, and I didn't want there to be any bitter records on the album.

But we can coincide inside of a world. He's doing him, and he's not thinking about me, and I'm doing me and I'm not thinking about him.\"\n\nIn September 2013, in an interview with [[Angie Martinez]] on The Angie Martinez show on HOT 97, both Rule and [[Irv Gotti]] acknowledged 50 Cent not only took a toll on Ja Rule's prominence, but along with the federal indictment, damaged Murder, Inc., as a music label.  They told Martinez their immediate reaction on hearing 50 Cent's single, \"[[In Da Club]]\", on the radio was that it was \"so dope\" and that they had a problem with it. They also disclosed that they had been blackballed from various award shows where 50 Cent was to perform due to their feud. Notwithstanding seeing 50 Cent as a hustler, they liked his entrepreneurial mentality, 10 years on, no longer had a problem with him. Ja Rule indicated he had plans to write a book surrounding the whole experience.\n<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/110089/ja-rule-and-50-cent-squash-beef/ |title=Ja Rule and 50 Cent Squash Beef |website=Inquisitr.com |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2018, the beef reignited after 50 Cent publicly dissed Ja Rule on [[Big Boy (radio host)|Big Boy]]'s Neighborhood leading to Ja Rule retaliating on Twitter the next day.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Lamarre|first=Carl|date=19 January 2018|url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8095111/ja-rule-disses-50-cent-twitter-beef|title= Ja Rule Refuels Feud With 50 Cent on Twitter: 'I Own Your Soul'|magazine= Billboard|accessdate=February 20, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119192128/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8095111/ja-rule-disses-50-cent-twitter-beef|archivedate=January 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Shady/Aftermath====\nThe conflict started after [[50 Cent]] signed to [[Shady Records]] and [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]] in 2002.

After the group signed with [[TVT Records]], the song was re-released through the label later that year as the B-side to their second single, ''\"4 My Click\"''. \"4 My Click\" featured [[Mic Geronimo]] and became popular on [[pirate radio]], eventually receiving airplay on [[Yo! MTV Raps]]. Plans for the release of the group's eponymous debut studio album were brought to a halt in 1995 after Chris Black was sentenced to five years in prison and the group was dropped from TVT, which led to their third single ''\"She Swallowed It\"'' never officially being released, however it was later bootlegged.

He also had a brief cameo in the video for \"Walk In New York\" by Queens hardcore rap group Onyx. Later in 1997, Irv Gotti was granted his own imprint from Def Jam, known as [[Murder Inc. Records]]. Ja Rule was promoted as the label's flagship artist, and he continued to make guest appearances on songs by other artists, including [[Method Man]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Nas]], DMX, [[LL Cool J]] and [[Dru Hill]]. He later appeared on Jay-Z's 1998 hit single \"[[Can I Get A...]]\", for which he wrote the hook.

Records]]. 50 Cent claimed that the feud began in 1999 after Ja Rule spotted him with a man who robbed him of his jewelry and also because of Ja Rule \"trying to be Tupac\".<ref name=\"http://hiphopdx.com\"/> However, Ja Rule claimed the conflict stemmed from a video shoot in [[Queens]] because 50 Cent did not like Ja Rule \"getting so much love\" from the neighborhood,<ref name=\"MTV News\"/> 50 Cent indirectly confirmed this in an interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', where 50 Cent states he was upset with Ja Rule for being under the aegis of [[Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff]].<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\"/> A confrontation occurred in Atlanta in which Ja Rule claims he struck  50 Cent with a baseball bat, later his crew stepping in to beat up 50 Cent.<ref name=\"hiphopdx.com\"/> Another confrontation occurred while in a [[The Hit Factory|New York studio]] where rapper [[Black Child (rapper)|Black Child]], a Murder Inc. artist, stabbed 50 Cent, causing a wound requiring four [[surgical suture|stitches]].<ref name=MTV/>\n\nIn his book, 50 Cent details how Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff tried to resolve the conflict between him and Ja Rule. Allegedly, McGriff asked 50 Cent to leave them alone because of the money involved. 50 Cent insinuated the conflict had something to do with the shooting where he was ambushed and shot.\n\nSince then, Black Child and other Murder Inc. rappers such as [[Caddillac Tah (rapper)|Cadillac Tah]] publicly insulted 50 Cent with \"There's a Snitch in the Club\" by Cadillac Tah, and \"The Real Wanksta\" by Black Child. In both songs, Black Child details violent actions directed toward 50 Cent.<ref name=MTV/> The exchange of insult tracks released from both parties culminated in Ja Rule's ''[[Blood in My Eye]]'', which was an album that returned additional insults to 50 Cent. Because of the ongoing feud between the two, 50 Cent's labelmates [[Eminem]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Obie Trice]], [[D12]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and the rest of the members of [[G-Unit]], also became involved and released tracks which insulted Ja Rule.<ref name=MTV/>\n\nJa Rule later released ''[[R.U.L.E.]]'' which included the successful single \"New York\", featuring [[Jadakiss]] and Fat Joe, in which Ja Rule obliquely attacked 50 Cent. This single prompted 50 Cent to enter a feud with the two featured artists, reflected in his response, \"[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]\".\n\nAlthough it seemed that the feud was over, Ja Rule returned with a track titled \"21 Gunz\".<ref name=illseed>{{cite web|date= April 2006|url= http://www.allhiphop.com/rumors/?ID=1002|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060504185544/http://www.allhiphop.com/rumors/?ID=1002|archivedate= 2006-05-04|title= Hip-Hop Rumors: Kay Slay Doll, Ja Rule, Happy 1,000Th To Illseed!|website= Allhiphop.com|accessdate=25 July 2007}}</ref> In response, [[Lloyd Banks]] and 50 Cent released the track \"Return of Ja Fool\" on Lloyd Banks' mixtape ''Mo Money in the Bank Pt. 4, Gang Green Season Starts Now''.<ref name=illseed/>\n\nIn an interview with MTV, Ja Rule stated, in reference to his album, ''[[The Mirror (Ja Rule album)|The Mirror]]'':\n\n{{quote|There was a lot of things I wanted to say, and I didn't want there to be any bitter records on the album.

But we can coincide inside of a world. He's doing him, and he's not thinking about me, and I'm doing me and I'm not thinking about him.\"\n\nIn September 2013, in an interview with [[Angie Martinez]] on The Angie Martinez show on HOT 97, both Rule and [[Irv Gotti]] acknowledged 50 Cent not only took a toll on Ja Rule's prominence, but along with the federal indictment, damaged Murder, Inc., as a music label.  They told Martinez their immediate reaction on hearing 50 Cent's single, \"[[In Da Club]]\", on the radio was that it was \"so dope\" and that they had a problem with it. They also disclosed that they had been blackballed from various award shows where 50 Cent was to perform due to their feud. Notwithstanding seeing 50 Cent as a hustler, they liked his entrepreneurial mentality, 10 years on, no longer had a problem with him. Ja Rule indicated he had plans to write a book surrounding the whole experience.\n<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/110089/ja-rule-and-50-cent-squash-beef/ |title=Ja Rule and 50 Cent Squash Beef |website=Inquisitr.com |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2018, the beef reignited after 50 Cent publicly dissed Ja Rule on [[Big Boy (radio host)|Big Boy]]'s Neighborhood leading to Ja Rule retaliating on Twitter the next day.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Lamarre|first=Carl|date=19 January 2018|url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8095111/ja-rule-disses-50-cent-twitter-beef|title= Ja Rule Refuels Feud With 50 Cent on Twitter: 'I Own Your Soul'|magazine= Billboard|accessdate=February 20, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119192128/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8095111/ja-rule-disses-50-cent-twitter-beef|archivedate=January 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Shady/Aftermath====\nThe conflict started after [[50 Cent]] signed to [[Shady Records]] and [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]] in 2002.

Since October 2002 the primary broadcaster has been [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], which is free-of-charge to view.\n\nYouView is also distinctly marketed{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} although it provides the same free channels as Freeview as it uses the same transmitter network.\n\nThe TV channels are transmitted in bundles, called [[Multiplex (television)| multiplexes]], and the available channels are dependent on how many multiplexes are transmitted in each area. Three multiplexes, carrying channels from BBC, ITV, Channel 4, S4C, and Channel 5 as well as radio, are available to 98.5% of the population from 1,154 transmitters. A further 3 multiplexes transmit to 90% of homes from 80 transmitters, and another 2 multiplexes are available to 76% of homes from 30 transmitters. The terrestrial service consisting of just the 3 public service multiplexes, available to 8.5% of the population, is informally called 'Freeview Light' by some websites. In Northern Ireland, a multiplex carrying channels from the [[Republic of Ireland]] can reach 90% of Northern Irish homes from 3 transmitters. Local TV and radio is available from an additional multiplex at 42 transmitters.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/operations/multiplexes|title= Digital UK - Multiplexes|website= www.digitaluk.co.uk}}</ref>{{qn|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{cite web|url= https://ukfree.tv/maps/freeviewlight|title= Full-Freeview vs Freeview Light: map|website=UK Free TV}}</ref>{{qn|date=February 2020}}<ref>http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/tv-research/no3factsheet.pdf</ref>{{qn|date=February 2020}}\n\nCatch-up TV services such as BBC iPlayer are available via the broadband connection of both Freeview and YouView receivers.  On YouView, subscription-TV services from BT, TalkTalk, Plusnet, and global-streaming services can also be received via the broadband connection.

Compared to the previous analogue service, it provided more channels, widescreen, interactive TV and a [[Video on demand#Near video on demand|near video-on-demand]] service using staggered start times for pay-per-view content. Innovations since have included high definition, 3D TV, a [[digital video recorder]], the ability to view recordings on other devices, remote operation via the Internet to add recordings, and on-demand content via the satellite-receiver's broadband connection of both Sky and third-party TV. The Sky subscription also includes access to [[Sky Go]], which allows mobile devices and computers to access subscription content via the Internet.\n\n'''[[Freesat from Sky]]''' is a free satellite-service owned by [[Sky Limited|Sky Ltd]].  Existing Sky TV customers can end their ongoing subscriptions and opt for the Free-To-View viewing-card, which gives them the Freesat from Sky service. Freesat from Sky does not provide digital recording or video-on-demand.  Freesat from Sky has more channels than Freesat, which are mostly international or shopping channels.  The [[electronic program guide|on-screen programme guide]] lists subscription channels even thought they can't be viewed.\n\n'''[[Freesat]]''' is a free satellite-service developed jointly by the BBC and ITV. In contrast to Freesat from Sky, it does not need a viewing card. Like Sky, it provides high-definition content, digital recording and video-on-demand via the broadband connection.  The on-screen programme guide lists the available channels, rather than encrypted channels which need a subscription to view.\n\n[[File:Eurobird.JPG|thumb|\u00bc scale mockup of the [[Eutelsat 28A]] satellite, a [[Spacebus 3000]]B2 manufactured by [[Thales Alenia Space Alcatel Space]]]]\n\nFreesat, Freesat from Sky and Sky TV transmit from [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellite) |Astra]] [[satellite]]s at [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0 east]] ([[Astra 2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]/[[Astra 2G|2G]]).

In the UK, most broadcasters provide catch-up TV services which allow viewing of TV for a window after it was broadcast.  Online video can be viewed via mobile devices, computers, TVs equipped with a built in Internet connection, or TVs connected to an external set-top-box, streaming stick or games console.  Most of the broadcast TV providers have integrated their set-top-boxes with Internet video to provide a hybrid broadcast and online service.\n\n=== Catch-up services ===\n\nSince 2006, UK channel owners and content producers have been creating Internet services to access their programmes. Often, these are available for a window after the broadcast schedule.  These services generally block users outside of the UK.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Service name !! Owner !!

It rebranded to BBC 1 in 1964, the same year that BBC 2 launched, the UK's third analogue terrestrial channel after ITV. Both channels styled as [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] from 1997. BBC News 24 launched as an analogue cable channel in 1997, later rebranding to BBC News.  BBC Parliament, which was originally an analogue cable channel known as The Parliamentary Channel, was acquired by the BBC in 1998.  From 1998 onwards the BBC started digital TV transmissions, launching new channels and broadcasting via satellite in addition to terrestrial and cable. BBC Three closed as a broadcast channel in 2016, continuing as an Internet video service.\n\nThe BBC's Internet-based service iPlayer contains content from the BBC's TV channels, the Welsh-language public-service broadcaster S4C, as well as videos created from BBC radio programmes, with Radio 1 in particular appearing as a channel alongside the normal TV channels.\n\n[[UKTV]] is a commercial broadcaster owned by [[BBC Studios]], one of the BBC's commercial units.

The channels at launch were [[Sky One|Sky Channel]], [[Sky News]], [[Sky Cinema|Sky Movies]] and [[Eurosport]]. They were initially free to receive, and Sky Movies was the first to move to a subscription early in 1990. Sky News was the UK's first dedicated news channel. The new service was the UK's first consumer satellite TV service, beating rival [[British_Satellite_Broadcasting|BSB]], with which Sky would later merge to become BSkyB.  Sky's satellite service grew to become a subscription platform through which Sky offer their own channels, pay-per-view services and channels from other broadcasters.

[[BBC Two]] also showed children's programming all morning until the start of 2013. That channel now broadcasts repeats of BBC One's daytime programmes. [[Channel 4]] predominately broadcasts comedy and music programmes such as ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and ''[[Freshly Squeezed]]'' in its morning slot. The weekday breakfast news programme ends at 9:15&nbsp;am on BBC One and 8:30&nbsp;am on ITV.\n\nFollowing this on BBC One, lifestyle programming is generally shown, including property, auction and home/garden makeover. BBC One continues this genre until after the lunchtime news, whereby afternoon has a soap called ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'' followed by dramas currently occupy the schedule. BBC Two broadcasts repeats of recent BBC One programmes with on-screen signing before airing news and politics programming between 11&nbsp;am and 1&nbsp;pm. ITV on the other hand takes over from GMB at 9:00&nbsp;am, and generally broadcasts more human-interest chat-style shows, including ''[[Lorraine (TV programme)|Lorraine]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' and ''[[Loose Women]]'', in the morning to mid-afternoon slots, with the ''[[ITV Lunchtime News]]'' (including a regional bulletin) at 1:30&nbsp;pm. Channel 4 often shows home-project and archaeology lifestyle programming in the early afternoon after a ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' summary. Channel 5 broadcasts chatshow programmes in the morning including Jeremy Vine with regular news bulletins. In the afternoon it shows a drama followed by an hour of Australian soaps such as ''[[Home and Away]]'' and ''[[Neighbours]]'' and a film.\n\nUntil the end of 2012 BBC One showed children's programmes in the late afternoon but the channel now continues to show lifestyle programming until broadcasting the game show ''[[Pointless (game show)|Pointless]]'' at 5:15&nbsp;pm. BBC Two used to show lifestyle programming such as ''[[Animal Park]]'' in the late afternoon before these programmes were switched to BBC One. BBC Two now broadcasts repeats unless it is showing sporting events. ITV shows a lifestyle programme followed by a chat show such as ''[[The Alan Titchmarsh Show]]'' before repeats of classic ITV shows, such as ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'', ''[[Poirot]]'' and ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'' in late-afternoon, before a gameshow-style programme at 5:00&nbsp;pm, which have included ''[[Golden Balls]]'' and ''[[The Price Is Right (UK game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.\n\nNews bulletins are broadcast between 6&nbsp;pm and 7&nbsp;pm on both BBC One and ITV, with BBC One beginning with the national [[BBC News at Six]] and ITV with the flagship regional news programme. At around 18.30, BBC One broadcasts the regional news programmes whilst ITV broadcasts the [[ITV Evening News]]. [[Channel 4 News]] starts at 7&nbsp;pm.\n\nPrimetime programming is usually dominated by further soaps, including ''Doctors'', ''[[EastEnders]]'' on BBC One, ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[Emmerdale]]'' on ITV, and ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' on Channel 4. These soap operas or 'continuing dramas' as they are now called can vary throughout the year, however weekly dramas, such as ''[[Holby City]]'', are also fixed to scheduling. Because of this, the UK can often rely more heavily on TV guides, be it with the newspaper, online, via information services on the television such as the [[BBC Red Button]] service or the built in [[EPG|Electronic Programme Guides]].\n\nAt 10pm with the flagship national news on BBC One in [[BBC News at Ten]] and on ITV on [[ITV News at Ten]] followed by the regional late night news\n\nAfter midnight, when late evening films are shown, many channels cease broadcasting \"normal\" programming or simulcast with another channel. Before 2000, the channels simply closed down. However, since then programming has been shown continuously. BBC One will join [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] in a multichannel simulcast and BBC Two shows a continuous loop of forthcoming programme previews and trailers, although prior to the completion of Digital switchover BBC Two had filled its overnight downtime with [[Pages from Ceefax]]. Between 2005 and 2007 ITV broadcast the [[ITV Play]] strand of phone-in participation TV programmes but now much of the night is dedicated to the text-based ITV information service [[ITV Nightscreen]]. Previously, Channel 4 had closed down to show live feeds of ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' (in the summer) and its spin-off, ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' (in January). However, since 2010, repeats of Channel 4 daytime shows have typically been shown. Until the end of the 2000s Channel 5 generally showed various sports from around the world, including boxing and football from European leagues as well as live American sport, with phone-in participation-TV ''[[Quiz Call]]'' on weekends. Quiz Call is now shown every night of the week.\n\n==== Weekend ====\n\nWeekend daytime programming traditionally consists of more lifestyle programming, as well as afternoon live and recorded coverage of sporting events and films. There are further battles for viewers in the weekend primetime slot, often featuring reality or talent game shows in the evening. Lunchtime, early evening and late evening news programmes continue on BBC One and ITV although the length of the bulletins are shorter than during the week.\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\n{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}\n\n=== Christian morality ===\n\nIn 1963 [[Mary Whitehouse]], incensed by the liberalising policies followed by [[Hugh Greene|Sir Hugh Greene]], then director general of the BBC, began her letter writing campaign.

They have been awarded annually since 1954, and are only open to British programmes. After all the entries have been received, they are voted for online by all eligible members of the Academy. The winner is chosen from the four nominees by a special jury of nine academy members for each award, the members of each jury selected by the Academy's Television Committee.\n\nThe '''[[National Television Awards]]''' is a British television awards ceremony, sponsored by ITV and initiated in 1995. Although not widely held to be as prestigious as the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards are probably the most prominent ceremony for which the results are voted on by the general public. Unlike the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards allow foreign programmes to be nominated, providing they have been screened on a British channel during the eligible time period.\n\n== Regulation ==\n\n'''[[Ofcom]]''' is the independent regulator and competition authority for the communication industries in the United Kingdom, including television. As the regulatory body for media broadcasts, Ofcom's duties include:\n*Specification of the Broadcast Code, which took effect on 25 July 2005, with the latest version being published October 2008.

The Broadcast Advertising Codes (or the TV codes) are accessible on CAP's web site. The Codes cover advertising standards (the TV Code), guidance notes, scheduling rules, text services (the Teletext Code) and interactive television guidance. The main sections of the TV Code concern compliance, programmes and advertising, unacceptable products, political and controversial issues, misleading advertising, harm and offence, children, medicines, treatments, health claims and nutrition, finance and investments, and religion.<ref name=\"captvcode\">[http://www.cap.org.uk/cap/codes/broadcast_codes/tv_code/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506194851/http://www.cap.org.uk/cap/codes/broadcast_codes/tv_code/ |date=6 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe '''[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]''' is an independent body responsible for resolving complaints relating to the advertising industry within the UK. It is not government funded, but funded by a levy on the advertising industry. It ensures compliance with the Codes created by CAP. The ASA covers all forms of advertising, not just television advertisements. The ASA can refer problematic adverts to Ofcom, since the channels carrying the adverts are ultimately responsible for the advertising content, and are answerable to Ofcom. Ofcom can issue fines or revoke broadcast licences if necessary.\n\n== Licensing ==\n{{main|Television licensing in the United Kingdom}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the [[Crown dependencies]], a '''[[television licence]]''' is required to receive any publicly broadcast television service, from any source.

The launch channel was the [[BBC One|BBC Television Service]], known as BBC 1 since 1964. This was joined by [[ITV (TV network)|Independent Television]], a network of regional franchises launching between 1955 and 1962. The channels transmitted in monochrome using the [[405-line television system]] at 25 frames per second, initially with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 5:4, switching to [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3]] in 1950.\n\n'''[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]''' transmissions started in 1964 and closed in 2012.  The launch channel was [[BBC Two|BBC 2]]. This would be joined by BBC 1, the ITV network, [[Channel 4]] or [[S4C]] in Wales, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] as well as a network of [[Restricted Service Licence#Television|local TV]] channels. Transmissions started using the [[CCIR System I|System I]] standard, a 625-line monochrome picture at 25 frames/second ([[576i]]) and a 4:3 aspect ratio.  Technical advancements included [[PAL|colour]] (1967), [[teletext]] (1974), and [[NICAM|stereo sound]] (1991).  The drive to switch viewers from analogue to digital transmissions was a process called the [[Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom|digital switchover]].\n\nWhilst there are no longer any analogue broadcasts in the UK, a PAL signal may be present in closed RF distribution systems, e.g. a video feed from an intercom in a block of flats, or a security system.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"\n!

For a list, see [[List of former TV channels in the UK]] or [[:Category:Defunct British television channels]].\n\n=== Commentary ===\n\n==== The rise of television in the UK ====\n\n{{Expand section|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was established in 1927 to develop radio broadcasting, and inevitably became involved in TV in 1936. The BBC is funded by income from a \"Broadcast Receiving Licence\" purchased by UK residents. The cost of this is set by agreement with the UK Government.\n\nTelevision caught on in the United Kingdom in 1947, but its expansion was slow. By 1951, with only two transmitters, near [[Alexandra Palace television station|London]] and [[Sutton Coldfield transmitting station|Birmingham]], only 9% of British homes owned a television set. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to have a regular daily television schedule direct to homes and it was the first to have technical professions to work on TVs. (A. Smith, ''Television: An International History'' 1995)\n\nUp until 1972, television broadcasting hours were tightly regulated by the British government, under the control of the Postmaster General. Before the launch of the commercial channel ITV in 1955, the BBC was restricted by law to just five hours maximum of television in a day. This was increased at the launch of the commercial channel ITV to a 7-hour broadcasting day for both channels. Gradually the number of hours were increased. Typically during the late 1960s the law regulated a 50-hour broadcasting week for all television channels in the UK. This meant BBC1, BBC2 and ITV could only broadcast normal programming for 7 hours a day Mondays to Fridays, and 7.5 hours a day on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nUntil 1957, television in the United Kingdom could not air from 6.00pm-7.00pm. This was called \"Toddler's Truce\", where the idea was that parents could put their children to bed, before prime time television would commence. This restriction was lifted in 1957.  However, on Sundays, television remained off the air from 6.00pm-7.00pm. This was in response to religious leaders fears that television would interfere with people attending church services.  In 1958 a compromise was reached, where only religious programming could be aired during this time slot. This restriction was lifted in January 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/30006/toddlers-truce-why-you-couldnt-watch-british-tv-6pm-until-1957|title=The Toddlers' Truce: Why You Couldn't Watch British TV at 6pm Until 1957|date=16 February 2012|website=mentalfloss.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneyweek.com/380333/16-february-1957-the-toddlers-truce-comes-to-an-end/|title=16 February 1957: The 'Toddlers' Truce' comes to an end|date=16 February 2015|website=MoneyWeek}}</ref>\n\nThe Postmaster General allowed exemptions to the regulations.  All schools programming, adult education, religious programming, state occasions, political broadcasts and Welsh language programming were totally exempt from the restrictions.  Sport and outside broadcasting events were given a separate quota of broadcasting hours which could be used in a year, starting off at 200 hours a year in the mid 1950s, rising to a quota of 350 hours a year by the late 1960s.  Broadcasting on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day were also exempt from the tightly controlled restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/features/Limits.html|title=Time Limits|website=www.users.zetnet.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe election of a conservative government in June 1970 brought in changes to the control of broadcasting hours. At first the typical broadcasting day was extended to 8 hours a day, with an increase in exemptions over Christmas and an increase in the sport/outside broadcasting quota.  On 19 January 1972, the then Minister for Posts and Telecommunications, Christopher Chataway, announced to the British House of Commons that all restrictions on broadcasting hours on television would be lifted from that day, with the broadcasters allowed to set their own broadcasting hours from then on. By November 1972 a full daytime schedule had been launched on ITV from 9.30am each day, with the BBC also expanding their schedules to include more daytime programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1972/jan/19/television-and-radio-broadcasting-1|title=TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING (Hansard, 19 January 1972)|website=api.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe UK Government previously appointed people to the BBC's Board of Governors, a body responsible for the general direction of the organisation, and appointment of senior executives, but not its day-to-day management. From 2007, the [[BBC Trust]] replaced the Board of Governors. It is operationally independent of BBC management and external bodies, and aims to act in the best interests of licence fee payers.\n\n[[Commercial television]] was first introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1955. Unlike the US, there was a distinct split between advertisements and programming. Advertisers purely purchased spots within pre-defined breaks within programming, and had no connection to the programme content. The content and nature of adverts being strictly controlled by the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]] the body controlling commercial television.\n\n==== History of satellite television ====\nThe first commercial direct-broadcast satellite (DBS, also known as direct-to-home) service in the United Kingdom, [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television]], was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched [[Astra 1A|Astra]] satellite at [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E|19.2\u00b0 east]], providing four analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent [[VideoCrypt]] video encryption system used the existing PAL broadcast standard, unlike the winner of the UK state DBS licence, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] (BSB).\n\nIn 1990, BSB launched, broadcasting five channels ([[Now (TV channel)|Now]], [[Galaxy (British television)|Galaxy]], [[The Movie Channel (UK)|The Movie Channel]], [[The Power Station (TV channel)|The Power Station]] and [[The Sports Channel]]) in [[Multiplexed Analogue Components|D-MAC]] format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was derived from the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. One of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the [[Squarial]], a flat plate antenna and [[low-noise block converter]] (LNB). Sky's system used conventional and cheaper [[Satellite dish|dish]] and LNB technology.\n\nThe two companies competed over the UK rights to movies. Sky operated from an industrial park in [[Isleworth]] in [[West London (sub region)|West London]], whereas BSB had newly built offices in London ([[Marco Polo House]]). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). BSB's D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky's [[VideoCrypt]] video encryption system.\n\nIn 1994 17% of the group was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] (with [[American depositary receipt|ADRs]] listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]), and [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corporation owns a 35% stake. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nBy 1998, following the launch of several more satellites to Astra's [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E|19.2\u00b0 east]] position, the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from Astra's new satellite, at [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0 east]] position under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyB's analogue service has now been discontinued, with all customers having been migrated to Sky Digital.\n\nIn May 2008, a free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name [[Freesat]], carrying a variety of channels from [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E]], including some content in HD formats.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Television|United Kingdom}}\n\n=== Industry bodies ===\n*[[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union]] (BECTU), [[National Union of Journalists]] (NUJ) and [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], trade unions for members of the broadcasting industry\n*[[Clearcast]], performs clearance of television advertising copy and the final advertisements.

All providers make available the UK's five most-watched channels: [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV (TV channel) |ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)| Channel 5]].\n\nBroadcast television is distributed as radio waves via terrestrial or satellite transmissions, or as electrical or light signals through ground-based cables.

Since October 2002 the primary broadcaster has been [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], which is free-of-charge to view.\n\nYouView is also distinctly marketed{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} although it provides the same free channels as Freeview as it uses the same transmitter network.\n\nThe TV channels are transmitted in bundles, called [[Multiplex (television)| multiplexes]], and the available channels are dependent on how many multiplexes are transmitted in each area. Three multiplexes, carrying channels from BBC, ITV, Channel 4, S4C, and Channel 5 as well as radio, are available to 98.5% of the population from 1,154 transmitters. A further 3 multiplexes transmit to 90% of homes from 80 transmitters, and another 2 multiplexes are available to 76% of homes from 30 transmitters. The terrestrial service consisting of just the 3 public service multiplexes, available to 8.5% of the population, is informally called 'Freeview Light' by some websites. In Northern Ireland, a multiplex carrying channels from the [[Republic of Ireland]] can reach 90% of Northern Irish homes from 3 transmitters. Local TV and radio is available from an additional multiplex at 42 transmitters.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/operations/multiplexes|title= Digital UK - Multiplexes|website= www.digitaluk.co.uk}}</ref>{{qn|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{cite web|url= https://ukfree.tv/maps/freeviewlight|title= Full-Freeview vs Freeview Light: map|website=UK Free TV}}</ref>{{qn|date=February 2020}}<ref>http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/tv-research/no3factsheet.pdf</ref>{{qn|date=February 2020}}\n\nCatch-up TV services such as BBC iPlayer are available via the broadband connection of both Freeview and YouView receivers.  On YouView, subscription-TV services from BT, TalkTalk, Plusnet, and global-streaming services can also be received via the broadband connection. SureTV offers a similar service in Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.\n\n=== Cable television ===\n[[File:Virgin Media cables revealed under pavement.jpg|thumb|right |A pavement dug up, revealing the cables underneath.

The small oval dishes are most likely being used for viewing British services, and are known as [[Minidish]]es. The larger dishes are most likely being used for viewing satellite services from outside the UK.]]\n{{See also|Satellite television by region#United Kingdom and Ireland |List of free-to-air channels at 28%C2%B0E}}\n\nThere are three distinctly-marketed [[direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS) services (also known as direct-to-home (DTH), to be distinguished from satellite signals intended for non-consumer reception).\n\n'''[[Sky UK|Sky TV]]''' is a subscription service operated by [[Sky Limited |Sky Ltd]], owned by [[Comcast]], which launched in 1998 as SkyDigital.  Compared to the previous analogue service, it provided more channels, widescreen, interactive TV and a [[Video on demand#Near video on demand|near video-on-demand]] service using staggered start times for pay-per-view content. Innovations since have included high definition, 3D TV, a [[digital video recorder]], the ability to view recordings on other devices, remote operation via the Internet to add recordings, and on-demand content via the satellite-receiver's broadband connection of both Sky and third-party TV. The Sky subscription also includes access to [[Sky Go]], which allows mobile devices and computers to access subscription content via the Internet.\n\n'''[[Freesat from Sky]]''' is a free satellite-service owned by [[Sky Limited|Sky Ltd]].  Existing Sky TV customers can end their ongoing subscriptions and opt for the Free-To-View viewing-card, which gives them the Freesat from Sky service. Freesat from Sky does not provide digital recording or video-on-demand.  Freesat from Sky has more channels than Freesat, which are mostly international or shopping channels.  The [[electronic program guide|on-screen programme guide]] lists subscription channels even thought they can't be viewed.\n\n'''[[Freesat]]''' is a free satellite-service developed jointly by the BBC and ITV. In contrast to Freesat from Sky, it does not need a viewing card. Like Sky, it provides high-definition content, digital recording and video-on-demand via the broadband connection.  The on-screen programme guide lists the available channels, rather than encrypted channels which need a subscription to view.\n\n[[File:Eurobird.JPG|thumb|\u00bc scale mockup of the [[Eutelsat 28A]] satellite, a [[Spacebus 3000]]B2 manufactured by [[Thales Alenia Space Alcatel Space]]]]\n\nFreesat, Freesat from Sky and Sky TV transmit from [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellite) |Astra]] [[satellite]]s at [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0 east]] ([[Astra 2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]/[[Astra 2G|2G]]).

In the UK, most broadcasters provide catch-up TV services which allow viewing of TV for a window after it was broadcast.  Online video can be viewed via mobile devices, computers, TVs equipped with a built in Internet connection, or TVs connected to an external set-top-box, streaming stick or games console.  Most of the broadcast TV providers have integrated their set-top-boxes with Internet video to provide a hybrid broadcast and online service.\n\n=== Catch-up services ===\n\nSince 2006, UK channel owners and content producers have been creating Internet services to access their programmes. Often, these are available for a window after the broadcast schedule.  These services generally block users outside of the UK.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Service name !! Owner !!

It rebranded to BBC 1 in 1964, the same year that BBC 2 launched, the UK's third analogue terrestrial channel after ITV. Both channels styled as [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] from 1997. BBC News 24 launched as an analogue cable channel in 1997, later rebranding to BBC News.  BBC Parliament, which was originally an analogue cable channel known as The Parliamentary Channel, was acquired by the BBC in 1998.  From 1998 onwards the BBC started digital TV transmissions, launching new channels and broadcasting via satellite in addition to terrestrial and cable. BBC Three closed as a broadcast channel in 2016, continuing as an Internet video service.\n\nThe BBC's Internet-based service iPlayer contains content from the BBC's TV channels, the Welsh-language public-service broadcaster S4C, as well as videos created from BBC radio programmes, with Radio 1 in particular appearing as a channel alongside the normal TV channels.\n\n[[UKTV]] is a commercial broadcaster owned by [[BBC Studios]], one of the BBC's commercial units.

The new service was the UK's first consumer satellite TV service, beating rival [[British_Satellite_Broadcasting|BSB]], with which Sky would later merge to become BSkyB.  Sky's satellite service grew to become a subscription platform through which Sky offer their own channels, pay-per-view services and channels from other broadcasters.

[[BBC Two]] also showed children's programming all morning until the start of 2013. That channel now broadcasts repeats of BBC One's daytime programmes. [[Channel 4]] predominately broadcasts comedy and music programmes such as ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and ''[[Freshly Squeezed]]'' in its morning slot. The weekday breakfast news programme ends at 9:15&nbsp;am on BBC One and 8:30&nbsp;am on ITV.\n\nFollowing this on BBC One, lifestyle programming is generally shown, including property, auction and home/garden makeover. BBC One continues this genre until after the lunchtime news, whereby afternoon has a soap called ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'' followed by dramas currently occupy the schedule. BBC Two broadcasts repeats of recent BBC One programmes with on-screen signing before airing news and politics programming between 11&nbsp;am and 1&nbsp;pm. ITV on the other hand takes over from GMB at 9:00&nbsp;am, and generally broadcasts more human-interest chat-style shows, including ''[[Lorraine (TV programme)|Lorraine]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' and ''[[Loose Women]]'', in the morning to mid-afternoon slots, with the ''[[ITV Lunchtime News]]'' (including a regional bulletin) at 1:30&nbsp;pm. Channel 4 often shows home-project and archaeology lifestyle programming in the early afternoon after a ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' summary. Channel 5 broadcasts chatshow programmes in the morning including Jeremy Vine with regular news bulletins. In the afternoon it shows a drama followed by an hour of Australian soaps such as ''[[Home and Away]]'' and ''[[Neighbours]]'' and a film.\n\nUntil the end of 2012 BBC One showed children's programmes in the late afternoon but the channel now continues to show lifestyle programming until broadcasting the game show ''[[Pointless (game show)|Pointless]]'' at 5:15&nbsp;pm. BBC Two used to show lifestyle programming such as ''[[Animal Park]]'' in the late afternoon before these programmes were switched to BBC One. BBC Two now broadcasts repeats unless it is showing sporting events. ITV shows a lifestyle programme followed by a chat show such as ''[[The Alan Titchmarsh Show]]'' before repeats of classic ITV shows, such as ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'', ''[[Poirot]]'' and ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'' in late-afternoon, before a gameshow-style programme at 5:00&nbsp;pm, which have included ''[[Golden Balls]]'' and ''[[The Price Is Right (UK game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.\n\nNews bulletins are broadcast between 6&nbsp;pm and 7&nbsp;pm on both BBC One and ITV, with BBC One beginning with the national [[BBC News at Six]] and ITV with the flagship regional news programme. At around 18.30, BBC One broadcasts the regional news programmes whilst ITV broadcasts the [[ITV Evening News]]. [[Channel 4 News]] starts at 7&nbsp;pm.\n\nPrimetime programming is usually dominated by further soaps, including ''Doctors'', ''[[EastEnders]]'' on BBC One, ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[Emmerdale]]'' on ITV, and ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' on Channel 4. These soap operas or 'continuing dramas' as they are now called can vary throughout the year, however weekly dramas, such as ''[[Holby City]]'', are also fixed to scheduling. Because of this, the UK can often rely more heavily on TV guides, be it with the newspaper, online, via information services on the television such as the [[BBC Red Button]] service or the built in [[EPG|Electronic Programme Guides]].\n\nAt 10pm with the flagship national news on BBC One in [[BBC News at Ten]] and on ITV on [[ITV News at Ten]] followed by the regional late night news\n\nAfter midnight, when late evening films are shown, many channels cease broadcasting \"normal\" programming or simulcast with another channel. Before 2000, the channels simply closed down. However, since then programming has been shown continuously. BBC One will join [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] in a multichannel simulcast and BBC Two shows a continuous loop of forthcoming programme previews and trailers, although prior to the completion of Digital switchover BBC Two had filled its overnight downtime with [[Pages from Ceefax]]. Between 2005 and 2007 ITV broadcast the [[ITV Play]] strand of phone-in participation TV programmes but now much of the night is dedicated to the text-based ITV information service [[ITV Nightscreen]]. Previously, Channel 4 had closed down to show live feeds of ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' (in the summer) and its spin-off, ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' (in January). However, since 2010, repeats of Channel 4 daytime shows have typically been shown. Until the end of the 2000s Channel 5 generally showed various sports from around the world, including boxing and football from European leagues as well as live American sport, with phone-in participation-TV ''[[Quiz Call]]'' on weekends. Quiz Call is now shown every night of the week.\n\n==== Weekend ====\n\nWeekend daytime programming traditionally consists of more lifestyle programming, as well as afternoon live and recorded coverage of sporting events and films. There are further battles for viewers in the weekend primetime slot, often featuring reality or talent game shows in the evening. Lunchtime, early evening and late evening news programmes continue on BBC One and ITV although the length of the bulletins are shorter than during the week.\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\n{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}\n\n=== Christian morality ===\n\nIn 1963 [[Mary Whitehouse]], incensed by the liberalising policies followed by [[Hugh Greene|Sir Hugh Greene]], then director general of the BBC, began her letter writing campaign.

In 2008, [[Toby Young]] in an article for ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote: \"On the wider question of whether sex and violence on TV has led to a general moral collapse in society at large, the jury is still out.

They have been awarded annually since 1954, and are only open to British programmes. After all the entries have been received, they are voted for online by all eligible members of the Academy. The winner is chosen from the four nominees by a special jury of nine academy members for each award, the members of each jury selected by the Academy's Television Committee.\n\nThe '''[[National Television Awards]]''' is a British television awards ceremony, sponsored by ITV and initiated in 1995. Although not widely held to be as prestigious as the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards are probably the most prominent ceremony for which the results are voted on by the general public. Unlike the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards allow foreign programmes to be nominated, providing they have been screened on a British channel during the eligible time period.\n\n== Regulation ==\n\n'''[[Ofcom]]''' is the independent regulator and competition authority for the communication industries in the United Kingdom, including television. As the regulatory body for media broadcasts, Ofcom's duties include:\n*Specification of the Broadcast Code, which took effect on 25 July 2005, with the latest version being published October 2008.

The Broadcast Advertising Codes (or the TV codes) are accessible on CAP's web site. The Codes cover advertising standards (the TV Code), guidance notes, scheduling rules, text services (the Teletext Code) and interactive television guidance. The main sections of the TV Code concern compliance, programmes and advertising, unacceptable products, political and controversial issues, misleading advertising, harm and offence, children, medicines, treatments, health claims and nutrition, finance and investments, and religion.<ref name=\"captvcode\">[http://www.cap.org.uk/cap/codes/broadcast_codes/tv_code/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506194851/http://www.cap.org.uk/cap/codes/broadcast_codes/tv_code/ |date=6 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe '''[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]''' is an independent body responsible for resolving complaints relating to the advertising industry within the UK. It is not government funded, but funded by a levy on the advertising industry. It ensures compliance with the Codes created by CAP. The ASA covers all forms of advertising, not just television advertisements. The ASA can refer problematic adverts to Ofcom, since the channels carrying the adverts are ultimately responsible for the advertising content, and are answerable to Ofcom. Ofcom can issue fines or revoke broadcast licences if necessary.\n\n== Licensing ==\n{{main|Television licensing in the United Kingdom}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the [[Crown dependencies]], a '''[[television licence]]''' is required to receive any publicly broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions.

The launch channel was the [[BBC One|BBC Television Service]], known as BBC 1 since 1964. This was joined by [[ITV (TV network)|Independent Television]], a network of regional franchises launching between 1955 and 1962. The channels transmitted in monochrome using the [[405-line television system]] at 25 frames per second, initially with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 5:4, switching to [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3]] in 1950.\n\n'''[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]''' transmissions started in 1964 and closed in 2012.  The launch channel was [[BBC Two|BBC 2]]. This would be joined by BBC 1, the ITV network, [[Channel 4]] or [[S4C]] in Wales, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] as well as a network of [[Restricted Service Licence#Television|local TV]] channels. Transmissions started using the [[CCIR System I|System I]] standard, a 625-line monochrome picture at 25 frames/second ([[576i]]) and a 4:3 aspect ratio.  Technical advancements included [[PAL|colour]] (1967), [[teletext]] (1974), and [[NICAM|stereo sound]] (1991).  The drive to switch viewers from analogue to digital transmissions was a process called the [[Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom|digital switchover]].\n\nWhilst there are no longer any analogue broadcasts in the UK, a PAL signal may be present in closed RF distribution systems, e.g. a video feed from an intercom in a block of flats, or a security system.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"\n!

The BBC is funded by income from a \"Broadcast Receiving Licence\" purchased by UK residents. The cost of this is set by agreement with the UK Government.\n\nTelevision caught on in the United Kingdom in 1947, but its expansion was slow. By 1951, with only two transmitters, near [[Alexandra Palace television station|London]] and [[Sutton Coldfield transmitting station|Birmingham]], only 9% of British homes owned a television set. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to have a regular daily television schedule direct to homes and it was the first to have technical professions to work on TVs. (A. Smith, ''Television: An International History'' 1995)\n\nUp until 1972, television broadcasting hours were tightly regulated by the British government, under the control of the Postmaster General. Before the launch of the commercial channel ITV in 1955, the BBC was restricted by law to just five hours maximum of television in a day. This was increased at the launch of the commercial channel ITV to a 7-hour broadcasting day for both channels. Gradually the number of hours were increased. Typically during the late 1960s the law regulated a 50-hour broadcasting week for all television channels in the UK. This meant BBC1, BBC2 and ITV could only broadcast normal programming for 7 hours a day Mondays to Fridays, and 7.5 hours a day on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nUntil 1957, television in the United Kingdom could not air from 6.00pm-7.00pm. This was called \"Toddler's Truce\", where the idea was that parents could put their children to bed, before prime time television would commence. This restriction was lifted in 1957.  However, on Sundays, television remained off the air from 6.00pm-7.00pm. This was in response to religious leaders fears that television would interfere with people attending church services.  In 1958 a compromise was reached, where only religious programming could be aired during this time slot. This restriction was lifted in January 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/30006/toddlers-truce-why-you-couldnt-watch-british-tv-6pm-until-1957|title=The Toddlers' Truce: Why You Couldn't Watch British TV at 6pm Until 1957|date=16 February 2012|website=mentalfloss.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneyweek.com/380333/16-february-1957-the-toddlers-truce-comes-to-an-end/|title=16 February 1957: The 'Toddlers' Truce' comes to an end|date=16 February 2015|website=MoneyWeek}}</ref>\n\nThe Postmaster General allowed exemptions to the regulations.  All schools programming, adult education, religious programming, state occasions, political broadcasts and Welsh language programming were totally exempt from the restrictions.  Sport and outside broadcasting events were given a separate quota of broadcasting hours which could be used in a year, starting off at 200 hours a year in the mid 1950s, rising to a quota of 350 hours a year by the late 1960s.  Broadcasting on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day were also exempt from the tightly controlled restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/features/Limits.html|title=Time Limits|website=www.users.zetnet.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe election of a conservative government in June 1970 brought in changes to the control of broadcasting hours. At first the typical broadcasting day was extended to 8 hours a day, with an increase in exemptions over Christmas and an increase in the sport/outside broadcasting quota.  On 19 January 1972, the then Minister for Posts and Telecommunications, Christopher Chataway, announced to the British House of Commons that all restrictions on broadcasting hours on television would be lifted from that day, with the broadcasters allowed to set their own broadcasting hours from then on. By November 1972 a full daytime schedule had been launched on ITV from 9.30am each day, with the BBC also expanding their schedules to include more daytime programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1972/jan/19/television-and-radio-broadcasting-1|title=TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING (Hansard, 19 January 1972)|website=api.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe UK Government previously appointed people to the BBC's Board of Governors, a body responsible for the general direction of the organisation, and appointment of senior executives, but not its day-to-day management. From 2007, the [[BBC Trust]] replaced the Board of Governors. It is operationally independent of BBC management and external bodies, and aims to act in the best interests of licence fee payers.\n\n[[Commercial television]] was first introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1955. Unlike the US, there was a distinct split between advertisements and programming. Advertisers purely purchased spots within pre-defined breaks within programming, and had no connection to the programme content. The content and nature of adverts being strictly controlled by the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]] the body controlling commercial television.\n\n==== History of satellite television ====\nThe first commercial direct-broadcast satellite (DBS, also known as direct-to-home) service in the United Kingdom, [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television]], was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched [[Astra 1A|Astra]] satellite at [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E|19.2\u00b0 east]], providing four analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent [[VideoCrypt]] video encryption system used the existing PAL broadcast standard, unlike the winner of the UK state DBS licence, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] (BSB).\n\nIn 1990, BSB launched, broadcasting five channels ([[Now (TV channel)|Now]], [[Galaxy (British television)|Galaxy]], [[The Movie Channel (UK)|The Movie Channel]], [[The Power Station (TV channel)|The Power Station]] and [[The Sports Channel]]) in [[Multiplexed Analogue Components|D-MAC]] format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was derived from the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. One of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the [[Squarial]], a flat plate antenna and [[low-noise block converter]] (LNB). Sky's system used conventional and cheaper [[Satellite dish|dish]] and LNB technology.\n\nThe two companies competed over the UK rights to movies. Sky operated from an industrial park in [[Isleworth]] in [[West London (sub region)|West London]], whereas BSB had newly built offices in London ([[Marco Polo House]]). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). BSB's D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky's [[VideoCrypt]] video encryption system.\n\nIn 1994 17% of the group was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] (with [[American depositary receipt|ADRs]] listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]), and [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corporation owns a 35% stake. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nBy 1998, following the launch of several more satellites to Astra's [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E|19.2\u00b0 east]] position, the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from Astra's new satellite, at [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0 east]] position under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyB's analogue service has now been discontinued, with all customers having been migrated to Sky Digital.\n\nIn May 2008, a free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name [[Freesat]], carrying a variety of channels from [[Astra 28.2\u00b0E]], including some content in HD formats.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Television|United Kingdom}}\n\n=== Industry bodies ===\n*[[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union]] (BECTU), [[National Union of Journalists]] (NUJ) and [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], trade unions for members of the broadcasting industry\n*[[Clearcast]], performs clearance of television advertising copy and the final advertisements.

It has solitary flower heads about 2 inches (5&nbsp;cm) across. The purple ray  florets surround black and yellow discs. The [[lanceolate]] leaves are opposite the flower heads.\n\n== History ==\nThe species was first collected in 1789 at [[Tixtla]], [[Guerrero]], by [[Mart\u00edn Sess\u00e9 y Lacasta|Sess\u00e9]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Moci\u00f1o|Moci\u00f1o]]. It was formally described as ''Zinnia violacea'' by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 Cavanilles|Cavanilles]] in 1791. [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin|Jacquin]] described it again in 1792 as ''Zinnia elegans'', which was the name that Sess\u00e9 and Mo\u00e7i\u00f1o had used in their manuscript of ''Plantae Novae Hispaniae'', which was not published until 1890.<ref>Kirkbride, J. H. & J. H. Wiersma. (2007). Proposal to conserve the name ''Zinnia elegans'' against ''Z. violacea''. ''Taxon'' 56(3):958-959.</ref> The genus was named by [[Carl von Linn\u00e9]] after the German botanist [[Johann Gottfried Zinn]], who described the species now known as ''[[Zinnia peruviana]]'' in 1757 as ''Rudbeckia foliis oppositis hirsutis ovato-acutis, calyce imbricatus, radii petalis pistillatis''. Linn\u00e9 realised that it was not a ''[[Rudbeckia]]''.\n\n== Habits ==\nFlowering occurs between spring to fall.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe garden zinnia was bred via [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] from the wild form. Zinnias are popular garden plants with hundreds of [[cultivars]] in many flower colours, sizes and forms. There are giant forms with flower heads up to 6 in (15&nbsp;cm) in diameter.\n\nFlower colours range from white and cream to pinks, reds, and purples, to green, yellow, [[apricot (colour)|apricot]], orange, [[salmon (colour)|salmon]], and bronze. Some are striped, speckled or bicoloured. There are \"[[pom-pom]]\" forms that resemble [[dahlias]]. Sizes range from dwarf varieties of less than 6 inches (15&nbsp;cm) in height to 3 feet (90&nbsp;cm) tall. The [[powdery mildew]] common to zinnias in humid climates is less common in recently developed varieties, which are resistant.\n\nOther cultivars include 'Magellan', 'Envy Double', 'Fireworks', 'Purple Prince', 'Blue Point Purple', 'Profusion Cherry', 'Profusion Orange', 'Star Gold', 'Star Orange', and several white-flowered types such as 'Crystal White', 'Purity', and 'Profusion White'. Mixed-colour seed selections are available.\n\n=== Growth ===\nZinnias grow easily and prefer well-drained, [[loam]]y soil and full sun. They grow best in dry, warm, frost-free regions, and many kinds are drought-tolerant. Some may be grown indoors.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Zinnia July 2010-1.jpg|''Zinnia elegans'' with a wasp\nFile:Zinnia elegans at Kadavoor.jpg|''Zinnia elegans'' in [[Kerala]]\nFile:Abejorro (Bombus lucorum) en una Zinnia elegans, Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico, M\u00fanich, Alemania, 2013-09-08, DD 01.JPG|Bumblebee (''Bombus lucorum'') on a ''Zinnia elegans'', Botanic Garden of Munich, Germany\nFile:Plumchen 002.jpg|Closeup of flower center, ''Z.

It was started in 1948 by [[John Fluke]], who was a friend and roommate of [[David Packard]], future co-founder of [[Hewlett-Packard]], when both were employed at [[General Electric]].\n\n== History ==\n\nFluke Corporation was founded in Washington state by John Fluke on October 7, 1953 as the John Fluke Manufacturing Company, Inc., producing electrical metering equipment.\n\nIn 1987 Fluke entered a partnership with the [[Dutch]] electronics manufacturer [[Philips]]. Aside from access to their respective oversea markets, the partnership brought to the development of the [[scopemeter]], an instrument combining features of an [[oscilloscope]] and a [[multimeter]]. Fluke finally puchased the testing and measurements division of Philips in 1993 for $41.8 millions.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 15 |date=1996 |publisher=St. James Press |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/fluke-corporation-history/}}</ref> Notably, the Philips PM series of measurement instruments was rebranded as Fluke.\n\nFluke was bought by the [[Danaher Corporation]] in 1998. Danaher spun off several subsidiaries, including Fluke, in 2016 to create Fortive.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Zacks Equity Research|title=Danaher Completes Fortive Spin-Off, Trading to Begin Today|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/danaher-completes-fortive-spin-off-125312990.html|website=Yahoo Finance|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Subsidiaries ==\n=== Pomona Electronics ===\nPomona Electronics is a company specializing in electronic test equipment and accessories.
