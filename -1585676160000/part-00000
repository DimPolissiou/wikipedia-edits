A road coach service then extended the service into Bishop Auckland, and a secondary road coach service also ran to [[Rainton Meadows]]. After completion of the Shildon tunnel, the BA&WR erected a permanent station on the current site, which opened to freight on 8 November 1843, and passengers on 30 January 1843.<ref name=ButtP35/> All operations were sub-leased as agreed to the S&DR.<ref name=ButtP35/>\n\nIn 1844, after the [[West Durham Railway]] extended from a junction with the [[Clarence Railway]] at {{stnlnk|Byers Green}} to Crook, the S&DR extended the BA&WR from Bishop Auckland along the river valley to [[Witton-le-Wear]], and then into {{rws|Crook}}. In 1845, the S&DR came to an agreement with the [[Derwent Iron Company]] to sub-lease the southern section of the former [[Stanhope and Tyne Railway]]. It extended the line from Crook to {{stnlnk|Waskerley}} and then to [[Blackhill, Consett|Blackhill]], and it was opened as the [[Weardale Extension Railway|Weardale Extension Railway (WXR)]].<ref name=ButtP35/><ref name=DisBisAuk/>\n\nIn July 1845 Parliament passed the Wear Valley Act, which allowed the extension of the BA&WR from a junction at Witton-le-Wear to {{stnlnk|Frosterley}}, and a small branch line across the river to [[Bishopley]]. With all works again undertaken by the S&DR, this line opened on 3 August 1847. After these works had been completed, the BA&WR amalgamated with the WXR. All service were operated by the S&DR, which officially took over the new company in January 1857.<ref name=ButtP35/><ref name=DisBisAuk/>\n\nOn 1 April 1857, the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway (NER)]] started a service from {{stnlnk|Durham}} to Bishop Auckland at a new terminus in Tenter Street. However, the S&DR and NER quickly came to the agreement of development of a joint station in the town, and so rebuilt the existing former BA&WR station, with NER trains using it from December 1857.<ref name=\"ButtP35\"/><ref name=DisBisAuk/>\n\nIn 1862, an Act of Parliament was passed allowing the S&DR backed [[Frosterley and Stanhope Railway]] to extend the line to {{stnlnk|Stanhope}}, thus allowing trains to transport [[limestone]] from the Newlandside Estate on the south side of the town. This brought about the extension of the [[South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway]] from {{stnlnk|Barnard Castle}} into Bishop Auckland in 1862, and with the final addition of traffic from an extension of the [[Clarence Railway]] at {{stnlnk|Byers Green}}, eventually resulted in the NER rebuilding the station again in December 1867.<ref name=ButtP35/><ref name=DisBisAuk/>\n\nThe final extension of the Weardale Railway to {{stnlnk|Wearhead}} opened on 21 October 1895, with the NER having resited the station at {{stnlnk|Stanhope}} to provide a more suitable gradient for the heavy limestone trains. Between Eastgate and Westgate at Cambo Keels, sidings were established to serve the Weardale Iron Company's Heights limestone quarry, which is still in operation today. This final extension of the Weardale Railway bought about the final and largest layout of Bishop Auckland railway station, which was now rebuilt in triangular form with four platforms in 1905.<ref name=ButtP35/><ref name=DisBisAuk/>  Only three of these were normally used for passenger trains, with platform 1 handing trains towards Crook & Wearhead and platforms 2 & 3 dealing with services on the Barnard Castle, Ferryhill & Durham lines.

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.\n\n[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of [[Irish literature|literature]].

The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain.

The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].\n\nDaniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or \"[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]\". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376\u2013400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914.

The Act was passed but with the \"temporary\" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war.

He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R.

The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>\n\nThe [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom.

Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.<ref name=\"MEclimate\">{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}}|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\nPrecipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.<ref name=\"MErainfall\">{{cite web |title=Rainfall |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}} |url= http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |access-date=5 November 2008}}</ref> [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.\n\nInland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter.

Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name=\"cap_reforms\">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform \u2013 A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nForested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates.

Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\nThe [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast.

Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 \u2013 c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coisc\u00e9im]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\nIn English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo\u2013Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"[[Bloomsday]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cr\u00e9 na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.\n\n[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century]]\n\n====Music====\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: \"Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister\", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: \"Medieval Ireland, Music in\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.\n\nIrish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26\u201330 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}</ref> However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like {{lang|ga|[[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada]]}} and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.\n\n====Art====\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period.

The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAI History: 1921\u20131930 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=5 June 2009 |url= http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222&Itemid=226 |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.\n\n[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]\nIn 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as \"[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]\" and that the IFA's team be known as \"[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]\" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]].

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.\n\n[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of [[Irish literature|literature]].

The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously.

After the passing of [[Test Act#1672 Act|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728.

In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name=\"Ward 1994 28\">{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782\u20131992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=978-0-8132-0784-1}}</ref>\n\nThe passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799.

The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].\n\nDaniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or \"[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]\". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376\u2013400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914.

The Act was passed but with the \"temporary\" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war.

For many multinationals the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R.

The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>\n\nThe [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom.

Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.<ref name=whyte>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |chapter=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921\u20131968? |last=Whyte |first=John |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=O'Connell |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0-7190-0919-7 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] |year=1983 |access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0-10-103802-X |year= 1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=Northern Ireland Office |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet|author-link=Northern Ireland Office }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.\n\nThe substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first=Tauno |last=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D.

They share an [[Irish border|open border]] and both are part of the [[Common Travel Area]].\n\nBoth the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the [[European Union]], having both acceded to its precursor entity, the European Economic Community [EEC], in 1973, and as a consequence there is [[internal market|free movement of people, goods, services and capital]] across the border.\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\n[[File:\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in 2010.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ga|[[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]]}}, the official residence of the [[President of Ireland]]]]\nThe [[Republic of Ireland]] is a [[parliamentary democracy]] based on the British model, with a [[Constitution of Ireland|written constitution]] and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The [[Government of Ireland|government]] is headed by a prime minister, the [[Taoiseach]], who is appointed by the [[President of Ireland|President]] on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|''D\u00e1il'']].

The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion with each party's representation in the assembly. Its capital is [[Belfast]].\n\nUltimately political power is held by the [[UK government]], from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' 650 MPs. The [[Northern Ireland Secretary]] is a cabinet-level post in the British government.\n\nAlong with [[England and Wales]] and with Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] as their court of final appeal.\n\n===All-island institutions===\nAs part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The [[North/South Ministerial Council]] is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island \"implementation bodies,\" and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: [[Waterways Ireland]], the [[Food Safety Promotion Board]], [[InterTradeIreland]], the [[Special European Union Programmes Body]], [[the North/South Language Body]] and the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights|Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission]].\n\nThe [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matters of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, \"regular and frequent\" meetings co-chaired by the ROI Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved [[all-Ireland]] issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.\n\nThe [[North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association]] is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Economy of Northern Ireland}}\n{{See also|International Financial Services Centre}}\nDespite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the [[euro]] and [[pound sterling]]), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis.

Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.<ref name=\"MEclimate\">{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}}|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\nPrecipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail.

Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name=\"cap_reforms\">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform \u2013 A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nForested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates.

The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.\n\nIreland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]]. The largest denomination is [[Roman Catholicism]], representing over 73% for the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland).

Counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] have been broken up into smaller administrative areas.

A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.\n\nEmigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, in all of which a large [[Irish diaspora]] lives. {{As of|2006}}, 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, are of Irish descent,<ref>\"[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=2&Data=Count&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories \u2013 20% sample data]\".

Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\nThe [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast.

These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the [[fall of Rome]], earning Ireland the sobriquet, \"the island of saints and scholars\".\n\nSince the 20th century [[Irish pub]]s worldwide have become outposts of Irish culture, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the [[Abbey Theatre]], which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is {{lang|ga|[[An Taibhdhearc]]}}, which was established in 1928 in [[Galway]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stair na Taibhdheirce |publisher={{lang|ga|An Taibhdheirce}} |date=2014 |url= http://antaibhdhearc.com/theatre-info/fuinn/ |access-date= 28 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=An Taibhdhearc |publisher=Fodor's |url= http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141002060446/http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands/ |archive-date=2 October 2014}}</ref> Playwrights such as [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], [[Brian Friel]], [[Sebastian Barry]], [[Conor McPherson]] and [[Billy Roche]] are internationally renowned.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Houston |first=Eugenie |title=Working and Living in Ireland |publisher=Working and Living Publications |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-9536896-8-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/workinglivingini00euge/page/253 253] |url=https://archive.org/details/workinglivingini00euge/page/253 }}</ref>\n\n===Arts===\n{{Main|Music of Ireland|Irish dance|Irish literature|Irish art|Irish theatre}}\n\n[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|upright|Illuminated page from [[Book of Kells]]]]\n\n====Literature====\nIreland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 \u2013 c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coisc\u00e9im]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\nIn English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo\u2013Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"[[Bloomsday]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cr\u00e9 na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.\n\n[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century]]\n\n====Music====\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: \"Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister\", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: \"Medieval Ireland, Music in\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.\n\nIrish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26\u201330 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}</ref> However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like {{lang|ga|[[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada]]}} and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.\n\n====Art====\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period.

[[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard.

A study conducted by Perova and Vakis revealed that the program increased spending on food categories such as breads and cereals, vegetables, fruits, and tubers among participating households compared to a control group. The evidence suggests that more nutritious calories were consumed as a result of the cash transfers. Despite improving diets and increasing health service utilization, the JUNTOS program has not been able to affect final outcome indicators of nutrition.<ref name=Perova/> There were increases in per capita spending, food expenditure, decreases in severity and poverty gap, increases in school attendance and reductions of school dropout.

Calculations were controlled for household factors. They found that the VL transfers were targeted more toward lower quintile households, with the poorest 40% receiving three times as much aid as the richest 20%. From 1996 to 2000, the stunting rate among children decreased by 0.2%, from 26% to 25.8%, a statistically insignificant decrease.

The program targets impoverished households with children under the age of 14, and transfers are given to mothers. The agreement includes the completion of vaccination charts and pre and post-natal health check-ups, as well as using the National Nutritional Assistance Program package for children under three years old, which includes using chlorinated water and anti-parasite medicine. The program aims to focus more on addressing malnutrition in children, encouraging families to use the transfers to purchase more high protein foods. A study conducted by Perova and Vakis revealed that the program increased spending on food categories such as breads and cereals, vegetables, fruits, and tubers among participating households compared to a control group. The evidence suggests that more nutritious calories were consumed as a result of the cash transfers. Despite improving diets and increasing health service utilization, the JUNTOS program has not been able to affect final outcome indicators of nutrition.<ref name=Perova/> There were increases in per capita spending, food expenditure, decreases in severity and poverty gap, increases in school attendance and reductions of school dropout.

The [[Gezer]] calendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] one that, through the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], later became the [[Roman script]].

The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works associated with them.\n* [[Archaic Biblical Hebrew]] from the 10th to the 6th century BCE, corresponding to the Monarchic Period until the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]] and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]), notably the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). Also called Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew. It was written in the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]].

Basically similar to Classical Biblical Hebrew, apart from a few foreign words adopted for mainly governmental terms, and some syntactical innovations such as the use of the particle ''she-'' (alternative of \"asher\", meaning \"that, which, who\"). It adopted the [[Aramaic alphabet|Imperial Aramaic script]] (from which the modern Hebrew script descends).\n* [[Israelian Hebrew]] is a proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew, believed to have existed in all eras of the language, in some cases competing with late biblical Hebrew as an explanation for non-standard linguistic features of biblical texts.\n\n====Early post-Biblical Hebrew====\n* [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Scroll]] Hebrew from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, corresponding to the Hellenistic and Roman Periods before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, and represented by the Qumran Scrolls that form most (but not all) of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Commonly abbreviated as DSS Hebrew, also called Qumran Hebrew. The Imperial Aramaic script of the earlier scrolls in the 3rd century BCE evolved into the [[Hebrew square script]] of the later scrolls in the 1st century CE, also known as ''ketav Ashuri'' (Assyrian script), still in use today.\n* [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] from the 1st to the 3rd or 4th century CE, corresponding to the Roman Period after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and represented by the bulk of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]] within the [[Talmud]] and by the Dead Sea Scrolls, notably the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba]] letters and the [[Copper Scroll]].

The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also called [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew I), which was a [[spoken language]], and [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a [[literary language]]. The earlier section of the Talmud is the [[Mishnah]] that was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and was written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the [[Midrash halakha|halachic]] [[Midrash]]im ([[Sifra]], [[Sifre]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mechilta]] etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the [[Tosefta]]. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is ''[[Baraita|Baraitot]]''. The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.\n\nAbout a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. The later section of the Talmud, the [[Gemara]], generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew, which sometimes occurs in the text of the Gemara.\n\nHebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel's religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries.<ref>[http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html Languages of the World (Hebrew)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117194849/http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html |date=17 January 2009 }}</ref> After the 2nd century CE when the [[Roman Empire]] exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.\n\n=== Medieval Hebrew ===\n{{Main|Medieval Hebrew}}\n[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|[[Aleppo Codex]]: 10th century [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] pointing (Joshua 1:1).]]\n[[File:Cochin Jewish Inscription.JPG|thumb|Kochangadi Synagogue in [[Kochi]], India dated to 1344.]]\n\nAfter the Talmud, various regional literary dialects of [[Medieval Hebrew]] evolved. The most important is [[Tiberian Hebrew]] or Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect of [[Tiberias]] in [[Galilee]] that became the standard for vocalizing the [[Hebrew Bible]] and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called \"Biblical Hebrew\" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however, properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the remarkable scholarship of the [[Masoretes]] (from ''masoret'' meaning \"tradition\"), who added [[niqqud|vowel points]] and [[Cantillation|grammar points]] to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. The [[Syriac alphabet]], precursor to the [[Arabic alphabet]], also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. The [[Aleppo Codex]], a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely in [[Tiberias]], and survives to this day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.\n\nDuring the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]], important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the [[Islamic grammatical tradition|grammarians]] of [[Classical Arabic]]. Important Hebrew grammarians were [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]], [[Jonah ibn Janah]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]<ref>Abraham ibn Ezra, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/19685 ''Hebrew Grammar''], Venice 1546 (Hebrew)</ref> and later (in [[Provence]]), [[David Kimhi]]. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as [[Dunash ben Labrat]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], in a \"purified\" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters. This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.<ref>T. Carmi, ''Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse''.</ref>\n\nThe need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from [[Classical Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Medieval Arabic]] motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by the [[Ibn Tibbon]] family. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.{{cn|date=December 2019}}) Another important influence was [[Maimonides]], who developed a simple style based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] for use in his law code, the [[Mishneh Torah]].  Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.\n\nHebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses\u2014not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been many deviations from this generalization such as [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]]'s letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic,<ref>Safrai, Shmuel, Shemuel Safrai, M. Stern. 1976. The Jewish people in the first century. P.1036</ref> and [[Maimonides]]' writings, which were mostly in [[Arabic]];<ref>Fox, Marvin. 1995. Interpreting Maimonides. P.326</ref> but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. For example, the first Middle East printing press, in Safed (modern Israel), produced a small number of books in Hebrew in 1577, which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cojs.org/1577-first-printing-press-middle-east-safed/|title=1577 The First Printing Press in the Middle East - Safed - Center for Online Judaic Studies|date=2017-09-07|work=Center for Online Judaic Studies|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US}}</ref> This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi [[Avraham Danzig]] wrote the ''[[Chayei Adam]]'' in Hebrew, as opposed to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], as a guide to ''[[Halacha]]'' for the \"''average'' 17-year-old\" (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, the [[Chofetz Chaim]], Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]]'s purpose in writing the ''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' was to \"produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute\".  The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, \"the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=onNwsw0akyoC&pg=PR14&lpg=PR14 |title=Mishnah B'rurah \u2013 Israel Meir (ha-Kohen), Aharon Feldman, Aviel Orenstein \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=3 May 2013|isbn=9780873061988|year=1980|last1=(Ha-Kohen) |first1=Israel Meir }}</ref>\n\n=== Revival ===\n{{Main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}\nHebrew has been revived several times as a literary language, most significantly by the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. In the early 19th century, a form of spoken Hebrew had emerged in the markets of Jerusalem between Jews of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate for commercial purposes. This Hebrew dialect was to a certain extent a [[pidgin]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/This-week-in-history-Revival-of-the-Hebrew-language | title=This week in history: Revival of the Hebrew language - Jewish World - Jerusalem Post}}</ref> Near the end of that century the Jewish activist [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], owing to the ideology of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] ({{lang|he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df}}, ''Shivat Tziyon,'' later [[Zionism]]), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the [[Second Aliyah]], it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including [[Judaeo-Spanish]] (also called \"Judezmo\" and \"Ladino\"), [[Yiddish]], [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] and [[Bukhori dialect|Bukhori]] (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the [[Jewish diaspora]] such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].\n\nThe major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as [[neologism]]s from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declared [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.\n\nIn the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variously ''Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Hebrew'', ''New Hebrew'', ''Israeli Standard Hebrew'', ''Standard Hebrew'' and so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features of [[Sephardic Hebrew]] from its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.\n\n[[File:Eliezer Ben-Yehuda at his desk in Jerusalem - c1912.jpg|thumb|[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]]]\nThe literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew, ''[[Me'assefim|HaMe'assef]]'' (The Gatherer), was published by [[maskil]]im in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (today's [[Kaliningrad]]) from 1783 onwards.<ref>[[Shalom Spiegel]], ''Hebrew Reborn'' (1930), Meridian Books reprint 1962, New York p. 56.</ref> In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g. ''[[Hamagid]]'', founded in [[E\u0142k]] in 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets were [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]]; there were also novels written in the language.\n\nThe [[revival of the Hebrew language]] as a [[first language|mother tongue]] was initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. He joined the [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and in 1881 immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] \"[[shtetl]]\" lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the [[literary language|literary]] and [[sacred language|liturgical language]] into everyday [[spoken language]]. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in [[Eastern Europe]] by different grammar and style, in the writings of people like [[Ahad Ha'am]] and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the [[vernacular]]ization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904\u20131914 [[Second Aliyah]] that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in [[phonology]], was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.\n\nWhile many saw his work as fanciful or even [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]<ref>[http://www.jewishmag.com/43mag/ben-yehuda/ben-yehuda.htm Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Resurgence of the Hebrew Language] by Libby Kantorwitz</ref> (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (''The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew''). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of the [[Yishuv|Old Yishuv]] and a very few [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] sects, most notably those under the auspices of [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew \"reactionary\" since it was associated with [[Zionism]], and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] as early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming to [[secularization|secularize]] education (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |title=The Transformation of Jewish Culture in the USSR from 1930 to the Present (in Russian) |publisher=Jewish-heritage.org |accessdate=25 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222024723/http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |archivedate=22 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>).

Later in the 1980s in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], Hebrew studies reappeared due to people struggling for permission to go to Israel ([[refusenik]]s). Several of the teachers were imprisoned, e.g. [[Iosif Begun|Yosef Begun]], [[Ephraim Kholmyansky]], [[Yevgeny Korostyshevsky]] and others responsible for a Hebrew learning network connecting many cities of the USSR.\n\n=== Modern Hebrew ===\n{{Main|Modern Hebrew}}\n[[File:Annava165.jpg|thumb|upright=1.59|Hebrew, [[Arabic]] and English multilingual signs on an Israeli highway]]\n[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language [[Hebrew keyboard|Hebrew]] and English keyboard]]\nStandard Hebrew, as developed by [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], was based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Mishnaic]] spelling and [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation.

The [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] currently invents about 2,000 new Hebrew words each year for modern words by finding an original Hebrew word that captures the meaning, as an alternative to incorporating more English words into Hebrew vocabulary.

The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels /a a\u02d0 i i\u02d0 u u\u02d0/ as well as /o\u02d0/, but this system changed dramatically over time.\n\nBy the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, /\u026c/ had shifted to /s/ in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with /\u0283/ instead. (Elisha Qimron 1986. ''Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', 29). The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system /a \u025b e i \u0254 o u \u0103 \u0254\u0306 \u025b\u0306/, though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.\n\nA number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental ([[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi]]) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and [[Torah reading]]), and show the shift of /w/ to /v/. The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]] tradition has a complex vowel system that does not correspond closely to the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] systems.\n\nModern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. In line with [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation, emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, /w/ to /v/, and [\u0263 \u00f0 \u03b8] are not present. Most Israelis today also merge /\u0295 \u0127/ with /\u0294 \u03c7/, do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce /r/ as a uvular fricative [\u0281] or a voiced velar fricative [\u0263] rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences. The consonants /t\u0283/ and /d\u0292/ have become phonemic due to loan words, and /w/ has similarly been re-introduced.\n\n===Consonants===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Later on, however, {{IPA|/\u026c/}} merged with {{IPA|/s/}}, but the old spelling was largely retained, and the two pronunciations of <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9}}</big> were distinguished graphically in [[Tiberian Hebrew]] as <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c1}}</big> {{IPA|/\u0283/}} vs. <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c2}}</big> {{IPA|/s/}} < {{IPA|/\u026c/}}.\n# Biblical Hebrew as of the 3rd century BCE apparently still distinguished the phonemes {{transl|sem|\u0121}} {{IPA|/\u0281/}}, {{transl|sem|\u1e2b}} {{IPA|/\u03c7/}}, {{transl|sem|\u1e0f}} {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} and {{transl|sem|\u1e6f}} {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, based on transcriptions in the [[Septuagint]]. As in the case of {{IPA|/\u026c/}}, no letters were available to represent these sounds, and existing letters did double duty: <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05d7}}</big> {{IPA|/\u03c7/ /\u0127/}}, <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e2}}</big> {{IPA|/\u0281/ /\u0295/}}, <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c1}}</big> {{IPA|/\u03b8/ /\u0283/}} and <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05d6}}</big> {{IPA|/\u00f0/ /z/}}. In all of these cases, however, the sounds represented by the same letter eventually merged, leaving no evidence (other than early transcriptions) of the former distinctions.\n# Hebrew and Aramaic underwent [[begadkefat]] spirantization at a certain point, whereby the stop sounds {{IPA|/b \u0261 d k p t/}} were [[lenition|softened]] to the corresponding fricatives {{IPA|[v \u0263 \u00f0 x f \u03b8]}} (written ''\u1e07 \u1e21 \u1e0f \u1e35 p\u0304 \u1e6f'') when occurring after a vowel and not geminated.

However, Blau argues that it is possible that lenited {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} could coexist even if pronounced identically, since one would be recognized as an alternating allophone (as apparently is the case in Nestorian Syriac).

(The others are pronounced like the corresponding stops, apparently under the influence of later non-native speakers whose native European tongues lacked the sounds {{IPA|/\u0263 \u00f0 \u03b8/}} as phonemes.)\n\n== Hebrew grammar ==\n{{Main|Modern Hebrew grammar}}\n{{Further|History of Hebrew grammar}}\nHebrew grammar is partly [[analytic language|analytic]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]] and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[grammatical case]]s. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of the verbs and nouns. For example, nouns have a [[construct state]], called \"smikhut\", to denote the relationship of \"belonging to\": this is the converse of the [[genitive case]] of more inflected languages. Words in smikhut are often combined with [[hyphen]]s.  In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition \"shel\", meaning \"of\".  There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and \"person\"-[[enclitic]]s are widely used to \"decline\" prepositions.\n\n=== Morphology ===\nLike all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of \"[[triliteral]]\", or 3-consonant [[Triliteral|consonantal roots]], from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels and/or adding prefixes, suffixes or [[infix]]es. 4-consonant roots also exist and became more frequent in the modern language due to a process of coining verbs from nouns that are themselves constructed from 3-consonant verbs. Some trilateral roots lose one of their consonants in most forms and are called \"Nehim\" (Resting).\n\nHebrew uses a number of [[Prefixes and suffixes in Hebrew|one-letter prefixes]] that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or \"Letters of Use\" ({{lang-he|\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e9|Otiyot HaShimush|links=no}}). Such items include: the definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''ha-'' ({{IPA|/ha/}}) (=\"the\"); [[preposition]]s ''be-'' ({{IPA|/b\u0259/}}) (=\"in\"), ''le-'' ({{IPA|/l\u0259/}}) (=\"to\"; a shortened version of the preposition ''el''), ''mi-'' ({{IPA|/mi/}}) (=\"from\"; a shortened version of the preposition ''min''); [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] ''ve-'' ({{IPA|/v\u0259/}}) (=\"and\"), ''she-'' ({{IPA|/\u0283e/}}) (=\"that\"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction ''asher''), ''ke-'' ({{IPA|/k\u0259/}}) (=\"as\", \"like\"; a shortened version of the conjunction ''kmo'').\n\nThe vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes, hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form, may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word that begins with a moving [[Shva]], then the preposition takes the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial ''be-kfar'' (=\"in a village\") corresponds to the more formal ''bi-khfar''.\n\nThe definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like ''m\u00e9-ha-kfar'' (=\"from the village\"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of ''mi-''. With ''be'',  ''le'' and ''ke'', the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes ''ba'', ''la'' or ''ka''. Thus *''be-ha-matos'' becomes ''ba-matos'' (=\"in the plane\"). Note that this does not happen to ''m\u00e9'' (the form of \"min\" or \"mi-\" used before the letter \"he\"), therefore ''m\u00e9-ha-matos'' is a valid form, which means \"from the airplane\".\n\n:''* indicates that the given example is grammatically [[standard language|non-standard]]''.\n\n=== Syntax ===\nLike most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject and so on.\n* Many Hebrew sentences have several correct orders of words. One can change the order of the words in the sentence and keep the same meaning. For example, the sentence \"Dad went to work\", in Hebrew, includes a word for ''Dad'' ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0}} ''{{transl|he|aba}}''), for ''went'' ({{lang|he|\u05d4\u05dc\u05da}} ''{{transl|he|hala\u1e35}}''), and for ''to work'' (to the working place = {{lang|he|\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|la-\u02bfavoda}}''). However, unlike in English, those three words can be put in almost any combination ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4/ \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da/ \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0/ \u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4}} and so on).\n* In Hebrew, there is no [[indefinite article]].\n* Hebrew sentences do not have to include verbs; the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in the [[present tense]] is omitted. For example, the sentence \"I am here\" ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9&nbsp;\u05e4\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;po}}'') has only two words; one for I ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9}}) and one for here ({{lang|he|\u05e4\u05d4}}). In the sentence \"I am that person\" ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d6\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;hu&nbsp;ha'adam&nbsp;ha'ze}}''), the word for \"am\" corresponds to the word for \"he\" ({{lang|he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0}}). However, this may also be omitted. Thus, the sentence ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d6\u05d4}}) is identical in meaning.\n*Negative and interrogative Sentences have the same order as the regular declarative one. A question that has a yes/no answer begins with {{lang|he|\"\u05d4\u05d0\u05dd\"}} (''haim'', an interrogative form of 'if'), but it's largely omitted in informal speech.\n* Though early [[Biblical Hebrew]] had a verb-subject-object ordering, this gradually transitioned to a subject-verb-object ordering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/basic-word-order-in-the-biblical-hebrew-verbal-clause-part-6/ |title=Basic Word Order in the Biblical Hebrew Verbal Clause, Part 6 &#124; Ancient Hebrew Grammar |publisher=Ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com |date= 2011-05-24|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n* In Hebrew there is a specific preposition ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea}} ''{{transl|he|et}}'') for direct objects that would not have a preposition marker in English. The English phrase \"he ate the cake\" would in Hebrew be {{lang|he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d0\u05db\u05dc&nbsp;\u05d0\u05ea&nbsp;\u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|hu&nbsp;akhal&nbsp;et&nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' (literally, \"He ate {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea}} the cake\"). The word {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea}}, however, can be omitted, making {{lang|he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d0\u05db\u05dc&nbsp;\u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|hu&nbsp;akhal&nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' (\"He ate the cake\"). Former Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] was convinced that {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea}} should never be used as it elongates the sentence without adding meaning. \n* In spoken Hebrew {{lang|he|-\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4}} {{transl|he|et ha-}} is also often contracted to {{lang|he|-\u05b7\u05ea'}} {{transl|he|ta-}}, e.g. {{lang|he|\u05ea'\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd}} {{transl|he|ta-anashim}} instead of {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd}} {{transl|he|et ha-anashim}} (the ' indicates non-standard use). This phenomenon has also been found by researchers in the [[Cave of Letters#Bar-Kokhba letters|Bar Kokhba documents]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} : {{lang|he|\u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd\u2026 \u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05df \u05ea\u05db\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05dd}}, writing {{lang|he|\u05ea\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5}} instead of {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5}}, as well as {{lang|he|\u05ea\u05d3\u05e7\u05dc}} and so on.\n\n== Writing system ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Character Set]] -->\n{{Main|Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew braille}}\n[[File:Frank-ruehl.png|thumb|[[Hebrew alphabet]]]]\nModern Hebrew is written from [[Right-to-left|right to left]] using the [[Hebrew alphabet]], which is an \"impure\" [[abjad]], or consonant-only script, of 22 letters. The ancient [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] is similar to those used for [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Modern scripts are based on the \"square\" letter form, known as ''Ashurit'' (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A [[cursive Hebrew]] script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to be more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents.  The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as [[Rashi script]].  When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of ''[[matres lectionis]]'', which are consonantal letters used as vowels.  Further diacritics are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. ''bet''/''vet'', ''shin''/''sin''); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see [[Cantillation]]).\n{{clear2|right}}\n\n== Liturgical use in Judaism ==\n{{Listen|filename=Cantillation_Example_Aliyah_Reform2.ogg|title=Audio example of liturgical Hebrew |description=This is a portion of the blessing that is traditionally [[cantillation|chanted]] before the [[Baal kore|Aliyah La-Torah]] (reading of the Torah). |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nHebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.\n\n[[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in the [[Haredi]] and other [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] communities. It was influenced by the Yiddish language.\n\n[[Sephardi Hebrew]] is the traditional pronunciation of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] and [[Sephardi Jews]] in the countries of the former [[Ottoman Empire]], with the exception of [[Yemenite Hebrew]].  This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of the [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]] of Israeli native speakers. It was influenced by the [[Judezmo]] language.\n\n[[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew]] is actually a collection of dialects spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the [[Arab]] and [[Islam]]ic world. It was derived from the old [[Arabic language]], and in some cases influenced by [[Sephardi Hebrew]]. The same claim is sometimes made for [[Yemenite Hebrew]] or ''Temanit'', which differs from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and \"ghimel\".)\n\nThese pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study, in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew, though some traditionalist Israelis use liturgical pronunciations in prayer.\n\nMany synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the \"Sephardic\" pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction between [[Niqqud|tsere]] and [[Niqqud|segol]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Israel|Language}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]\n* [[List of Hebrew dictionaries]]\n* [[Hebraism]]\n* [[Hebraization of English]]\n* [[Hebrew abbreviations]]\n* [[Hebrew literature]]\n* [[Hebrew numerals]]\n* [[Jewish languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Hebrew origin]]\n* [[Romanization of Hebrew]]\n* [[Study of the Hebrew language]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Joel M.|title=In the Beginning: A Short History of the Hebrew Language|place=New York|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3654-8|date=August 2004}}\n* {{cite web|last=Izre'el|first= Shlomo|editor=[[Benjamin Hary]]|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/semitic/cosih.html|title= The Corpus of Spoken Israeli Hebrew| publisher=(CoSIH): Working Papers I|date=2001}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Klein|first= Reuven Chaim|title=Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew|publisher=Mosaica Press|date= 2014|isbn=978-1937887360}}\n* {{cite book|last=Kuzar|first= Ron|title=Hebrew and Zionism: A Discourse Analytic Cultural Study|place= Berlin & New York|publisher= Mouton de Gruyter|date= 2001|isbn=978-3-11-016993-5}}\n* {{cite book|last=Laufer|first= Asher|title=Hebrew Handbook of the International Phonetic Association|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1999|isbn=978-0-521-65236-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=S\u00e1enz-Badillos|first= Angel|date=1993|title=A History of the Hebrew Language|translator=John Elwolde|place=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55634-7}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links |wikt=Hebrew |q=Hebraic proverbs |s=Category:Hebrew language |voy=Hebrew phrasebook |n=no}}\n{{Wiktionary category}}\n{{InterWiki|code=he}}\n{{WikisourceWiki|code=he}}\n;Government\n*[http://en.hebrew-academy.org.il/ Official website] of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]\n*[http://maagarim.hebrew-academy.org.il/Pages/PMain.aspx Ma'agarim] \u2013 The [[Historical Dictionary Project of the Hebrew Language|Historical Dictionary Project]] by the Academy of the Hebrew Language\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161220180804/http://goisrael.com/evng/Tourist%20Information/Jewish%20Culture/Pages/Hebrew%20Phrases.aspx Hebrew Phrases] by the [[Ministry of Tourism (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Tourism]]\n\n;General information\n*[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hebrewtoc.html Hebrew language] at the [[Jewish Virtual Library]]\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7453-hebrew-language Hebrew language] at the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/other/hebrew/guide/ A Guide to Hebrew] at [[BBC Online]]\n*[http://www.adath-shalom.ca/rabin_he.htm ''A Short History of the Hebrew Language''] by [[Chaim Menachem Rabin]]\n*{{Dmoz|Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics/Languages/Natural/Afro-Asiatic/Hebrew}}\n\n;Tutorials, courses and dictionaries\n*[https://www.laits.utexas.edu/hebrew/ Hebrew language] at the [[University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts]]\n*[https://www.livelingua.com/course/fsi/Hebrew_-_Basic_Course Hebrew Basic Course] by the [[Foreign Service Institute]]\n*[http://www.ulpan-online.com/ Hebrew for the 21st century], online [[ulpan]]\n*[http://www.morfix.co.il/en/ Morfix], online dictionary\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Languages of Israel}}\n{{Semitic languages}}\n{{Jewish languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hebrew Language}}\n[[Category:Hebrew language| ]]\n[[Category:Languages of Israel]]\n[[Category:Verb\u2013subject\u2013object languages]]\n[[Category:Fusional languages]]\n[[Category:Languages attested from the 10th century BC]]\n[[Category:Canaanite languages]]\n[[Category:Jewish languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Hebrew}}\n{{short description|Semitic language native to Israel}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n<!--clarify the nature of the modern language as separate from Hebrew proper and only about 100 years old-->\n{{Infobox language\n| name = Hebrew\n| nativename = {{Hebrew|\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea}}'', {{transl|he|Ivrit}}''\n| pronunciation = Modern: {{IPA|[iv\u02c8\u0281it]}} \u2013 Ancient: {{IPA|[\u0295ib'rit]}}{{refn|[[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi]] {{IPA|[\u0295iv\u02c8\u027eit]}};

The [[Gezer]] calendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] one that, through the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], later became the [[Roman script]]. The Gezer calendar is written without any vowels, and it does not use [[Mater lectionis|consonants to imply vowels]] even in the places in which later Hebrew spelling requires them.\n\nNumerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example, [[Protosinaitic]]. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back to [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the [[acrophonic]] principle.

One ancient document is the famous [[Moabite Stone]], written in the Moabite dialect; the [[Siloam Inscription]], found near [[Jerusalem]], is an early example of Hebrew.

The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works associated with them.\n* [[Archaic Biblical Hebrew]] from the 10th to the 6th century BCE, corresponding to the Monarchic Period until the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]] and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]), notably the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). Also called Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew. It was written in the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]. A script descended from this, the [[Samaritan alphabet]], is still used by the [[Samaritans]].\n[[File:Sefer-torah-vayehi-binsoa.jpg|thumb|Hebrew script used in [[Ktav Stam|writing a Torah scroll]]. Note ornamental [[Ktav_Stam#Serifs_(tagin)|\"crowns\"]] on tops of certain letters.]]\n* [[Biblical Hebrew|Standard Biblical Hebrew]] around the 8th to 6th centuries BCE, corresponding to the late Monarchic period and the Babylonian Exile. It is represented by the bulk of the Hebrew Bible that attains much of its present form around this time. Also called Biblical Hebrew, Early Biblical Hebrew, Classical Biblical Hebrew or Classical Hebrew (in the narrowest sense).\n* [[Late Biblical Hebrew]], from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BCE, corresponding to the [[Persian period|Persian Period]] and represented by certain texts in the [[Hebrew Bible]], notably the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Basically similar to Classical Biblical Hebrew, apart from a few foreign words adopted for mainly governmental terms, and some syntactical innovations such as the use of the particle ''she-'' (alternative of \"asher\", meaning \"that, which, who\"). It adopted the [[Aramaic alphabet|Imperial Aramaic script]] (from which the modern Hebrew script descends).\n* [[Israelian Hebrew]] is a proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew, believed to have existed in all eras of the language, in some cases competing with late biblical Hebrew as an explanation for non-standard linguistic features of biblical texts.\n\n====Early post-Biblical Hebrew====\n* [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Scroll]] Hebrew from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, corresponding to the Hellenistic and Roman Periods before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, and represented by the Qumran Scrolls that form most (but not all) of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Commonly abbreviated as DSS Hebrew, also called Qumran Hebrew. The Imperial Aramaic script of the earlier scrolls in the 3rd century BCE evolved into the [[Hebrew square script]] of the later scrolls in the 1st century CE, also known as ''ketav Ashuri'' (Assyrian script), still in use today.\n* [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] from the 1st to the 3rd or 4th century CE, corresponding to the Roman Period after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and represented by the bulk of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]] within the [[Talmud]] and by the Dead Sea Scrolls, notably the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba]] letters and the [[Copper Scroll]]. Also called Tannaitic Hebrew or Early Rabbinic Hebrew.\n\nSometimes the above phases of spoken Classical Hebrew are simplified into \"Biblical Hebrew\" (including several dialects from the 10th century BCE to 2nd century BCE and extant in certain Dead Sea Scrolls) and \"Mishnaic Hebrew\" (including several dialects from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE and extant in certain other Dead Sea Scrolls).<ref name=Segal>M.

The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also called [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew I), which was a [[spoken language]], and [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a [[literary language]]. The earlier section of the Talmud is the [[Mishnah]] that was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and was written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the [[Midrash halakha|halachic]] [[Midrash]]im ([[Sifra]], [[Sifre]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mechilta]] etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the [[Tosefta]]. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is ''[[Baraita|Baraitot]]''. The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.\n\nAbout a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. The later section of the Talmud, the [[Gemara]], generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew, which sometimes occurs in the text of the Gemara.\n\nHebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel's religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries.<ref>[http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html Languages of the World (Hebrew)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117194849/http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html |date=17 January 2009 }}</ref> After the 2nd century CE when the [[Roman Empire]] exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.\n\n=== Medieval Hebrew ===\n{{Main|Medieval Hebrew}}\n[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|[[Aleppo Codex]]: 10th century [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] pointing (Joshua 1:1).]]\n[[File:Cochin Jewish Inscription.JPG|thumb|Kochangadi Synagogue in [[Kochi]], India dated to 1344.]]\n\nAfter the Talmud, various regional literary dialects of [[Medieval Hebrew]] evolved. The most important is [[Tiberian Hebrew]] or Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect of [[Tiberias]] in [[Galilee]] that became the standard for vocalizing the [[Hebrew Bible]] and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called \"Biblical Hebrew\" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however, properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the remarkable scholarship of the [[Masoretes]] (from ''masoret'' meaning \"tradition\"), who added [[niqqud|vowel points]] and [[Cantillation|grammar points]] to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. The [[Syriac alphabet]], precursor to the [[Arabic alphabet]], also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. The [[Aleppo Codex]], a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely in [[Tiberias]], and survives to this day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.\n\nDuring the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]], important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the [[Islamic grammatical tradition|grammarians]] of [[Classical Arabic]]. Important Hebrew grammarians were [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]], [[Jonah ibn Janah]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]<ref>Abraham ibn Ezra, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/19685 ''Hebrew Grammar''], Venice 1546 (Hebrew)</ref> and later (in [[Provence]]), [[David Kimhi]]. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as [[Dunash ben Labrat]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], in a \"purified\" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters. This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.<ref>T. Carmi, ''Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse''.</ref>\n\nThe need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from [[Classical Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Medieval Arabic]] motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by the [[Ibn Tibbon]] family. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.{{cn|date=December 2019}}) Another important influence was [[Maimonides]], who developed a simple style based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] for use in his law code, the [[Mishneh Torah]].  Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.\n\nHebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses\u2014not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been many deviations from this generalization such as [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]]'s letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic,<ref>Safrai, Shmuel, Shemuel Safrai, M. Stern. 1976. The Jewish people in the first century. P.1036</ref> and [[Maimonides]]' writings, which were mostly in [[Arabic]];<ref>Fox, Marvin. 1995. Interpreting Maimonides. P.326</ref> but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. For example, the first Middle East printing press, in Safed (modern Israel), produced a small number of books in Hebrew in 1577, which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cojs.org/1577-first-printing-press-middle-east-safed/|title=1577 The First Printing Press in the Middle East - Safed - Center for Online Judaic Studies|date=2017-09-07|work=Center for Online Judaic Studies|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US}}</ref> This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi [[Avraham Danzig]] wrote the ''[[Chayei Adam]]'' in Hebrew, as opposed to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], as a guide to ''[[Halacha]]'' for the \"''average'' 17-year-old\" (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, the [[Chofetz Chaim]], Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]]'s purpose in writing the ''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' was to \"produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute\".  The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, \"the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=onNwsw0akyoC&pg=PR14&lpg=PR14 |title=Mishnah B'rurah \u2013 Israel Meir (ha-Kohen), Aharon Feldman, Aviel Orenstein \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=3 May 2013|isbn=9780873061988|year=1980|last1=(Ha-Kohen) |first1=Israel Meir }}</ref>\n\n=== Revival ===\n{{Main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}\nHebrew has been revived several times as a literary language, most significantly by the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. In the early 19th century, a form of spoken Hebrew had emerged in the markets of Jerusalem between Jews of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate for commercial purposes. This Hebrew dialect was to a certain extent a [[pidgin]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/This-week-in-history-Revival-of-the-Hebrew-language | title=This week in history: Revival of the Hebrew language - Jewish World - Jerusalem Post}}</ref> Near the end of that century the Jewish activist [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], owing to the ideology of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] ({{lang|he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df}}, ''Shivat Tziyon,'' later [[Zionism]]), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the [[Second Aliyah]], it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including [[Judaeo-Spanish]] (also called \"Judezmo\" and \"Ladino\"), [[Yiddish]], [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] and [[Bukhori dialect|Bukhori]] (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the [[Jewish diaspora]] such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].\n\nThe major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as [[neologism]]s from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declared [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.\n\nIn the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variously ''Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Hebrew'', ''New Hebrew'', ''Israeli Standard Hebrew'', ''Standard Hebrew'' and so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features of [[Sephardic Hebrew]] from its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.\n\n[[File:Eliezer Ben-Yehuda at his desk in Jerusalem - c1912.jpg|thumb|[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]]]\nThe literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew, ''[[Me'assefim|HaMe'assef]]'' (The Gatherer), was published by [[maskil]]im in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (today's [[Kaliningrad]]) from 1783 onwards.<ref>[[Shalom Spiegel]], ''Hebrew Reborn'' (1930), Meridian Books reprint 1962, New York p. 56.</ref> In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g. ''[[Hamagid]]'', founded in [[E\u0142k]] in 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets were [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]]; there were also novels written in the language.\n\nThe [[revival of the Hebrew language]] as a [[first language|mother tongue]] was initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. He joined the [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and in 1881 immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] \"[[shtetl]]\" lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the [[literary language|literary]] and [[sacred language|liturgical language]] into everyday [[spoken language]]. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in [[Eastern Europe]] by different grammar and style, in the writings of people like [[Ahad Ha'am]] and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the [[vernacular]]ization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904\u20131914 [[Second Aliyah]] that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in [[phonology]], was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.\n\nWhile many saw his work as fanciful or even [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]<ref>[http://www.jewishmag.com/43mag/ben-yehuda/ben-yehuda.htm Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Resurgence of the Hebrew Language] by Libby Kantorwitz</ref> (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (''The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew''). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of the [[Yishuv|Old Yishuv]] and a very few [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] sects, most notably those under the auspices of [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew \"reactionary\" since it was associated with [[Zionism]], and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] as early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming to [[secularization|secularize]] education (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |title=The Transformation of Jewish Culture in the USSR from 1930 to the Present (in Russian) |publisher=Jewish-heritage.org |accessdate=25 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222024723/http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |archivedate=22 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>).

The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels /a a\u02d0 i i\u02d0 u u\u02d0/ as well as /o\u02d0/, but this system changed dramatically over time.\n\nBy the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, /\u026c/ had shifted to /s/ in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with /\u0283/ instead. (Elisha Qimron 1986. ''Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', 29). The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system /a \u025b e i \u0254 o u \u0103 \u0254\u0306 \u025b\u0306/, though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.\n\nA number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental ([[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi]]) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and [[Torah reading]]), and show the shift of /w/ to /v/. The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]] tradition has a complex vowel system that does not correspond closely to the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] systems.\n\nModern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. In line with [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation, emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, /w/ to /v/, and [\u0263 \u00f0 \u03b8] are not present. Most Israelis today also merge /\u0295 \u0127/ with /\u0294 \u03c7/, do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce /r/ as a uvular fricative [\u0281] or a voiced velar fricative [\u0263] rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences. The consonants /t\u0283/ and /d\u0292/ have become phonemic due to loan words, and /w/ has similarly been re-introduced.\n\n===Consonants===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Later on, however, {{IPA|/\u026c/}} merged with {{IPA|/s/}}, but the old spelling was largely retained, and the two pronunciations of <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9}}</big> were distinguished graphically in [[Tiberian Hebrew]] as <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c1}}</big> {{IPA|/\u0283/}} vs. <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c2}}</big> {{IPA|/s/}} < {{IPA|/\u026c/}}.\n# Biblical Hebrew as of the 3rd century BCE apparently still distinguished the phonemes {{transl|sem|\u0121}} {{IPA|/\u0281/}}, {{transl|sem|\u1e2b}} {{IPA|/\u03c7/}}, {{transl|sem|\u1e0f}} {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} and {{transl|sem|\u1e6f}} {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, based on transcriptions in the [[Septuagint]]. As in the case of {{IPA|/\u026c/}}, no letters were available to represent these sounds, and existing letters did double duty: <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05d7}}</big> {{IPA|/\u03c7/ /\u0127/}}, <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e2}}</big> {{IPA|/\u0281/ /\u0295/}}, <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c1}}</big> {{IPA|/\u03b8/ /\u0283/}} and <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05d6}}</big> {{IPA|/\u00f0/ /z/}}. In all of these cases, however, the sounds represented by the same letter eventually merged, leaving no evidence (other than early transcriptions) of the former distinctions.\n# Hebrew and Aramaic underwent [[begadkefat]] spirantization at a certain point, whereby the stop sounds {{IPA|/b \u0261 d k p t/}} were [[lenition|softened]] to the corresponding fricatives {{IPA|[v \u0263 \u00f0 x f \u03b8]}} (written ''\u1e07 \u1e21 \u1e0f \u1e35 p\u0304 \u1e6f'') when occurring after a vowel and not geminated. This change probably happened after the original Old Aramaic phonemes {{IPA|/\u03b8, \u00f0/}} disappeared in the 7th century&nbsp;BCE,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dolgopolsky|1999|p=72}}</ref> and most likely occurred after the loss of Hebrew {{IPA|/\u03c7, \u0281/}} c. 200&nbsp;BCE.<ref group=\"note\">According to the generally accepted view, it is unlikely that begadkefat spirantization occurred before the merger of {{IPA|/\u03c7, \u0281/}} and {{IPA|/\u0127, \u0295/}}, or else {{IPA|[x, \u03c7]}} and {{IPA|[\u0263, \u0281]}} would have to be contrastive, which is cross-linguistically rare. However, Blau argues that it is possible that lenited {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} could coexist even if pronounced identically, since one would be recognized as an alternating allophone (as apparently is the case in Nestorian Syriac). See {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=56}}.</ref> It is known to have occurred in Hebrew by the 2nd century.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dolgopolsky|1999|p=73}}</ref> After a certain point this alternation became contrastive in word-medial and final position (though bearing low [[functional load]]), but in word-initial position they remained allophonic.<ref name=\"bbgd\">{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=78\u201381}}</ref> In [[Modern Hebrew]], the distinction has a higher functional load due to the loss of gemination, although only the three fricatives {{IPA|/v \u03c7 f/}} are still preserved (the fricative {{IPA|/x/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} in modern Hebrew). (The others are pronounced like the corresponding stops, apparently under the influence of later non-native speakers whose native European tongues lacked the sounds {{IPA|/\u0263 \u00f0 \u03b8/}} as phonemes.)\n\n== Hebrew grammar ==\n{{Main|Modern Hebrew grammar}}\n{{Further|History of Hebrew grammar}}\nHebrew grammar is partly [[analytic language|analytic]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]] and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[grammatical case]]s. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of the verbs and nouns. For example, nouns have a [[construct state]], called \"smikhut\", to denote the relationship of \"belonging to\": this is the converse of the [[genitive case]] of more inflected languages. Words in smikhut are often combined with [[hyphen]]s.  In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition \"shel\", meaning \"of\".  There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and \"person\"-[[enclitic]]s are widely used to \"decline\" prepositions.\n\n=== Morphology ===\nLike all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of \"[[triliteral]]\", or 3-consonant [[Triliteral|consonantal roots]], from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels and/or adding prefixes, suffixes or [[infix]]es. 4-consonant roots also exist and became more frequent in the modern language due to a process of coining verbs from nouns that are themselves constructed from 3-consonant verbs. Some trilateral roots lose one of their consonants in most forms and are called \"Nehim\" (Resting).\n\nHebrew uses a number of [[Prefixes and suffixes in Hebrew|one-letter prefixes]] that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or \"Letters of Use\" ({{lang-he|\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e9|Otiyot HaShimush|links=no}}). Such items include: the definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''ha-'' ({{IPA|/ha/}}) (=\"the\"); [[preposition]]s ''be-'' ({{IPA|/b\u0259/}}) (=\"in\"), ''le-'' ({{IPA|/l\u0259/}}) (=\"to\"; a shortened version of the preposition ''el''), ''mi-'' ({{IPA|/mi/}}) (=\"from\"; a shortened version of the preposition ''min''); [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] ''ve-'' ({{IPA|/v\u0259/}}) (=\"and\"), ''she-'' ({{IPA|/\u0283e/}}) (=\"that\"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction ''asher''), ''ke-'' ({{IPA|/k\u0259/}}) (=\"as\", \"like\"; a shortened version of the conjunction ''kmo'').\n\nThe vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes, hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form, may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word that begins with a moving [[Shva]], then the preposition takes the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial ''be-kfar'' (=\"in a village\") corresponds to the more formal ''bi-khfar''.\n\nThe definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like ''m\u00e9-ha-kfar'' (=\"from the village\"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of ''mi-''. With ''be'',  ''le'' and ''ke'', the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes ''ba'', ''la'' or ''ka''. Thus *''be-ha-matos'' becomes ''ba-matos'' (=\"in the plane\"). Note that this does not happen to ''m\u00e9'' (the form of \"min\" or \"mi-\" used before the letter \"he\"), therefore ''m\u00e9-ha-matos'' is a valid form, which means \"from the airplane\".\n\n:''* indicates that the given example is grammatically [[standard language|non-standard]]''.\n\n=== Syntax ===\nLike most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject and so on.\n* Many Hebrew sentences have several correct orders of words. One can change the order of the words in the sentence and keep the same meaning. For example, the sentence \"Dad went to work\", in Hebrew, includes a word for ''Dad'' ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0}} ''{{transl|he|aba}}''), for ''went'' ({{lang|he|\u05d4\u05dc\u05da}} ''{{transl|he|hala\u1e35}}''), and for ''to work'' (to the working place = {{lang|he|\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|la-\u02bfavoda}}''). However, unlike in English, those three words can be put in almost any combination ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4/ \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da/ \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0/ \u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4}} and so on).\n* In Hebrew, there is no [[indefinite article]].\n* Hebrew sentences do not have to include verbs; the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in the [[present tense]] is omitted. For example, the sentence \"I am here\" ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9&nbsp;\u05e4\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;po}}'') has only two words; one for I ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9}}) and one for here ({{lang|he|\u05e4\u05d4}}). In the sentence \"I am that person\" ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d6\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;hu&nbsp;ha'adam&nbsp;ha'ze}}''), the word for \"am\" corresponds to the word for \"he\" ({{lang|he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0}}). However, this may also be omitted. Thus, the sentence ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d6\u05d4}}) is identical in meaning.\n*Negative and interrogative Sentences have the same order as the regular declarative one. A question that has a yes/no answer begins with {{lang|he|\"\u05d4\u05d0\u05dd\"}} (''haim'', an interrogative form of 'if'), but it's largely omitted in informal speech.\n* Though early [[Biblical Hebrew]] had a verb-subject-object ordering, this gradually transitioned to a subject-verb-object ordering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/basic-word-order-in-the-biblical-hebrew-verbal-clause-part-6/ |title=Basic Word Order in the Biblical Hebrew Verbal Clause, Part 6 &#124; Ancient Hebrew Grammar |publisher=Ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com |date= 2011-05-24|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n* In Hebrew there is a specific preposition ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea}} ''{{transl|he|et}}'') for direct objects that would not have a preposition marker in English. The English phrase \"he ate the cake\" would in Hebrew be {{lang|he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d0\u05db\u05dc&nbsp;\u05d0\u05ea&nbsp;\u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|hu&nbsp;akhal&nbsp;et&nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' (literally, \"He ate {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea}} the cake\"). The word {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea}}, however, can be omitted, making {{lang|he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d0\u05db\u05dc&nbsp;\u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|hu&nbsp;akhal&nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' (\"He ate the cake\"). Former Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] was convinced that {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea}} should never be used as it elongates the sentence without adding meaning. \n* In spoken Hebrew {{lang|he|-\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4}} {{transl|he|et ha-}} is also often contracted to {{lang|he|-\u05b7\u05ea'}} {{transl|he|ta-}}, e.g. {{lang|he|\u05ea'\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd}} {{transl|he|ta-anashim}} instead of {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd}} {{transl|he|et ha-anashim}} (the ' indicates non-standard use). This phenomenon has also been found by researchers in the [[Cave of Letters#Bar-Kokhba letters|Bar Kokhba documents]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} : {{lang|he|\u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd\u2026 \u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05df \u05ea\u05db\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05dd}}, writing {{lang|he|\u05ea\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5}} instead of {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5}}, as well as {{lang|he|\u05ea\u05d3\u05e7\u05dc}} and so on.\n\n== Writing system ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Character Set]] -->\n{{Main|Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew braille}}\n[[File:Frank-ruehl.png|thumb|[[Hebrew alphabet]]]]\nModern Hebrew is written from [[Right-to-left|right to left]] using the [[Hebrew alphabet]], which is an \"impure\" [[abjad]], or consonant-only script, of 22 letters. The ancient [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] is similar to those used for [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Modern scripts are based on the \"square\" letter form, known as ''Ashurit'' (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A [[cursive Hebrew]] script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to be more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents.  The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as [[Rashi script]].  When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of ''[[matres lectionis]]'', which are consonantal letters used as vowels.  Further diacritics are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. ''bet''/''vet'', ''shin''/''sin''); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see [[Cantillation]]).\n{{clear2|right}}\n\n== Liturgical use in Judaism ==\n{{Listen|filename=Cantillation_Example_Aliyah_Reform2.ogg|title=Audio example of liturgical Hebrew |description=This is a portion of the blessing that is traditionally [[cantillation|chanted]] before the [[Baal kore|Aliyah La-Torah]] (reading of the Torah). |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nHebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.\n\n[[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in the [[Haredi]] and other [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] communities. It was influenced by the Yiddish language.\n\n[[Sephardi Hebrew]] is the traditional pronunciation of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] and [[Sephardi Jews]] in the countries of the former [[Ottoman Empire]], with the exception of [[Yemenite Hebrew]].  This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of the [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]] of Israeli native speakers. It was influenced by the [[Judezmo]] language.\n\n[[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew]] is actually a collection of dialects spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the [[Arab]] and [[Islam]]ic world. It was derived from the old [[Arabic language]], and in some cases influenced by [[Sephardi Hebrew]]. The same claim is sometimes made for [[Yemenite Hebrew]] or ''Temanit'', which differs from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and \"ghimel\".)\n\nThese pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study, in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew, though some traditionalist Israelis use liturgical pronunciations in prayer.\n\nMany synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the \"Sephardic\" pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction between [[Niqqud|tsere]] and [[Niqqud|segol]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Israel|Language}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]\n* [[List of Hebrew dictionaries]]\n* [[Hebraism]]\n* [[Hebraization of English]]\n* [[Hebrew abbreviations]]\n* [[Hebrew literature]]\n* [[Hebrew numerals]]\n* [[Jewish languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Hebrew origin]]\n* [[Romanization of Hebrew]]\n* [[Study of the Hebrew language]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Joel M.|title=In the Beginning: A Short History of the Hebrew Language|place=New York|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3654-8|date=August 2004}}\n* {{cite web|last=Izre'el|first= Shlomo|editor=[[Benjamin Hary]]|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/semitic/cosih.html|title= The Corpus of Spoken Israeli Hebrew| publisher=(CoSIH): Working Papers I|date=2001}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Klein|first= Reuven Chaim|title=Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew|publisher=Mosaica Press|date= 2014|isbn=978-1937887360}}\n* {{cite book|last=Kuzar|first= Ron|title=Hebrew and Zionism: A Discourse Analytic Cultural Study|place= Berlin & New York|publisher= Mouton de Gruyter|date= 2001|isbn=978-3-11-016993-5}}\n* {{cite book|last=Laufer|first= Asher|title=Hebrew Handbook of the International Phonetic Association|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1999|isbn=978-0-521-65236-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=S\u00e1enz-Badillos|first= Angel|date=1993|title=A History of the Hebrew Language|translator=John Elwolde|place=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55634-7}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links |wikt=Hebrew |q=Hebraic proverbs |s=Category:Hebrew language |voy=Hebrew phrasebook |n=no}}\n{{Wiktionary category}}\n{{InterWiki|code=he}}\n{{WikisourceWiki|code=he}}\n;Government\n*[http://en.hebrew-academy.org.il/ Official website] of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]\n*[http://maagarim.hebrew-academy.org.il/Pages/PMain.aspx Ma'agarim] \u2013 The [[Historical Dictionary Project of the Hebrew Language|Historical Dictionary Project]] by the Academy of the Hebrew Language\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161220180804/http://goisrael.com/evng/Tourist%20Information/Jewish%20Culture/Pages/Hebrew%20Phrases.aspx Hebrew Phrases] by the [[Ministry of Tourism (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Tourism]]\n\n;General information\n*[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hebrewtoc.html Hebrew language] at the [[Jewish Virtual Library]]\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7453-hebrew-language Hebrew language] at the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/other/hebrew/guide/ A Guide to Hebrew] at [[BBC Online]]\n*[http://www.adath-shalom.ca/rabin_he.htm ''A Short History of the Hebrew Language''] by [[Chaim Menachem Rabin]]\n*{{Dmoz|Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics/Languages/Natural/Afro-Asiatic/Hebrew}}\n\n;Tutorials, courses and dictionaries\n*[https://www.laits.utexas.edu/hebrew/ Hebrew language] at the [[University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts]]\n*[https://www.livelingua.com/course/fsi/Hebrew_-_Basic_Course Hebrew Basic Course] by the [[Foreign Service Institute]]\n*[http://www.ulpan-online.com/ Hebrew for the 21st century], online [[ulpan]]\n*[http://www.morfix.co.il/en/ Morfix], online dictionary\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Languages of Israel}}\n{{Semitic languages}}\n{{Jewish languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hebrew Language}}\n[[Category:Hebrew language| ]]\n[[Category:Languages of Israel]]\n[[Category:Verb\u2013subject\u2013object languages]]\n[[Category:Fusional languages]]\n[[Category:Languages attested from the 10th century BC]]\n[[Category:Canaanite languages]]\n[[Category:Jewish languages]]\n", "name_user": "Gorobay", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDisplacement by Aramaic:\u27e8\u1f19\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u00ef\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u27e9 \u2192 \u27e8\u1f19\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03ca\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u27e9", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"}
{"title_page": "List of Pretty Cure films", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Pretty Cure'' films}}\nThe following is a list of Japanese animated films produced by [[Toei Animation]], based on [[Izumi Todo]]'s '''''[[Pretty Cure]]''''' (''Precure'') [[anime]] television franchise, also known as '''''Glitter Force''''' outside of Japan. Beginning with 2005's ''[[Futari wa Pretty Cure|Futari wa Pretty Cure Max Heart]]'', which had two films released for it, each subsequent series in the franchise has received a film, which is usually released towards the end of each year.

Later, whilst discussing their elementary school days with Alice, Rikka,  and Makoto, Mana recalls owning a dog named Mallow, who died when she was little. That night, a mysterious man named Marsh uses a clarinet to call forth forgotten and discarded objects that still feel they have use, combining together into a giant whale-shaped blimp in the sky. Marsh, who Mana doesn't seem to recognise, starts trapping people inside film reels, forcing them to relive their past memories for eternity, depriving them of their futures. He then summons three henchmen; Purple Buggy, Silver Clock, and Mannequin Carmine, to fight against the Cure, reassembling them no matter how many times they are destroyed. Overwhelming the Cures, Marsh traps them inside their own memories, with Mana finding herself in her elementary school days when both her grandmother and Maro were still alive. Meanwhile, Sharuru  and the other fairies are approached by Bebel, a former acquaintance of Marsh, who informs them that they must venture inside the memories of their partners in order to save them. As Mana tries to find a way back to the real world, she finds the memories in this world are different from her own, as Rikka and Alice are nowhere to be found, but seems to enjoy being with Mallow. With help from Bebel, Sharuru and the others dive into their partners's memories, with Sharuru joining Mana just before she learns Mallow was hit by a car, which ends her film reels when she gives into the grief of losing her beloved dog. Cautious about Bebel's words that Mana will never give up, Matthew sends his henchmen after Rikka, Alice, and Makoto, deeming them a threat. Rikka and Alice manage to find each other within their memories, soon joined by their partners, whilst Davi convinces Makoto not to run away from the reality of the Trump Kingdom's situation. Rikka and Alice fight off against their opponents whilst Makoto is assisted by the arrival of Aguri, Cure Ace. Meanwhile, Mana, who can't stand returning to a world without Mallow, receives words of encouragement from her grandmother, allowing her to hear the support of her friends and find a way back to her world along with the others. As Marsh transforms into his true form, Mana, realising that Marsh is actually Mallow himself, takes on his attack, stating she has never once forgotten him, helping him to see the light. Just then, the clarinet that had been influencing Mallow travels forward in time to try and destroy the Cures's future. Using the Miracle Bouquet Lights, the Cures travel forward in time to the day of Mana's wedding and, with help from Mallow, reach the clarinet, who proves resilient to their attacks and delivers a critical blow to Mallow. Being left with no regrets, Mallow leaves behind his psyche, which gives Mana the powerful Engage Mode, allowing her to defeat the clarinet. After the girls return to the present and everyone who was imprisoned is freed, Bebel takes care of Maro's psyche, revealing herself to be Mana's grandmother.\n\n===''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls'' (2014)===\n{{Main|HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls}}\n{{nihongo|''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls''|\u6620\u753b \u30cf\u30d4\u30cd\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\uff01\u4eba\u5f62\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30d0\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca|Eiga HapinesuCh\u0101ji Purikyua!

Later, whilst discussing their elementary school days with Alice, Rikka,  and Makoto, Mana recalls owning a dog named Mallow, who died when she was little. That night, a mysterious man named Marsh uses a clarinet to call forth forgotten and discarded objects that still feel they have use, combining together into a giant whale-shaped blimp in the sky. Marsh, who Mana doesn't seem to recognise, starts trapping people inside film reels, forcing them to relive their past memories for eternity, depriving them of their futures. He then summons three henchmen; Purple Buggy, Silver Clock, and Mannequin Carmine, to fight against the Cure, reassembling them no matter how many times they are destroyed. Overwhelming the Cures, Marsh traps them inside their own memories, with Mana finding herself in her elementary school days when both her grandmother and Maro were still alive. Meanwhile, Sharuru  and the other fairies are approached by Bebel, a former acquaintance of Marsh, who informs them that they must venture inside the memories of their partners in order to save them. As Mana tries to find a way back to the real world, she finds the memories in this world are different from her own, as Rikka and Alice are nowhere to be found, but seems to enjoy being with Mallow. With help from Bebel, Sharuru and the others dive into their partners's memories, with Sharuru joining Mana just before she learns Mallow was hit by a car, which ends her film reels when she gives into the grief of losing her beloved dog. Cautious about Bebel's words that Mana will never give up, Matthew sends his henchmen after Rikka, Alice, and Makoto, deeming them a threat. Rikka and Alice manage to find each other within their memories, soon joined by their partners, whilst Davi convinces Makoto not to run away from the reality of the Trump Kingdom's situation. Rikka and Alice fight off against their opponents whilst Makoto is assisted by the arrival of Aguri, Cure Ace. Meanwhile, Mana, who can't stand returning to a world without Mallow, receives words of encouragement from her grandmother, allowing her to hear the support of her friends and find a way back to her world along with the others. As Marsh transforms into his true form, Mana, realising that Marsh is actually Mallow himself, takes on his attack, stating she has never once forgotten him, helping him to see the light. Just then, the clarinet that had been influencing Mallow travels forward in time to try and destroy the Cures's future. Using the Miracle Bouquet Lights, the Cures travel forward in time to the day of Mana's wedding and, with help from Mallow, reach the clarinet, who proves resilient to their attacks and delivers a critical blow to Mallow. Being left with no regrets, Mallow leaves behind his psyche, which gives Mana the powerful Engage Mode, allowing her to defeat the clarinet. After the girls return to the present and everyone who was imprisoned is freed, Bebel takes care of Maro's psyche, revealing herself to be Mana's grandmother.\n\n===''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls'' (2014)===\n{{Main|HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls}}\n{{nihongo|''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls''|\u6620\u753b \u30cf\u30d4\u30cd\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\uff01\u4eba\u5f62\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30d0\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca|Eiga HapinesuCh\u0101ji Purikyua!

These include [[printing|print media]] ([[newspaper]]s, [[newsmagazine]]s), [[News broadcasting|broadcast news]] ([[radio news|radio]] and [[television news|television]]), and more recently the [[Internet]] ([[online newspaper]]s, news [[blog]]s, news videos, live news streaming, etc.).\n\n== History ==\nSome of the first news circulations occurred in Renaissance Europe. These handwritten newsletters contained news about wars, economic conditions, and social customs and were circulated among merchants. The first printed news appeared by the late 1400s in German pamphlets that contained content that was often highly sensationalized. The first newspaper written in English was ''The Weekly Newes,'' published in London in 1621. Several papers followed in the 1640s and 1650s. In 1690, the first American newspaper was published by Richard Pierce and Benjamin Harris in Boston. However, it did not have permission from the government to be published and was immediately suppressed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/mediahistory.html|title=NOW with Bill Moyers. Politics & Economy. Milestones in Media and Politics {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref>\n\n=== In America ===\n\nIn 1729, Benjamin Franklin began writing a new form of newspaper that was more satirical and more involved in civic affairs than previously seen. In 1735, [[John Peter Zenger]] was accused of seditious libel by the governor of New York, William Cosby. Zenger was found not guilty, largely in part to his attorney Andrew Hamilton, who later wrote a paper in which he argued that newspapers should be free to criticize the government as long as it was true. Later, with the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, freedom of the press would be guaranteed by the First Amendment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1830s, newspapers started seeking commercial success and turned toward reportage. This began with the New York Sun in 1833. Advancements in technology made it cheaper to print newspapers and \"penny papers\" emerged. These issues sought out local news and coverage of society. Later, news-gathering became a central function of newspapers. With the invention of the telegraph in 1845, the \"[[Inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]]\" structure of news was developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/735/04/|title=Purdue OWL: Journalism and Journalistic Writing|website=owl.english.purdue.edu|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref> Through the latter half of the 1800s, politics played a role in what newspapers published. By the end of the century, modern aspects of newspapers, such as banner headlines, extensive use of illustrations, \"funny pages,\" and expanded coverage of organized sporting events, began to appear. Also, media consolidation began with many independent newspapers becoming part of \"chains\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe early 1900s saw Progressive Era journalists using a new style of investigative journalism that revealed the corrupt practices of government officials. These exposing articles became featured in many newspapers and magazines. The people who wrote them became labeled as \"muckrakers\". They became very influential and were a vital force in the Progressive reform movement. However, after 1912 muckraking declined. The public began to think the expos\u00e9s were sensationalized, but they did make a great impact on future policies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the 1920s, radio became a news medium, and was a significant source of breaking news. Although, during World War I, radio broadcasts in America were only given information about Allied victories because Great Britain had a monopoly on the transatlantic radio lines. For the newspapers, the government suppressed any radical or German papers during and after the war.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWith the introduction of the television came The Communications Act of 1934. It was an agreement between commercial television and the people of the United States that established that: The airways are public property; Commercial broadcasters are licensed to use the airways; The main condition for use will be whether the broadcaster served \"the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\" During the Vietnam War, the media reporting directly challenged the government, drawing attention to the \"credibility gap\" \u2014 official lies and half-truths about the war.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTelevision news continued to expand during the 1970s, and by 1990, more than half of American homes had cable systems and nationally oriented newspapers expanded their reach. With technological advancements in the newsroom, notably the Internet, a new emphasis on computer-assisted reporting and a new blending of media forms emerged, with one reporter preparing the same story in print, online, and on camera for a newspaper's cable station.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n\nA [[medium (communication)|\"medium\"]] (plural \"media\") is a carrier of something. Common things carried by media include [[information]], art, or physical objects. A medium may provide transmission or storage of information or both.\nThe industries which produce news and entertainment content for the [[mass media]] are often called \"the media\" (in much the same way the newspaper industry is called \"the [[news|press]]\"). In the late 20th century it became commonplace for this usage to be construed as singular (\"The media is...\") rather than as the traditional plural.\n\n\"Press\" is the collective designation of media vehicles that carry out journalism and other functions of informative communication, in contrast to purely propaganda or entertainment communication. The term press comes from the [[printing press]] of [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the sixteenth century and which, from the eighteenth century, was used to print newspapers, then the only existing journalistic vehicles. From the middle of the 20th century onwards, newspapers also began to be broadcast and broadcast (radio news and television news) and, with the advent of the World Wide Web, also came the online newspapers, or cyberjornais, or webjornais. Followed by online newspapers, online news videos and online streaming news has been introduced in the 2010s.  The term \"press\", however, was maintained.\n\n==Broadcasting==\n\n'''Broadcasting''' is the distribution of [[sound|audio]] and [[video]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signals]] (programs) to a number of recipients (\"listeners\" or \"viewers\") that belong to a large group.  This group may be the public in general, or a relatively large audience within the public.  Thus, an [[Internet]] channel may distribute text or music worldwide, while a [[public address]] system in (for example) a workplace may broadcast very limited ''ad hoc'' [[soundbite]]s to a small population within its range.\n\nThe sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a [[scheduling (broadcasting)|schedule]].\n\nTelevision and radio programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or [[cable television|cable]], often simultaneously.  By coding signals and having [[Descrambler|decoding]] equipment in homes, the latter also enables [[subscription]]-based channels and [[pay-per-view]] services.\n\nA broadcasting [[organization]] may broadcast several programs at the same time, through several channels ([[frequencies]]), for example [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two|Two]]. On the other hand, two or more organizations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day. [[Digital radio]] and [[digital television]] may also transmit [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] programming, with several channels [[data compression|compressed]] into one [[DAB ensemble|ensemble]].\n\nWhen broadcasting is done via the Internet the term [[webcasting]] is often used.\n\nBroadcasting forms a very large segment of the [[mass media]].\n\nBroadcasting to a very narrow range of audience is called [[narrowcast]]ing.\n\n===Television===\n\nIn a broadcast system (television), journalists or reporters are also involved with editing the video material that has been shot alongside their research, and in working on the visual [[narrative]] of the story. Broadcast journalists often make an appearance in the news story at the beginning or end of the video clip.\n\nIn [[television]] or [[broadcast journalism]], news analysts (also called news-casters or news anchors) examine, interpret, and broadcast news received from various [[Journalism sourcing|sources]] of information. ''Anchors'' present this as news, either videotaped or live, through transmissions from on-the-scene reporters (news correspondents).\n\nNews films (\"clips\") can vary in length; there are some which may be as long as ten minutes, others that need to fit in all the relevant information and material in two or three minutes. News channels these days have also begun to host special [[documentary films]] that stretch for much longer durations and are able to explore a news subject or issue in greater detail.\n\nThe desk persons categorise news stories with various formats according to the merit of the story. Such formats include AVO, AVO Byte, Pkg, VO SOT, VOX POP, and Ancho Visual.\n* The AVO, or Anchor Voice Over, is the short form of news. The story is written in a gist. According to the script visual is edited. The anchor reads the news while the visual is broadcast simultaneously. Generally, the duration of an AVO is 30 to 40 seconds. The script is three to four lines. At first the anchor starts to read the news, and, after reading one or one-and-a-half lines, the visual is aired, overlapping the face of anchor.\n* The AVO Byte has two parts: An AVO, and one or more bytes. This is the same as an AVO, except that as soon as the AVO ends, the Byte is aired.\n* The Pkg has three parts: Anchor, Voice Over, and Sign Off. At first a Script is written. A voice over anchor reads the anchor or anchor intro part.\n*\n\n==Newspapers==\n{{main|Newspaper}}\n\n[[File:Statue of Len Ganeway reading (Brookgreen Gardens, Pawleys Island, South Carolina).jpg|thumb|left|Reading the newspaper: [[Brookgreen Gardens]] in [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina|Pawleys Island]], [[South Carolina]].]]\nA newspaper is a lightweight and disposable [[publication]] (more specifically, a [[periodical]]), usually printed on low-cost paper called [[newsprint]]. It may be general or special interest, and may be published daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly.\n\nGeneral-interest newspapers are usually journals of current [[news]] on a variety of topics. Those can include [[Politics|political events]], [[crime]], [[business]], [[Sportswriting|sports]], and opinions (either [[editorial]]s, [[columnist|columns]], or [[political cartoon]]s). Many also include weather news and [[weather forecast|forecasts]]. Newspapers increasingly use photographs to illustrate stories; they also often include [[comic strips]] and other entertainment, such as [[crossword]]s.\n\n=== Print journalism ===\n\n[[File:CBC journalists in Montreal.jpg|thumb|Journalists at work in [[Montreal]] in the 1940s]]\n\nA '''story''' is a single article, [[news]] item or [[feature story|feature]], usually concerning a single [[wikt:event|event]], issue, [[theme (literature)|theme]], or [[wikt:profile|profile]] of a person. ''Correspondents'' report news occurring in the main, locally, from their own country, or from foreign cities where they are stationed.\n\nMost reporters ''file'' information or write their stories electronically from remote locations. In many cases, ''breaking stories'' are written by staff members, through information collected and submitted by other reporters who are out on the field gathering information for an event that has just occurred and needs to be broadcast instantly. Radio and television reporters often compose stories and report \"live\" from the scene. Some journalists also interpret the news or offer opinions and analysis to readers, viewers, or listeners. In this role, they are called commentators or columnists.\n\n[[Reporter]]s take notes and also take photographs or shoot videos, either on their own, by citizens or through a [[photographer]] or camera person. In the second phase, they organize the material, determine the focus or emphasis (identify the peg), and finally write their stories. The story is then [[editing|edited]] by news or copy-editors (U.S. style) or sub-editors in Europe, who function from the ''news desk''. The headline of the story is decided by the news desk, and practically never by the reporter or the writer of the piece. Often, the news desk also heavily re-writes or changes the style and tone of the first draft prepared by the reporter / writer originally. Finally, a collection of stories that have been picked for the newspaper or magazine ''edition'', are laid out on dummy (trial) pages, and after the ''chief editor'' has approved the content, style and language in the material, it is sent for [[publishing]]. The writer is given a ''byline'' for the piece that is published; his or her name appears alongside the article. This process takes place according to the frequency of the publication. News can be published in a variety of formats ([[broadsheet]], [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], [[magazine]] and periodical publications) as well as periods (daily, weekly, semi-weekly, fortnightly or monthly).\n\n==Newsmagazines==\n[[Image:Couverture-3-magazine-2512.JPG|thumb|upright|Cover of ''[[2512 (magazine)|2512]]'', a monthly newsmagazine published in [[R\u00e9union]].]]\n{{main|Newsmagazine}}\n\nA '''newsmagazine''', sometimes called '''news magazine''', is a usually weekly magazine featuring articles on current events. News magazines generally go more in-depth into stories than newspapers, trying to give the reader an understanding of the context surrounding important events, rather than just the facts.\n\n==Newsreels==\n\nA [[newsreel]] was a [[documentary film]] common in the first half of the 20th century, that regularly released in a public presentation place containing filmed [[news]] stories.\na refernece bey\n\nCreated by [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]] of [[France]] in 1908, this form of film was a staple of the typical North American, [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries (especially Canada, Australia and New Zealand)]], and throughout European [[film|cinema]] programming schedule from the [[silent movies|silent era]] until the 1960s when television news broadcasting completely supplanted its role.\n\n==Online journalism==\n{{Main|Online newspaper|Online magazine}}\n\n[[File:Newspapers-20101122.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Empty newspaper vending boxes on the street, left to right, the Los Angeles Times (cut off), Epoch Times, a San Diego paper (Gone to the Web, sddt.com), a white unnamed box, and the San Diego Business Journal (cut off)|Newspaper \"gone to the Web\" in California]]\n'''Online journalism''' is [[Journalism|reporting]] and other [[journalism]] produced or distributed via the [[Internet]]. The [[Internet]] has allowed the formal and informal publication of news stories through mainstream media outlets as well as [[blog]]s and other [[self-publishing|self-published]] news stories. Journalists working on the Internet have been referred to as J-Bloggers, a term coined by Australian Media Academic Dr Nicola Goc to describe journalists who [blog] and [blog]gers who produce journalism. \"J-Bloggers: Internet bloggers acting in the role of journalists disseminating newsworthy information, who subscribe to the journalistic ideals of an obligation to the truth and the public's right to know\".<ref>Media and Journalism: Theory to Practice (2008) Melbourne: OUP, p45</ref>\n\nAn early leader was ''[[The News & Observer]]'' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], USA.\n\nMany news organizations based in other media also distribute news online. How much they take advantage of the medium varies. Some news organizations use the web only or primarily.\n\nThe Internet challenges traditional news organizations in several ways. They may be losing [[classified ad]]s to Web sites, which are often targeted by interest instead of geography. The [[advertising]] on news web sites is sometimes insufficient to support the investment.\n\nEven before the Internet, technology and perhaps other factors were dividing people's attention, leading to more but narrower media outlets.\n\nOnline journalism also leads to the spread of independent online media such as [[openDemocracy]] and the UK, [[Wikinews]] as well as allowing smaller news organizations to publish to a broad audience, such as [[mediastrike]].\n\n=== Streaming Journalism ===\n\nLive online streaming journalism began on various online platforms in the late 2010s, such as youtube.com and twitch.tv (which began primarily as a live streaming platform targeting gamers, then expanding into non-gaming topics including news and political reporting and commentary).\n== News coverage and new media ==\nBy covering news, politics, weather, sports, entertainment, and vital events, the daily media shape the dominant cultural, social and political picture of society. Beyond the media networks, independent news sources have evolved to report on events which escape attention or underlie the major stories.  In recent years, the [[blogosphere]] has taken reporting a step further, mining down to the experiences and perceptions of individual citizens.\n\nAn exponentially growing phenomenon, the blogosphere can be abuzz with news that is overlooked by the press and TV networks. Due to the rise of social media involvement in news, the most common news value has become entertainment in recent years.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=What is News?: News values revisited again|last=Harcup|first=Tony|date=1 Mar 2016|doi = 10.1080/1461670X.2016.1150193}}</ref> Apropos of this was [[Robert F.

These include [[printing|print media]] ([[newspaper]]s, [[newsmagazine]]s), [[News broadcasting|broadcast news]] ([[radio news|radio]] and [[television news|television]]), and more recently the [[Internet]] ([[online newspaper]]s, news [[blog]]s, news videos, live news streaming, etc.).\n\n== History ==\nSome of the first news circulations occurred in Renaissance Europe. These handwritten newsletters contained news about wars, economic conditions, and social customs and were circulated among merchants. The first printed news appeared by the late 1400s in German pamphlets that contained content that was often highly sensationalized. The first newspaper written in English was ''The Weekly Newes,'' published in London in 1621. Several papers followed in the 1640s and 1650s. In 1690, the first American newspaper was published by Richard Pierce and Benjamin Harris in Boston. However, it did not have permission from the government to be published and was immediately suppressed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/mediahistory.html|title=NOW with Bill Moyers. Politics & Economy. Milestones in Media and Politics {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref>\n\n=== In America ===\n\nIn 1729, Benjamin Franklin began writing a new form of newspaper that was more satirical and more involved in civic affairs than previously seen. In 1735, [[John Peter Zenger]] was accused of seditious libel by the governor of New York, William Cosby. Zenger was found not guilty, largely in part to his attorney Andrew Hamilton, who later wrote a paper in which he argued that newspapers should be free to criticize the government as long as it was true. Later, with the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, freedom of the press would be guaranteed by the First Amendment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1830s, newspapers started seeking commercial success and turned toward reportage. This began with the New York Sun in 1833. Advancements in technology made it cheaper to print newspapers and \"penny papers\" emerged. These issues sought out local news and coverage of society. Later, news-gathering became a central function of newspapers. With the invention of the telegraph in 1845, the \"[[Inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]]\" structure of news was developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/735/04/|title=Purdue OWL: Journalism and Journalistic Writing|website=owl.english.purdue.edu|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref> Through the latter half of the 1800s, politics played a role in what newspapers published. By the end of the century, modern aspects of newspapers, such as banner headlines, extensive use of illustrations, \"funny pages,\" and expanded coverage of organized sporting events, began to appear. Also, media consolidation began with many independent newspapers becoming part of \"chains\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe early 1900s saw Progressive Era journalists using a new style of investigative journalism that revealed the corrupt practices of government officials. These exposing articles became featured in many newspapers and magazines. The people who wrote them became labeled as \"muckrakers\". They became very influential and were a vital force in the Progressive reform movement. However, after 1912 muckraking declined. The public began to think the expos\u00e9s were sensationalized, but they did make a great impact on future policies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the 1920s, radio became a news medium, and was a significant source of breaking news. Although, during World War I, radio broadcasts in America were only given information about Allied victories because Great Britain had a monopoly on the transatlantic radio lines. For the newspapers, the government suppressed any radical or German papers during and after the war.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWith the introduction of the television came The Communications Act of 1934. It was an agreement between commercial television and the people of the United States that established that: The airways are public property; Commercial broadcasters are licensed to use the airways; The main condition for use will be whether the broadcaster served \"the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\" During the Vietnam War, the media reporting directly challenged the government, drawing attention to the \"credibility gap\" \u2014 official lies and half-truths about the war.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTelevision news continued to expand during the 1970s, and by 1990, more than half of American homes had cable systems and nationally oriented newspapers expanded their reach. With technological advancements in the newsroom, notably the Internet, a new emphasis on computer-assisted reporting and a new blending of media forms emerged, with one reporter preparing the same story in print, online, and on camera for a newspaper's cable station.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n\nA [[medium (communication)|\"medium\"]] (plural \"media\") is a carrier of something. Common things carried by media include [[information]], art, or physical objects. A medium may provide transmission or storage of information or both.\nThe industries which produce news and entertainment content for the [[mass media]] are often called \"the media\" (in much the same way the newspaper industry is called \"the [[news|press]]\"). In the late 20th century it became commonplace for this usage to be construed as singular (\"The media is...\") rather than as the traditional plural.\n\n\"Press\" is the collective designation of media vehicles that carry out journalism and other functions of informative communication, in contrast to purely propaganda or entertainment communication. The term press comes from the [[printing press]] of [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the sixteenth century and which, from the eighteenth century, was used to print newspapers, then the only existing journalistic vehicles. From the middle of the 20th century onwards, newspapers also began to be broadcast and broadcast (radio news and television news) and, with the advent of the World Wide Web, also came the online newspapers, or cyberjornais, or webjornais. Followed by online newspapers, online news videos and online streaming news has been introduced in the 2010s.  The term \"press\", however, was maintained.\n\n==Broadcasting==\n\n'''Broadcasting''' is the distribution of [[sound|audio]] and [[video]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signals]] (programs) to a number of recipients (\"listeners\" or \"viewers\") that belong to a large group.  This group may be the public in general, or a relatively large audience within the public.  Thus, an [[Internet]] channel may distribute text or music worldwide, while a [[public address]] system in (for example) a workplace may broadcast very limited ''ad hoc'' [[soundbite]]s to a small population within its range.\n\nThe sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a [[scheduling (broadcasting)|schedule]].\n\nTelevision and radio programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or [[cable television|cable]], often simultaneously.  By coding signals and having [[Descrambler|decoding]] equipment in homes, the latter also enables [[subscription]]-based channels and [[pay-per-view]] services.\n\nA broadcasting [[organization]] may broadcast several programs at the same time, through several channels ([[frequencies]]), for example [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two|Two]]. On the other hand, two or more organizations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day. [[Digital radio]] and [[digital television]] may also transmit [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] programming, with several channels [[data compression|compressed]] into one [[DAB ensemble|ensemble]].\n\nWhen broadcasting is done via the Internet the term [[webcasting]] is often used.\n\nBroadcasting forms a very large segment of the [[mass media]].\n\nBroadcasting to a very narrow range of audience is called [[narrowcast]]ing.\n\n===Television===\n\nIn a broadcast system (television), journalists or reporters are also involved with editing the video material that has been shot alongside their research, and in working on the visual [[narrative]] of the story. Broadcast journalists often make an appearance in the news story at the beginning or end of the video clip.\n\nIn [[television]] or [[broadcast journalism]], news analysts (also called news-casters or news anchors) examine, interpret, and broadcast news received from various [[Journalism sourcing|sources]] of information. ''Anchors'' present this as news, either videotaped or live, through transmissions from on-the-scene reporters (news correspondents).\n\nNews films (\"clips\") can vary in length; there are some which may be as long as ten minutes, others that need to fit in all the relevant information and material in two or three minutes. News channels these days have also begun to host special [[documentary films]] that stretch for much longer durations and are able to explore a news subject or issue in greater detail.\n\nThe desk persons categorise news stories with various formats according to the merit of the story. Such formats include AVO, AVO Byte, Pkg, VO SOT, VOX POP, and Ancho Visual.\n* The AVO, or Anchor Voice Over, is the short form of news. The story is written in a gist. According to the script visual is edited. The anchor reads the news while the visual is broadcast simultaneously. Generally, the duration of an AVO is 30 to 40 seconds. The script is three to four lines. At first the anchor starts to read the news, and, after reading one or one-and-a-half lines, the visual is aired, overlapping the face of anchor.\n* The AVO Byte has two parts: An AVO, and one or more bytes. This is the same as an AVO, except that as soon as the AVO ends, the Byte is aired.\n* The Pkg has three parts: Anchor, Voice Over, and Sign Off. At first a Script is written. A voice over anchor reads the anchor or anchor intro part.\n*\n\n==Newspapers==\n{{main|Newspaper}}\n\n[[File:Statue of Len Ganeway reading (Brookgreen Gardens, Pawleys Island, South Carolina).jpg|thumb|left|Reading the newspaper: [[Brookgreen Gardens]] in [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina|Pawleys Island]], [[South Carolina]].]]\nA newspaper is a lightweight and disposable [[publication]] (more specifically, a [[periodical]]), usually printed on low-cost paper called [[newsprint]]. It may be general or special interest, and may be published daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly.\n\nGeneral-interest newspapers are usually journals of current [[news]] on a variety of topics. Those can include [[Politics|political events]], [[crime]], [[business]], [[Sportswriting|sports]], and opinions (either [[editorial]]s, [[columnist|columns]], or [[political cartoon]]s). Many also include weather news and [[weather forecast|forecasts]]. Newspapers increasingly use photographs to illustrate stories; they also often include [[comic strips]] and other entertainment, such as [[crossword]]s.\n\n=== Print journalism ===\n\n[[File:CBC journalists in Montreal.jpg|thumb|Journalists at work in [[Montreal]] in the 1940s]]\n\nA '''story''' is a single article, [[news]] item or [[feature story|feature]], usually concerning a single [[wikt:event|event]], issue, [[theme (literature)|theme]], or [[wikt:profile|profile]] of a person. ''Correspondents'' report news occurring in the main, locally, from their own country, or from foreign cities where they are stationed.\n\nMost reporters ''file'' information or write their stories electronically from remote locations. In many cases, ''breaking stories'' are written by staff members, through information collected and submitted by other reporters who are out on the field gathering information for an event that has just occurred and needs to be broadcast instantly. Radio and television reporters often compose stories and report \"live\" from the scene. Some journalists also interpret the news or offer opinions and analysis to readers, viewers, or listeners. In this role, they are called commentators or columnists.\n\n[[Reporter]]s take notes and also take photographs or shoot videos, either on their own, by citizens or through a [[photographer]] or camera person. In the second phase, they organize the material, determine the focus or emphasis (identify the peg), and finally write their stories. The story is then [[editing|edited]] by news or copy-editors (U.S. style) or sub-editors in Europe, who function from the ''news desk''. The headline of the story is decided by the news desk, and practically never by the reporter or the writer of the piece. Often, the news desk also heavily re-writes or changes the style and tone of the first draft prepared by the reporter / writer originally. Finally, a collection of stories that have been picked for the newspaper or magazine ''edition'', are laid out on dummy (trial) pages, and after the ''chief editor'' has approved the content, style and language in the material, it is sent for [[publishing]]. The writer is given a ''byline'' for the piece that is published; his or her name appears alongside the article. This process takes place according to the frequency of the publication. News can be published in a variety of formats ([[broadsheet]], [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], [[magazine]] and periodical publications) as well as periods (daily, weekly, semi-weekly, fortnightly or monthly).\n\n==Newsmagazines==\n[[Image:Couverture-3-magazine-2512.JPG|thumb|upright|Cover of ''[[2512 (magazine)|2512]]'', a monthly newsmagazine published in [[R\u00e9union]].]]\n{{main|Newsmagazine}}\n\nA '''newsmagazine''', sometimes called '''news magazine''', is a usually weekly magazine featuring articles on current events. News magazines generally go more in-depth into stories than newspapers, trying to give the reader an understanding of the context surrounding important events, rather than just the facts.\n\n==Newsreels==\n\nA [[newsreel]] was a [[documentary film]] common in the first half of the 20th century, that regularly released in a public presentation place containing filmed [[news]] stories.\n\nCreated by [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]] of [[France]] in 1908, this form of film was a staple of the typical North American, [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries (especially Canada, Australia and New Zealand)]], and throughout European [[film|cinema]] programming schedule from the [[silent movies|silent era]] until the 1960s when television news broadcasting completely supplanted its role.\n\n==Online journalism==\n{{Main|Online newspaper|Online magazine}}\n\n[[File:Newspapers-20101122.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Empty newspaper vending boxes on the street, left to right, the Los Angeles Times (cut off), Epoch Times, a San Diego paper (Gone to the Web, sddt.com), a white unnamed box, and the San Diego Business Journal (cut off)|Newspaper \"gone to the Web\" in California]]\n'''Online journalism''' is [[Journalism|reporting]] and other [[journalism]] produced or distributed via the [[Internet]]. The [[Internet]] has allowed the formal and informal publication of news stories through mainstream media outlets as well as [[blog]]s and other [[self-publishing|self-published]] news stories. Journalists working on the Internet have been referred to as J-Bloggers, a term coined by Australian Media Academic Dr Nicola Goc to describe journalists who [blog] and [blog]gers who produce journalism. \"J-Bloggers: Internet bloggers acting in the role of journalists disseminating newsworthy information, who subscribe to the journalistic ideals of an obligation to the truth and the public's right to know\".<ref>Media and Journalism: Theory to Practice (2008) Melbourne: OUP, p45</ref>\n\nAn early leader was ''[[The News & Observer]]'' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], USA.\n\nMany news organizations based in other media also distribute news online. How much they take advantage of the medium varies. Some news organizations use the web only or primarily.\n\nThe Internet challenges traditional news organizations in several ways. They may be losing [[classified ad]]s to Web sites, which are often targeted by interest instead of geography. The [[advertising]] on news web sites is sometimes insufficient to support the investment.\n\nEven before the Internet, technology and perhaps other factors were dividing people's attention, leading to more but narrower media outlets.\n\nOnline journalism also leads to the spread of independent online media such as [[openDemocracy]] and the UK, [[Wikinews]] as well as allowing smaller news organizations to publish to a broad audience, such as [[mediastrike]].\n\n=== Streaming Journalism ===\n\nLive online streaming journalism began on various online platforms in the late 2010s, such as youtube.com and twitch.tv (which began primarily as a live streaming platform targeting gamers, then expanding into non-gaming topics including news and political reporting and commentary).\n== News coverage and new media ==\nBy covering news, politics, weather, sports, entertainment, and vital events, the daily media shape the dominant cultural, social and political picture of society. Beyond the media networks, independent news sources have evolved to report on events which escape attention or underlie the major stories.  In recent years, the [[blogosphere]] has taken reporting a step further, mining down to the experiences and perceptions of individual citizens.\n\nAn exponentially growing phenomenon, the blogosphere can be abuzz with news that is overlooked by the press and TV networks. Due to the rise of social media involvement in news, the most common news value has become entertainment in recent years.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=What is News?: News values revisited again|last=Harcup|first=Tony|date=1 Mar 2016|doi = 10.1080/1461670X.2016.1150193}}</ref> Apropos of this was [[Robert F.

Portland had traded [[Geoff Petrie]] and [[Steve Hawes]] to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] for the second overall pick, which they used to select Lucas. In the 1976\u201377 NBA season, Lucas led the Trail Blazers in scoring, minutes played, [[Field goal (basketball)|field goals]], [[free throw]]s, and offensive [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]. Not only did the team qualify for their first trip to the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] that season, but Lucas and teammate [[Bill Walton]] led the Trail Blazers past the favored [[Los Angeles Lakers]], sweeping them 4\u20130 in the Western Conference Finals, and a surprising come-from-behind 4\u20132 upset victory over the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the [[1977 NBA Finals]].\n\nIn that NBA Finals series, Lucas asserted his \"enforcer\" role in Game 2. With the 76ers comfortably ahead late in the game, the Blazers streaked down the floor on a fast break. [[Lionel Hollins]] missed the shot, both [[Bob Gross]] and [[Darryl Dawkins]] went up and wrestled for the rebound, and both came crashing to the floor. As Dawkins ran up court, he threw a punch that largely missed Gross, nailing his own teammate [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] instead.  As Dawkins reached mid-court, Lucas greeted him with an elbow to the head, after which they briefly squared off.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucas vs Dawkins Fight|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lHM6h40Zo}}</ref>  Both benches emptied and Dawkins and Lucas were ejected. Although the 76ers would go on to win the game and go up 2\u20130 in the series, Lucas' actions appeared to alter the momentum of the series in favor of the Blazers. Inspired, Portland won the next two games at home in blowouts, then won at Philadelphia, and closed out the 76ers at home to win the series. ''Sports Illustrated'' featured Lucas on their cover for their 1977-78 NBA preview issue, spotlighting enforcers throughout the league. He remained with Portland until 1980 when he was traded to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in exchange for [[Calvin Natt]].\n\nAfter a year with the Nets, Lucas was traded to the [[New York Knicks]] for [[Ray Williams (basketball)|Ray Williams]]. In 1982, he was dealt to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for [[Truck Robinson]]. In Phoenix, Lucas helped an injury-plagued Suns team reach the Western Conference Finals in 1984. Ironically, Lucas would sign with the team Phoenix lost to in 1984, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], following the 1985 season. On Wednesday, December 4, 1985, Lucas made a 60-foot shot at the regulation buzzer to send the game into overtime.  The Lakers would go on to defeat the [[Utah Jazz]] 131-127.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=60-foot shot sets up Lakers' win, 131-127 |url= |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |location= |date=December 5, 1985 |access-date= |page=8C }}</ref>  After the Lakers lost the 1986 Western Conference Finals to the [[Houston Rockets]], Lucas moved to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] for one year, before returning to the Trail Blazers for his final NBA season in [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1988]].\n\nIn his fourteen-year [[professional basketball]] career \u2013 two in the ABA and 12 in the NBA \u2013 Lucas scored 14,857 points and gathered 9,306 rebounds in 1021 games.

He then played twelve seasons in the [[National Basketball Association|National Basketball Association (NBA)]] with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[New Jersey Nets]], [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]], [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. The starting [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] on the [[1976\u201377 Portland Trail Blazers season|Trail Blazers' 1976\u201377 NBA Championship team]], he was [[nickname]]d '''''The Enforcer''''' because of his primary role on the court which was best exemplified in Game 2 of the [[1977 NBA Finals|NBA Finals that season]].\n\n==College==\nLucas played college basketball for head coach [[Al McGuire]] with the then-[[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette Warriors]] for two years, leading them to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championship game]] in 1974.

Portland had traded [[Geoff Petrie]] and [[Steve Hawes]] to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] for the second overall pick, which they used to select Lucas. In the 1976\u201377 NBA season, Lucas led the Trail Blazers in scoring, minutes played, [[Field goal (basketball)|field goals]], [[free throw]]s, and offensive [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]. Not only did the team qualify for their first trip to the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] that season, but Lucas and teammate [[Bill Walton]] led the Trail Blazers past the favored [[Los Angeles Lakers]], sweeping them 4\u20130 in the Western Conference Finals, and a surprising come-from-behind 4\u20132 upset victory over the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the [[1977 NBA Finals]].\n\nIn that NBA Finals series, Lucas asserted his \"enforcer\" role in Game 2. With the 76ers comfortably ahead late in the game, the Blazers streaked down the floor on a fast break. [[Lionel Hollins]] missed the shot, both [[Bob Gross]] and [[Darryl Dawkins]] went up and wrestled for the rebound, and both came crashing to the floor. As Dawkins ran up court, he threw a punch that largely missed Gross, nailing his own teammate [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] instead.  As Dawkins reached mid-court, Lucas greeted him with an elbow to the head, after which they briefly squared off.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucas vs Dawkins Fight|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lHM6h40Zo}}</ref>  Both benches emptied and Dawkins and Lucas were ejected. Although the 76ers would go on to win the game and go up 2\u20130 in the series, Lucas' actions appeared to alter the momentum of the series in favor of the Blazers. Inspired, Portland won the next two games at home in blowouts, then won at Philadelphia, and closed out the 76ers at home to win the series. ''Sports Illustrated'' featured Lucas on their cover for their 1977-78 NBA preview issue, spotlighting enforcers throughout the league. He remained with Portland until 1980 when he was traded to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in exchange for [[Calvin Natt]].\n\nAfter a year with the Nets, Lucas was traded to the [[New York Knicks]] for [[Ray Williams (basketball)|Ray Williams]]. In 1982, he was dealt to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for [[Truck Robinson]]. In Phoenix, Lucas helped an injury-plagued Suns team reach the Western Conference Finals in 1984. Ironically, Lucas would sign with the team Phoenix lost to in 1984, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], following the 1985 season. On Wednesday, December 4, 1985, Lucas made a 60-foot shot at the regulation buzzer to send the game into overtime.  The Lakers would go on to defeat the [[Utah Jazz]] 131-127.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=60-foot shot sets up Lakers' win, 131-127 |url= |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |location= |date=December 5, 1985 |access-date= |page=8C }}</ref>  After the Lakers lost the 1986 Western Conference Finals to the [[Houston Rockets]], Lucas moved to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] for one year, before returning to the Trail Blazers for his final NBA season in [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1988]].\n\nIn his fourteen-year [[professional basketball]] career \u2013 two in the ABA and 12 in the NBA \u2013 Lucas scored 14,857 points and gathered 9,306 rebounds in 1021 games.

At [[Callao]] (25 January \u2013 6 February 1935) they joined in the 400-year celebration of Peru. ''Karlsruhe'' returned to Kiel on 15 June 1935, travelling through the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Houston]], [[Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis|Charlestown]] and [[Vigo, Spain]].{{sfn|Hildebrand|R\u00f6hr|Steinmetz|1993|p=89}}\n\nFollowing his journey on ''Karlsruhe'', Topp attended the main cadet course at the [[Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik]] (30 June 1935&nbsp;\u2013 29 June 1936).<ref group=Tr>main cadet course\u2014''Hauptlehrgang f\u00fcr F\u00e4hnriche''</ref> During this time frame at the naval academy, he advanced in rank to ''[[F\u00e4hnrich zur See]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 July 1935.

Topp's fifth war patrol began in Kiel on 11 July 1940 and was destined for the [[North Atlantic]], into the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]], and [[The Minch]]. Because the ''[[Gruppenhorchger\u00e4t]]'', a [[hydrophone]] [[Phased array|array]], was experiencing technical difficulties, Topp took ''U-57''  to port for repairs. ''U-57'' arrived in Bergen on 15 July, departed again that day only to return to Bergen on 20 July. Two days later, ''U-57'' was able to begin its patrol. The ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]'' (BdU\u2014supreme commander of the U-boat arm) credited Topp with the sinking three ships of {{GRT|12,773|link=off}} of shipping.

[[U-boat|U-Boat]] commanders of [[World War II]]. He was a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. He sank 35 ships for a total of {{GRT|197,460|disp=long}}. After the war he served with the Federal [[German Navy]], reaching the rank of ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral). He later served in [[NATO]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nTopp was born in [[Hannover]] on 2 July 1914.{{sfn|Mitcham|2012|p=258}} Topp joined the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' on 8 April 1935 as a member of \"Crew 34\" (the incoming class of 1934).<ref group=\"Note\">The German ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' was renamed to ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' on 1 June 1935.</ref> He received his military basic training in the 2nd company in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Stralsund]] (8 April 1934&nbsp;\u2013 13 June 1934).<ref group=Tr>2nd company\u20142. ''Kompanie''</ref><ref group=Tr>2nd department\u2014II. ''Abteilung''</ref><ref group=Tr>standing ship division\u2014''Schiffsstammdivision''</ref> He was then transferred to the [[school ship]] [[Gorch Fock (1933)|''Gorch Fock'']] on 14 June 1934, and to the light cruiser {{Ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}} on 27 September 1934.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=141}} Under the command of ''Kapit\u00e4n zur See'' [[G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens]], Topp sailed on ''Karlsruhe''{{'}}s fourth training cruise. ''Karlsruhe'' left [[Kiel]] on 22 October 1934. The ship sailed via [[Skagen]], the [[Azores]] and [[Trinidad]] on the east coast of [[South America]], passed the [[Cape Horn]], up the west coast of South, [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle]] and [[North America]] to Vancouver. At [[Callao]] (25 January \u2013 6 February 1935) they joined in the 400-year celebration of Peru. ''Karlsruhe'' returned to Kiel on 15 June 1935, travelling through the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Houston]], [[Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis|Charlestown]] and [[Vigo, Spain]].{{sfn|Hildebrand|R\u00f6hr|Steinmetz|1993|p=89}}\n\nFollowing his journey on ''Karlsruhe'', Topp attended the main cadet course at the [[Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik]] (30 June 1935&nbsp;\u2013 29 June 1936).<ref group=Tr>main cadet course\u2014''Hauptlehrgang f\u00fcr F\u00e4hnriche''</ref> During this time frame at the naval academy, he advanced in rank to ''[[F\u00e4hnrich zur See]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 July 1935. Starting on 30 June 1936, he underwent a number of specialized weapons training courses for cadets at various naval schools.<ref group=Tr>weapons course for cadets\u2014''Waffenlehrgang f\u00fcr F\u00e4hnriche''</ref> On 16 October 1936, he was again transferred to ''Karlsruhe'', staying onboard until 31 March 1937. The next day, he was promoted to ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' (Second Lieutenant) and took a torpedo training course which he completed on 17 April. On 18 April, he was yet again posted to ''Karlsruhe'', serving as an [[adjutant]] until 4 October 1937.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=141}}\n\nOn 5 October 1937, Topp started his U-boat training at the U-boat school in [[Neustadt in Holstein]] before he became an instruction officer at the naval non-commissioned officer training department in Friedrichsort, a borough of Kiel, on 2 June 1938.<ref group=Tr>naval non-commissioned officer training department\u2014M.L.A ''Marineunteroffizierslehrabteilung''</ref>  Topp was then posted to the [[7th U-boat Flotilla|Wegener Flotilla]] on 26 September 1938. There, he was appointed 1st watch officer on {{GS|U-46|1938|2}} under the command of ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' [[Herbert Sohler]]. On 1 April 1939, Topp was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' (sub-lieutenant).{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=142}}\n\n===National Socialism===\nIn May 1933, Topp joined the [[Nazi Party]] and in 1934 also joined the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]''.{{sfn|Mulligan|2013|p=}} Topp took the [[Hitler oath]], convinced it was the \"right thing to do.\"{{sfn|Rust|1993|p=157}} To the beginning of the war at least, his peers regarded Topp as a Nazi.{{sfn|Vause|1997|p=96}} Topp made the acquaintance of [[Martin Bormann]], Hitler's personal secretary and head of the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]]. Bormann married the sister of Topp's crew mate, Walter Buch. Topp was close enough to be invited to Bormann's residence in [[Berchtesgaden]].{{sfn|Topp|1992|p=98}} Topp's political outlook was not shared by his uncle. His aunt through marriage, Anna Topp, was [[Jewish]]. During the Nazi reign she was sent to and survived the [[Theresienstadt Ghetto]]. {{sfn|Topp|1992|pp=120, 129\u2013131}} In his memoirs Topp claimed not to have believed in [[Nazi ideology]].{{sfn|Topp|1992|p=125}} One analyst wrote, \"the contrasts and Topp's individual course make obvious the limitations of any quantitative study\" [of his political convictions].{{sfn|Mulligan|2013|p=}}\n\nTopp came to terms with the Nazi regime and its crimes postwar.{{sfn|Mulligan|2013|p=}} He entered into heated arguments with former comrades over the cause for which they fought. Topp was particularly critical of Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], commander-in-chief of U-boats and later the ''Kriegsmarine''.{{sfn|Mulligan|2013|p=}} After the war, Topp expressed his view that the German naval command, and his superior Karl D\u00f6nitz, knew of the [[Holocaust]].{{sfn|Rust|1993|p=158}} Topp referenced D\u00f6nitz's commitment to [[National Socialism]], admiration for Hitler, and his presence at the [[Posen speeches]]. Topp was critical of D\u00f6nitz's pretensions to have been an apolitical soldier.{{sfn|Rust|1993|pp=158\u2013159}} Topp said of D\u00f6nitz, that his failure to do anything about it \"comes very close to a passive toleration of these insane crimes.\"{{sfn|Vause|1997|p=195}} Few former U-boat commanders were as vocal in attacking D\u00f6nitz's character. His aunt's experiences in the ghetto from 1943 may have been a factor.{{sfn|Vause|1997|p=195}} D\u00f6nitz confronted Topp personally when the later called upon him. He purportedly greeted Topp with a question, \"I understand you think I should have been executed!?\"{{sfn|Rust|1993|p=159}} He presented Topp with his accusation, underlined, and a letter from [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], the official historian of the [[United States Navy]], which accepted D\u00f6nitz's defence that he knew nothing of the Nazi crimes. It was Morrison that told D\u00f6nitz of Topp's accusations, or \"doubts\", as Topp later claimed they were.{{sfn|Rust|1993|p=159}}\n\n==World War II==\n[[World War II]] commenced following the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939. ''U-46'', under the command of Sohler, had already been at sea since 19 August, returning to port on 15 September. Topp sailed on three further patrols on ''U-46'' (3 October \u2013 7 November 1939, 19 December 1939 \u2013 10 January 1940 and 11 March \u2013 23 April 1940). During these patrols, ''U-46'' sank one ship of {{GRT|7,028|disp=long}} on 17 October and another ship of {{GRT|924|link=off}} on 21 December.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1968|pp=19, 28}} For his service on ''U-46'', Topp was awarded the [[U-boat War Badge]] ({{lang|de|U-Boot-Kriegsabzeichen}}) on 7 November 1939 and the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse}}) in January 1940. On 1 May 1940, he was transferred to the [[1st U-boat Flotilla]].{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=142}}\n\n===Command of ''U-57''===\nAfter eight war patrols under the command of ''Kapit\u00e4nleutnant'' [[Claus Korth]], command of {{GS|U-57|1938|2}} of the [[1st U-boat Flotilla]] was passed to Topp on 5 June 1940. Topp's fifth war patrol began in Kiel on 11 July 1940 and was destined for the [[North Atlantic]], into the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]], and [[The Minch]]. Because the ''[[Gruppenhorchger\u00e4t]]'', a [[hydrophone]] [[Phased array|array]], was experiencing technical difficulties, Topp took ''U-57''  to port for repairs. ''U-57'' arrived in Bergen on 15 July, departed again that day only to return to Bergen on 20 July. Two days later, ''U-57'' was able to begin its patrol. The ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]'' (BdU\u2014supreme commander of the U-boat arm) credited Topp with the sinking three ships of {{GRT|12,773|link=off}} of shipping. On 7 August, ''U-57'' arrived in [[Lorient]], France.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=143}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1968|pp=61, 63}}\n\nOn 14 August 1940, ''U-57'' departed from Lorient on its tenth war patrol. Again Topp led ''U-57'' into the North Atlantic, the North Channel and the [[Hebrides]]. On this patrol, Kretschmer sank three ships of {{GRT|24,088|link=off}}, and damaged another ship of {{GRT|5,407|link=off}}. On 3 September 1940, ''U-57'' collided with the Norwegian vessel ''Rona'' near the [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]] at [[Brunsb\u00fcttel]] and sank.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|pp=142\u2013143}} Following the loss of ''U-57'' \u2014 the boat was later raised and used for training purposes \u2014 Topp was awarded Iron Cross 1st Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse}}) and initially remained with 1st U-boat Flotilla. On 4 November, he was sent to [[Blohm & Voss]], the shipbuilding works in [[Hamburg]], for construction training of {{GS|U-552||2}}, a [[Type VII U-boat|Type VIIC U-boat]].{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=143}}\n\n===Transfer to ''U-552''===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-3676-28, St. Nazaire, Uboot U 552.jpg|thumb|left|''U-552'' returning to St. Nazaire, Koitschka standing left of Topp]]\nOn 4 December 1940, Topp took command of ''U-552'' and commissioned the U-boat into the [[7th U-boat Flotilla]]. Following sea trials and training, Topp, with ''Leutnant zur See'' [[Siegfried Koitschka]] as his second watch officer, took ''U-552'' on its first war patrol on 13 February 1941. The patrol which was destined for the North Atlantic west of Ireland began in Kiel. That day, they headed for Brunsb\u00fcttel where they stayed one day. The following day, ''U-552'' made a stopover at [[Cuxhaven]] before leaving for [[Heligoland]] on 15 February. After three days at Heligoland, Topp took the boat into the North Atlantic. ''U-552''{{'}}s first patrol ended in [[Saint-Nazaire]], France on 16 March 1941.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=143}} On this patrol, Topp sank two ships of {{GRT|12,749|link=off}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1968|p=105}}\n\nThe second patrol on ''U-552'' began on 7 April 1941 from Saint-Nazaire and targeted the shipping routes in the North Atlantic, south of [[Iceland]]. On this patrol, the BdU credited Topp with the sinking of three ships and one escort totaling {{GRT|24,319|link=off}}. The patrol ended on 6 May, again in Saint-Nazaire.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=144}} In reality, Topp sank three ships totaling {{GRT|15,970|link=off}}, and damaged one ship of {{GRT|8,190|link=off}} which was then sunk by {{GS|U-201||2}} ([[Adalbert Schnee]]).{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1968|p=117}} On 25 May, Topp took ''U-552'' on its third war patrol. The next day, ''U-552'' returned to Saint-Nazaire before heading for North Channel on 3 June. The BdU assumed that Topp sank three ships of {{GRT|25,548|link=off}} and he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}) on 20 June 1941. This patrol ended on 2 July in Saint-Nazaire.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|pp=142, 144}} Later analysis revealed that the true tonnage sunk accumulated to {{GRT|24,401|link=off}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1968|p=130}} One of the ships was the {{GRT|10,948|link=off}} [[List of shipwrecks in June 1941#18 June|''Norfolk'']]. The vessel carried mail an steel plates among 4,000 tons of general cargo. Captain Frederick Lougheed and 69 men were saved; one man was lost.{{sfn|Tennent|2001|p=134}}\n\n''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' [[Harro Schacht]] was Topp's cammander in training on ''U-552''{{'}}s fourth war patrol. The patrol, which began on 18 August and ended on 26 August in Saint-Nazaire, resulted in the sinking of one ship of {{GRT|2,129|link=off}}.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=144}} This ship had previously been damaged by {{GS|U-564||2}} ([[Reinhard Suhren]]).{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1968|p=154}} Following this patrol, Topp was promoted to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (Captain Lieutenant) on 1 September 1941. The fifth war patrol took ''U-552'' into the North Atlantik, patrolling southeast of [[Greenland]]. Topp left Saint-Nazaire on 4 September and sank three ships of {{GRT|18,687|link=off}}.

All of her officers and over 100 of the crew went down with the ship.{{sfn|Padfield|1995|p=164}} The destruction of the ''Reuben James'' facilitated a worsening of already rapidly deteriorating diplomatic relations between [[Nazi Germany]] and the still nominally neutral [[United States of America]].

In August 1944, Topp was appointed head of the department charged with introducing the [[Type XXI submarine]]s into service, the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged. In this position, he was promoted to ''[[Fregattenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Frigate Captain) on 1 December 1944.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=142}}\n\nOn 23 March 1945, he was appointed commander of {{GS|U-3010||2}} in the [[4th U-boat Flotilla]], and commander of {{GS|U-2513||2}} in the [[11th U-boat Flotilla]] on 26 April.

His first assignment was with the [[Armed Forces Staff (Germany)|''F\u00fchrungsstab der Marine'']] (Navy Staff). On 16 August 1958, he served with the [[NATO Military Committee]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], initially as a naval speaker, later as the [[chief-of-staff]] of the German delegation in Washington. During this assignment, he was promoted to ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (captain at sea/captain) on 1 November 1959.

On 1 October 1966, Topp was named deputy [[Inspector of the Navy]] and at the same time became the chief of the ''F\u00fchrungsstab der Marine'' in the Federal Ministry of Defence. In this role, Topp was promoted to ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (Counter Admiral) on 21 December 1966. Topp held this position until 30 September 1969. He then continued to serve with Inspector of the Navy until his retirement on 31 December 1969. For his service with the ''Bundesmarine'', Topp was awarded the Commander's Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] ({{lang|de|Gro\u00dfes Verdienstkreuz des Verdienstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}) on 19 September 1969.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=143}}\n\nIn 1968, Topp had been considered as head of the Plans & Policy department with the [[Allied Forces Northern Europe]] (AFNORTH) in [[Kols\u00e5s]], Norway which at the time was headed by the German ''Konteradmiral'' Heinrich Erdmann. The [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR), US General [[Lyman Lemnitzer]], had originally approved this nomination. In order to not unnecessarily stress the German-Norwegian relationship, Topp had sunk four Norwegian vessels in World War II, Lemnitzer later decided against Topp and appointed ''Konteradmiral'' [[Friedrich Guggenberger]] instead.{{sfn|Gablik|1996|p=129}}\n\nAfter retiring from the Bundesmarine, for a few years Topp was a technical advisor to the German shipyard [[HDW]] AG.

His memoirs \"The Odyssey of a U-Boat Commander: The Recollections of Erich Topp\" was published in 1992. When Topp was asked in 1996 by publisher/historian [[Theodore P. Savas]] to contribute a Foreword for a collection of essays on German U-boat commanders, he instead submitted a contribution about his close friend [[Engelbert Endrass]], who was lost with his crew and boat {{GS|U-567||2}} off Gibraltar in late December 1941. Topp had privately penned the piece about their friendship on his next patrol to the east coast of America, but had never submitted it for publication. The essay was translated from German and footnoted by Dr. Eric Rust, and appeared as the opening chapter in \"Silent Hunters: German U-boat Commanders of World War II\" (1997, 2003, 2005). Savas also recruited Topp to serve as the technical adviser for the 2001 submarine simulation computer game [[Silent Hunter II]], and a series of interviews with him appears in the game.{{sfn|Bub|1999}} He was interviewed on World War II submarine operations for the [[Nova (American TV series)|Nova (TV series)]] special [[Hitler's Lost Sub]], which detailed the efforts of a team of divers, led by [[John Chatterton]] and [[Richie Kohler]] to identify an unknown German U-Boat wreck 65 miles off the coast of New Jersey; the wreck was identified as {{GS|U-869||2}}.{{sfn|Der Spiegel Die letzte Feindfahrt}}\n\nTopp died on 26 December 2005, in [[S\u00fc\u00dfen]] at the age of 91; he was survived by two sons, Peter Kay (1945-2015) and Michael (b. 1950), and five grandchildren.\n\n==Summary of career==\n\n===Ships attacked===\nAs commander of {{GS|U-57|1938|2}} and {{GS|U-552||2}}, Topp is credited with the sinking of 35 ships for a total of {{GRT|197,460|disp=long}}, further damaging four ships of {{GRT|32,317}} and sinking one warship, {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|6}}, of {{convert|1190|LT|abbr=off}}, killing a total of approximately 822 crew, troops and passengers.\n{{Clear}}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:right; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width: 100%;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | Chronicle of ships attacked\n|-\n!Date\n!U-boat\n!Ship\n!Nationality\n!Tonnage\n!Fate\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|17 July 1940\n|align=\"left\" |''U-57''\n|align=\"left\" |[[List of shipwrecks in July 1940#17 July|''O.A.

I stayed in Moscow up to 2004 for higher studies. In the meantime, I got married and went to the United States for a living. I had a job in a pharmacy there. Life was good enough. I came back to Bangladesh in 2006 for a short visit. I got offers for acting in the film at that time suddenly. There is no one in my family who ever performed in films. So I came to act here out of curiosity. But the interesting fact is that the very first movie in which I acted has yet to be released! My first released movie is \u2018Pitar ashon\u2019.\"\n\nAfter being successful in Dhaka film industry, Film Actress Nipun has also acted in Bangla film of Kolkata. Soon she will be seen in the Tollywood film for the first time. Star Bangladeshi actor Ferdous and famous west Bengal star of the time Proshenjit has acted with her in the movie named \u2018Porichoy\u2019.\n\nBangladeshi Film Actress Nipun said in this regard, \"Actor [[Ferdous Ahmed]] played a major role to take my opportunity to act in the movie. It is he who discussed with the director Rupali Chatterjee and producer Shomu Gawal for giving me an opportunity. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest chances of my life.\" \"I was afraid hearing that I have to work with Bumbada. But when he came to me and introduced himself, I felt relieved.\"In recent times, Nipun performed in some of the commercially successful movies. In 2017, Nipun has been elected as an active member of [[Bangladesh Film Development Corporation]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.priyo.com/articles/mousumi-s-chair-is-elegant-in-the-chair-20171011 |script-title=bn:\u09ae\u09cc\u09b8\u09c1\u09ae\u09c0\u09b0 \u09b8\u09cd\u09a5\u09b2\u09be\u09ad\u09bf\u09b7\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09a4 \u09b9\u09b2\u09c7\u09a8 \u09a8\u09bf\u09aa\u09c1\u09a3 |work=Priyo.com |access-date=2017-10-12}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nBangladeshi Film Actress Nipun has so far grabbed two National Film Awards.

I stayed in Moscow up to 2004 for higher studies. In the meantime, I got married and went to the United States for a living. I had a job in a pharmacy there. Life was good enough. I came back to Bangladesh in 2006 for a short visit. I got offers for acting in the film at that time suddenly. There is no one in my family who ever performed in films. So I came to act here out of curiosity. But the interesting fact is that the very first movie in which I acted has yet to be released! My first released movie is \u2018Pitar ashon\u2019.\"\n\nAfter being successful in Dhaka film industry, Film Actress Nipun has also acted in Bangla film of Kolkata. Soon she will be seen in the Tollywood film for the first time. Star Bangladeshi actor Ferdous and famous west Bengal star of the time Proshenjit has acted with her in the movie named \u2018Porichoy\u2019.\n\nBangladeshi Film Actress Nipun said in this regard, \"Actor [[Ferdous Ahmed]] played a major role to take my opportunity to act in the movie. It is he who discussed with the director Rupali Chatterjee and producer Shomu Gawal for giving me an opportunity. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest chances of my life.\" \"I was afraid hearing that I have to work with Bumbada. But when he came to me and introduced himself, I felt relieved.\"In recent times, Nipun performed in some of the commercially successful movies.

Sports]]'', an eight-page contract was sent on December 11, 2009, by Golden Boy Promotions on behalf of Mayweather to [[Top Rank]], representing Pacquiao, that proposed a 50\u201350 financial split between the sides for a fight to take place on March 13, 2010.\n\nThe eight-page agreement was so detailed that it indicated which of the two fighters would step onto the scale first at the weigh-in (Pacquiao), who would walk to the ring first (Pacquiao), who would be introduced first (Mayweather) and who had first choice of the locker room (Mayweather). It detailed that the bout would have been on [[HBO]] [[Pay-Per-View]] at a cost of $59.95. Billing was to be \"Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, presented by Top Rank, Golden Boy Promotions, Mayweather Promotions and M-P Promotions in association with [approved sponsors and the site].\" The contract also called for both fighters to submit to [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-style [[drug test]]ing.\n\nA Mayweather-Pacquiao bout at that time was expected to be the largest-grossing fight in history, in which total revenues could reach $300 million. Experts predicted the fight would sell between 2.5 million and 3 million pay-per-views in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/boxing--floyd-mayweather-and-manny-pacquiao-nearly-agreed-to-a-2010-fight.html |title=Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao nearly agreed to a 2010 fight, documents show |publisher=Yahoo!Sports |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn a video titled \"Boxing Legend Freddie Roach Updates Us On Pacquiao\" uploaded to [[YouTube]] on December 11, 2009, Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, revealed the first hint about Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing, telling roving reporter Elie Seckbach, \"I hear negotiations are a little shady. Schaefer and them are unhappy about something. They want Olympic-style drug testing. I said, 'Yeah, no problem.' I said, 'Whatever you want.' Since we accepted that, now they're running scared again.\"<ref name=\"roach-updates\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGd8r7G7Mxo|title=Boxing Legend Freddie Roach Updates Us On Pacquiao|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn December 13, 2009, Pacquiao's adviser, Michael Koncz, said Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing was a laughing matter and they had no concerns whatsoever about it. \"Our reaction is, 'So what?' We know Manny doesn't take any illegal drugs or anything. And none of this is getting under Manny's skin or anything. I'm here with Manny, and to him, it's like a joke. It's a laughing matter,\" said Koncz.\n\nAfter reports had surfaced that both parties had agreed to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling to comply with the Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent: <blockquote>We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, to me, just signaled that he didn't want the fight.</blockquote> Arum told David Mayo of the [[The Grand Rapids Press|''Grand Rapids Press'']].\n\nNot long after declaring that the fight was off, Arum had a change of heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it deadline to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests\u2014one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: <blockquote>Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.</blockquote>\n\nFreddie Roach told Lance Pugmire of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on December 22 that he would prefer for Pacquiao to give his final blood sample a week before the bout and no later than 72 hours before.\n\nOn December 28, 2009, video from an episode of HBO's ''[[Ricky Hatton vs. Manny Pacquiao|Pacquiao-Hatton:]] 24/7'' surfaced on the internet showing Pacquiao giving blood in the weeks leading up to his May 2, 2009, bout with Ricky Hatton. Documents confirmed that the video was recorded on April 8, 2009, 24 days prior to the fight and past the 30-day cut-off date that Pacquiao had demanded for a Mayweather fight.\n\nBoth sides agreed to enter into [[mediation]] on January 7, 2010, in hopes of coming to an agreement on the blood testing issue. Retired federal judge Daniel Weinstein, who successfully resolved a prior dispute between Top Rank and Golden Boy Promotions, would again act as mediator. Two days later, after hours of negotiating during mediation, Arum declared that the fight was officially off after Mayweather refused to agree to a 24-day cut-off date. Mayweather revealed that he offered a 14-day cut-off date to Team Pacquiao, but it was rejected.\n\nMayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe declared on January 18, 2010, that random blood and urine testing will be implemented in all of Mayweather's future fights, regardless of the opponent. On February 13, 2010, in an exclusive interview with David Mayo of The ''Grand Rapids Press'', Mayweather said, \"I gave him [Pacquiao] a chance, up to 14 days out. But my new terms are all the way up to the fight. They can come get us whenever, all the way up to the fight, random drug test. That's what it is.\"<ref name=\"timeline1\"/>\n\nAfter the failed negotiations, both fighters moved on to instead face other opponents. On March 13, 2010, Pacquiao defeated [[Joshua Clottey]] via unanimous decision, and on May 1, 2010, Mayweather beat Shane Mosley by a unanimous decision.\n\nPacquiao was quoted by the ''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' on May 20, 2010, as saying, \"As long as they're not getting a large amount of blood, I am willing to give out blood as close to two weeks before the fight.\" On the same day, Mayweather revealed that he would be taking the rest of 2010, and possibly 2011, off.\n\nOn June 10, 2010, Oscar De La Hoya said negotiations for a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight were close to being finalized. Speaking to Spanish-language sport show ''[[Rep\u00fablica Deportiva]]'', De La Hoya briefly talked about the current status of negotiations and, with a grin on his face, said that the two sides were extremely close to making the biggest fight in boxing a reality. \"These negotiations have been real difficult for various reasons, but we're really close to finalizing the contracts, even though they've been complicated,\" he commented. \"Today, I can't really talk about the negotiations, but we're really close.\" A week later, Golden Boy Promotions CEO [[Richard Schaefer]] refuted De La Hoya's comments. \"I saw those quotes as well, and I had no idea what Oscar was talking about. And I called him up and asked him about them, and he said that he was misquoted,\" Schaefer explained to Lem Satterfield of ''FanHouse''.\n\nArum declared on June 30, 2010, that there were no longer any issues and the decision was up to Mayweather. \"That's all been resolved,\" Arum stated to Kevin Iole of ''Yahoo! Sports'' regarding the dispute over random blood and urine drug testing. Arum would also tell the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', \"There's no longer any issues....The question is whether Mayweather is willing to fight this year.\" He would reiterate that comment to the ''Manila Bulletin'', stating, \"It's now up to Mayweather if he wants to fight.\"\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Arum issued a July 16 midnight deadline for Mayweather. \"Mayweather has until the end of the week. He could wait until the last minute. If it's Friday [July 16] and it's 11 p.m., and he says we have a deal, we have a deal,\" Arum would explain to Dan Rafael of ESPN. On July 15, 2010, Top Rank's website unveiled an official countdown to the deadline entitled \"Money\" Time: Mayweather's Decision.\n\nAs soon as the deadline for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted of a series of conversations with HBO Sports President [[Ross Greenburg]]. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions: <blockquote>I had a couple of conversations with Ross [Greenburg] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing. He got back to me in a couple of weeks and told me that he had had discussions with [[Al Haymon]], representing Floyd Mayweather, and that everything looked good and we were nearing a resolution...The subsequent conversations with Ross detailed to me conversations he had with Al Haymon. Nowhere was the name Richard Schaefer or Golden Boy mentioned, although I read, as you all did, Oscar's statement that a deal was close, so I assumed from that Haymon was keeping Schaefer and Golden Boy abreast of the situation.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Floyd Mayweather Jr 2011.jpg|thumb|Mayweather in 2011]]\nDuring a Q & A session following his opening statement, Arum further explained, \"We have never talked to anybody on the Mayweather side and all conversations on our part were through Ross Greenburg and he reported on all conversations on the Mayweather side from Al Haymon.\"\n\nOn July 19, 2010, Ellerbe denied that negotiations ever took place and nothing was ever agreed on. Ellerbe stated: <blockquote>Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself speak to each other on a regular basis and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor was there ever a deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is not telling the truth, but history tells us who is lying.</blockquote> Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place.\n\nWhen asked via e-mail for his response to Ellerbe's denial that negotiations ever took place, Greenburg would respond to ESPN's Dan Rafael with the following reply: \"As always we have no comment.\"\n\nRegarding comments he made suggesting that contracts for the mega-fight were close to being finalized, De La Hoya told ''BoxingScene.com'' on July 26, 2010: <blockquote>I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.</blockquote>\n\nAlso on July 26, Greenburg released a statement saying that he had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, 2010. \"I had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, carefully trying to put the fight together. Hopefully, someday this fight will happen. Sports fans deserve it,\" Greenburg revealed in a prepared statement sent out to select members of the media.\n\nSchaefer again supported Ellerbe's denial of negotiations, and challenged both Greenburg and Arum to take lie detector tests. \"I think it's unfortunate that Ross made that statement. I fully stand behind the statement I made. I have not negotiated with Ross and I am not aware of any negotiations that have taken place,\" Schaefer told ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fighthype.com/pages/mayweather-pacquiao-negotiations-timeline-2.html |title=Source:Mayweather-Pacquiao Negotiations Timeline Part 2 |publisher=Fighthype.com |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 8, 2011, ESPN reported that Pacquiao was willing to agree to random drug testing\u2014but not by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). \"We have agreed in the Pacquiao camp to unlimited random testing done by a responsible, neutral organization,\" Arum told Yahoo. <blockquote>We don't believe USADA is a neutral organization. I don't think anybody's test is as vigorous as the test administered by the Olympic Organization. And we can arrange for the Olympic Organization to handle the test under the supervision of the Athletic commission respective of the state where the fight is going to be held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/sport/story/100115.html |title=Pacquiao 'agrees to Mayweather's demands' |publisher=ESPN|date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the following day, Pacquiao's top adviser, Michael Koncz, stated that Pacquiao had never agreed to testing until fight day. \"Will we give blood five days, seven days before the fight? You know, that's something I have to talk to Manny about, but we have nothing to hide,\" Koncz said.\n\nESPN reported on January 20, 2012, that Mayweather called Pacquiao on the telephone and spoke directly with him in the Philippines. \"He ask about a 50/50 split and I told him no that can't happen, but what can happen is you can make more money fighting me then [sic] you have made in your career,\" Mayweather said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7480500/floyd-mayweather-jr-places-telephone-call-manny-pacquiao |title=Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao talk |publisher=ESPN|date=January 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> Mayweather offered to pay him a flat fee of $40 million for a proposed fight but would not allow him to share in the revenue.

From round one, Mayweather used his speed, skills and accurate right hand to tag Ortiz repeatedly. Although Mayweather seemed in control through the first three rounds, judges' scores 30\u201327, 30\u201327, and 29\u201328 for Mayweather, in the fourth round Ortiz had some success, landing a few shots and stinging Mayweather before bulling him into the corner. He then rammed Mayweather in the face with an intentional [[headbutt]], opening a [[Wound|cut]] on the inside and outside of Mayweather's mouth. Referee [[Joe Cortez]] immediately called time out and docked Ortiz a point for the blatant [[Foul (sports)|foul]]. Ortiz, apparently acknowledging his wrongdoing, hugged Mayweather in the corner and even appeared to kiss him.\n\nCortez motioned the fighters back together to resume the fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was not looking at the fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/6991483/floyd-mayweather-won-fight-victor-ortiz-fair-square |title=Mayweather won fair and square |publisher=ESPN |date=September 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s Legal Sucker Punch|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/floyd-mayweather-jrs-legal-sucker-punch/245261/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Gareth|title=Floyd Mayweather accused of blindsiding Victor Ortiz with controversial 'sucker punch' in 4th round KO|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/sport/garethadavies/100019662/floyd-mayweather-accused-of-blindsiding-victor-ortiz-with-controversial-sucker-punch-in-4th-round-ko/|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=December 22, 2011|location=London|date=September 18, 2011}}</ref> After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was \"blindsided\" by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that \"In the ring, you have to protect yourself at all times\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/6983926/floyd-mayweather-scores-controversial-ko-victor-ortiz |title=Mayweather scores controversial KO |publisher=ESPN  |date=September 18, 2011 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMayweather vs. Ortiz was purchased by 1.25 million homes with a value of $78,440,000 in pay-per-view revenue.

Beginning in rounds three and four Cotto cut the ring off from Mayweather, forcing the latter to fight from the ropes. However, Mayweather seemed to outfight Cotto from the ropes with his combinations and by rolling with most of Cotto's punches. Cotto had more success in the middle rounds, landing his jab and body shots on Mayweather and effectively trapping him on the ropes. The later rounds were controlled by Mayweather, who boxed more in the center of the ring late in the fight. In the 12th round Mayweather's uppercut stunned and hurt Cotto, but Cotto was able to fight until the end. The judges scored the fight a unanimous decision for Mayweather by scores of 118\u2013110, 117\u2013111, and 117\u2013111.

In the opening round, Mayweather, as per previous fights, started slow to work out McGregor's tactics. In his post-fight interview, he revealed it was part of the game plan to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges scorecards, the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. McGregor was warned a few times through the fight for hitting behind the head, but no points were deducted by referee Robert Byrd.

Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, to me, just signaled that he didn't want the fight.</blockquote> Arum told David Mayo of the [[The Grand Rapids Press|''Grand Rapids Press'']].\n\nNot long after declaring that the fight was off, Arum had a change of heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it deadline to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests\u2014one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: <blockquote>Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.</blockquote>\n\nFreddie Roach told Lance Pugmire of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on December 22 that he would prefer for Pacquiao to give his final blood sample a week before the bout and no later than 72 hours before.\n\nOn December 28, 2009, video from an episode of HBO's ''[[Ricky Hatton vs. Manny Pacquiao|Pacquiao-Hatton:]] 24/7'' surfaced on the internet showing Pacquiao giving blood in the weeks leading up to his May 2, 2009, bout with Ricky Hatton. Documents confirmed that the video was recorded on April 8, 2009, 24 days prior to the fight and past the 30-day cut-off date that Pacquiao had demanded for a Mayweather fight.\n\nBoth sides agreed to enter into [[mediation]] on January 7, 2010, in hopes of coming to an agreement on the blood testing issue. Retired federal judge Daniel Weinstein, who successfully resolved a prior dispute between Top Rank and Golden Boy Promotions, would again act as mediator. Two days later, after hours of negotiating during mediation, Arum declared that the fight was officially off after Mayweather refused to agree to a 24-day cut-off date. Mayweather revealed that he offered a 14-day cut-off date to Team Pacquiao, but it was rejected.\n\nMayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe declared on January 18, 2010, that random blood and urine testing will be implemented in all of Mayweather's future fights, regardless of the opponent. On February 13, 2010, in an exclusive interview with David Mayo of The ''Grand Rapids Press'', Mayweather said, \"I gave him [Pacquiao] a chance, up to 14 days out. But my new terms are all the way up to the fight. They can come get us whenever, all the way up to the fight, random drug test. That's what it is.\"<ref name=\"timeline1\"/>\n\nAfter the failed negotiations, both fighters moved on to instead face other opponents. On March 13, 2010, Pacquiao defeated [[Joshua Clottey]] via unanimous decision, and on May 1, 2010, Mayweather beat Shane Mosley by a unanimous decision.\n\nPacquiao was quoted by the ''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' on May 20, 2010, as saying, \"As long as they're not getting a large amount of blood, I am willing to give out blood as close to two weeks before the fight.\" On the same day, Mayweather revealed that he would be taking the rest of 2010, and possibly 2011, off.\n\nOn June 10, 2010, Oscar De La Hoya said negotiations for a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight were close to being finalized. Speaking to Spanish-language sport show ''[[Rep\u00fablica Deportiva]]'', De La Hoya briefly talked about the current status of negotiations and, with a grin on his face, said that the two sides were extremely close to making the biggest fight in boxing a reality. \"These negotiations have been real difficult for various reasons, but we're really close to finalizing the contracts, even though they've been complicated,\" he commented. \"Today, I can't really talk about the negotiations, but we're really close.\" A week later, Golden Boy Promotions CEO [[Richard Schaefer]] refuted De La Hoya's comments. \"I saw those quotes as well, and I had no idea what Oscar was talking about. And I called him up and asked him about them, and he said that he was misquoted,\" Schaefer explained to Lem Satterfield of ''FanHouse''.\n\nArum declared on June 30, 2010, that there were no longer any issues and the decision was up to Mayweather. \"That's all been resolved,\" Arum stated to Kevin Iole of ''Yahoo! Sports'' regarding the dispute over random blood and urine drug testing. Arum would also tell the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', \"There's no longer any issues....The question is whether Mayweather is willing to fight this year.\" He would reiterate that comment to the ''Manila Bulletin'', stating, \"It's now up to Mayweather if he wants to fight.\"\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Arum issued a July 16 midnight deadline for Mayweather. \"Mayweather has until the end of the week. He could wait until the last minute. If it's Friday [July 16] and it's 11 p.m., and he says we have a deal, we have a deal,\" Arum would explain to Dan Rafael of ESPN. On July 15, 2010, Top Rank's website unveiled an official countdown to the deadline entitled \"Money\" Time: Mayweather's Decision.\n\nAs soon as the deadline for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted of a series of conversations with HBO Sports President [[Ross Greenburg]]. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions: <blockquote>I had a couple of conversations with Ross [Greenburg] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing. He got back to me in a couple of weeks and told me that he had had discussions with [[Al Haymon]], representing Floyd Mayweather, and that everything looked good and we were nearing a resolution...The subsequent conversations with Ross detailed to me conversations he had with Al Haymon. Nowhere was the name Richard Schaefer or Golden Boy mentioned, although I read, as you all did, Oscar's statement that a deal was close, so I assumed from that Haymon was keeping Schaefer and Golden Boy abreast of the situation.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Floyd Mayweather Jr 2011.jpg|thumb|Mayweather in 2011]]\nDuring a Q & A session following his opening statement, Arum further explained, \"We have never talked to anybody on the Mayweather side and all conversations on our part were through Ross Greenburg and he reported on all conversations on the Mayweather side from Al Haymon.\"\n\nOn July 19, 2010, Ellerbe denied that negotiations ever took place and nothing was ever agreed on. Ellerbe stated: <blockquote>Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself speak to each other on a regular basis and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor was there ever a deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is not telling the truth, but history tells us who is lying.</blockquote> Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place.\n\nWhen asked via e-mail for his response to Ellerbe's denial that negotiations ever took place, Greenburg would respond to ESPN's Dan Rafael with the following reply: \"As always we have no comment.\"\n\nRegarding comments he made suggesting that contracts for the mega-fight were close to being finalized, De La Hoya told ''BoxingScene.com'' on July 26, 2010: <blockquote>I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.</blockquote>\n\nAlso on July 26, Greenburg released a statement saying that he had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, 2010. \"I had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, carefully trying to put the fight together. Hopefully, someday this fight will happen. Sports fans deserve it,\" Greenburg revealed in a prepared statement sent out to select members of the media.\n\nSchaefer again supported Ellerbe's denial of negotiations, and challenged both Greenburg and Arum to take lie detector tests. \"I think it's unfortunate that Ross made that statement. I fully stand behind the statement I made. I have not negotiated with Ross and I am not aware of any negotiations that have taken place,\" Schaefer told ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fighthype.com/pages/mayweather-pacquiao-negotiations-timeline-2.html |title=Source:Mayweather-Pacquiao Negotiations Timeline Part 2 |publisher=Fighthype.com |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 8, 2011, ESPN reported that Pacquiao was willing to agree to random drug testing\u2014but not by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). \"We have agreed in the Pacquiao camp to unlimited random testing done by a responsible, neutral organization,\" Arum told Yahoo. <blockquote>We don't believe USADA is a neutral organization. I don't think anybody's test is as vigorous as the test administered by the Olympic Organization. And we can arrange for the Olympic Organization to handle the test under the supervision of the Athletic commission respective of the state where the fight is going to be held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/sport/story/100115.html |title=Pacquiao 'agrees to Mayweather's demands' |publisher=ESPN|date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the following day, Pacquiao's top adviser, Michael Koncz, stated that Pacquiao had never agreed to testing until fight day. \"Will we give blood five days, seven days before the fight? You know, that's something I have to talk to Manny about, but we have nothing to hide,\" Koncz said.\n\nESPN reported on January 20, 2012, that Mayweather called Pacquiao on the telephone and spoke directly with him in the Philippines. \"He ask about a 50/50 split and I told him no that can't happen, but what can happen is you can make more money fighting me then [sic] you have made in your career,\" Mayweather said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7480500/floyd-mayweather-jr-places-telephone-call-manny-pacquiao |title=Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao talk |publisher=ESPN|date=January 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> Mayweather offered to pay him a flat fee of $40 million for a proposed fight but would not allow him to share in the revenue.

No problem.\"\n\nOn December 20, 2013, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Mayweather said Pacquiao's association with promoter Bob Arum is the reason why the bout will not happen. \"We all know the Pacquiao fight, at this particular time, will never happen, and the reason why the fight won't happen is because I will never do business with Bob Arum again in life, and Pacquiao is Bob Arum's fighter,\" Mayweather said.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/manny-pacquiao/10529965/Floyd-Mayweather-says-fight-with-Manny-Pacquiao-will-never-happen.html |title=Floyd Mayweather says fight with Manny Pacquiao will 'never happen' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Return to the ring===\n\n====Mayweather vs. Ortiz====\n{{Main|Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Victor Ortiz}}\n[[File:Floyd Mayweather, Jr. June 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Mayweather photographed at the Mayweather\u2013Ortiz press conference on June 28, 2011|alt=Mayweather smiling and flashing \"V\" for victory with his right hand]]\nOn June 7, 2011, Mayweather announced via [[Twitter]] that he was set to fight WBC welterweight champion and ''The Ring'' #2-ranked welterweight [[Victor Ortiz]] on September 17.

From round one, Mayweather used his speed, skills and accurate right hand to tag Ortiz repeatedly. Although Mayweather seemed in control through the first three rounds, judges' scores 30\u201327, 30\u201327, and 29\u201328 for Mayweather, in the fourth round Ortiz had some success, landing a few shots and stinging Mayweather before bulling him into the corner. He then rammed Mayweather in the face with an intentional [[headbutt]], opening a [[Wound|cut]] on the inside and outside of Mayweather's mouth. Referee [[Joe Cortez]] immediately called time out and docked Ortiz a point for the blatant [[Foul (sports)|foul]]. Ortiz, apparently acknowledging his wrongdoing, hugged Mayweather in the corner and even appeared to kiss him.\n\nCortez motioned the fighters back together to resume the fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was not looking at the fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/6991483/floyd-mayweather-won-fight-victor-ortiz-fair-square |title=Mayweather won fair and square |publisher=ESPN |date=September 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s Legal Sucker Punch|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/floyd-mayweather-jrs-legal-sucker-punch/245261/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Gareth|title=Floyd Mayweather accused of blindsiding Victor Ortiz with controversial 'sucker punch' in 4th round KO|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/sport/garethadavies/100019662/floyd-mayweather-accused-of-blindsiding-victor-ortiz-with-controversial-sucker-punch-in-4th-round-ko/|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=December 22, 2011|location=London|date=September 18, 2011}}</ref> After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was \"blindsided\" by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that \"In the ring, you have to protect yourself at all times\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/6983926/floyd-mayweather-scores-controversial-ko-victor-ortiz |title=Mayweather scores controversial KO |publisher=ESPN  |date=September 18, 2011 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMayweather vs. Ortiz was purchased by 1.25 million homes with a value of $78,440,000 in pay-per-view revenue.

Beginning in rounds three and four Cotto cut the ring off from Mayweather, forcing the latter to fight from the ropes. However, Mayweather seemed to outfight Cotto from the ropes with his combinations and by rolling with most of Cotto's punches. Cotto had more success in the middle rounds, landing his jab and body shots on Mayweather and effectively trapping him on the ropes. The later rounds were controlled by Mayweather, who boxed more in the center of the ring late in the fight. In the 12th round Mayweather's uppercut stunned and hurt Cotto, but Cotto was able to fight until the end. The judges scored the fight a unanimous decision for Mayweather by scores of 118\u2013110, 117\u2013111, and 117\u2013111.

In the opening round, Mayweather, as per previous fights, started slow to work out McGregor's tactics. In his post-fight interview, he revealed it was part of the game plan to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges scorecards, the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. McGregor was warned a few times through the fight for hitting behind the head, but no points were deducted by referee Robert Byrd. By the fourth round, McGregor began to tire and breathe heavily with his mouth open. Mayweather started to take control and landed with his right hands. For the next few rounds, McGregor came out throwing shots in the opening 30 seconds, but immediately tired, giving Mayweather enough time to carry on landing clean shots and winning the rounds. By round 9, McGregor had almost nothing left. Although he didn't look hurt, he was very fatigued and his face started showing redness. Two of the judges scored the round 10\u20138 for Mayweather.

In addition to the 90-day sentence Mayweather was ordered to complete 100 hours of [[community service]], a 12-month domestic-violence program and to pay a fine of $2,500.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jail time for Mayweather after guilty plea|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-12-21/news/30544534_1_leonard-ellerbe-josie-harris-officer-bill-cassell|newspaper=NY Daily News | location=New York|date=December 21, 2011}}</ref> On June 1, Mayweather began serving his county jail sentence,<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritter|first=Ken|title=Boxer Mayweather due to begin Vegas jail sentence|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/boxer-mayweather-due-begin-vegas-182523834--box.html|accessdate=June 1, 2012|newspaper=Yahoo|date=June 1, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603101815/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/boxer-mayweather-due-begin-vegas-182523834--box.html|archivedate=June 3, 2012}}</ref> and was released on August 3, 2012.\n\n===Sued for defamation===\nIn May 2015, following his bout against Pacquiao, Josie Harris sued Mayweather for $20 million for defamation, claiming that Mayweather lied during an interview with Katie Couric in April. During that interview, he called her a drug abuser while discussing the 2010 domestic-violence incident which ended up with Mayweather going to jail for two months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/after-fight-of-the-century-mayweather-pacquiao-both-sued/ |title=After 'Fight of the Century,' Mayweather, Pacquiao both sued |website=BusinessMirror.com |date=May 6, 2015 |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref> The case remains pending {{as of|2017|September|19|lc=y|df=US}}.<ref>[https://www.lacourt.org/casesummary/ui/ Los Angeles Superior Court online docket search]; Case No. PC056372.</ref>\n\n===Stripped of WBO welterweight title===\nOn Monday, July 6, 2015, Mayweather was stripped of his WBO Welterweight Champion (147 lbs) title for noncompliance with the regulations of the organization. Mayweather won the WBO Welterweight title when he beat Manny Pacquiao in the May 2 bout. However, the WBO rules say that boxers cannot hold world titles in multiple weight classes, and Mayweather already held two junior middleweight championship titles when he won the welterweight title.\n\nMayweather had until 4:30&nbsp;p.m. EST on July 3 to vacate the two other belts and pay a $200,000 sanctioning fee. He did not comply, and the WBO vacated the title on July 6, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brow, Jason |url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/07/07/floyd-mayweather-stripped-title-wbo-welterweight-championship/ |title=Floyd Mayweather Stripped Of Title: WBO Vacates Welterweight Championship |publisher=[[Hollywood Life]] |date=July 7, 2015 |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 2018 SEC settlement ===\nIn November 2018, together with [[DJ Khaled]], Mayweather agreed to a total settlement of $750,000 with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) for failing to disclose payments accepted from issuers of initial coin offerings, including a personal $100,000 promotional payment from beleaguered cryptocurrency firm [[Centra Tech]] Inc.,<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/mayweather-dj-khaled-settle-over-digital-coin-promotions/2018/11/29/2e111ac6-f433-11e8-99c2-cfca6fcf610c_story.html|title=Mayweather, DJ Khaled settle over digital coin promotions|last=Gordon|first=Marcy|date=November 29, 2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=December 1, 2018}}</ref> whose co-founders were indicted for fraud in May 2018.

The time from bud emergence to flowering is six to nine months. Male and female flowers must be open simultaneously for pollination to occur, hence successful pollination and fruit production are quite rare. In addition to habitat loss, these reproductive limitations are contributing factors to why many species are endangered.

The time from bud emergence to flowering is six to nine months. Male and female flowers must be open simultaneously for pollination to occur, hence successful pollination and fruit production are quite rare. In addition to habitat loss, these reproductive limitations are contributing factors to why many species are endangered. ''R. keithii'' is found along the eastern slopes of [[Mount Kinabalu]] in the [[Lohan Valley]] of [[Sabah]]. ''[[Rafflesia tuan-mudae]]'' is endemic to only [[Gunung Gading National Park]] in [[Sarawak]].\n\n===Mindanao (Philippines) species===\nThe Mindanao species is known as ''[[Rafflesia schadenbergiana]]'', after the naturalist [[Alexander Schadenberg]], who first discovered the species at the foothills of [[Mount Apo]] in 1882. With a flower of nearly a meter, it is close to the size of a 7 year old child when seated. On Mindanao, the species has been seen in Davao del Sur, South Cotabato and [[Mount Kitanglad]] in [[Bukidnon]].<ref>Barcelona, J.F., P.B. Pelser, A.M. Tagtag, R.G. Dahonog & A.P. Lilangan. 2008.

Both were discovered at [[Mount Candalaga]] in [[Maragusan, Compostela Valley|Maragusan]], Compostela Valley. The two forms differ in size measurements in which the scientific description of Magnifica came from measurements of flowers in full bloom while that of Mira was from photographs of nearly dead samples. The medium-sized Mira and Magnifica flowers measure about half a meter and they have round or elliptic perigone wart.<ref name=medulid>Madulid, D.A.; Tandang, D.N. & Agoo, E.M.G.
