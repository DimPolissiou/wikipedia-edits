The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

Survey data from March in the USA indicated that, when museums were permitted to reopen, the public \"intent to visit\" metric for cultural activities should be unchanged overall from prior to the pandemic \u2013 but with a shifted preference for the ''kind'' of activity. Data indicated there would be a decreased willingness for attendance of activities in confined spaces, large immobile groups (such as cinemas), or tactile activities; with an increase in interest for activities outdoors or with large spaces (such as zoos and botanic gardens).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.colleendilen.com/2020/03/25/how-is-covid-19-impacting-likelihood-to-attend-different-cultural-entities-data/|title=Post-Pandemic, Which Cultural Entity Types Are People More Likely to Revisit?

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj. Yuvraj was set to miss the whole [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]] as he was undergoing treatment for [[germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]].<ref name=\"withdraw\"/> On 6 February 2012, [[Subrata Roy]], the chairman of Sahara India Pariwar, said that Sourav Ganguly will take a call on reconciliation.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/sourav-ganguly-to-take-call-on-reconciliation-subroto-roy/|title=Sourav Ganguly to take call on reconciliation: Subroto Roy}}</ref> A week later, the BCCI announced that they have allowed Yuvraj Singh's replacement for Pune Warriors India for the 2012 season, though a deadlock still persisted between the two parties on long-term sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/bcci-sahara-feud-unresolved-board-refuses-to-make-any-exceptions/articleshow/11872185.cms |title=BCCI-Sahara feud unresolved, Board refuses to make any exceptions \u2013 Economic Times |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=13 February 2012 |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2012, the BCCI and Sahara ended their differences and announced that Pune Warriors India will play in IPL 5.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pune Warriors India to play in IPL 5|date=4 February 2012|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/pune-warriors-india-to-play-in-ipl-5/}}</ref> The BCCI agreed to give Sahara a total purse of $3.4 million, $1.6 million from the money that they had for the auction and $1.8 million as compensation due to the absence of Yuvraj. It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]]. They also signed Indian players including [[Raiphi Gomez]], [[Ali Murtaza]], [[Ashok Dinda]], [[Anustup Majumdar]] and [[Mahesh Rawat]].

But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain.

The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

Srinivasan]] towards Sahara and the Pune franchise was the main reason for the withdrawal of Sahara from IPL and Indian cricket and also added that Sahara would never be associated with Indian cricket as long as Srinivasan is at the helm of BCCI affairs.<ref>[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sack-n-srinivasan-or-wont-sponsor-team-india-subrata-roy/1120155 Sack N Srinivasan or won't sponsor Team India: Subrata Roy]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2013, the BCCI officially terminated its agreement with the team, bringing an end to the team's IPL sojourn.<ref name=\"goodbye pwi\"/>\n\n==Home ground==\n\n[[File:DY Patil Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[DY Patil Stadium]], the initial \"home\" ground of Pune Warriors India]]\n[[File:Sahara Stadium Pune 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]] at Gahunje, the home ground of Pune Warriors India from 2012\u20132013]]\nIn their inaugural season in 2011, the team played their home matches at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] at [[Navi Mumbai]], as their designated home venue, the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]], was still under construction. Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar.

The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj.

It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]].

But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs.

Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain.

Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.

Furthermore, there are a number of proposed, but doubtful, references from European sources recorded in the 15th century, and perhaps a pictograph associated with the [[Ancestral Puebloan]] culture found near the [[Pe\u00f1asco Blanco]] site in New Mexico, United States.\n\nThe [[supernova remnant|remnant]] of SN 1054, which consists of debris ejected during the explosion, is known as the [[Crab Nebula]]. It is located in the sky near the star [[Zeta Tauri]] (\u03b6 Tauri). The core of the exploding star formed a [[pulsar]], called the [[Crab Pulsar]] (or PSR B0531+21). The nebula and the pulsar that it contains are some of the most studied astronomical objects outside the [[Solar System]]. It is one of the few [[Milky Way|Galactic]] supernovae where the date of the explosion is well known. The two objects are the most luminous in their respective categories. For these reasons, and because of the important role it has repeatedly played in the modern era, SN 1054 is one of the best known supernovae in the history of [[astronomy]].\n\nThe Crab Nebula is easily observed by amateur astronomers thanks to its brightness, and was also catalogued early on by professional astronomers, long before its true nature was understood and identified. When the French astronomer [[Charles Messier]] watched for the return of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1758, he confused the nebula for the comet, as he was unaware of the former's existence. Motivated by this error, he created his catalogue of non-cometary nebulous objects, the [[Messier Catalogue]], to avoid such mistakes in the future. The nebula is catalogued as the first Messier object, or [[Crab Nebula|M1]].\n\n== Identification of the supernova ==\n{{Further|Crab Nebula#Modern astronomy}}\n\nThe [[Crab Nebula]] was identified as the [[supernova remnant]] of SN 1054 between 1921 and 1942, at first speculatively (1920s), with some plausibility by 1939, and beyond reasonable doubt by [[Jan Oort]] in 1942.\n \nIn 1921, [[Carl Lampland|Carl Otto Lampland]] was the first to announce that he had seen changes in the structure of the Crab Nebula.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lampland|first=C.O.|author-link=Carl Otto Lampland|title=Observed Changes in the Structure of the \"Crab\" Nebula (N.

Their nature, size and distance were subject to debate. Observing changes in such objects allows astronomers to determine whether their spatial extension is \"small\" or \"large\", in the sense that notable fluctuations to an object as vast as our [[Milky Way]] cannot be seen over a small time period, such as a few years, whereas such substantial changes are possible if the size of the object does not exceed a diameter of a few light-years. Lampland's comments were confirmed some weeks later by [[John Charles Duncan]], an astronomer at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. He benefited from photographic material obtained with equipment and emulsions that had not changed since 1909; as a result the comparison with older snapshots was easy and emphasized a general expansion of the cloud. The points were moving away from the centre, and did so faster as they got further from it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=John C.|title=Changes Observed in the Crab Nebula in Taurus|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/7/6/179.full.pdf|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=June 1921|volume=7|issue=6|pages=179\u2013180.1|bibcode=1921PNAS....7..179D|doi=10.1073/pnas.7.6.179|pmid=16586833|pmc=1084821}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1921, [[Knut Lundmark]] compiled the data for the \"guest stars\" mentioned in the Chinese chronicles known in the West.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lundmark|first=Knut|author-link=Knut Lundmark|title=Suspected New Stars Recorded in Old Chronicles and Among Recent Meridian Observations|journal=[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]|date=October 1921|volume=33|issue=195|pages=225\u2013238|bibcode=1921PASP...33..225L|doi=10.1086/123101}}</ref> He based this on older works, having analysed various sources such as the ''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]'', studied for the first time from an astronomical perspective by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in the middle of the 19th century. Lundmark gives a list of 60 ''suspected novae'', then the generic term for a stellar explosion, in fact covering what is now understood as two distinct phenomena, [[nova]]e and supernovae. The ''nova'' of 1054, already mentioned by the Biots in 1843,<ref name=biot>[[\u00c9douard Biot]], \"Catalogue des \u00e9toiles extraordinaires observ\u00e9es en Chine depuis les temps anciens jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019an 1203 de notre \u00e8re\", published in ''Connaissance des temps ou des mouvements c\u00e9lestes, \u00e0 l\u2019usage des astronomes et des navigateurs, pour l\u2019an 1846''. 1843. {{in lang|fr}}</ref> is part of the list. It stipulates the location of this guest star in a note at the bottom of the page as being \"close to NGC 1952\", one of the names for the Crab Nebula, but it does not seem to create an explicit link between them.\n\nIn 1928, [[Edwin Hubble]] was the first to note that the changing aspect of the Crab Nebula, which was growing bigger in size, suggests that it is the remains of a stellar explosion. He realised that the apparent speed of change in its size signifies that the explosion which it comes from occurred only nine centuries ago, which puts the date of the explosion in the period covered by Lundmark's compilation. He also noted that the only possible nova in the region of the Taurus constellation (where the cloud is located) is that of 1054, whose age is estimated to correspond to an explosion dating from the start of the second millennium.\n\nHubble therefore deduced, correctly, that this cloud was the remains of the explosion which was observed by Chinese astronomers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hubble|first=Edwin|author-link=Edwin Hubble|year=1928|title=Novae or Temporary Stars|journal=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets]]|volume=1|issue=14|pages=55\u201358|bibcode=1928ASPL....1...55H}}</ref>\n\nHubble's comment remained relatively unknown as the physical phenomenon of the explosion was not known at the time.

These new accounts, globally and mutually concordant, confirm the initial conclusions by Mayall and Oort in 1939 and the identification of the guest star of 1054 is established beyond all reasonable doubt. \nMost other historical supernovas are not confirmed so conclusively: supernovas of the first millennium ([[SN 185|SN&nbsp;185]], [[SN 386|SN&nbsp;386]] and [[SN 393|SN&nbsp;393]]) are established on the basis of a single document each, and so they cannot be confirmed; in relation to the supposed historical supernova which followed the one in 1054, [[SN 1181|SN&nbsp;1181]], there are legitimate doubts concerning the proposed remnant ([[3C 58|3C58]]) and an object of less than 1000 years of age. Other historical supernovae of which there are written accounts which precede the invention of the [[telescope]] ([[SN 1006|SN&nbsp;1006]], [[SN 1572|SN&nbsp;1572]] and [[SN 1604|SN&nbsp;1604]]) are however established with certitude.

The highlighted passages refer to the supernova.]] \nSN 1054 is one of eight [[supernovae]] in the [[Milky Way]] that can be identified because written testimony describing the explosion has survived. In the nineteenth century, astronomers began to take an interest in the historic records. They compiled and examined the records as part of their research on recent [[nova]]e, comets, and later, the supernovae.\n\nThe first people to attempt a systematic compilation of records from China were the father and son Biot. In 1843, the [[sinologist]] [[\u00c9douard Biot]] translated for his father, the astronomer [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], passages from the astronomical treatise of the 348-volume Chinese encyclopaedia, the ''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]''.\n\nAlmost 80 years later, in 1921, [[Knut Lundmark]] undertook a similar effort based on a greater number of sources. In 1942, [[Jan Oort]], convinced that the Crab Nebula was the \"guest star\" of 1054 described by the Chinese, asked sinologist [[J.J.L. Duyvendak]] to help him compile new evidence on the observation of the event.\n\n=== Chinese astronomy ===\n[[File:SN 1054 4th Jul 1054 043000 UTC+0800 Kaifeng.png|thumb|Simulated image of supernova SN 1054 at the position of modern Crab Nebula, as presumably would have been observed from capital of [[Song Dynasty]] at Kaifeng, China during the morning of {{circa|4 July}} 1054.]]\nStar-like objects that appeared temporarily in the sky were generically called \"[[Guest star (astronomy)|guest stars]]\" (''k\u00e8 x\u012bng'' \u5ba2\u661f) by Chinese astronomers. The guest star of 1054 occurred during the reign of the [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]] of the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279). The relevant year is recorded in Chinese documents as \"the first year of the Zhihe era\". ''Zhihe'' was an [[Chinese era name|era name]] used during the reign of Emperor Renzong, and corresponds to the years 1054\u20131056 C.E., so the first year of the Zhihe era corresponds to the year 1054 C.E.\n\nSome of the Chinese accounts are well preserved and detailed. The oldest and most detailed accounts are from ''[[Song Huiyao]]'' and ''[[History of Song|Song Shi]]'', historiographical works of which the extant text was redacted perhaps within a few decades of the event. There are also some later records, redacted in the 13th century, which are not necessarily independent of the older ones.\nThree accounts are apparently related because they describe the angular distance from the guest star to Zeta Tauri as \"perhaps several inches away\", but they are in apparent disagreement about the date of appearance of the star. The older two mention the day ''jichou'' \u5df1\u4e11, but the third, the Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, the day ''yichou'' \u4e59\u4e11. These terms refer to the Chinese [[sexagenary cycle]], corresponding to numbers 26 and 2 of the cycle, which corresponds, in the context where they are cited, respectively, to 4 July and 10 June.\nAs the redaction of the third source is of considerably later date (1280) and the two characters are similar, this is easily explained as a transcription error, the historical date being ''jichou'' \u5df1\u4e11, 4 July.\n\nThe description of the guest star's location as \"to the south-east of Tianguan, perhaps several inches away\" has perplexed modern astronomers, because the Crab Nebula is not situated in the south-east, but to the north-west of Zeta Tauri.\n\nThe duration of visibility is explicitly mentioned in chapter 12 of ''Song Shi'', and slightly less accurately, in the ''Song Huiyao''. The last sighting was on 6 April 1056, after a total period of visibility of 642 days. \nThis duration is supported by the ''Song Shi''. According to the ''Song Huiyao'' the visibility of the guest star was for only 23 days, but this is after mentioning visibility during daylight. This period of 23 days applies in all likelihood solely to visibility during the day.\n\n==== Sources ====\nThe ''Song Huiyao'' (literally \"Collected important documents of the Song dynasty\") covers the period 960\u20131220. ''Huiyao'' is a traditional form of history books in China which aimed mainly to preserve [[primary source]]s, and as such are important sources supplementing the official ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]''. The Song dynasty had a specific government department dedicated to compiling the ''Huiyao'', and some 2,200 volumes were published in ten batches during the Song dynasty. However, most of these documents were lost by the time of the [[Qing Dynasty]] except for the synopsis and a relatively small portion preserved as part of the imperial ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]''. In 1809, the portion preserved in the ''Yongle Encyclopedia'' was extracted and re-published as the ''Song Huiyao Jigao'' (the \"draft extract of the ''Song Huiyao''\"). Subsequent scholars have worked on the project further and the current edition dates from 1936.\n\nThis document recounts the observation of the guest star, focusing on the astrological aspect but also giving important information on the visibility of the star, by day and by night.\n{{quote| Zhihe era, first year, seventh lunar month, 22nd day. [...] Yang Weide declared:  \"I humbly observe that a guest star has appeared; above the star there is a feeble yellow glimmer. If one examines the divination regarding the Emperor, the interpretation [of the presence of this guest star] is the following: The fact that the star has not overrun [[Net (Chinese constellation)|Bi]] and that its brightness must represent a person of great value.  I demand that the Office of Historiography is informed of this.\" All officials congratulated the Emperor, who ordered his congratulations be [back] forwarded to the Office of Historiography.  First year of the era of Jiayou, third lunar month, the director of the Astronomical Office said \"The guest star has disappeared, which means the departure of the host [that it represents].\" Previously, during the first year of the Zhihe era, during the fifth lunar month, it had appeared at dawn, in the direction of the east, under the watch of ''[[Tianguan|Ti\u0101ngu\u0101n]]'' (\u5929\u95dc, Zeta Tauri).  It had been seen in daylight, like Venus. It had rays stemming in all directions, and its colour was reddish white. Altogether visible for 23 days.}}\n\nThe ''Song Shi'' is the official annals of the Song dynasty. Chapter 12 mentions the guest star, not its appearance but rather the moment of its disappearance. The corresponding entry dated 6 April 1056 indicates:\n{{quote| Jiayou era, first year, third lunar month, [[xinwei]] day, the director of the Office of Astronomy reported during the fifth lunar month of the first year of the Zhihe era, a guest star had appeared at dawn, in the direction of the east, under the watch of Tianguan. Now it has disappeared.}}\nIn chapter 56 (\"Astronomical treaty\") of the same document, the guest star is again mentioned in a chapter dedicated to this type of phenomenon, this time focusing on its appearance, \n{{quote|Zhihe era of the reign, first year, fifth lunar month, [[jichou]] day.

The book in question, the ''[[Qidan Guo Zhi]]'', was compiled by [[Ye Longli]] in 1247. It includes various astronomical notes, some of which are clearly copied from the ''Song Shi''.

The highest office at the Office of History, [[Liu Yishou]] had said \"These are omens of the death of the King.\" This prediction has been realised.}}\n\nThe account of ''Qidan Guo Zhi'' alluded to the notable astronomical events that preceded the death of King Xingzong. Various historical documents allow us to establish the date of death of the Emperor [[Xingzong]] as 28 August 1055, during the eighth lunar month of the twenty-fourth (and not twenty-third) year of his reign. The dates of the two astronomical events mentioned (the eclipse and the appearance of the guest star) are not specified, but were probably before the obituary (2 or 3 years at most). Two solar eclipses were visible shortly before that date in the Khitan kingdom, on 13 November 1053 and 10 May 1054. Of these, only one occurred around noon, that of 13 November; it seems likely that this is what the document mentions. As for the guest star, only a rough estimate of location is given, corresponding to the moon mansion Mao. This mansion is situated just east of where the star appeared, as mentioned in the other testimonies. Since no other known significant astronomical event occurred in this region of the sky during the two years that preceded the death of Xingzong, it seems likely that the text is actually referring to the star of 1054.\n\nThe ''Wenxian Tongkao'' is the first East Asian source that came to the attention of Western astronomers; it was translated by \u00c9douard Biot in 1843. This source, compiled by [[Ma Duanlin]] in 1280, is relatively brief. The text is very close to that of the ''Song Shi'':\n{{quote| Zhihe era of the reign, first year, fifth lunar month, ''[[sexagenary cycle|ji-chou]]'' day. A [[Guest star (astronomy)|guest star]] has appeared to the south-east of ''Ti\u0101ngu\u0101n'', perhaps several inches away. After a year or more, it gradually disappeared. }}\n\n==== Identity of ''Tianguan''====\n{{Further|Zeta Tauri}}\nThe [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] (or \"constellations\") of Chinese astronomy were catalogued around the 2nd century BC. The asterisms with the brightest stars in the sky were compiled in a work called ''[[Shi Shen#Books|Shi Shi]]'', which also includes ''Tianguan''.\nIdentification of ''Tianguan'' is comparatively easy, as it is indicated that it is located at the foot of the [[Five Chariots]] asterism, the nature of which is left in hardly any doubt by representation on maps of the Chinese sky: it consists of a large pentagon containing the bright stars of the [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]. As ''Tianguan'' is also represented to the north of the [[Three Stars (Chinese constellation)|Three Stars]] asterism, the composition of which is well known, corresponding to the bright stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], its possible localisation is strongly restricted to the immediate proximity of the star [[Zeta Tauri|\u03b6&nbsp;Tauri]], located between \"Five Chariots\" and \"Three Stars\". This star, of medium brightness ([[apparent magnitude]] of 3.3), is the only star of its level of brightness in this area of the sky (there is no other star that is brighter than an apparent magnitude of 4.5 within 7&nbsp;degrees of \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri), and therefore the only one likely to figure among the asterisms of \"Shi Shi\". All of these elements, along with some others, allow \"Tianguan\" to be confirmed beyond reasonable doubt as corresponding to the star \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri.\n\n[[File:Zeta tauri Beta Tauri and M1.png|upright=1.8|thumb|Northeast region of the Taurus constellation, with &zeta; and &beta;&nbsp;Tauri stars and the location of the supernova of 1054 between them (M1).]]\n\n==== Position relative to Tianguan ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThree Chinese documents indicate that the guest star was located \"perhaps a few inches\" South-East of ''Tianguan''. ''Song Shi'' and ''Song Huiyao'' stipulate that it \"was standing guard\" for the asterism, corresponding to the star \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri. The \"South-East\" orientation has a simple astronomical meaning, the celestial sphere having, like the Earth's globe, both north and south [[celestial pole]]s, the \"South-East\" direction thus corresponding to a \"bottom-left\" location in relation to the reference object (in this case, the star \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri) when it appears at the South. However, this \"South-East\" direction has long left modern astronomers{{who|date=April 2013}} perplexed in the context of this event: the logical remnant of the supernova corresponding to the guest star is the [[Crab Nebula]], but it is not situated to the southeast of \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri, rather in the opposite direction, to the northwest.\n\nThe term \"perhaps a few inches\" (''ke shu cun'' in the Latin transliteration) is relatively uncommon in Chinese astronomical documents. The first term, ''ke'', is translated as \"approximately\" or \"perhaps\", the latter being currently preferred. The second term, ''shu'', means \"several\", and more specifically any number between 3 and 9 (limits included). Finally, ''[[cun (unit)|cun]]'' resembles a unit of measurement for angles translated by the term \"inch\". \nIt is part of a group of three angular units, ''zhang'' (also written ''chang''), ''chi'' (\"foot\") and ''cun'' (\"inch\"). Different astronomical documents indicate without much possible discussion that a ''zhang'' corresponds to ten ''chi'', and that one ''chi'' corresponds to ten ''cun''. The angular units are not the ones used to determine stars' coordinates, which are given in terms of ''du'', an angular unit corresponding to the average angular distance travelled by the sun per day, which corresponds to around 360/365.25 degrees, in other words almost one degree. The use of different angular units can be surprising, but it is similar to the current situation in modern astronomy, where the angular unit used to measure angular distances between two points is certainly the same as for [[declination]] (the degree), but is different for [[right ascension]] (which is expressed in angular hours; an angular hour corresponds to exactly 15&nbsp;degrees. In Chinese astronomy, right ascension and declination have the same unit, which is not the one used for other angular distances. The reason for this choice to use different units in the Chinese world is not well known.\n\n===== Meaning of units =====\nHowever, the exact value of these new units (''zhang'', ''chi'' and ''cun'') was never stipulated, but can be deduced by the context in which they are used. For example, the spectacular passing of [[Halley's comet]] in 837 indicates that the tail of the comet measured 8 ''zhang''. Even if it is not possible to know the angular size of the comet at the time it passed, it is certain that 8 ''zhang'' correspond to 180 degrees at the most (maximum visible angle on the celestial sphere), which means that one ''zhang'' can hardly exceed 20 degrees, and therefore one ''cun'' cannot exceed 0.2 degrees. A more rigorous estimation was made from 1972 on the basis of references of minimal separations expressed in ''chi'' or ''cun'' between two stars in the case of various conjunctions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kiang|first=T.|year=1972|title=The past orbit of Halley's Comet|journal=[[Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=76|pages=27\u201366|bibcode=1972MmRAS..76...27K}}</ref>\nThe results suggest that one ''cun'' is between 0.1 and 0.2 degrees and that one ''chi'' is between 0.44 and 2.8 degrees, a range which is compatible with the estimations for one ''cun''. A more solid estimation error is that it is generally accepted that one ''chi'' is in the order of one degree (or one ''du''), and that one ''cun'' is in the order of one tenth of a degree. The expression \"perhaps a few inches\" therefore suggests an angular distance in the order of one degree or less.\n\n===== Problems with description =====\nIf all the available elements strongly suggest that the star of 1054 was a supernova, and that in the area next to where the star was seen, there is a remnant of a supernova which has all of the characteristics expected of an object that is around 1000 years old, a major problem arises: the new star is described as being to the South-East of ''Tianguan'', while the Crab Nebula is to the North-East. This problem has been known since the 1940s and has long been unsolved. In 1972 for example, Ho Peng Yoke and his colleagues suggested that the Crab Nebula was not the product of the explosion of 1054, but that the true remnant was to the South-East, as indicated in several Chinese sources. For this, they envisaged that the angular unit ''cun'' corresponds to a considerable angle of 1 or 2 degrees, meaning that the distance from the remnant to \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri was therefore considerable. Aside from the fact that this theory does not account for the large angular sizes of certain comets, expressed in ''zhang'', it comes up against the fact that there it does not make sense to measure the gap between a guest star and a star located so far away from it, when there are closer asterisms that could be used.\n\nIn their controversial article (see above) Collins and his colleagues make another suggestion:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=George W., II|last2=Claspy|first2=William P.|last3=Martin|first3=John C.|title=A Reinterpretation of Historical References to the Supernova of A.D. 1054|journal=[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]|date=July 1999|volume=111|issue=761|pages=871\u2013880|arxiv=astro-ph/9904285|bibcode=1999PASP..111..871C|doi=10.1086/316401}}</ref> on the morning of 4 July, the star \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri was not bright enough and too low on the horizon to be visible. If the guest star, which was located close to it, was visible, it is only because its brightness was comparable to Venus. However, there was another star, brighter and higher on the horizon, which was possibly visible, for reference: [[Beta Tauri]] (\u03b2 Tauri). This star is located at around 8 degrees north-north-west of \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri. The Crab Nebula is south-south-east of \u03b2&nbsp;Tauri. ''Collins et al.'' suggest therefore that at the time of its discovery, the star was seen to the south-east of \u03b2&nbsp;Tauri, and that as the days passed and visibility improved, astronomers were able to see that it was in fact a lot closer to \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri, but that the direction \"south-east\" used for the first star was kept in error.\n\nThe solution to this problem was suggested (without proof) by A.&nbsp;Breen and D.&nbsp;McCarthy in 1995.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Breen|first=A.|last2=McCarthy|first2=D.|year=1995|title=A Re-evaluation of the Eastern and Western Records of the Supernova of 1054|journal=Vistas in Astronomy|volume=39|issue=3|pages=363\u2013379|bibcode=1995VA.....39..363B|doi=10.1016/0083-6656(95)96619-S}}</ref> and proved very convincingly by D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Green et F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Stephenson (2003) The term \"stand on guard\" obviously signifies a proximity between the two stars, but also means a general orientation: a guest star \"standing on guard\" for a fixed star is systematically located below it. In order to support this theory, Green and Stephenson investigated other entries in ''Song Shi'', which also includes reference to \"standing on guard\". They selected entries relating to conjunctions betweens the stars identified and planets, of which the trajectory can be calculated without difficulty and with great precision on the indicated dates. Of the 18 conjunctions analysed, spreading from 1172 (the [[Jupiter]]\u2013[[Regulus]] conjunction on 5 December) to 1245 (the [[Saturn]]\u2013[[Gamma Virginis]] conjunction on 17 May), the planet was more to the north (in the sense of a lower declination) in 15 cases, and in the three remaining cases, it was never in the south quadrant of the star.\n\nIn addition, Stephenson and Clark (1977) had already highlighted such an inversion of direction in a planetary conjunction: on 13 September 1253, an entry in the astronomical report ''[[Koryo-sa]]'' indicated that [[Mars]] had hidden the star to the south-east of the twenty-eight mansions sign ''[[Ghost (Chinese constellation)]]'' ([[Delta Cancri]]), while in reality, it approached the star north-west of the asterism ([[Eta Cancri]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Historical Supernovae|last=Clark|first=David H.|last2=Stephenson|first2=F.

The brevity contrasts with the more detailed descriptions of \"guest stars\" (supernovas) of 1006 and 1181.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe Meigetsuki places the event in the fourth lunar moon, one month earlier than the Chinese texts.\nWhatever the exact date during this month, there seems to be a contradiction between this period and the observation of the guest star: the star was close to the sun, making daytime and nighttime observation impossible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The visibility in daylight as described by the Chinese texts is thus validated by the Japanese documents, and is consistent with a period of moderate visibility, which implies that the star's period of diurnal visibility was very short.\nIn contrast, the day of the cycle given in the Chinese documents is compatible with the months that they state, reinforcing the idea that the month on the Japanese document is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\nThe study of other medieval supernovas ([[SN 1006]] and [[SN 1181]]) reveals a proximity in the dates of discovery of a guest star in China and Japan, although clearly based on different sources.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}\n\nFujiwara no Teika's interest in the guest star seems to have come accidentally whilst observing a comet in December 1230, which prompted him to search for evidence of past guest stars, among those SN 1054 (as well as [[SN 1006]] and [[SN 1181]], the two other historic supernovas from the early second millennium). The entry relating to SN 1054 can be translated as:{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n{{quote|\n[[Tengi|Tengi era]] of the emperor [[Go-Reizei]], second year, fourth lunar month, after the middle period of ten days.

It has been viewed in the direction of the East and has emerged from the Tianguan star. It was as big as Jupiter.\n}}\nThe source used by Fujiwara no Teika is the records of Yasutoshi Abe (Onmy\u014dd\u014d doctor), but it seems to have been based, for all the astronomical events he has recorded, on documents of Japanese origin. \nThe date he gives is prior to the third part of ten days of the lunar month mentioned, which corresponds to the period of between 30 May and 8 June 1054 of the Julian calendar, which is around one month earlier than Chinese documentation. This difference is usually attributed to an error in the lunar months (fourth place and fifth place). \nThe location of the guest star, clearly straddling the moon mansions Shen and Zuixi, corresponds to what would be expected of a star appearing in the immediate vicinity of Tianguan.\n\n===Ibn Butlan (Iraq)===\nWhile [[SN 1006]], which was significantly brighter than SN 1054, was mentioned by several Arab chroniclers, there exist no Arabic reports relating to the rather faint [[SN 1181]]. \nOnly one Arabic account has been found concerning SN 1054, whose brightness is between those of the last two stars mentioned. This account, discovered in 1978, is that of a Nestorian Christian doctor, [[Ibn Butlan]], transcribed in the [[Uyun al-Anba]], a book on detailed biographies of physicians in the [[Islamic World]] compiled by [[Ibn Abi Usaybi'a]] (1194\u20131270) in the mid-thirteenth century. This is a translation of the passage in question:\n{{quote|\nI copied the following hand written testimony [that of Ibn Butlan]. He stated: \"One of the famous epidemics of our time has occurred when a spectacular star appeared in [the zodiac star] Gemini, of the year 446 [of the Muslim calendar].

Thereafter, in the middle of the summer of 447, the majority of the [[Fostat]] people [Le Caire] and all foreigners died\".

There is an apparent inconsistency in the year of occurrence of the star, first announced as 446, then 445. This problem is solved by reading other entries in the book, which quite explicitly specify that the Nile was low at 446.\nThis year of the Muslim calendar ran from 12 April 1054 to 1 April 1055, which is compatible with the appearance of the star in July 1054, as its location (admittedly rather vague), is in the astrological sign of Gemini (which, due to [[axial precession]], covers the eastern part of the Constellation Taurus). The date of the event in 446 is harder to determine, but the reference to the level of the Nile refers to the period preceding its annual flood, which happens during the summer.\n\n=== Suggested European sightings ===\n\n[[File:Heinrich III. sieht den neuen Stern \u00fcber der Stadt Tivoli (Tyburtina).jpg|thumb|[[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] before [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]] pointing up at a new star.]]\n\nSince 1980, several European documents have been identified as possible observations of the supernova.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Dall'Olmo|first=Umberto|year=1980|title=Latin Terminology Relating to Aurorae Comets Meteors and Novae|journal=[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]|volume=11|pages=10\u201327|bibcode=1980JHA....11...10D|doi=10.1177/002182868001100103}}</ref><ref name=will>[[L.

In fact, it is known that the [[SN 1006|supernova of 1006]] was recorded in a large number of European documents, albeit not in astronomical terms. Among the proposed explanations for the lack of European accounts of SN 1054, its concurrence with the [[East-West Schism]] is prominent.<ref name=Collins-etc>See the references in  ''Collins et al.'' (1999)</ref> \nIn fact, the date of the excommunication of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Michael I Cerularius]] (16 July) corresponds to the star reaching its maximum brightness and being visible in the daytime. \nAmong the six proposed European documents, one does not seem to correspond to the year of the supernova (the chronicle of Jacobus Malvecius). Another (the Cronaca Rampona) has large dating and internal coherence problems. \nThe four others are relatively precisely dated, but contradict the Chinese documents: they date from Spring and not Summer 1054, that is to say before the conjunction between the supernova and the sun. Three of the documents (the chronicle of Jacobus Malvecius, the Cronaca Rampona and the Armenian chronicle) make reference relatively explicitly to conjunctions between the moon and stars, of which one is identified (Jupiter, in the Armenian chronicle).\nThe three other documents are very unclear and have almost unusable astronomical content.\n\nIn 1999, George W. Collins and his colleagues<ref name=\":0\" /> defended the plausibility of European sighting of SN 1054. They argue that the records suggest that European sightings even predate Chinese and Japanese reports by more than two months (April 1054). These authors emphasize the problems associated with the Chinese reports, especially the position of the supernova relative to Zeta Tauri. They also adduce a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] document which they suggest might establish observation of the supernova at the time of the solar eclipse of 10 May 1054 (which would corrobate the \"late\" date of Chinese observation of the event).\nConversely, they interpret the European documents, taken in conjunction, as plausibly establishing that an unusual astronomical phenomenon was visible in Europe in the spring of 1054, i.e. even before the Sun's conjunction with Zeta Tauri.\nThey also surmise that the correct year in the report by Ibn Butlan is AH 445 (23 April 1053 &ndash; 11 April 1054) rather than AH 446 (12 April 1054 &ndash; 1 April 1055).\n\nThe publication by Collins et al. was criticised by Stephenson and Green (2003). These authors insist that the problems with the Chinese and Japanese documents can easily be resolved philologically (as common copyists' mistakes) and need not indicate unreliability of the Chinese observations. Stephenson and Green condemn attempts at uncovering European sightings of the supernova as it were at any cost as suffering from [[confirmation bias]], \"anxious to ensure that this event was recorded by Europeans\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=F.

Henry III, therefore, was dead in 1056, and his reign could not have coincided with that of Stephen IX. It seems more likely that the text was the subject of various alterations, as the date format (for example, the number 1058 is written as ''Ml8'', with a mix of Roman and Arab characters, common in the period when the Cronaca Rampona was written (15th century) but not in the 11th century.<ref name=will/> \nFurthermore, associating the event described with the sighting of a supernova in 1054 would require the supposition that the Cronaca Rampona entry was in the wrong place in relation to the rest of the document, as the different entries are in chronological order and several previous entries are later than 1054 (in order, the previous entries refer to 1046, 1049, 1051, 1055, 1056, written in a mix of Arab and Roman characters, namely Mxl6, Mxl9, Mli, Mlv and Ml6). Additionally, there is a discrepancy with the date of the new moon. The term [[calends]], which refers to the [[Roman calendar]], can be written in the ordinary form of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the phase of the moon can be calculated from it. \nIt is clear that the new moon did not occur on the thirteenth day of the Calends in any month in 1054. All of this is in strong opposition to the precision of the dates of references to [[eclipses]] in medieval European chronicles: a study of 48 partial or total [[solar eclipse]]s from 733 to 1544, reveals that 42 dates out of 48 are correct, and of the six remaining, three are incorrect by one of two days and the three others give the correct day and month, but not the year.<ref>F.

This scenario is corroborated by two contemporary documents which are perfectly dated and describe a conjunction and a planetary concealment by the moon in relatively similar terms. These two documents, unearthed by [[Robert Russell Newton]],<ref name=\":5\" /> are taken from the [[Annales Cavenses]], Latin chronicles from [[la Trinit\u00e0 della Cava]] ([[Province of Salerno]]).

In fact, on the morning of 5 July, the moon was located in the immediate proximity of the supernova, which could reinforce the idea that it was this proximity that had been represented in these paintings. This interpretation cannot be confirmed. The dating of the paintings is extremely imprecise (between the 10th and 12th century), and only one of them shows the crescent moon with the correct orientation in relation to the supernova.

On the wall underneath the petroglyph there is a drawing which could be the core and tail of a comet. Apart from the petroglyph, which could represent the configuration of the moon and supernova on the morning of 5 July 1054, this period corresponds to the apogee of the Anasazi civilisation. It seems possible to propose an interpretation of the other petroglyph, which, if it is more recent than the other one, could possibly correspond to the passing of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1066.

Furthermore, there are a number of proposed, but doubtful, references from European sources recorded in the 15th century, and perhaps a pictograph associated with the [[Ancestral Puebloan]] culture found near the [[Pe\u00f1asco Blanco]] site in New Mexico, United States.\n\nThe [[supernova remnant|remnant]] of SN 1054, which consists of debris ejected during the explosion, is known as the [[Crab Nebula]]. It is located in the sky near the star [[Zeta Tauri]] (\u03b6 Tauri). The core of the exploding star formed a [[pulsar]], called the [[Crab Pulsar]] (or PSR B0531+21). The nebula and the pulsar that it contains are some of the most studied astronomical objects outside the [[Solar System]]. It is one of the few [[Milky Way|Galactic]] supernovae where the date of the explosion is well known. The two objects are the most luminous in their respective categories. For these reasons, and because of the important role it has repeatedly played in the modern era, SN 1054 is one of the best known supernovae in the history of [[astronomy]].\n\nThe Crab Nebula is easily observed by amateur astronomers thanks to its brightness, and was also catalogued early on by professional astronomers, long before its true nature was understood and identified. When the French astronomer [[Charles Messier]] watched for the return of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1758, he confused the nebula for the comet, as he was unaware of the former's existence. Motivated by this error, he created his catalogue of non-cometary nebulous objects, the [[Messier Catalogue]], to avoid such mistakes in the future. The nebula is catalogued as the first Messier object, or [[Crab Nebula|M1]].\n\n== Identification of the supernova ==\n{{Further|Crab Nebula#Modern astronomy}}\n\nThe [[Crab Nebula]] was identified as the [[supernova remnant]] of SN 1054 between 1921 and 1942, at first speculatively (1920s), with some plausibility by 1939, and beyond reasonable doubt by [[Jan Oort]] in 1942.\n \nIn 1921, [[Carl Lampland|Carl Otto Lampland]] was the first to announce that he had seen changes in the structure of the Crab Nebula.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lampland|first=C.O.|author-link=Carl Otto Lampland|title=Observed Changes in the Structure of the \"Crab\" Nebula (N.

Their nature, size and distance were subject to debate. Observing changes in such objects allows astronomers to determine whether their spatial extension is \"small\" or \"large\", in the sense that notable fluctuations to an object as vast as our [[Milky Way]] cannot be seen over a small time period, such as a few years, whereas such substantial changes are possible if the size of the object does not exceed a diameter of a few light-years. Lampland's comments were confirmed some weeks later by [[John Charles Duncan]], an astronomer at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. He benefited from photographic material obtained with equipment and emulsions that had not changed since 1909; as a result the comparison with older snapshots was easy and emphasized a general expansion of the cloud. The points were moving away from the centre, and did so faster as they got further from it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=John C.|title=Changes Observed in the Crab Nebula in Taurus|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/7/6/179.full.pdf|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=June 1921|volume=7|issue=6|pages=179\u2013180.1|bibcode=1921PNAS....7..179D|doi=10.1073/pnas.7.6.179|pmid=16586833|pmc=1084821}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1921, [[Knut Lundmark]] compiled the data for the \"guest stars\" mentioned in the Chinese chronicles known in the West.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lundmark|first=Knut|author-link=Knut Lundmark|title=Suspected New Stars Recorded in Old Chronicles and Among Recent Meridian Observations|journal=[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]|date=October 1921|volume=33|issue=195|pages=225\u2013238|bibcode=1921PASP...33..225L|doi=10.1086/123101}}</ref> He based this on older works, having analysed various sources such as the ''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]'', studied for the first time from an astronomical perspective by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in the middle of the 19th century. Lundmark gives a list of 60 ''suspected novae'', then the generic term for a stellar explosion, in fact covering what is now understood as two distinct phenomena, [[nova]]e and supernovae.

It stipulates the location of this guest star in a note at the bottom of the page as being \"close to NGC 1952\", one of the names for the Crab Nebula, but it does not seem to create an explicit link between them.\n\nIn 1928, [[Edwin Hubble]] was the first to note that the changing aspect of the Crab Nebula, which was growing bigger in size, suggests that it is the remains of a stellar explosion. He realised that the apparent speed of change in its size signifies that the explosion which it comes from occurred only nine centuries ago, which puts the date of the explosion in the period covered by Lundmark's compilation. He also noted that the only possible nova in the region of the Taurus constellation (where the cloud is located) is that of 1054, whose age is estimated to correspond to an explosion dating from the start of the second millennium.\n\nHubble therefore deduced, correctly, that this cloud was the remains of the explosion which was observed by Chinese astronomers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hubble|first=Edwin|author-link=Edwin Hubble|year=1928|title=Novae or Temporary Stars|journal=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets]]|volume=1|issue=14|pages=55\u201358|bibcode=1928ASPL....1...55H}}</ref>\n\nHubble's comment remained relatively unknown as the physical phenomenon of the explosion was not known at the time.

Telescope-era supernovae are of course associated with their remnant, when one is observed, with full certitude, but none is known within the [[Milky Way]].\n\n== Historical records ==\n[[File:800crab.png|260px|thumb|left|The [[Crab Nebula]] is a remnant of an exploded star.

The highlighted passages refer to the supernova.]] \nSN 1054 is one of eight [[supernovae]] in the [[Milky Way]] that can be identified because written testimony describing the explosion has survived. In the nineteenth century, astronomers began to take an interest in the historic records. They compiled and examined the records as part of their research on recent [[nova]]e, comets, and later, the supernovae.\n\nThe first people to attempt a systematic compilation of records from China were the father and son Biot. In 1843, the [[sinologist]] [[\u00c9douard Biot]] translated for his father, the astronomer [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], passages from the astronomical treatise of the 348-volume Chinese encyclopaedia, the ''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]''.\n\nAlmost 80 years later, in 1921, [[Knut Lundmark]] undertook a similar effort based on a greater number of sources. In 1942, [[Jan Oort]], convinced that the Crab Nebula was the \"guest star\" of 1054 described by the Chinese, asked sinologist [[J.J.L. Duyvendak]] to help him compile new evidence on the observation of the event.\n\n=== Chinese astronomy ===\n[[File:SN 1054 4th Jul 1054 043000 UTC+0800 Kaifeng.png|thumb|Simulated image of supernova SN 1054 at the position of modern Crab Nebula, as presumably would have been observed from capital of [[Song Dynasty]] at Kaifeng, China during the morning of {{circa|4 July}} 1054.]]\nStar-like objects that appeared temporarily in the sky were generically called \"[[Guest star (astronomy)|guest stars]]\" (''k\u00e8 x\u012bng'' \u5ba2\u661f) by Chinese astronomers. The guest star of 1054 occurred during the reign of the [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]] of the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279). The relevant year is recorded in Chinese documents as \"the first year of the Zhihe era\". ''Zhihe'' was an [[Chinese era name|era name]] used during the reign of Emperor Renzong, and corresponds to the years 1054\u20131056 C.E., so the first year of the Zhihe era corresponds to the year 1054 C.E.\n\nSome of the Chinese accounts are well preserved and detailed. The oldest and most detailed accounts are from ''[[Song Huiyao]]'' and ''[[History of Song|Song Shi]]'', historiographical works of which the extant text was redacted perhaps within a few decades of the event. There are also some later records, redacted in the 13th century, which are not necessarily independent of the older ones.\nThree accounts are apparently related because they describe the angular distance from the guest star to Zeta Tauri as \"perhaps several inches away\", but they are in apparent disagreement about the date of appearance of the star. The older two mention the day ''jichou'' \u5df1\u4e11, but the third, the Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, the day ''yichou'' \u4e59\u4e11. These terms refer to the Chinese [[sexagenary cycle]], corresponding to numbers 26 and 2 of the cycle, which corresponds, in the context where they are cited, respectively, to 4 July and 10 June.\nAs the redaction of the third source is of considerably later date (1280) and the two characters are similar, this is easily explained as a transcription error, the historical date being ''jichou'' \u5df1\u4e11, 4 July.\n\nThe description of the guest star's location as \"to the south-east of Tianguan, perhaps several inches away\" has perplexed modern astronomers, because the Crab Nebula is not situated in the south-east, but to the north-west of Zeta Tauri.\n\nThe duration of visibility is explicitly mentioned in chapter 12 of ''Song Shi'', and slightly less accurately, in the ''Song Huiyao''. The last sighting was on 6 April 1056, after a total period of visibility of 642 days. \nThis duration is supported by the ''Song Shi''. According to the ''Song Huiyao'' the visibility of the guest star was for only 23 days, but this is after mentioning visibility during daylight. This period of 23 days applies in all likelihood solely to visibility during the day.\n\n==== Sources ====\nThe ''Song Huiyao'' (literally \"Collected important documents of the Song dynasty\") covers the period 960\u20131220. ''Huiyao'' is a traditional form of history books in China which aimed mainly to preserve [[primary source]]s, and as such are important sources supplementing the official ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]''. The Song dynasty had a specific government department dedicated to compiling the ''Huiyao'', and some 2,200 volumes were published in ten batches during the Song dynasty. However, most of these documents were lost by the time of the [[Qing Dynasty]] except for the synopsis and a relatively small portion preserved as part of the imperial ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]''. In 1809, the portion preserved in the ''Yongle Encyclopedia'' was extracted and re-published as the ''Song Huiyao Jigao'' (the \"draft extract of the ''Song Huiyao''\"). Subsequent scholars have worked on the project further and the current edition dates from 1936.\n\nThis document recounts the observation of the guest star, focusing on the astrological aspect but also giving important information on the visibility of the star, by day and by night.\n{{quote| Zhihe era, first year, seventh lunar month, 22nd day. [...] Yang Weide declared:  \"I humbly observe that a guest star has appeared; above the star there is a feeble yellow glimmer. If one examines the divination regarding the Emperor, the interpretation [of the presence of this guest star] is the following: The fact that the star has not overrun [[Net (Chinese constellation)|Bi]] and that its brightness must represent a person of great value.  I demand that the Office of Historiography is informed of this.\" All officials congratulated the Emperor, who ordered his congratulations be [back] forwarded to the Office of Historiography.  First year of the era of Jiayou, third lunar month, the director of the Astronomical Office said \"The guest star has disappeared, which means the departure of the host [that it represents].\" Previously, during the first year of the Zhihe era, during the fifth lunar month, it had appeared at dawn, in the direction of the east, under the watch of ''[[Tianguan|Ti\u0101ngu\u0101n]]'' (\u5929\u95dc, Zeta Tauri).  It had been seen in daylight, like Venus. It had rays stemming in all directions, and its colour was reddish white. Altogether visible for 23 days.}}\n\nThe ''Song Shi'' is the official annals of the Song dynasty. Chapter 12 mentions the guest star, not its appearance but rather the moment of its disappearance. The corresponding entry dated 6 April 1056 indicates:\n{{quote| Jiayou era, first year, third lunar month, [[xinwei]] day, the director of the Office of Astronomy reported during the fifth lunar month of the first year of the Zhihe era, a guest star had appeared at dawn, in the direction of the east, under the watch of Tianguan. Now it has disappeared.}}\nIn chapter 56 (\"Astronomical treaty\") of the same document, the guest star is again mentioned in a chapter dedicated to this type of phenomenon, this time focusing on its appearance, \n{{quote|Zhihe era of the reign, first year, fifth lunar month, [[jichou]] day. A guest star has appeared to the south-east of Tianguan, perhaps several inches away. After a year or more, it gradually disappeared.}}\n\nThe ''[[Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian]]'' (\"Long compilation of the continuation of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]''\"), a book covering the period of 960\u20131126 and written 40 years or so later by [[Li Tao (historian)|Li Tao]] (1114\u20131183), contains the oldest Chinese testimonies relating to the observation of the star. It was rediscovered in 1970 by the specialist in Chinese civilisations [[Ho Peng Yoke]] and collaborators.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\nIt is relatively imprecise in the case of the explosion of SN 1054. A loose translation of what was stated:\n{{quote|First year of the Zhihe era, fifth lunar month, ''[[sexagenary cycle|ji-chou]]'' day. A guest star has appeared to the south-east of ''Tianguan'', perhaps several inches away [of this star]. (The star disappeared in the third lunar month of the first year of the Jiayou era.)}}\n\nThere is an account of the star from the [[Liao Dynasty]], which ruled in the area around [[northeast China]] from 907\u20131125. The book in question, the ''[[Qidan Guo Zhi]]'', was compiled by [[Ye Longli]] in 1247. It includes various astronomical notes, some of which are clearly copied from the ''Song Shi''. This entry referring to the star of 1054 seems unique:{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n{{quote|Chongxi era of the reign of [King [[Xingzong]]], twenty-third year eighth lunar moon, the ruler of the realm is dead. It happened before a solar eclipse at noon, and a guest star appeared. The highest office at the Office of History, [[Liu Yishou]] had said \"These are omens of the death of the King.\" This prediction has been realised.}}\n\nThe account of ''Qidan Guo Zhi'' alluded to the notable astronomical events that preceded the death of King Xingzong. Various historical documents allow us to establish the date of death of the Emperor [[Xingzong]] as 28 August 1055, during the eighth lunar month of the twenty-fourth (and not twenty-third) year of his reign. The dates of the two astronomical events mentioned (the eclipse and the appearance of the guest star) are not specified, but were probably before the obituary (2 or 3 years at most). Two solar eclipses were visible shortly before that date in the Khitan kingdom, on 13 November 1053 and 10 May 1054. Of these, only one occurred around noon, that of 13 November; it seems likely that this is what the document mentions. As for the guest star, only a rough estimate of location is given, corresponding to the moon mansion Mao. This mansion is situated just east of where the star appeared, as mentioned in the other testimonies. Since no other known significant astronomical event occurred in this region of the sky during the two years that preceded the death of Xingzong, it seems likely that the text is actually referring to the star of 1054.\n\nThe ''Wenxian Tongkao'' is the first East Asian source that came to the attention of Western astronomers; it was translated by \u00c9douard Biot in 1843. This source, compiled by [[Ma Duanlin]] in 1280, is relatively brief. The text is very close to that of the ''Song Shi'':\n{{quote| Zhihe era of the reign, first year, fifth lunar month, ''[[sexagenary cycle|ji-chou]]'' day. A [[Guest star (astronomy)|guest star]] has appeared to the south-east of ''Ti\u0101ngu\u0101n'', perhaps several inches away. After a year or more, it gradually disappeared. }}\n\n==== Identity of ''Tianguan''====\n{{Further|Zeta Tauri}}\nThe [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] (or \"constellations\") of Chinese astronomy were catalogued around the 2nd century BC. The asterisms with the brightest stars in the sky were compiled in a work called ''[[Shi Shen#Books|Shi Shi]]'', which also includes ''Tianguan''.\nIdentification of ''Tianguan'' is comparatively easy, as it is indicated that it is located at the foot of the [[Five Chariots]] asterism, the nature of which is left in hardly any doubt by representation on maps of the Chinese sky: it consists of a large pentagon containing the bright stars of the [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]. As ''Tianguan'' is also represented to the north of the [[Three Stars (Chinese constellation)|Three Stars]] asterism, the composition of which is well known, corresponding to the bright stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], its possible localisation is strongly restricted to the immediate proximity of the star [[Zeta Tauri|\u03b6&nbsp;Tauri]], located between \"Five Chariots\" and \"Three Stars\". This star, of medium brightness ([[apparent magnitude]] of 3.3), is the only star of its level of brightness in this area of the sky (there is no other star that is brighter than an apparent magnitude of 4.5 within 7&nbsp;degrees of \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri), and therefore the only one likely to figure among the asterisms of \"Shi Shi\". All of these elements, along with some others, allow \"Tianguan\" to be confirmed beyond reasonable doubt as corresponding to the star \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri.\n\n[[File:Zeta tauri Beta Tauri and M1.png|upright=1.8|thumb|Northeast region of the Taurus constellation, with &zeta; and &beta;&nbsp;Tauri stars and the location of the supernova of 1054 between them (M1).]]\n\n==== Position relative to Tianguan ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThree Chinese documents indicate that the guest star was located \"perhaps a few inches\" South-East of ''Tianguan''. ''Song Shi'' and ''Song Huiyao'' stipulate that it \"was standing guard\" for the asterism, corresponding to the star \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri. The \"South-East\" orientation has a simple astronomical meaning, the celestial sphere having, like the Earth's globe, both north and south [[celestial pole]]s, the \"South-East\" direction thus corresponding to a \"bottom-left\" location in relation to the reference object (in this case, the star \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri) when it appears at the South. However, this \"South-East\" direction has long left modern astronomers{{who|date=April 2013}} perplexed in the context of this event: the logical remnant of the supernova corresponding to the guest star is the [[Crab Nebula]], but it is not situated to the southeast of \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri, rather in the opposite direction, to the northwest.\n\nThe term \"perhaps a few inches\" (''ke shu cun'' in the Latin transliteration) is relatively uncommon in Chinese astronomical documents. The first term, ''ke'', is translated as \"approximately\" or \"perhaps\", the latter being currently preferred. The second term, ''shu'', means \"several\", and more specifically any number between 3 and 9 (limits included). Finally, ''[[cun (unit)|cun]]'' resembles a unit of measurement for angles translated by the term \"inch\". \nIt is part of a group of three angular units, ''zhang'' (also written ''chang''), ''chi'' (\"foot\") and ''cun'' (\"inch\"). Different astronomical documents indicate without much possible discussion that a ''zhang'' corresponds to ten ''chi'', and that one ''chi'' corresponds to ten ''cun''. The angular units are not the ones used to determine stars' coordinates, which are given in terms of ''du'', an angular unit corresponding to the average angular distance travelled by the sun per day, which corresponds to around 360/365.25 degrees, in other words almost one degree. The use of different angular units can be surprising, but it is similar to the current situation in modern astronomy, where the angular unit used to measure angular distances between two points is certainly the same as for [[declination]] (the degree), but is different for [[right ascension]] (which is expressed in angular hours; an angular hour corresponds to exactly 15&nbsp;degrees. In Chinese astronomy, right ascension and declination have the same unit, which is not the one used for other angular distances. The reason for this choice to use different units in the Chinese world is not well known.\n\n===== Meaning of units =====\nHowever, the exact value of these new units (''zhang'', ''chi'' and ''cun'') was never stipulated, but can be deduced by the context in which they are used. For example, the spectacular passing of [[Halley's comet]] in 837 indicates that the tail of the comet measured 8 ''zhang''. Even if it is not possible to know the angular size of the comet at the time it passed, it is certain that 8 ''zhang'' correspond to 180 degrees at the most (maximum visible angle on the celestial sphere), which means that one ''zhang'' can hardly exceed 20 degrees, and therefore one ''cun'' cannot exceed 0.2 degrees. A more rigorous estimation was made from 1972 on the basis of references of minimal separations expressed in ''chi'' or ''cun'' between two stars in the case of various conjunctions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kiang|first=T.|year=1972|title=The past orbit of Halley's Comet|journal=[[Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=76|pages=27\u201366|bibcode=1972MmRAS..76...27K}}</ref>\nThe results suggest that one ''cun'' is between 0.1 and 0.2 degrees and that one ''chi'' is between 0.44 and 2.8 degrees, a range which is compatible with the estimations for one ''cun''. A more solid estimation error is that it is generally accepted that one ''chi'' is in the order of one degree (or one ''du''), and that one ''cun'' is in the order of one tenth of a degree. The expression \"perhaps a few inches\" therefore suggests an angular distance in the order of one degree or less.\n\n===== Problems with description =====\nIf all the available elements strongly suggest that the star of 1054 was a supernova, and that in the area next to where the star was seen, there is a remnant of a supernova which has all of the characteristics expected of an object that is around 1000 years old, a major problem arises: the new star is described as being to the South-East of ''Tianguan'', while the Crab Nebula is to the North-East. This problem has been known since the 1940s and has long been unsolved. In 1972 for example, Ho Peng Yoke and his colleagues suggested that the Crab Nebula was not the product of the explosion of 1054, but that the true remnant was to the South-East, as indicated in several Chinese sources. For this, they envisaged that the angular unit ''cun'' corresponds to a considerable angle of 1 or 2 degrees, meaning that the distance from the remnant to \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri was therefore considerable. Aside from the fact that this theory does not account for the large angular sizes of certain comets, expressed in ''zhang'', it comes up against the fact that there it does not make sense to measure the gap between a guest star and a star located so far away from it, when there are closer asterisms that could be used.\n\nIn their controversial article (see above) Collins and his colleagues make another suggestion:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=George W., II|last2=Claspy|first2=William P.|last3=Martin|first3=John C.|title=A Reinterpretation of Historical References to the Supernova of A.D. 1054|journal=[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]|date=July 1999|volume=111|issue=761|pages=871\u2013880|arxiv=astro-ph/9904285|bibcode=1999PASP..111..871C|doi=10.1086/316401}}</ref> on the morning of 4 July, the star \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri was not bright enough and too low on the horizon to be visible. If the guest star, which was located close to it, was visible, it is only because its brightness was comparable to Venus. However, there was another star, brighter and higher on the horizon, which was possibly visible, for reference: [[Beta Tauri]] (\u03b2 Tauri). This star is located at around 8 degrees north-north-west of \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri. The Crab Nebula is south-south-east of \u03b2&nbsp;Tauri. ''Collins et al.'' suggest therefore that at the time of its discovery, the star was seen to the south-east of \u03b2&nbsp;Tauri, and that as the days passed and visibility improved, astronomers were able to see that it was in fact a lot closer to \u03b6&nbsp;Tauri, but that the direction \"south-east\" used for the first star was kept in error.\n\nThe solution to this problem was suggested (without proof) by A.&nbsp;Breen and D.&nbsp;McCarthy in 1995.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Breen|first=A.|last2=McCarthy|first2=D.|year=1995|title=A Re-evaluation of the Eastern and Western Records of the Supernova of 1054|journal=Vistas in Astronomy|volume=39|issue=3|pages=363\u2013379|bibcode=1995VA.....39..363B|doi=10.1016/0083-6656(95)96619-S}}</ref> and proved very convincingly by D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Green et F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Stephenson (2003) The term \"stand on guard\" obviously signifies a proximity between the two stars, but also means a general orientation: a guest star \"standing on guard\" for a fixed star is systematically located below it. In order to support this theory, Green and Stephenson investigated other entries in ''Song Shi'', which also includes reference to \"standing on guard\". They selected entries relating to conjunctions betweens the stars identified and planets, of which the trajectory can be calculated without difficulty and with great precision on the indicated dates. Of the 18 conjunctions analysed, spreading from 1172 (the [[Jupiter]]\u2013[[Regulus]] conjunction on 5 December) to 1245 (the [[Saturn]]\u2013[[Gamma Virginis]] conjunction on 17 May), the planet was more to the north (in the sense of a lower declination) in 15 cases, and in the three remaining cases, it was never in the south quadrant of the star.\n\nIn addition, Stephenson and Clark (1977) had already highlighted such an inversion of direction in a planetary conjunction: on 13 September 1253, an entry in the astronomical report ''[[Koryo-sa]]'' indicated that [[Mars]] had hidden the star to the south-east of the twenty-eight mansions sign ''[[Ghost (Chinese constellation)]]'' ([[Delta Cancri]]), while in reality, it approached the star north-west of the asterism ([[Eta Cancri]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Historical Supernovae|last=Clark|first=David H.|last2=Stephenson|first2=F.

This difference is usually attributed to an error in the lunar months (fourth place and fifth place). \nThe location of the guest star, clearly straddling the moon mansions Shen and Zuixi, corresponds to what would be expected of a star appearing in the immediate vicinity of Tianguan.\n\n===Ibn Butlan (Iraq)===\nWhile [[SN 1006]], which was significantly brighter than SN 1054, was mentioned by several Arab chroniclers, there exist no Arabic reports relating to the rather faint [[SN 1181]]. \nOnly one Arabic account has been found concerning SN 1054, whose brightness is between those of the last two stars mentioned. This account, discovered in 1978, is that of a Nestorian Christian doctor, [[Ibn Butlan]], transcribed in the [[Uyun al-Anba]], a book on detailed biographies of physicians in the [[Islamic World]] compiled by [[Ibn Abi Usaybi'a]] (1194\u20131270) in the mid-thirteenth century.

There is an apparent inconsistency in the year of occurrence of the star, first announced as 446, then 445. This problem is solved by reading other entries in the book, which quite explicitly specify that the Nile was low at 446.\nThis year of the Muslim calendar ran from 12 April 1054 to 1 April 1055, which is compatible with the appearance of the star in July 1054, as its location (admittedly rather vague), is in the astrological sign of Gemini (which, due to [[axial precession]], covers the eastern part of the Constellation Taurus). The date of the event in 446 is harder to determine, but the reference to the level of the Nile refers to the period preceding its annual flood, which happens during the summer.\n\n=== Suggested European sightings ===\n\n[[File:Heinrich III. sieht den neuen Stern \u00fcber der Stadt Tivoli (Tyburtina).jpg|thumb|[[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] before [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]] pointing up at a new star.]]\n\nSince 1980, several European documents have been identified as possible observations of the supernova.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Dall'Olmo|first=Umberto|year=1980|title=Latin Terminology Relating to Aurorae Comets Meteors and Novae|journal=[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]|volume=11|pages=10\u201327|bibcode=1980JHA....11...10D|doi=10.1177/002182868001100103}}</ref><ref name=will>[[L.

In fact, it is known that the [[SN 1006|supernova of 1006]] was recorded in a large number of European documents, albeit not in astronomical terms. Among the proposed explanations for the lack of European accounts of SN 1054, its concurrence with the [[East-West Schism]] is prominent.<ref name=Collins-etc>See the references in  ''Collins et al.'' (1999)</ref> \nIn fact, the date of the excommunication of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Michael I Cerularius]] (16 July) corresponds to the star reaching its maximum brightness and being visible in the daytime. \nAmong the six proposed European documents, one does not seem to correspond to the year of the supernova (the chronicle of Jacobus Malvecius). Another (the Cronaca Rampona) has large dating and internal coherence problems. \nThe four others are relatively precisely dated, but contradict the Chinese documents: they date from Spring and not Summer 1054, that is to say before the conjunction between the supernova and the sun. Three of the documents (the chronicle of Jacobus Malvecius, the Cronaca Rampona and the Armenian chronicle) make reference relatively explicitly to conjunctions between the moon and stars, of which one is identified (Jupiter, in the Armenian chronicle).\nThe three other documents are very unclear and have almost unusable astronomical content.\n\nIn 1999, George W. Collins and his colleagues<ref name=\":0\" /> defended the plausibility of European sighting of SN 1054. They argue that the records suggest that European sightings even predate Chinese and Japanese reports by more than two months (April 1054). These authors emphasize the problems associated with the Chinese reports, especially the position of the supernova relative to Zeta Tauri. They also adduce a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] document which they suggest might establish observation of the supernova at the time of the solar eclipse of 10 May 1054 (which would corrobate the \"late\" date of Chinese observation of the event).\nConversely, they interpret the European documents, taken in conjunction, as plausibly establishing that an unusual astronomical phenomenon was visible in Europe in the spring of 1054, i.e. even before the Sun's conjunction with Zeta Tauri.\nThey also surmise that the correct year in the report by Ibn Butlan is AH 445 (23 April 1053 &ndash; 11 April 1054) rather than AH 446 (12 April 1054 &ndash; 1 April 1055).\n\nThe publication by Collins et al. was criticised by Stephenson and Green (2003). These authors insist that the problems with the Chinese and Japanese documents can easily be resolved philologically (as common copyists' mistakes) and need not indicate unreliability of the Chinese observations. Stephenson and Green condemn attempts at uncovering European sightings of the supernova as it were at any cost as suffering from [[confirmation bias]], \"anxious to ensure that this event was recorded by Europeans\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=F.

He went to Rome for the first time in the month of May. At this time, famine and death was upon the whole world. He stayed in the province of [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tibur]] for three days in the month of June [...] At that time, a very brightly-shining star (''stella clarissima'') entered into the circle [or the circuit] of the new moon, in the thirteenth calends at the beginning of the night.<ref>''Huius tempore stella clarissima in circuitu prime lune ingressa tercio decimo kalendas in noctis initio'', Martinus Polonus. Codex Saec. XIII. Teplenus, Pragae 1859.</ref>}}\n\nWithout even discussing the last, astronomical part of the passage, skeptics point out at least two discrepancies in the following: [[Pope Stephen IX]] became Pope in 1057, not 1058, and Emperor Henry III who is mentioned, actually [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], was born in 1017, 39 and not 49 years before 1058, his reign having started in 1039 ([[King of the Romans]], then as emperor of the Romans from 1046 after being consecrated by Pope [[Clement II]] during the course of his brief pontificate). Henry III, therefore, was dead in 1056, and his reign could not have coincided with that of Stephen IX. It seems more likely that the text was the subject of various alterations, as the date format (for example, the number 1058 is written as ''Ml8'', with a mix of Roman and Arab characters, common in the period when the Cronaca Rampona was written (15th century) but not in the 11th century.<ref name=will/> \nFurthermore, associating the event described with the sighting of a supernova in 1054 would require the supposition that the Cronaca Rampona entry was in the wrong place in relation to the rest of the document, as the different entries are in chronological order and several previous entries are later than 1054 (in order, the previous entries refer to 1046, 1049, 1051, 1055, 1056, written in a mix of Arab and Roman characters, namely Mxl6, Mxl9, Mli, Mlv and Ml6). Additionally, there is a discrepancy with the date of the new moon. The term [[calends]], which refers to the [[Roman calendar]], can be written in the ordinary form of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the phase of the moon can be calculated from it. \nIt is clear that the new moon did not occur on the thirteenth day of the Calends in any month in 1054. All of this is in strong opposition to the precision of the dates of references to [[eclipses]] in medieval European chronicles: a study of 48 partial or total [[solar eclipse]]s from 733 to 1544, reveals that 42 dates out of 48 are correct, and of the six remaining, three are incorrect by one of two days and the three others give the correct day and month, but not the year.<ref>F.

Richard|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-521-46194-4}}</ref>\n\nFinally, even considering that the stated event corresponds to May or June 1054 nevertheless, and describes a conjunction between the already visible supernova and the moon, another problem arises: during those months, the moon did not pass very close to the location of the supernova.\nTherefore, it is possible that the account describes an approach or a concealment of a planet by the moon, contemporary to the suggested date (1058). This scenario is corroborated by two contemporary documents which are perfectly dated and describe a conjunction and a planetary concealment by the moon in relatively similar terms. These two documents, unearthed by [[Robert Russell Newton]],<ref name=\":5\" /> are taken from the [[Annales Cavenses]], Latin chronicles from [[la Trinit\u00e0 della Cava]] ([[Province of Salerno]]). They mention \n\"a bright star that entered into the circle of the (new) moon\" \nfor both 17 February 1086 (''[Martii incipiente nocte] stella clarissima in circulum lunae primae ingressa est'') and for 6 August 1096 (''stella clarissima venit in circulum lunae''). The first event can be verified as Venus being eclipsed by the moon, the second as the Moon passing Jupiter at a distance of less than one degree after a [[lunar eclipse]] which was also mentioned in the chronicle.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n====Hayton of Corycus====\n\nThe ''Cronaca Rampona'' account is apparently also reflected in the Armenian chronicle of [[Hayton of Corycus]] (written before 1307).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Astapovich|first=I.S.|last2=Tumanyan|first2=B.E.|year=1969|title=Selected records of astronomical phenomena (meteor events) from old Armenian chronicles|journal=Uch.

Thus the mention of the \"Sunday of Saint George's Day\" corresponds to the next day, 24 April) long before the sighting noted by the Chinese.

In fact, on the morning of 5 July, the moon was located in the immediate proximity of the supernova, which could reinforce the idea that it was this proximity that had been represented in these paintings. This interpretation cannot be confirmed. The dating of the paintings is extremely imprecise (between the 10th and 12th century), and only one of them shows the crescent moon with the correct orientation in relation to the supernova.

On the wall underneath the petroglyph there is a drawing which could be the core and tail of a comet. Apart from the petroglyph, which could represent the configuration of the moon and supernova on the morning of 5 July 1054, this period corresponds to the apogee of the Anasazi civilisation. It seems possible to propose an interpretation of the other petroglyph, which, if it is more recent than the other one, could possibly correspond to the passing of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1066. Although plausible, this interpretation is impossible to confirm and does not explain why it was the supernova of 1054 that was represented, rather than the [[SN 1006|supernova of 1006]], which was brighter and also visible to this civilisation.\n\n=== Suggested records in Aboriginal oral tradition ===\n\nThe Aboriginal people of the region around [[Ooldea, South Australia|Ooldea]] have passed in oral tradition a detailed account of their mythology of the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and the [[Pleiades]].<ref>[[Daisy Bates (Australia)]], ''1921b.

[[\u014ctomo no Yakamochi]] took position as a government official in this area in the 8th century. During his five-year stay he wrote many [[waka (poetry)|''waka'' poems]]<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url =  https://www.britannica.com/biography/Otomo-Yakamochi\n  | title = \u014ctomo Yakamochi - Japanese poet - Britannica.com\n  | publisher = Encyclopedia Britannica\n  | accessdate = 2018-04-06}}</ref>. This is the reason for Takaoka being nicknamed [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b|Many\u014d City]]. \n\nOriginally, the Takaoka region was called ''Sekino'', but when [[Maeda Toshinaga]] of [[Kaga Domain]] took control of the city in 1609, he named it after a verse from the religious poem ''Shihen'' which includes the word ''Takaoka''. In addition to this, the fact that [[Takaoka Castle]] was built on a slightly elevated shoreline is thought to be another possible origin for the name Takaoka, since ''Taka'' means \"high\" and \"Oka\" means \"hill or elevated land\".\n\nDespite the loss of its castle due to orders from the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1615, the [[Maeda clan]] pursued policies regulating the relocation of Takaoka citizens and promoting the development of Takaoka as an industrial city. This resulted in the start of Takaoka's role as a city of commerce and industry. Takaoka copperware and lacquerware also took off at this time.\nFollowing the [[Meiji restoration]], with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889, Takaoka was registered as one of Japan's first 30 cities.<ref>Takaoka City Editorial Committee, Takaoka Rekishi to no Deai \uff08\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u306e\u51fa\u4f1a\u3044\uff09, Takaoka City, 1991, p.239</ref> The area around [[Fushiki Port]] was declared an open port for foreign trade by Imperial decree in July 1899.<ref>US Department of State.

Takaoka has the second largest population after [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama City]]. \n\nThe area that is east of Kureha hill (\u5449\u7fbd\u4e18\u9675 Kureha-kyuryo) has been called Goto (\u5449\u6771), which means the east of Kureha and the area that is west of Kureha hill has been called Gosei (\u5449\u897f), which means the west of Kureha. \u00a0\n\nToyama city is a center city of \"Goto,\" meanwhile Takaoka city is a center of this \"Gosei.\"\n\n{{As of|2018|03|10}}, the city had an estimated population of 173,086 in 68,350 households and a population density of 819 persons per km\u00b2.

The surface area of the city comprises 36.96&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of real estate, 61.02&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of agricultural land, 22.69&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of mountains and forests, 80.43&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of public property (parks etc.), 6.10&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of wasteland, and 2.18&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of moorland.<ref>Takaoka City Development and Planning Department, Public Affairs and Statistics Section, \"Takaoka Mini Data 2011\". Takaoka City, 2011</ref>\n\nThe Takaoka region extends 19.2&nbsp;km from north to south, 24.5&nbsp;km from east to west with a perimeter of 125.9&nbsp;km \u2013 which is roughly equal to the length of coastline in Toyama Prefecture (147 m). Takaoka borders four cities in Toyama Prefecture ([[Himi, Toyama|Himi]], [[Oyabe, Toyama|Oyabe]], [[Tonami, Toyama|Tonami]], and [[Imizu, Toyama|Imizu]]) and two towns in Ishikawa Prefecture ([[Tsubata, Ishikawa|Tsubata]] and [[H\u014ddatsushimizu, Ishikawa| H\u014ddatsushimizu]]).\n\nFrom its border with Himi down to the southwest area of the city, a range of mountains stretch for roughly 150 m to 300 m with a particularly high stretch of mountains centering on Mt. Futagami near Himi. Shogawa River and the Oyabegawa River run through Takaoka and tributaries weave their way though the city center. Including small rivers, a total of 10 rivers flow through the city. The Amaharashi coast lies to the north of the region. Just off the coast lies the uninhabited offshore rock of Otokoiwa. Another uninhabited rock, Onnaiwa, lies nearby and the view of this island against the backdrop of the [[Mount Tate|Tateyama]] range of peaks is famous and features in promotional media for the region.<ref>Hot Hot Takaoka, http://www.city.takaoka.toyama.jp</ref> A section of the Imizu plains runs from the central district of the city to the eastern district, and the Tonami plains which stretch from the west to the south are dotted with [[dispersed settlement]]s in certain areas.\n\n===Surrounding municipalities===\n*Toyama Prefecture\n** [[Himi, Toyama| Himi]]\n** [[Tonami, Toyama| Tonami]]\n** [[Oyabe, Toyama | Oyabe]]\n** [[Imizu, Toyama| Imizu]]\n**[[Tsubata, Ishikawa|Tsubata]]\n** [[H\u014ddatsushimizu, Ishikawa| H\u014ddatsushimizu]]\n*Ishikawa Prefecture\n** [[Tsubata, Ishikawa|Tsubata]]\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Takaoka is a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), similar to that of much of the [[Sea of Japan]] coast.

Depending on the year, the city can experience extraordinarily heavy snowfall, like, for example in 2006 when snow 1.4m high and in 2011 1.27m was recorded.

[[\u014ctomo no Yakamochi]] took position as a government official in this area in 8th century. During his five-year stay he wrote many [[waka (poetry)|''waka'' poems]]<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url =  https://www.britannica.com/biography/Otomo-Yakamochi\n  | title = \u014ctomo Yakamochi - Japanese poet - Britannica.com\n  | publisher = Encyclopedia Britannica\n  | accessdate = 2018-04-06}}</ref>. This is the reason for Takaoka being nicknamed [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b|Many\u014d City]]. \n\nOriginally, the Takaoka region was called ''Sekino'', but when [[Maeda Toshinaga]] of [[Kaga Domain]] took control of the city in 1609, he named it after a verse from the religious poem ''Shihen'' which includes the word ''Takaoka''. In addition to this, the fact that [[Takaoka Castle]] was built on a slightly elevated shoreline is thought to be another possible origin for the name Takaoka, since ''Taka'' means \"high\" and \"Oka\" means \"hill or elevated land\".\n\nDespite the loss of its castle due to orders from the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1615, the [[Maeda clan]] pursued policies regulating the relocation of Takaoka citizens and promoting the development of Takaoka as an industrial city. This resulted in the start of Takaoka's role as a city of commerce and industry. Takaoka copperware and lacquerware also took off at this time.\nFollowing the [[Meiji restoration]], with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889, Takaoka was registered as one of Japan's first 30 cities.<ref>Takaoka City Editorial Committee, Takaoka Rekishi to no Deai \uff08\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u306e\u51fa\u4f1a\u3044\uff09, Takaoka City, 1991, p.239</ref> The area around [[Fushiki Port]] was declared an open port for foreign trade by Imperial decree in July 1899.<ref>US Department of State.
