Peggy became a regular character, and Windsor played the role until she was forced to take a long break due to poor health and departed on 23 May 2003. She returned for two episodes broadcast on 16 and 17 September 2004, before rejoining as a regular character on 8 September 2005.

Windsor returned to the show for guest appearances on 20 September 2013, 25 September 2014, 17 February 2015 (as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations; see [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]]) and 15 January 2016.

Peggy's funeral aired on 4 July 2016.\n\nPeggy is fiercely protective of her family and the Mitchell name, and has become famous for her catchphrase \"Get outta my pub!\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article685854.ece|title=Washed out diva |last=Teeman|first=Tim|date=12 July 2006|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News International#Times Newspapers|Times Newspapers Limited]]|accessdate=2 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> used when ejecting people from [[The Queen Victoria]], of which she is the landlady. Her storylines have seen her embark on a series of failed romances, including marriages to colleague [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and then brother-in-law [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She has been central to several plot strands revolving around health issues, launching a hate campaign against the [[HIV positive]] character [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), and going on to make amends with him when she is later diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Though she recovers from her cancer, it later returns and leads to her suicide. ''[[Inside Soap]]'' named Peggy the UK's top soap matriarch in 2009.\n\n==Storylines==\n===Backstory===\nPeggy married Eric Mitchell because she was pregnant with their son [[Phil Mitchell]]([[Steve McFadden]]). By the Eric grew to be a keen boxer, he worked for a gangland boss: [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]). This impacted the marriage as Johnny constantly taunted Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric fell in love with a glamorous woman called Maureen Loftus and planned to elope with her, but he changed his mind at the last minute - unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a [[Post Office]] robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]), who he also intended to run away with, but he changed his mind again, leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother [[Archie Mitchell|Archie]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) because he was there for Peggy when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 \u2013 her only daughter [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Samantha]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]; [[Kim Medcalf]]). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when [[Kevin Masters (EastEnders)|Kevin Masters]] ([[Colin McCormack]]) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, where they began a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him, but Kevin returned promptly after Eric's death in 1985 and Peggy's children took against him.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\n\n===1991===\nPeggy makes her first appearance in Albert Square when her son, Grant, decides to reenlist with the army and returns when her daughter Sam's desire to escape from her family causes her to elope with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), at the age of sixteen. Peggy, along with Kevin (her boyfriend), tries to persuade Sam that getting married at the age of sixteen will ruin her life, but she is unsuccessful. Peggy later accepts Sam and Ricky's relationship and leaves, after giving the couple her blessing.\n\n===1994{{ndash}}2010===\nPeggy is not seen for three years, during which time her relationship with Kevin ends. She returns to [[Walford]] when her sons fall out after Phil's affair with Grant's wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), is revealed. Peggy becomes acting [[landlady]] of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] and blames Sharon for the affair. Peggy tries to force her out of Walford, resulting in Sharon signing over her share of the pub and leaving the [[Mitchell family]] as the sole owners, with Peggy in charge.\n\nPeggy starts dating businessman [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]]), unaware that he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) when she discovers he is [[HIV|HIV positive]] and begins a feud with his mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he will not be able to handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a [[lumpectomy]]. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a [[mastectomy]], but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for [[Rio de Janeiro]] after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently argue over the running of The Queen Vic, ending with Dan insulting Frank's daughter [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), resulting in Frank punching Dan across the face. Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), so she shames them by reading Frank's [[Dear John letter|Dear Jane letter]] to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes [[clinical depression|depressed]] and begins to rely heavily on [[tranquilliser]]s. When Janine taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a [[baseball bat]]. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt, and is furious to discover the new owner is Sharon.\n\nPeggy begins dating [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), who owns a bar in Spain and convinces her to move there with him. They become engaged but break up when it is revealed that Harry is guilty of sexually abusing his niece [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and is therefore the father of Kat's teenage daughter, [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]). When Phil begins dating Sharon again and becomes joint owner of The Queen Vic, Peggy moves back in. She later becomes sole licensee again when Sharon sells her half of the pub back to her. Peggy is briefly reunited with Frank when she travels to Spain to attend his funeral. She discovers he faked his own death to avoid creditors. While she's in Spain, she shockingly finds Sam working as a lap dancer and takes her home. Peggy later decides to move to [[Brazil]] to be with Grant but visits Walford for Sam's wedding to [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]) before returning to Brazil.\n\nWhen Peggy returns to Walford in 2005, she is furious to discover Sam has lost possession of The Queen Vic, and that the new licensee [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) has framed Sam for her husband [[Den Watts]]' ([[Leslie Grantham]]) murder. While trying to exonerate Sam and reclaim ownership of the pub, Peggy ignites a feud with Johnny, who also wishes to buy The Queen Vic. Johnny hires a mobster to assault Peggy, but she is saved by her sons, Phil and Grant. They are able to deal with Johnny, secure Sam's release from prison, and return Peggy to The Queen Vic. Peggy begins a romance with [[Jack Edwards (EastEnders)|Jack Edwards]] ([[Nicky Henson]]), the father-in-law of Peggy's relative [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]). However, when Peggy discovers Billy's newborn daughter, [[Janet Mitchell]] (Grace), has [[Down's syndrome]], she declares that the baby should be put up for [[adoption]], causing friction in her relationship with Jack. Although Peggy comes to accept the baby, Jack breaks up with her and leaves Walford.\n\nPeggy begins a relationship with her brother-in-law, Archie, father of [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]). They get engaged and Archie begins subtly controlling Peggy. They marry, but it ends a few hours later when it is revealed that Archie lied to Ronnie about her infant daughter's death. Peggy has Archie evicted from The Queen Vic, and tries unsuccessfully to coerce Phil into murdering him. Peggy files for divorce and Archie plots revenge on the entire Mitchell family. When Peggy loses the bail surety she has paid on behalf of her daughter Sam (who breaks the conditions of her bail following coercion from Archie), the Mitchells are forced to use The Queen Vic to gain a collateral loan from [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Archie uses Janine to blackmail Ian into selling him the loan, and when the Mitchells are unable to meet the loan repayment, Archie evicts them and assumes ownership of the pub. However, Archie is murdered on Christmas Day 2009 by an unknown assailant (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]). Peggy grieves for Archie, but she and various other members of her family become suspects for his murder. Following a police enquiry, [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]) is posthumously found guilty of the murder, though unbeknown to everyone, the actual murderer is Bradley's wife, [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), after Archie raped her. In his will, Archie leaves The Queen Vic to Roxy, who reinstates Peggy.\n\nAfter being disgusted with the state of the Square and learning that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist [[Harvey Freeman (EastEnders)|Harvey Freeman]] ([[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]]). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter [[Louise Mitchell]] (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother, [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub (see [[Queen Vic Fire Week]]). Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes one last look at The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.\n\n===2013\u20132016===\nIn January 2012, Peggy misses Pat's funeral as she is on a cruise, and in 2013, Phil visits Peggy in Cornwall with Ben's baby daughter, [[Lexi Pearce]] (Dotti-Beau Cotterill). Three months later, Peggy flies into London to visit Phil in hospital, and encourages him to get rid of [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) - an ex-conman who seeks to take over the Mitchell business empire. After, she visits Pat's old house, and leaves a bottle of gin on the doorstep as a way of saying goodbye. In September 2014, Peggy appears in Portugal, telling Ronnie to go back to Walford and stop Phil from marrying Sharon. In February 2015, Peggy returns to the square to confront [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]), after her son [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) cut the brakes on a car and falsely incriminated Phil. She is also in on the secret that Ben's mother and Phil's ex-wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), faked her own death ten years ago and wants to return to Walford. Before returning to Portugal, Peggy visits The Queen Vic and meets its new landlord, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), who tells her to \"get out of my pub\" (which Peggy was known for saying as landlady).\n\nIn January 2016, Phil calls Peggy's older sister, [[Aunt Sal|Sal]] ([[Anna Karen]]), wanting Louise's (now played by [[Tilly Keeper]]) address, and when he goes to her house, Peggy is there, having returned a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of the liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try to make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.\n\nSharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She tells them both she will not kill herself, and after settling old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend, Pat. She decides she wants to be remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, so takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016. Phil is due to give a eulogy to her there, but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.\n\n==Creation==\nPeggy was introduced as a guest character in April 1991, by executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]]. The character was brought in as the mother of the already established Mitchell clan: [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Specifically, she played a key role in a storyline about the elopement of her daughter Sam with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). Peggy was played by actress Jo Warne for a period of three months, but was written out upon the completion of the storyline. Two other actresses had been cast in the part before Warne. The first quit before she could film any scenes, and the second filmed eight episodes, though all of her scenes were scrapped before broadcast.<ref name=RT>{{cite news|author= ''Radio Times'' staff|date= 2\u20138 January 2010|title= 10 For 2010|work= Radio Times|publisher= BBC Magazines|page= 19}}</ref>\n\nThe character did not make another appearance until 7 November 1994, when she was reintroduced by series producer [[Barbara Emile]] as a regular character. The actress was recast, the role being taken over by Barbara Windsor, already well known to viewers as a comic actress, notably appearing in the long-running [[Carry On films|''Carry On'' films]]. Scott Matthewman of ''[[The Stage]]'' commented on the recast in 2006: \"Quite the biggest \u2013 and most inexplicable \u2013 transformation is that of Peggy Mitchell in ''EastEnders''. While Barbara Windsor has dominated the role...first appearing in [1994], the character had appeared briefly [three] years earlier, played by Jo Warne, a lady who physically is as different from our Babs as it's possible to get.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/10/the-changing-face-of-soap-acting/ |title=The changing face of soap acting |work=[[The Stage]] |publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited |first=Scott |last=Matthewman |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611120102/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/10/the-changing-face-of-soap-acting/ |archivedate=11 June 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSteve McFadden and Ross Kemp had attempted to persuade ''EastEnders'' writer [[Tony Jordan]] to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her.<ref name=RT/> Windsor had previously expressed a desire to join the cast of ''EastEnders''. Chat show host [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'' made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement.

Certainly, Miss Windsor has been associated throughout her career with the lighter touch.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/struggling-eastenders-to-carry-on-with-windsor-1446306.html|title=Struggling 'Eastenders' to carry on with Windsor |last=Lawson|first=Mark|date=3 September 1994|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> According to Windsor, 27 million viewers watched her first appearance as Peggy on-screen.<ref name=\"WG\"/> Mark Lawson for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' has stated that five million extra viewers watched her first scenes, reporting that initially: \"The critics said that she lacked the 'brassiness and vulnerability' for soap acting and that, stripped of her bubbly image, 'nothing much of interest was revealed'. Ironically, viewers complained that she was too upmarket.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> Windsor has commented of the impact of her pre-existing celebrity status:\n\n{{cquote|[[Wendy Richard]] [who played [[Pauline Fowler]]] certainly had name value but I suppose it was regarded differently because she was part of the original cast. When I was brought on [to ''EastEnders''] the press made such a big deal. They made it seem like I was brought on to 'save' ''EastEnders'' or something, which was ridiculous...the show decided to move into the \"[[Sharongate]]\" storyline, which gave it an enormous push, creatively and ratings-wise. Peggy was brought on as an extension of the Sharongate story because she was Phil and Grant's mum.

She adds, \"Peggy likes to think she looks much younger [than she is]. She's flash, fast-talking and nobody's fool. She has always done things her own way, and heaven help anyone who crosses her, though her bark's usually worse than her bite.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |date=31 October 1991|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=978-0563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nWhen Windsor took over the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, \"a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely superficial level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/> However, early in 1995, ''EastEnders'' acquired a new executive producer, [[Corinne Hollingworth]], who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was \"not going to be allowed to just sit in some flat polishing her nails\".<ref name=\"WG\"/> Windsor has said: \"It was like a dream. [Hollingworth] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed to be a lot more flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...\".<ref name=\"WG\"/>\n\nWindsor has described Peggy as \"from the old school, the generation which doesn't put up with rubbish from anybody...She can get through practically anything because she's tough, tough, tough.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/> The character has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of ''EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square'', as a matriarch, assuming \"papal infallibility.

It was the first time that the soap had given one of its characters the illness, though the issue was covered much less substantially in 1987 as a means of promoting [[Mammography|breast cancer screening]], when [[Sue Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]]) discovered a lump on her breast, which turned out to be benign.\n\nPeggy's breast cancer storyline was devised at the suggestion of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea \"that had been knocking about for a long time.\"<ref name=\"social\">{{cite book |first= Lesley|last=Henderson|title= Social Issues in Television Fiction|year=2001|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|isbn=978-0-7486-2532-1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8l_TcZfmuDoC&pg=PA80&dq=eastenders+breast+cancer#PPA80,M1|chapter=A Woman's Disease: Breast Cancer|pages=76\u201392|accessdate=31 October 2009}}</ref> In Lesley Henderson's book, ''Social Issues in Television Fiction'', an ''EastEnders'' researcher explains that: \"A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material\", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with.<ref name=\"social\"/> The programme sought expert advice on \"storyline visuals\" from a variety of sources including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals.<ref name=\"social\"/> There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: \"''EastEnders'' is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work. You've got to be careful to make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development.\"<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\nProducers decided to use Peggy in the breast cancer storyline, conforming to a soap opera tradition of reserving strong roles for a firmly established middle-aged matriarch.<ref name=\"social\"/> The audience were familiar with Peggy's history, knew that her first husband had died from cancer, consequently making her fear hospitals, and she had: \"the right mentality for [the story theme], which was about 'a woman who discovers a lump and then refuses to accept that anything's wrong'. An added factor was that in choosing Peggy the programme could avoid appearing too issue driven, and [the] storyline could be used as a device to expand and develop her characterisation.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Additionally, as the causes of breast cancer are not attributable to risky behaviour, the disease was deemed \"more attractive\" in storyline terms. A member of the ''EastEnders'' production team explains:\n\n{{cquote|If you take a character who smokes and they get [[lung cancer]] that would seem too issue-driven. The great thing about a character like Peggy is [her breast cancer was] quite unexpected. At the time there were lots of other issues in her life. She was a character who audiences had only seen pulling pints behind the bar. Suddenly she was in a new environment in a hospital and had a huge medical crisis to go through, so that allowed the character to grow and expand in many ways...There was also fairly major moments [...] with Peggy and [her boyfriend [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]])]. She thought George wouldn't love her any more after she'd had the operation. We were able to use the illness to take them on a new journey.<ref name=\"social\"/>}}\n\nIn the view of the production team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer.<ref name=\"social\"/> In 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised ''EastEnders'' for this.<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\n[[File:Ross Kemp.jpg|thumb|[[Ross Kemp]] plays Peggy's son [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]]. The issue of whether Peggy's children would discover her breast cancer was used to build tension and create suspense in the viewing audience.]]\n\nThe storyline used elements of suspense, created by the use of \"shared secrets\" between Peggy and her daughter-in-law [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy's trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy's lump was benign or malignant and whether she would die, but also in terms of Peggy's relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or if George would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: \"such devises [added] pathos to Peggy's treatment path.

A member of the ''EastEnders'' production team explained: \"We have to think about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases.<ref name=\"social\"/> However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the \"all-clear\" at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction.<ref name=\"social\"/> It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy.<ref name=\"mastectomy\">{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,335926,00.html|title=An everyday story of... cancer|first=Sue|last=Arnold|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=25 June 2000|accessdate=26 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> BBC Production chief executive [[Matthew Bannister]] praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: \"It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us and a lot of other people.\"<ref name=\"wedding\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/308079.stm|title=Wedding knees-up in the Square |publisher=BBC News|date=30 March 1999| accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOncology nurses and consultants were involved in the development of the storyline, which was based on a real life case study.

Frank's history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special [[two-hander]] episode aired in November 1998, [[List of EastEnders two-hander episodes#Pat and Peggy (27 October 1998)|featuring only Pat and Peggy]] for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy's reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat's unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat's own marriage to [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy]] ([[Tony Caunter]]), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife's infidelity.

Pam and I were really proud.\" The ''Sunday Mirror'' described it as: \"one of the most impressive episodes of all time\".<ref name=\"fight\"/> In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact.\n\nPeggy and Frank were married on-screen on 1 April 1999.

She said: \"Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst [executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]], who I adore, is still in charge I want him to be the one to oversee it.

Windsor has since revealed that she was initially opposed to the storyline:\n\n{{cquote|[Peggy] was vicious to [Mark]. She was so na\u00efve about the whole thing. When I got the script and it said some awful things, I couldn't believe it. It's the only time I've questioned the writers and said 'I can't believe it, people aren't like that today'. Then they sent me a survey and proved that people are actually like that. When it came to doing the scenes, I just got hold of Todd [Carty] and said, 'sorry this is Peggy!' I got the most appalling [hate] mail because of it. I had a very dear friend of mine who was dying of AIDS so it was very personal to me. The last scene I did I went straight out and got terribly drunk.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> }}\n\nActress and writer [[Jacquetta May]], who played the character [[Rachel Kominski]] between 1991 and 1993, has discussed the storyline and the role of women in an article about ''EastEnders''. According to May, the scriptwriters were faced with a problem once Peggy, \"a key figure of the community\", was shown to exhibit such \"pig-headed ignorance and appalling prejudice\". In order for Peggy to be redeemed, she had to be seen to be punished, and so the character was given breast-cancer later that year. May comments, \"Peggy, malicious gossip and bigot, herself becomes the victim of a life-threatening illness. At Christmas they run a Christian forgiveness story. Peggy calls on Mark and tells him she now knows what it is like to suffer as he has. She apologises, thus underlining one of the basic tenets of the programme: underneath the skin we are all the same, human and vulnerable, and recognition of this should unite us not divide us. Along the way, a great deal of useful information about these illnesses was broadcast. So, although ''EastEnders'' endlessly repeats its conservative format, and although all issues are there primarily to feed the great hungry story-beast, its positive by-products cannot be denied.\"<ref name=\"kominski\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|archivedate=29 December 2006|title=Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|first=Jacquetta|last=May|authorlink=Jacquetta May|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has received praise for the handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, it was reported that media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as \"more tragic\" or \"more sexy\" in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50.<ref name=\"social\"/> Source organisations working with ''EastEnders'' on the storyline have commented: \"[The team] decided it was going to be [Peggy] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented \"particularly positive messages\" concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline \"didactic\".<ref name=\"social\"/> The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theanswerbank.co.uk/Article1254.html|title=What other medical issues have been raised by soaps?|first=Katharine|last=MacColl|publisher=Answer Bank|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2008, [[Bupa]] doctors criticised UK soaps for presenting unhealthy [[role model]]s to viewing audiences.

Peggy was initially played by [[Jo Warne]] when she first appeared in the episode broadcast on 30 April 1991, featuring in 10 episodes. Peggy was reintroduced in 1994, recast to [[Barbara Windsor]], who made her first appearance in the episode broadcast on 7 November 1994. Peggy became a regular character, and Windsor played the role until she was forced to take a long break due to poor health and departed on 23 May 2003. She returned for two episodes broadcast on 16 and 17 September 2004, before rejoining as a regular character on 8 September 2005. Windsor announced in October 2009 that she would be leaving the show and departed on 10 September 2010. Windsor returned to the show for guest appearances on 20 September 2013, 25 September 2014, 17 February 2015 (as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations; see [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]]) and 15 January 2016. She then appeared in six episodes between 9 and 17 May 2016 and the character was killed-off. Her voice is last heard in the following episode, on 19 May 2016. Peggy's funeral aired on 4 July 2016.\n\nPeggy is fiercely protective of her family and the Mitchell name, and has become famous for her catchphrase \"Get outta my pub!\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article685854.ece|title=Washed out diva |last=Teeman|first=Tim|date=12 July 2006|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News International#Times Newspapers|Times Newspapers Limited]]|accessdate=2 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> used when ejecting people from [[The Queen Victoria]], of which she is the landlady. Her storylines have seen her embark on a series of failed romances, including marriages to colleague [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and then brother-in-law [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She has been central to several plot strands revolving around health issues, launching a hate campaign against the [[HIV positive]] character [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), and going on to make amends with him when she is later diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Though she recovers from her cancer, it later returns and leads to her suicide. ''[[Inside Soap]]'' named Peggy the UK's top soap matriarch in 2009.\n\n==Storylines==\n===Backstory===\nPeggy married Eric Mitchell because she was pregnant with their son [[Phil Mitchell]]([[Steve McFadden]]). By the Eric grew to be a keen boxer, he worked for a gangland boss: [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]). This impacted the marriage as Johnny constantly taunted Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric fell in love with a glamorous woman called Maureen Loftus and planned to elope with her, but he changed his mind at the last minute - unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a [[Post Office]] robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]), who he also intended to run away with, but he changed his mind again, leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother [[Archie Mitchell|Archie]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) because he was there for Peggy when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 \u2013 her only daughter [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Samantha]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]; [[Kim Medcalf]]). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when [[Kevin Masters (EastEnders)|Kevin Masters]] ([[Colin McCormack]]) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, where they began a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him, but Kevin returned promptly after Eric's death in 1985 and Peggy's children took against him.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\n\n===1991===\nPeggy makes her first appearance in Albert Square when her son, Grant, decides to reenlist with the army and returns when her daughter Sam's desire to escape from her family causes her to elope with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), at the age of sixteen. Peggy, along with Kevin (her boyfriend), tries to persuade Sam that getting married at the age of sixteen will ruin her life, but she is unsuccessful. Peggy later accepts Sam and Ricky's relationship and leaves, after giving the couple her blessing.\n\n===1994{{ndash}}2010===\nPeggy is not seen for three years, during which time her relationship with Kevin ends. She returns to [[Walford]] when her sons fall out after Phil's affair with Grant's wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), is revealed. Peggy becomes acting [[landlady]] of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] and blames Sharon for the affair. Peggy tries to force her out of Walford, resulting in Sharon signing over her share of the pub and leaving the [[Mitchell family]] as the sole owners, with Peggy in charge.\n\nPeggy starts dating businessman [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]]), unaware that he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) when she discovers he is [[HIV|HIV positive]] and begins a feud with his mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he will not be able to handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a [[lumpectomy]]. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a [[mastectomy]], but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for [[Rio de Janeiro]] after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently argue over the running of The Queen Vic, ending with Dan insulting Frank's daughter [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), resulting in Frank punching Dan across the face. Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), so she shames them by reading Frank's [[Dear John letter|Dear Jane letter]] to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes [[clinical depression|depressed]] and begins to rely heavily on [[tranquilliser]]s. When Janine taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a [[baseball bat]]. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt, and is furious to discover the new owner is Sharon.\n\nPeggy begins dating [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), who owns a bar in Spain and convinces her to move there with him. They become engaged but break up when it is revealed that Harry is guilty of sexually abusing his niece [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and is therefore the father of Kat's teenage daughter, [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]). When Phil begins dating Sharon again and becomes joint owner of The Queen Vic, Peggy moves back in. She later becomes sole licensee again when Sharon sells her half of the pub back to her. Peggy is briefly reunited with Frank when she travels to Spain to attend his funeral. She discovers he faked his own death to avoid creditors. While she's in Spain, she shockingly finds Sam working as a lap dancer and takes her home. Peggy later decides to move to [[Brazil]] to be with Grant but visits Walford for Sam's wedding to [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]) before returning to Brazil.\n\nWhen Peggy returns to Walford in 2005, she is furious to discover Sam has lost possession of The Queen Vic, and that the new licensee [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) has framed Sam for her husband [[Den Watts]]' ([[Leslie Grantham]]) murder. While trying to exonerate Sam and reclaim ownership of the pub, Peggy ignites a feud with Johnny, who also wishes to buy The Queen Vic. Johnny hires a mobster to assault Peggy, but she is saved by her sons, Phil and Grant. They are able to deal with Johnny, secure Sam's release from prison, and return Peggy to The Queen Vic. Peggy begins a romance with [[Jack Edwards (EastEnders)|Jack Edwards]] ([[Nicky Henson]]), the father-in-law of Peggy's relative [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]). However, when Peggy discovers Billy's newborn daughter, [[Janet Mitchell]] (Grace), has [[Down's syndrome]], she declares that the baby should be put up for [[adoption]], causing friction in her relationship with Jack. Although Peggy comes to accept the baby, Jack breaks up with her and leaves Walford.\n\nPeggy begins a relationship with her brother-in-law, Archie, father of [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]). They get engaged and Archie begins subtly controlling Peggy. They marry, but it ends a few hours later when it is revealed that Archie lied to Ronnie about her infant daughter's death. Peggy has Archie evicted from The Queen Vic, and tries unsuccessfully to coerce Phil into murdering him. Peggy files for divorce and Archie plots revenge on the entire Mitchell family. When Peggy loses the bail surety she has paid on behalf of her daughter Sam (who breaks the conditions of her bail following coercion from Archie), the Mitchells are forced to use The Queen Vic to gain a collateral loan from [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Archie uses Janine to blackmail Ian into selling him the loan, and when the Mitchells are unable to meet the loan repayment, Archie evicts them and assumes ownership of the pub. However, Archie is murdered on Christmas Day 2009 by an unknown assailant (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]). Peggy grieves for Archie, but she and various other members of her family become suspects for his murder. Following a police enquiry, [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]) is posthumously found guilty of the murder, though unbeknown to everyone, the actual murderer is Bradley's wife, [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), after Archie raped her. In his will, Archie leaves The Queen Vic to Roxy, who reinstates Peggy.\n\nAfter being disgusted with the state of the Square and learning that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist [[Harvey Freeman (EastEnders)|Harvey Freeman]] ([[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]]). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter [[Louise Mitchell]] (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother, [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub (see [[Queen Vic Fire Week]]). Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes one last look at The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.\n\n===2013\u20132016===\nIn January 2012, Peggy misses Pat's funeral as she is on a cruise, and in 2013, Phil visits Peggy in Cornwall with Ben's baby daughter, [[Lexi Pearce]] (Dotti-Beau Cotterill). Three months later, Peggy flies into London to visit Phil in hospital, and encourages him to get rid of [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) - an ex-conman who seeks to take over the Mitchell business empire. After, she visits Pat's old house, and leaves a bottle of gin on the doorstep as a way of saying goodbye. In September 2014, Peggy appears in Portugal, telling Ronnie to go back to Walford and stop Phil from marrying Sharon. In February 2015, Peggy returns to the square to confront [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]), after her son [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) cut the brakes on a car and falsely incriminated Phil. She is also in on the secret that Ben's mother and Phil's ex-wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), faked her own death ten years ago and wants to return to Walford. Before returning to Portugal, Peggy visits The Queen Vic and meets its new landlord, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), who tells her to \"get out of my pub\" (which Peggy was known for saying as landlady).\n\nIn January 2016, Phil calls Peggy's older sister, [[Aunt Sal|Sal]] ([[Anna Karen]]), wanting Louise's (now played by [[Tilly Keeper]]) address, and when he goes to her house, Peggy is there, having returned a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of the liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try to make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.\n\nSharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She tells them both she will not kill herself, and after settling old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend, Pat. She decides she wants to be remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, so takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016. Phil is due to give a eulogy to her there, but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.\n\n==Creation==\nPeggy was introduced as a guest character in April 1991, by executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]]. The character was brought in as the mother of the already established Mitchell clan: [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Specifically, she played a key role in a storyline about the elopement of her daughter Sam with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). Peggy was played by actress Jo Warne for a period of three months, but was written out upon the completion of the storyline. Two other actresses had been cast in the part before Warne. The first quit before she could film any scenes, and the second filmed eight episodes, though all of her scenes were scrapped before broadcast.<ref name=RT>{{cite news|author= ''Radio Times'' staff|date= 2\u20138 January 2010|title= 10 For 2010|work= Radio Times|publisher= BBC Magazines|page= 19}}</ref>\n\nThe character did not make another appearance until 7 November 1994, when she was reintroduced by series producer [[Barbara Emile]] as a regular character. The actress was recast, the role being taken over by Barbara Windsor, already well known to viewers as a comic actress, notably appearing in the long-running [[Carry On films|''Carry On'' films]]. Scott Matthewman of ''[[The Stage]]'' commented on the recast in 2006: \"Quite the biggest \u2013 and most inexplicable \u2013 transformation is that of Peggy Mitchell in ''EastEnders''. While Barbara Windsor has dominated the role...first appearing in [1994], the character had appeared briefly [three] years earlier, played by Jo Warne, a lady who physically is as different from our Babs as it's possible to get.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/10/the-changing-face-of-soap-acting/ |title=The changing face of soap acting |work=[[The Stage]] |publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited |first=Scott |last=Matthewman |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611120102/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/10/the-changing-face-of-soap-acting/ |archivedate=11 June 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSteve McFadden and Ross Kemp had attempted to persuade ''EastEnders'' writer [[Tony Jordan]] to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy.

They made it seem like I was brought on to 'save' ''EastEnders'' or something, which was ridiculous...the show decided to move into the \"[[Sharongate]]\" storyline, which gave it an enormous push, creatively and ratings-wise. Peggy was brought on as an extension of the Sharongate story because she was Phil and Grant's mum.

She adds, \"Peggy likes to think she looks much younger [than she is]. She's flash, fast-talking and nobody's fool. She has always done things her own way, and heaven help anyone who crosses her, though her bark's usually worse than her bite.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |date=31 October 1991|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=978-0563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nWhen Windsor took over the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, \"a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely superficial level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/> However, early in 1995, ''EastEnders'' acquired a new executive producer, [[Corinne Hollingworth]], who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was \"not going to be allowed to just sit in some flat polishing her nails\".<ref name=\"WG\"/> Windsor has said: \"It was like a dream. [Hollingworth] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed to be a lot more flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...\".<ref name=\"WG\"/>\n\nWindsor has described Peggy as \"from the old school, the generation which doesn't put up with rubbish from anybody...She can get through practically anything because she's tough, tough, tough.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/> The character has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of ''EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square'', as a matriarch, assuming \"papal infallibility.

I drew on all of those experiences.\"<ref name=\"transcript\"/> In a 2009 radio interview with [[Dale Winton]], Windsor said three people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]], who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.<ref>{{cite interview |title= Barbara Windsor Interview |last=  |first=  |interviewer= [[Dale Winton]] |work=[[Steve Wright in the Afternoon]] |publisher= [[BBC Radio 2]] |date= 24 July 2009 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nPeggy has been central to numerous high-profile storylines, including a battle with [[breast cancer]], a failed marriage to Frank Butcher, and various business and family upsets.<ref name=\"break\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2352193.stm|title=Windsor plans EastEnders break|publisher=BBC News | date = 23 October 2002| accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Breast cancer===\nIn 1996, Peggy featured in a storyline about [[breast cancer]]. It was the first time that the soap had given one of its characters the illness, though the issue was covered much less substantially in 1987 as a means of promoting [[Mammography|breast cancer screening]], when [[Sue Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]]) discovered a lump on her breast, which turned out to be benign.\n\nPeggy's breast cancer storyline was devised at the suggestion of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea \"that had been knocking about for a long time.\"<ref name=\"social\">{{cite book |first= Lesley|last=Henderson|title= Social Issues in Television Fiction|year=2001|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|isbn=978-0-7486-2532-1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8l_TcZfmuDoC&pg=PA80&dq=eastenders+breast+cancer#PPA80,M1|chapter=A Woman's Disease: Breast Cancer|pages=76\u201392|accessdate=31 October 2009}}</ref> In Lesley Henderson's book, ''Social Issues in Television Fiction'', an ''EastEnders'' researcher explains that: \"A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material\", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with.<ref name=\"social\"/> The programme sought expert advice on \"storyline visuals\" from a variety of sources including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals.<ref name=\"social\"/> There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: \"''EastEnders'' is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work. You've got to be careful to make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development.\"<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\nProducers decided to use Peggy in the breast cancer storyline, conforming to a soap opera tradition of reserving strong roles for a firmly established middle-aged matriarch.<ref name=\"social\"/> The audience were familiar with Peggy's history, knew that her first husband had died from cancer, consequently making her fear hospitals, and she had: \"the right mentality for [the story theme], which was about 'a woman who discovers a lump and then refuses to accept that anything's wrong'. An added factor was that in choosing Peggy the programme could avoid appearing too issue driven, and [the] storyline could be used as a device to expand and develop her characterisation.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Additionally, as the causes of breast cancer are not attributable to risky behaviour, the disease was deemed \"more attractive\" in storyline terms. A member of the ''EastEnders'' production team explains:\n\n{{cquote|If you take a character who smokes and they get [[lung cancer]] that would seem too issue-driven. The great thing about a character like Peggy is [her breast cancer was] quite unexpected. At the time there were lots of other issues in her life. She was a character who audiences had only seen pulling pints behind the bar. Suddenly she was in a new environment in a hospital and had a huge medical crisis to go through, so that allowed the character to grow and expand in many ways...There was also fairly major moments [...] with Peggy and [her boyfriend [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]])]. She thought George wouldn't love her any more after she'd had the operation. We were able to use the illness to take them on a new journey.<ref name=\"social\"/>}}\n\nIn the view of the production team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer.<ref name=\"social\"/> In 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised ''EastEnders'' for this.<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\n[[File:Ross Kemp.jpg|thumb|[[Ross Kemp]] plays Peggy's son [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]]. The issue of whether Peggy's children would discover her breast cancer was used to build tension and create suspense in the viewing audience.]]\n\nThe storyline used elements of suspense, created by the use of \"shared secrets\" between Peggy and her daughter-in-law [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy's trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy's lump was benign or malignant and whether she would die, but also in terms of Peggy's relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or if George would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: \"such devises [added] pathos to Peggy's treatment path. Audiences [knew] that she [was] terrified and about to discover her biopsy results, but must watch as she is casually castigated by her son Grant for pestering his wife Tiffany to accompany her to 'the dentist'.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Hospital scenes were also played for narrative pace to build tension and drama.<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\nBecause \"radical, body-altering\" surgery on a long-running character would cause the production team ongoing problems with continuity, it was decided that Peggy would have a \"less visible\" [[lumpectomy]], rather than a [[mastectomy]]. A member of the ''EastEnders'' production team explained: \"We have to think about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases.<ref name=\"social\"/> However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the \"all-clear\" at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction.<ref name=\"social\"/> It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy.<ref name=\"mastectomy\">{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,335926,00.html|title=An everyday story of... cancer|first=Sue|last=Arnold|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=25 June 2000|accessdate=26 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> BBC Production chief executive [[Matthew Bannister]] praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: \"It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us and a lot of other people.\"<ref name=\"wedding\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/308079.stm|title=Wedding knees-up in the Square |publisher=BBC News|date=30 March 1999| accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOncology nurses and consultants were involved in the development of the storyline, which was based on a real life case study.

Felicity Smart, who had undergone a mastectomy, wrote to the BBC on behalf of the Breast Carer Support Group at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London to say that emotionally the storyline \"hit the spot\", but medically it was \"hopelessly inaccurate\" as according to Smart: \"No one pulls pints and wisecracks with customers three days after having a mastectomy.\"<ref name=\"mastectomy\"/>\n\n===Marriage to Frank Butcher===\nIn 1998, Peggy was romantically paired on-screen with the character [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]). Their coupling was part of producer Matthew Robinson's plan to place the focus of the soap back on to the Butcher and [[Mitchell family|Mitchell families]], while various other long-running characters were axed following a decline in ratings. The soap was attracting 15.74 million viewers in May 1998, as opposed to rival soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'s'' 16 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980524/ai_n14476271?tag=content;col1|first=Doug|last=Kempster|title=It's Axe-Enders|work=[[The Sunday Pictorial|Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=24 May 1998|accessdate=14 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nPlayed by [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]], Frank had been a regular character in the serial from 1987 to 1994, and had appeared in a recurring role until 1998, when Reid agreed to return full-time. Frank's history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special [[two-hander]] episode aired in November 1998, [[List of EastEnders two-hander episodes#Pat and Peggy (27 October 1998)|featuring only Pat and Peggy]] for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy's reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat's unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat's own marriage to [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy]] ([[Tony Caunter]]), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife's infidelity.

Windsor commented, \"The writer didn't want a namby- pamby cat fight between two silly girls. We were throwing chairs and bottles and the adrenaline was at a high. When I saw the programme I couldn't believe how good it was. Pam and I were really proud.\" The ''Sunday Mirror'' described it as: \"one of the most impressive episodes of all time\".<ref name=\"fight\"/> In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact.\n\nPeggy and Frank were married on-screen on 1 April 1999. A \"hen night\" was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a \"massive\" party in the show's [[Albert Square]] to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in [[Elstree Studios|Elstree]], [[Hertfordshire]]. Windsor admitted she had been so nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, \"I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous \u2013 we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It shows you care.\"<ref name=\"wedding\"/> The soap wedding was filmed in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], [[NW postcode area|North West London]] in February 1999.

I got the most appalling [hate] mail because of it. I had a very dear friend of mine who was dying of AIDS so it was very personal to me. The last scene I did I went straight out and got terribly drunk.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> }}\n\nActress and writer [[Jacquetta May]], who played the character [[Rachel Kominski]] between 1991 and 1993, has discussed the storyline and the role of women in an article about ''EastEnders''. According to May, the scriptwriters were faced with a problem once Peggy, \"a key figure of the community\", was shown to exhibit such \"pig-headed ignorance and appalling prejudice\". In order for Peggy to be redeemed, she had to be seen to be punished, and so the character was given breast-cancer later that year. May comments, \"Peggy, malicious gossip and bigot, herself becomes the victim of a life-threatening illness. At Christmas they run a Christian forgiveness story. Peggy calls on Mark and tells him she now knows what it is like to suffer as he has. She apologises, thus underlining one of the basic tenets of the programme: underneath the skin we are all the same, human and vulnerable, and recognition of this should unite us not divide us. Along the way, a great deal of useful information about these illnesses was broadcast. So, although ''EastEnders'' endlessly repeats its conservative format, and although all issues are there primarily to feed the great hungry story-beast, its positive by-products cannot be denied.\"<ref name=\"kominski\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|archivedate=29 December 2006|title=Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|first=Jacquetta|last=May|authorlink=Jacquetta May|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has received praise for the handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, it was reported that media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as \"more tragic\" or \"more sexy\" in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50.<ref name=\"social\"/> Source organisations working with ''EastEnders'' on the storyline have commented: \"[The team] decided it was going to be [Peggy] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented \"particularly positive messages\" concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline \"didactic\".<ref name=\"social\"/> The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theanswerbank.co.uk/Article1254.html|title=What other medical issues have been raised by soaps?|first=Katharine|last=MacColl|publisher=Answer Bank|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2008, [[Bupa]] doctors criticised UK soaps for presenting unhealthy [[role model]]s to viewing audiences.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]].

The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.[[File:Traza de la segunda fundaci\u00f3n de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]It is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]]. As such, Mendoza is one of the nine Great Wine Capitals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |title=The Great Wine Capitals |access-date=2019-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807002916/http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |archive-date=2019-08-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the city is an emerging [[enotourism]] destination and base for exploring the region's hundreds of wineries located along the [[Argentina Wine Route]].\n\n== History ==\nOn March 2, 1561, [[Pedro del Castillo]] founded the city and named it ''Ciudad de Mendoza del Nuevo Valle de La Rioja'' after the governor of [[Chile]], Don [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |title=welcomeargentina.com: Land of the good wine |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018111852/http://welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |archive-date=2007-10-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Before the 1560s the area was populated by tribes known as the [[Huarpe]]s and [[Puelche]]s. The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.[[File:Traza de la segunda fundaci\u00f3n de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]It is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.
