This would have been very easy. But ... it would have cost more at retail level, and we probably would not have sold as many.

The problem seemingly comes from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments. This causes the plastic mouldings inside the console to warp slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to sit the console on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.<ref name=\"problems\">{{cite web|title=Sony PlayStation 1st-gen specs difficulties|url=https://www.engadget.com/products/sony/playstation/1st-gen/specs/|website=engadget|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=18 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084637/http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/playstation/1st-gen/specs/|archive-date=19 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Sony representatives also recommended unplugging the PlayStation when it is not in use, as the system draws in a small amount of power (and therefore heat) even when turned off.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Buyers Beware |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=102 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=March 1997 |page=20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PlayStation Pickup.jpg|thumbnail|Comparison of old and new pick-ups]]\nThe first batch of PlayStations use a KSM-440AAM [[laser]] unit, whose case and movable parts are all built out of plastic. Over time, the plastic lens sled rail wears out\u2014usually unevenly\u2014due to friction. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerates wear, due to the additional heat, which makes the plastic more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled will become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD; after this, games will no longer load, due to data read errors. One common fix is turning the PlayStation upside down, which makes the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of [[Die casting|die-cast]] metal and placing the laser unit further away from the power supply on later PlayStation models.<ref name=\"problems\" /><ref name=\"specs\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.playstation.com/psvitasystem/#select-tab-specifications |title=Official PlayStation website: PlayStation Vita, PS Vita; Specifications for PlayStationVita |accessdate=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107200613/http://uk.playstation.com/psvitasystem/#select-tab-specifications |archive-date=7 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions (due to an engineering oversight) causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen.

This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play [[CD-R]] copies of games. It also allowed the console to play games from any region, as the modchip could inject the data for any region into the system. Since there was a multitude of electronic parts on the market, by the end of the system's life cycle, anyone with minimal soldering experience could perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using [[Free software|free]], official tools, such as the [[Net Yaroze]], as well as unofficial tools, and the reproduction of original

This would have been very easy. But ... it would have cost more at retail level, and we probably would not have sold as many.

The problem seemingly comes from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments. This causes the plastic mouldings inside the console to warp slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to sit the console on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.<ref name=\"problems\">{{cite web|title=Sony PlayStation 1st-gen specs difficulties|url=https://www.engadget.com/products/sony/playstation/1st-gen/specs/|website=engadget|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=18 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084637/http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/playstation/1st-gen/specs/|archive-date=19 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Sony representatives also recommended unplugging the PlayStation when it is not in use, as the system draws in a small amount of power (and therefore heat) even when turned off.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Buyers Beware |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=102 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=March 1997 |page=20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PlayStation Pickup.jpg|thumbnail|Comparison of old and new pick-ups]]\nThe first batch of PlayStations use a KSM-440AAM [[laser]] unit, whose case and movable parts are all built out of plastic. Over time, the plastic lens sled rail wears out\u2014usually unevenly\u2014due to friction. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerates wear, due to the additional heat, which makes the plastic more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled will become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD; after this, games will no longer load, due to data read errors. One common fix is turning the PlayStation upside down, which makes the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of [[Die casting|die-cast]] metal and placing the laser unit further away from the power supply on later PlayStation models.<ref name=\"problems\" /><ref name=\"specs\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.playstation.com/psvitasystem/#select-tab-specifications |title=Official PlayStation website: PlayStation Vita, PS Vita; Specifications for PlayStationVita |accessdate=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107200613/http://uk.playstation.com/psvitasystem/#select-tab-specifications |archive-date=7 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions (due to an engineering oversight) causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen.

This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play [[CD-R]] copies of games. It also allowed the console to play games from any region, as the modchip could inject the data for any region into the system. Since there was a multitude of electronic parts on the market, by the end of the system's life cycle, anyone with minimal soldering experience could perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using [[Free software|free]], official tools, such as the [[Net Yaroze]], as well as unofficial tools, and the reproduction of original

Nintendo had been the clear leader in the video game industry since the introduction of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position for Nintendo.

Elected to Parliament in 1784, Windham was attached to the remnants of the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham]]ite faction of Whigs, whose members included his friends [[Charles James Fox]] and [[Edmund Burke]].  Windham soon became noted for his oratory in the House of Commons.\n\nAn early supporter of the [[French Revolution]], by late 1791 he shared Burke's hostility to it and became a leading anti-Jacobin. After [[French Revolutionary Wars|war was declared on France]] in early 1793, he broke with the antiwar, pro-Revolution [[Foxite]] Whigs to form a small 'Third Party' that was independent of [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s government but supportive of the war effort.  Like Burke, Windham supported the war as an ideological crusade against Jacobinism and was an enthusiastic supporter of the French ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' and a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] restoration.  In July 1794 he finally joined Pitt's government as [[Secretary at War]] but did not control war policy.  He discovered that Pitt did not share his enthusiasm for the Bourbon cause and he argued in Cabinet against a peace agreement with the French Republic.\n\nIn February 1801 Windham followed Pitt in resigning from the government over the King's rejection of Catholic Emancipation.  He was the leading opponent of the new Prime Minister [[Henry Addington]]'s [[Treaty of Amiens|peace with France]] in late 1801 and early 1802.  In the [[Ministry of All the Talents]] in 1806\u20137, Windham became [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies|Secretary for War and the Colonies]], having reconciled with the Foxites.  He resigned with them from the government, again over Catholic Emancipation.  He spent the rest of his life in opposition, dying in 1810.<ref name=\"ODNB\">David Wilkinson, '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29725 Windham, William(1750\u20131810)]', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 14 December 2009.</ref>\n\n==Early life: 1750\u20131778==\nWindham was a member of an ancient [[Norfolk]] family and a great-great-grandson of [[John Wyndham (1558-1645)|Sir John Wyndham]]. He was the son of [[William Windham, Sr.]] of [[Felbrigg Hall]] and his second wife, Sarah Lukin. Windham was born at No. 6 Golden Square, Soho, London.<ref>The Earl of Rosebery (ed.), ''The Windham Papers. Volume One'' (London: Herbert  Jenkins Limited, 1913), p. 6.</ref>\n\nWindham was educated at [[Eton College]] from 1757 to 1766 (where he was a contemporary of [[Charles James Fox]]). Here he was noted for the ease in which he acquired knowledge, as well for his success in sports.  He became known as \"Fighting Windham\" because he was good with his fists.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers vol.I'', p. 6.</ref> His father died in 1761 and his guardians were [[Benjamin Stillingfleet]], Dr. Dampier, [[David Garrick]] and a Mr. Price of Hereford. Windham was removed from Eton for fighting.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 9.</ref>\n\nWindham attended the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1766 and studied under [[John Anderson (natural philosopher)|Dr. Anderson]], Professor of Natural Philosophy, and [[Robert Simson]] the mathematician.  Windham wrote three unpublished theses on mathematics.<ref name=\"Rosebery, p. 10\">Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 10.</ref> He then attended [[University College, Oxford]] from 1767 to 1771 as a [[gentleman-commoner]], where he was tutored by [[Robert Chambers (English judge)|Robert Chambers]]. According to [[Edmund Malone]], Windham \"was highly distinguished for his application to various studies, for his love of enterprise, for that frank and graceful address, and that honourable deportment, which gave a lustre to his character though every period of his life\".<ref name=\"Rosebery, p. 10\"/> He took his BA degree in 1771, his [[Oxford MA|MA]] on 7 October 1782, and was awarded a DCL at the Duke of Portland's installation as Chancellor.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 11.</ref>\n\nWindham was a Christian. Before his balloon ride, he wrote to George James Cholmondeley on 4 May 1785 a letter that was only to be delivered if he did not survive the trip. It contained Windham's confession of faith:\n\n<blockquote>The best, the greatest, the most solemn office I can render in a letter of this sort, is to extort you to a steady contemplation of divine truths, and a sincere endeavour to confirm in yourself that faith, which after various fluctuations I believe to be the true one, and which, independent of evidence, is supported by too great authorities ever to be rejected with confidence.  Whatever may be the diversity of opinion as to the particular nature, I believe [[Jesus|Christ]] to be a person divinely commissioned, and that faith in him affords the fairest hope of propitiating the great author of the world.  Cultivate in your mind this persuasion and dwell upon it till it grows into a principle of action.  May it avail both to the purposes of final salvation.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 79.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Early political career: 1778\u20131789==\n[[File:William Windham by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|William Windham by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]].]]\nIn early 1778 Windham first took part in political matters.  He felt strongly about the [[American War of Independence]], writing to [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] on 5 January that \"I never felt so much disposition to exert myself before\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 19.</ref> On 28 January Windham delivered in Norwich his first public speech, where he spoke against the war, and a few days later he wrote a remonstrance against it which was signed by 5,000 people and was presented to the House of Commons.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 20.</ref> His speech went down well and he was urged to stand for election. Windham stood unsuccessfully for [[w:Norwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Norwich]] in the election of September 1780.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', pp. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nWhen in 1783 the Duke of Portland formed an administration, he appointed Lord Northington as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Northington offered Windham the office of Chief Secretary for Ireland, which he accepted. However, after only four months in the post, Windham resigned under mysterious circumstances.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nOn 5 April 1784 Windham was elected to Parliament for Norwich.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 61.</ref> He took part in the [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|Impeachment]] of [[Warren Hastings]] and his speeches against him on 1 June 1787 and 22 March 1787 were admired.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nDuring the Regency Crisis of 1788\u201389 he spoke in favour of granting [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]] full regal powers as Regent.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He wrote on 26 November 1788: \"If the King of a country is completely out of his mind, whatever sorrow may be felt for that event, the extent of the evil is, however, known: It is, for the time it lasts, just as if the King were dead. The same person must, upon all principles of reason, and all views of the Constitution, carry on the Government, as if the King were actually dead\u2014should he again be restored completely to his senses, the case is then equally clear: he must be restored completely to his government\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\n==French Revolution: 1789\u20131794==\nFrom 12 August 1789 until 6 September, Windham toured France. Upon his return, Windham sent his friend and fellow Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] some books (recommended by a Deputy of the National Assembly) on the general state of public opinion in France in the aftermath of the beginnings of the [[French Revolution]]. Windham wrote to Burke on 15 September, saying: \"My notion has been from the beginning, and is not altered by what I have seen or heard, that the new Constitution will be settled without a struggle. Whether perfect quiet and satisfaction may be established in the country is another question: but it does not appear to me, that there is any near prospect of civil commotion.\u2014Any opinion, however, which I can have upon the subject is, of course, very vague conjecture.\"<ref>Alfred Cobban and Robert A. Smith (eds.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI: July 1789 \u2013 December 1791'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 21.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Henry Flood]] introduced a motion for parliamentary reform on 4 March 1790, Windham famously said: \"What, would Mr. Flood recommend you to repair your house in this hurricane season?\"<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 91.</ref>\n\nAfter reading Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' in November 1790, Windham wrote in his diary: \"Never was there, I suppose, a work so valuable in its kind, or that displayed powers of so extraordinary a sort. It is a work that may seem capable of overturning the National Assembly, and turning the stream of opinion throughout Europe. One would think, that the author of such a work, would be called to the government of his country, by the combined voices of every man in it. What shall be said of the state of things when it is remembered that the writer is a man decried, persecuted, and proscribed; not being much valued, even by his own party, and by half the nation considered as little better than an ingenious madman?\"<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\nWindham travelled to Paris in September 1791 and he was present at the ceremony in the National Assembly where King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] accepted the [[French Constitution of 1791|new constitution]] of France. Windham wrote to Mrs. Crewe that the ceremony was \"necessarily humiliating...there was somewhat too much of \"la nation,\" and somewhat too little of \"le Roi\".\" Windham wished they had been more courteous and added: \"I hope that we shall be the people to keep up a little of the \u201cvielle cour\u201d in our manners, while we lose nothing of the solid advantages and privileges that the new system can promise\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', pp. 99\u2013100.</ref> In May 1792 Windham wrote to a friend on his opposition to parliamentary reform: \"I have in general been far from adverse to the principles an cause of the French Revolution. So much otherwise indeed, that from the beginning almost, Mr. Burke and I have never exchanged a word on the subject. But when an attempt is made to bring the same principles home to us, Principles in a great measure extravagant and false and which at best have no practical application here, I shall ever prove myself as violent an opposer of them as Mr. Burke or any one can be\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 101.</ref>\n\nWindham supported the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|Royalist uprising]] in [[Vend\u00e9e|La Vend\u00e9e]] and he urged the British government to aid them with the aim of restoring the [[House of Bourbon]] to the throne: \"I would, from the beginning, have made this the  principal object of the war\".<ref>J. J. Sack, ''From Jacobite to  Conservative. Reaction and  orthodoxy in  Britain, c. 1760\u20131832''  (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 93.</ref>\n\nIn a speech to the Commons, on 30 April 1792, he declared that he would unite with any body of men \"who were determined to set their faces against every endeavour to subvert the true principles of the constitution\".<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Whig Party and the French Revolution'' (London: Macmillan, 1967), p. 85.</ref> On 13 November Windham and Burke met Pitt and hinted they and their fellow conservative Whigs would support strong measures; however, Pitt desired \"more certain and definite assurances of support from the heads of the party before the meeting of parliament\".<ref>O'Gorman, p. 108.</ref> He still had reservations about completely separating from Fox and he denied in the Commons (on 15 December) that they differed in principles. However, as he said in the Commons on 4 January 1793, he was no longer a systematic opposer of the government.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 116, n. 4.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the execution of Louis XVI, Parliament met in February 1793. Fox and his supporters excused France's actions short of supporting the execution and Fox claimed that the British monarchy was elective and that sovereignty resided with the people. On 9 February war was declared on France and the conservative Whigs met the next day. They decided that a reunion with the Foxites was now out of the question and that they would now call themselves the \u2018Third Party\u2019.<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref> This faction consisted of only approximately 38 MPs (26 of whom were members of the Whig party), with less than one-fifth of the Whigs as members.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 127.</ref>\n\nIn the opinion of the historian Frank O'Gorman, if the Pitt government was to be persuaded to adopt the only anti-Jacobin policies that would be effective, \"Windham was the only politician who might seriously undertake to accomplish these ends\":\n\n<blockquote>He was possessed of distinguished talents and a disposition so compelling as to endear him to all. The power of his intelligence was disguised by his self-effacing manner as a reserve of strength and firmness which he did not in reality possess. His talents and his nature, allied to unquestioned integrity, gave him a reputation and a standing among his contemporaries which was, perhaps, second only to that of Fox. It was not by accident that Windham was able to rally to him some of the most respectable independents in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, he was peculiarly ill-suited to the role which he was now called upon to play in...1793. He was daunted with the prospect of assuming responsibility for matters of state by the doubts and fears which gnawed away at the determination he could summon in his rare moments of enthusiasm and exuberance. Once his energy had been overcome by the exhaustion of his spirits, he would fall away into lethargy, despair and pessimism. Having formed the \u2018Third Party\u2019, he promptly excused himself from leading it. Having committed its members to a distinct support of administration, he escaped to the solitude of Fellbrig, in spite of 'the possibility of having lost an opportunity of distinction'. He consoled his conscience by toying with the preparation of speeches which he never delivered while he ruminated on his inability to act out the part which he himself had chosen.<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 137\u2013138.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 17 June Pitt offered Windham the office of Secretary at War. In a speech in the Commons that same day, Windham supported Pitt, arguing that intervention in French affairs might become a necessity if a government was formed in Paris \"as we might with safety treat with\".<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 144\u2013145.</ref> However, on 19 June he informed Pitt that he would decline his offer, although he added that he might accept office \"sometime hence\".<ref>O'Gorman, p. 146.</ref> From 12 July until 6 August, he was in Flanders. Windham was the contact between the conservative Whigs and the government; however, he was still at this time hesitant about joining Pitt's government.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 148.</ref>\n\nIn January 1794 began the [[1794 Treason Trials|trials]] of the leaders of the British Convention. In response, the radicals proposed another such convention. Therefore, the government decided to arrest leading radicals such as [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]]. On 13 May, the day after Hardy's arrest, the Commons voted to appoint a Committee of Secrecy to devise the measures necessary to counter a new convention. Windham was appointed to the Committee, along with Burke (and other conservative Whigs and government supporters), much to Fox's chagrin.<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 189\u2013190.</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Portland,  on 3 July, urged Windham that, if he took up Pitt's offer of the Secretaryship at War, he could make it \"a real efficient Cabinet employment\". His friend, Tom Grenville, met Windham that day and he succeeded in persuading Windham to accept office. Portland was therefore able to negotiate with the King a coalition government between the conservative Whigs and Pitt's government.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 204.</ref>\n\n==Secretary at War: 1794\u20131801==\n\nHe was  Secretary at War in Pitt's government. Windham managed to gain a few subsidies for the ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' and achieved Cabinet support for the failed [[Invasion of France (1795)|Quiberon expedition]]. In practice, Windham made himself responsible for all matters related to the Royalists but in the spring of 1796 he relinquished his sole responsibility for this as he was frustrated by the need to constantly refer to other departments when ever he wanted to do something that would help the Royalists. He realised that other Cabinet members did not share his enthusiasm for the Royalist cause and for a Bourbon restoration.<ref name=\"O'Gorman, p. 216\">O'Gorman, p. 216.</ref>\n\nIn late 1795 the government decided to negotiate peace with France and Windham agreed that France remaining a republic should be no obstacle to this.<ref name=\"O'Gorman, p. 216\"/> However, by October 1796, Windham had changed his mind, writing to Mrs Crewe: \"If I could have been sure that [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]]'s despicable embassy would succeed and that peace must be the immediate consequence, I should have been out long since\".<ref>O'Gorman, p. 217.</ref>\n\nIn the dispute between Fitzwilliam and Pitt over Ireland, Windham supported Fitzwilliam and threatened to resign if better policies for governing Ireland were not adopted. Windham acted as the mediator between the two sides.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], Windham supported the [[Acts of Union 1800|union of Ireland with Great Britain]], believing that Catholic emancipation would follow. On 7 February 1801 Windham was among those who resigned in protest at the King's veto of [[Catholic emancipation]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Opposition: 1801\u20131806==\n\nImmediately after the [[Treaty of Amiens|Peace of Amiens]] was signed, the Prime Minister, [[Henry Addington]], wrote to Windham on 1 October 1801: \"I think when I see you...I can satisfy you that it is not clear even upon your own Principles that we are wrong\".<ref>Charles John Fedorak, ''Henry Addington, Prime Minister, 1801\u20131804.  Peace, War and Parliamentary Politics'' (Akron, Ohio: The University  of Akron Press, 2002), p. 73.</ref> Windham replied to Addington on the same day:\n\n<blockquote>I can have no idea of the measure in question but as the commencement of a career which, by an easy descent, and step by step, but at no very distant period, will conduct the country to a situation where, when it looks at last for its independence, it will find that it is already gone. I have no idea how the effect of this measure is ever to be recover'd; Chance may do much, but, according to any conception I can form, the Country has received its death blow.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 173.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the preliminaries of the Treaty were debated in the Commons on 3 November 1801, Windham gave a speech that was, according to [[A. D. Harvey]], the sensation of the evening\".<ref>A. D. Harvey, ''Britain  in the early nineteenth century'' (B T Batsford Ltd, 1978), p. 125.</ref> He said Addington and Lord Hawkesbury \"in a moment of rashness and weakness, have fatally put their hands to this treaty, have signed the death-warrant of their country. They have given it a blow, under which it may languish for a few years, but from which I do not conceive how it is possible for it ever to recover\".<ref>Fedorak, p. 73.</ref> According to ''The Times'' Windham sat on \"the same bench from which Mr. Burke always spoke after separating from Mr. Fox\" and an observer said he spoke \"like the ghost of Burke\". One contemporary said  Windham possessed Burke's insanity without his inspiration.<ref>Harvey, p. 125.</ref> When [[Charles James Fox]] visited France during the Peace of Amiens he conversed with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (on 23 September 1802). Napoleon said he believed Windham's \"talents were mediocre and that he was an unfeeling, unprincipled man\". Fox immediately defended Windham but Napoleon countered: \"It is easy for you who only know public debate. But for me, I detest him and that Pitt who together have attempted my life\". Fox assured Napoleon that \"Mr Pitt and Mr Windham, like every other Englishman, would shrink with horror from the idea of secret assassination\".<ref>Tom Pocock, ''The Terror Before Trafalgar. Nelson, Napoleon and the Secret War'' (John Murray, 2003), pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n[[William Hazlitt]] apparently had it on somewhat good authority that Pitt had hated Windham.<ref>Sack, p. 93.</ref> Windham in turn did not attend Pitt's funeral at Westminster Abbey after his death in January 1806.<ref>The Countess of Minto, ''The Life and Letters of Sir Gilbert Elliott, First Earl of Minto.

Volume III'' (London: Longmans,  Green & Co., 1874), p. 379.</ref>\n\n==Secretary of State for War and the Colonies: 1806\u20131807==\n\nOn 5 February 1806 Windham received the seals of office to become Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]]'s [[Ministry of All the Talents]].<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', p. 285.</ref>\n\nWindham abolished the ballot for the militia to ensure that only volunteers manned the militia. He also wanted to solve the Army's recruiting shortage by limiting service in the Army to seven years. He increased soldiers' wages from 1 shilling to 1s. 6d. if they re-enlisted after the seven years, and to 2 shillings if they re-enlisted after fourteen years. He also introduced pensions for old soldiers.<ref>Richard Glover, ''Britain at Bay.

Vol. II'', p. 348.</ref> Writing to [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]] in September 1809, Windham voiced his opposition to peace with France, even though Wellington had been driven from Spain back into Portugal. He further argued that \"the great thing that is wanted is resistance to the strides that are making, in concurrence with the general tendency of things throughout the world, to turn the country into a democracy\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', pp. 358\u2013359.</ref>\n\n==Support for Old English sports==\n\nWindham was opposed to the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement and their attempt to outlaw traditional English sports: \"Few subjects agitated...Windham...more than the puritanical and Wilberforcian assault on the traditional sports of Englishmen such as boxing and bull-baiting. Windham's speeches in parliament in defense of such practices seem among his most heart-felt\".<ref>Sack, pp. 205\u2013205.</ref> [[William Wilberforce]] wrote to [[Hannah More]]&mdash;a leading evangelical moralist&mdash;on 15 November 1804: \"I really think there scarcely ever were, or can be, two men more different from each other in all their ideas than Windham and myself\".<ref>Robert Isaac Wilberforce and Samuel Wilberforce (eds.), ''The Correspondence of William Wilberforce: Volume I'' (London: John Murray, 1840), p. 340.</ref> Windham said that Wilberforce would delight in sending aristocrats to the guillotine.<ref>Sack, p. 210.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the British victory over the French at the [[Battle of Talavera]], Windham wrote on the subject of [[boxing]] in a letter to a friend dated 17 August 1809:\n\n<blockquote>Why are we to boast so much of the ''native'' valour of our troops, as shewn at Talavera, at [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeira]], and at [[Battle of Maida|Maida]], yet to discourage all the practices and habits which tend to keep alive the same sentiments and feelings? The sentiments that filled the minds of the three thousand spectators who attended the two pugilists, were just the same in kind as those which inspired the higher combatants on the occasions before enumerated. It is the circumstance only in which they are displayed, that makes the difference. ... Bravery is found in all habits, classes, circumstances, and conditions. But have habits and institutions of one sort no tendency to form it, more than of another? Longevity is found in persons of habits the most opposite: but are not certain habits more favourable to it than others? The courage does not arise from mere boxing, from the mere beating or being beat:\u2014but from the sentiments excited by the contemplation and cultivation of such practices. Will it make no difference in the mass of a people, whether their amusements are all of a pacific, pleasurable, and effeminate nature, or whether they are of a sort that calls forth a continued admiration of prowess and hardihood? But when I get on these topicks, I never know how to stop...<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', pp. 351\u2013352.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 8 July 1809, Windham was returning to [[Pall Mall, London]] from a friend's when he saw a house on fire in Conduit Street. His friend Frederick North lived a few doors away from the burning house and possessed a valuable library. Therefore, with the aid of two or three men, Windham succeeded in removing most of the books before the fire reached North's house. However, when removing some heavy books, he fell and bruised his hip. After a tumour grew in the hip he received medical help but this was ineffectual. On 6 May 1810 the surgeon Henry Cline advised him that an operation was imperative, an opinion shared by four of the six physicians Windham consulted.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', pp.  369\u2013370.</ref> Before the operation Windham went to some trouble to receive the Sacrament.<ref>Cecilia Anne Baring (ed.), ''The Diary of the Right Hon. William Windham. 1784 to 1810'' (London: Longmans, Green & Co., 1866), p. 505.</ref> Cline performed the operation on 17 May and, although it was successful, Windham did not recover from the shock. His last words were to Dr. Lynn, who moved him into a more comfortable position on the night of 3 June: \"I thank you; this is the last trouble I shall give you. You fight the battle well, but it will not do\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', p. 370.</ref> Not long after, he fell asleep and died in the presence of his wife. On 8 June, Windham's body was transported to the family vault at Felbrigg, with a private funeral. In the church window Windham's widow installed a memorial brass with the inscription:\n\n<blockquote>Sacred to the Memory of the Right Honourable William Windham, of Felbrigge, in this County. Born the 14th of May, O.S. 1750, Died the 4th of June, N.S. 1810. He was the only son of William Windham, esqre., by Sarah, relict of Robert Lukin, esqre. He married in 1798 Cecilia, third daughter of the late Commodore Forrest; who erects this Monument in grateful and tender remembrance of him. During a period of twenty-six years he distinguished himself in Parliament by his eloquence and talents; and was repeatedly called to the highest offices of the State. His views and councils were directed more to raising the glory than increasing the wealth of his country. He was above all things anxious to preserve untainted the National Character, and even those National Manners which long habit had associated with that character. As a Statesman, he laboured to exalt the courage, to improve the comforts, and ennoble the profession of a Soldier: As an individual, he exhibited a model of those qualities which denote the most accomplished and enlightened mind. Frank, generous, unassuming, intrepid, compassionate, and pious, he was so highly respected, even by those from whom he most differed in opinion, that, tho' much of his life had passed in political contention, he was accompanied to the grave by the sincere and unqualified regret of his Sovereign and his Country.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers.

The lineaments of his countenance, though they displayed the ravages of the smallpox, were pleasing, and retained a character of animation, blended with spirit and intelligence. Over his whole figure, nature had thrown an air of mind. His manners corresponded with his external appearance; and his conversation displayed the treasures of a highly cultivated understanding. Ardent in his love of civil liberty, for the preservation of which blessing, I believe, he would as cheerfully have shed his blood as did [[John Hampden|Hampden]] or [[Algernon Sidney|Sidney]]; it was constitutional freedom that he venerated, not a republican and impracticable emancipation from limited monarchial government...To Burke, Windham unquestionably bore some analogy; and on ''his'' shoulders may be said to have descended the mantle of Burke...Windham's talents, brilliant and various as they were, always however appeared to me more adapted to speculative, than to practical life.<ref>Nathaniel William Wraxall, ''Posthumous Memoirs of His Own Time. Volume I'' (London: Richardly Bentley, 1836), pp. 241\u2013242.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] said of Windham:\n\n<blockquote>...a lively wit of the most pungent and yet abstruse description, a turn  for subtle reasoning ... familiarity with men of letters and artists as  well as politicians...a singularly expressive countenance\u2014all fitted  this remarkable person to shine ... [but] he was too often the dupe of his own ingenuity; which made him doubt and balance ... His nature ... was to be a follower, if not a worshipper, rather than an original thinker or actor ... Accordingly, first Johnson in private and afterwards Burke on political matters were the deities whom he adored.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Whig historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]], in his essay on Warren Hastings that he wrote in 1841, praised Windham: \"There, with eyes reverentially fixed on Burke, appeared the finest gentleman of the age, his form developed by every manly exercise, his face beaming with intelligence and spirit, the ingenious, the chivalrous, the high-souled Windham\".<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/hastings/txt_complete.html</ref>\n\n[[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] edited Windham's papers in 1913, and said Windham was:\n\n<blockquote>...the finest English gentleman of his or perhaps of all time. Had he lived in the great days of Elizabeth, he would have been one of the heroes of her reign...He was a statesman, an orator, a mathematician, a scholar, and the most fascinating talker of his day...A noble gentleman in the highest sense of the word, full of light, intellect, and dignity, loved and lamented. His best qualities, no doubt, as is often the case, he carried almost to excess; for his cherished independence he led to a morbid craving for isolation. But to the charge of vacillation in public affairs he was not obnoxious; he was always true to his faith. But he chose his masters well, Johnson and Burke; the one gave him his religious, the other his political creed. In life he was brilliant and successful. In oratory, in parliament, in society, he was almost supreme. But he can scarcely be said to survive. He left no stamp, no school, no work. To those, however, who care to disinter his memory he displays character and qualities of excellence, rare at all times, rarest in these.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers.

Elected to Parliament in 1784, Windham was attached to the remnants of the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham]]ite faction of Whigs, whose members included his friends [[Charles James Fox]] and [[Edmund Burke]].  Windham soon became noted for his oratory in the House of Commons.\n\nAn early supporter of the [[French Revolution]], by late 1791 he shared Burke's hostility to it and became a leading anti-Jacobin. After [[French Revolutionary Wars|war was declared on France]] in early 1793, he broke with the antiwar, pro-Revolution [[Foxite]] Whigs to form a small 'Third Party' that was independent of [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s government but supportive of the war effort.  Like Burke, Windham supported the war as an ideological crusade against Jacobinism and was an enthusiastic supporter of the French ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' and a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] restoration.  In July 1794 he finally joined Pitt's government as [[Secretary at War]] but did not control war policy.  He discovered that Pitt did not share his enthusiasm for the Bourbon cause and he argued in Cabinet against a peace agreement with the French Republic.\n\nIn February 1801 Windham followed Pitt in resigning from the government over the King's rejection of Catholic Emancipation.  He was the leading opponent of the new Prime Minister [[Henry Addington]]'s [[Treaty of Amiens|peace with France]] in late 1801 and early 1802.  In the [[Ministry of All the Talents]] in 1806-7, Windham became [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies|Secretary for War and the Colonies]], having reconciled with the Foxites.  He resigned with them from the government, again over Catholic Emancipation.  He spent the rest of his life in opposition, dying in 1810.<ref name=\"ODNB\">David Wilkinson, '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29725 Windham, William(1750\u20131810)]', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 14 December 2009.</ref>\n\n==Early life: 1750\u20131778==\nWindham was a member of an ancient [[Norfolk]] family and a great-great-grandson of [[John Wyndham (1558-1645)|Sir John Wyndham]].

According to [[Edmund Malone]], Windham \"was highly distinguished for his application to various studies, for his love of enterprise, for that frank and graceful address, and that honourable deportment, which gave a lustre to his character though every period of his life\".<ref name=\"Rosebery, p. 10\"/> He took his BA degree in 1771, his [[Oxford MA|MA]] on 7 October 1782, and was awarded a DCL at the Duke of Portland's installation as Chancellor.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers.

It contained Windham's confession of faith:\n\n<blockquote>The best, the greatest, the most solemn office I can render in a letter of this sort, is to extort you to a steady contemplation of divine truths, and a sincere endeavour to confirm in yourself that faith, which after various fluctuations I believe to be the true one, and which, independent of evidence, is supported by too great authorities ever to be rejected with confidence.  Whatever may be the diversity of opinion as to the particular nature, I believe [[Jesus|Christ]] to be a person divinely commissioned, and that faith in him affords the fairest hope of propitiating the great author of the world.  Cultivate in your mind this persuasion and dwell upon it till it grows into a principle of action.  May it avail both to the purposes of final salvation.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers.

Vol. I'', p. 19.</ref> On 28 January Windham delivered in Norwich his first public speech, where he spoke against the war, and a few days later he wrote a remonstrance against it which was signed by 5,000 people and was presented to the House of Commons.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 20.</ref> His speech went down well and he was urged to stand for election. Windham stood unsuccessfully for [[w:Norwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Norwich]] in the election of September 1780.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', pp. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nWhen in 1783 the Duke of Portland formed an administration, he appointed Lord Northington as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Northington offered Windham the office of Chief Secretary for Ireland, which he accepted. However, after only four months in the post, Windham resigned under mysterious circumstances.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers.

The same person must, upon all principles of reason, and all views of the Constitution, carry on the Government, as if the King were actually dead\u2014should he again be restored completely to his senses, the case is then equally clear: he must be restored completely to his government\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers.

Upon his return, Windham sent his friend and fellow Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] some books (recommended by a Deputy of the National Assembly) on the general state of public opinion in France in the aftermath of the beginnings of the [[French Revolution]]. Windham wrote to Burke on 15 September, saying: \"My notion has been from the beginning, and is not altered by what I have seen or heard, that the new Constitution will be settled without a struggle. Whether perfect quiet and satisfaction may be established in the country is another question: but it does not appear to me, that there is any near prospect of civil commotion.\u2014Any opinion, however, which I can have upon the subject is, of course, very vague conjecture.\"<ref>Alfred Cobban and Robert A.

Volume VI: July 1789 \u2013 December 1791'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 21.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Henry Flood]] introduced a motion for parliamentary reform on 4 March 1790, Windham famously said: \"What, would Mr. Flood recommend you to repair your house in this hurricane season?\"<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 91.</ref>\n\nAfter reading Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' in November 1790, Windham wrote in his diary: \"Never was there, I suppose, a work so valuable in its kind, or that displayed powers of so extraordinary a sort. It is a work that may seem capable of overturning the National Assembly, and turning the stream of opinion throughout Europe. One would think, that the author of such a work, would be called to the government of his country, by the combined voices of every man in it. What shall be said of the state of things when it is remembered that the writer is a man decried, persecuted, and proscribed; not being much valued, even by his own party, and by half the nation considered as little better than an ingenious madman?\"<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\nWindham travelled to Paris in September 1791 and he was present at the ceremony in the National Assembly where King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] accepted the [[French Constitution of 1791|new constitution]] of France. Windham wrote to Mrs. Crewe that the ceremony was \"necessarily humiliating...there was somewhat too much of \"la nation,\" and somewhat too little of \"le Roi\".\" Windham wished they had been more courteous and added: \"I hope that we shall be the people to keep up a little of the \u201cvielle cour\u201d in our manners, while we lose nothing of the solid advantages and privileges that the new system can promise\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', pp. 99\u2013100.</ref> In May 1792 Windham wrote to a friend on his opposition to parliamentary reform: \"I have in general been far from adverse to the principles an cause of the French Revolution. So much otherwise indeed, that from the beginning almost, Mr. Burke and I have never exchanged a word on the subject. But when an attempt is made to bring the same principles home to us, Principles in a great measure extravagant and false and which at best have no practical application here, I shall ever prove myself as violent an opposer of them as Mr. Burke or any one can be\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 101.</ref>\n\nWindham supported the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|Royalist uprising]] in [[Vend\u00e9e|La Vend\u00e9e]] and he urged the British government to aid them with the aim of restoring the [[House of Bourbon]] to the throne: \"I would, from the beginning, have made this the  principal object of the war\".<ref>J. J. Sack, ''From Jacobite to  Conservative. Reaction and  orthodoxy in  Britain, c. 1760\u20131832''  (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 93.</ref>\n\nIn a speech to the Commons, on 30 April 1792, he declared that he would unite with any body of men \"who were determined to set their faces against every endeavour to subvert the true principles of the constitution\".<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Whig Party and the French Revolution'' (London: Macmillan, 1967), p. 85.</ref> On 13 November Windham and Burke met Pitt and hinted they and their fellow conservative Whigs would support strong measures; however, Pitt desired \"more certain and definite assurances of support from the heads of the party before the meeting of parliament\".<ref>O'Gorman, p. 108.</ref> He still had reservations about completely separating from Fox and he denied in the Commons (on 15 December) that they differed in principles. However, as he said in the Commons on 4 January 1793, he was no longer a systematic opposer of the government.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 116, n. 4.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the execution of Louis XVI, Parliament met in February 1793. Fox and his supporters excused France's actions short of supporting the execution and Fox claimed that the British monarchy was elective and that sovereignty resided with the people. On 9 February war was declared on France and the conservative Whigs met the next day. They decided that a reunion with the Foxites was now out of the question and that they would now call themselves the \u2018Third Party\u2019.<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref> This faction consisted of only approximately 38 MPs (26 of whom were members of the Whig party), with less than one-fifth of the Whigs as members.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 127.</ref>\n\nIn the opinion of the historian Frank O'Gorman, if the Pitt government was to be persuaded to adopt the only anti-Jacobin policies that would be effective, \"Windham was the only politician who might seriously undertake to accomplish these ends\":\n\n<blockquote>He was possessed of distinguished talents and a disposition so compelling as to endear him to all. The power of his intelligence was disguised by his self-effacing manner as a reserve of strength and firmness which he did not in reality possess. His talents and his nature, allied to unquestioned integrity, gave him a reputation and a standing among his contemporaries which was, perhaps, second only to that of Fox. It was not by accident that Windham was able to rally to him some of the most respectable independents in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, he was peculiarly ill-suited to the role which he was now called upon to play in...1793. He was daunted with the prospect of assuming responsibility for matters of state by the doubts and fears which gnawed away at the determination he could summon in his rare moments of enthusiasm and exuberance. Once his energy had been overcome by the exhaustion of his spirits, he would fall away into lethargy, despair and pessimism. Having formed the \u2018Third Party\u2019, he promptly excused himself from leading it. Having committed its members to a distinct support of administration, he escaped to the solitude of Fellbrig, in spite of 'the possibility of having lost an opportunity of distinction'. He consoled his conscience by toying with the preparation of speeches which he never delivered while he ruminated on his inability to act out the part which he himself had chosen.<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 137\u2013138.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 17 June Pitt offered Windham the office of Secretary at War. In a speech in the Commons that same day, Windham supported Pitt, arguing that intervention in French affairs might become a necessity if a government was formed in Paris \"as we might with safety treat with\".<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 144\u2013145.</ref> However, on 19 June he informed Pitt that he would decline his offer, although he added that he might accept office \"sometime hence\".<ref>O'Gorman, p. 146.</ref> From 12 July until 6 August, he was in Flanders. Windham was the contact between the conservative Whigs and the government; however, he was still at this time hesitant about joining Pitt's government.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 148.</ref>\n\nIn January 1794 began the [[1794 Treason Trials|trials]] of the leaders of the British Convention. In response, the radicals proposed another such convention. Therefore, the government decided to arrest leading radicals such as [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]]. On 13 May, the day after Hardy's arrest, the Commons voted to appoint a Committee of Secrecy to devise the measures necessary to counter a new convention. Windham was appointed to the Committee, along with Burke (and other conservative Whigs and government supporters), much to Fox's chagrin.<ref>O'Gorman, pp. 189\u2013190.</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Portland,  on 3 July, urged Windham that, if he took up Pitt's offer of the Secretaryship at War, he could make it \"a real efficient Cabinet employment\". His friend, Tom Grenville, met Windham that day and he succeeded in persuading Windham to accept office. Portland was therefore able to negotiate with the King a coalition government between the conservative Whigs and Pitt's government.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 204.</ref>\n\n==Secretary at War: 1794\u20131801==\n\nHe was  Secretary at War in Pitt's government. Windham managed to gain a few subsidies for the ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'' and achieved Cabinet support for the failed [[Invasion of France (1795)|Quiberon expedition]]. In practice, Windham made himself responsible for all matters related to the Royalists but in the spring of 1796 he relinquished his sole responsibility for this as he was frustrated by the need to constantly refer to other departments when ever he wanted to do something that would help the Royalists. He realised that other Cabinet members did not share his enthusiasm for the Royalist cause and for a Bourbon restoration.<ref name=\"O'Gorman, p. 216\">O'Gorman, p. 216.</ref>\n\nIn late 1795 the government decided to negotiate peace with France and Windham agreed that France remaining a republic should be no obstacle to this.<ref name=\"O'Gorman, p. 216\"/> However, by October 1796, Windham had changed his mind, writing to Mrs Crewe: \"If I could have been sure that [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]]'s despicable embassy would succeed and that peace must be the immediate consequence, I should have been out long since\".<ref>O'Gorman, p. 217.</ref>\n\nIn the dispute between Fitzwilliam and Pitt over Ireland, Windham supported Fitzwilliam and threatened to resign if better policies for governing Ireland were not adopted. Windham acted as the mediator between the two sides.<ref>O'Gorman, p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], Windham supported the [[Acts of Union 1800|union of Ireland with Great Britain]], believing that Catholic emancipation would follow. On 7 February 1801 Windham was among those who resigned in protest at the King's veto of [[Catholic emancipation]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Opposition: 1801\u20131806==\n\nImmediately after the [[Treaty of Amiens|Peace of Amiens]] was signed, the Prime Minister, [[Henry Addington]], wrote to Windham on 1 October 1801: \"I think when I see you...I can satisfy you that it is not clear even upon your own Principles that we are wrong\".<ref>Charles John Fedorak, ''Henry Addington, Prime Minister, 1801\u20131804.  Peace, War and Parliamentary Politics'' (Akron, Ohio: The University  of Akron Press, 2002), p. 73.</ref> Windham replied to Addington on the same day:\n\n<blockquote>I can have no idea of the measure in question but as the commencement of a career which, by an easy descent, and step by step, but at no very distant period, will conduct the country to a situation where, when it looks at last for its independence, it will find that it is already gone. I have no idea how the effect of this measure is ever to be recover'd; Chance may do much, but, according to any conception I can form, the Country has received its death blow.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. I'', p. 173.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the preliminaries of the Treaty were debated in the Commons on 3 November 1801, Windham gave a speech that was, according to [[A. D. Harvey]], the sensation of the evening\".<ref>A. D. Harvey, ''Britain  in the early nineteenth century'' (B T Batsford Ltd, 1978), p. 125.</ref> He said Addington and Lord Hawkesbury \"in a moment of rashness and weakness, have fatally put their hands to this treaty, have signed the death-warrant of their country. They have given it a blow, under which it may languish for a few years, but from which I do not conceive how it is possible for it ever to recover\".<ref>Fedorak, p. 73.</ref> According to ''The Times'' Windham sat on \"the same bench from which Mr. Burke always spoke after separating from Mr. Fox\" and an observer said he spoke \"like the ghost of Burke\". One contemporary said  Windham possessed Burke's insanity without his inspiration.<ref>Harvey, p. 125.</ref> When [[Charles James Fox]] visited France during the Peace of Amiens he conversed with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (on 23 September 1802). Napoleon said he believed Windham's \"talents were mediocre and that he was an unfeeling, unprincipled man\". Fox immediately defended Windham but Napoleon countered: \"It is easy for you who only know public debate. But for me, I detest him and that Pitt who together have attempted my life\". Fox assured Napoleon that \"Mr Pitt and Mr Windham, like every other Englishman, would shrink with horror from the idea of secret assassination\".<ref>Tom Pocock, ''The Terror Before Trafalgar. Nelson, Napoleon and the Secret War'' (John Murray, 2003), pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n[[William Hazlitt]] apparently had it on somewhat good authority that Pitt had hated Windham.<ref>Sack, p. 93.</ref> Windham in turn did not attend Pitt's funeral at Westminster Abbey after his death in January 1806.<ref>The Countess of Minto, ''The Life and Letters of Sir Gilbert Elliott, First Earl of Minto.

Vol. II'', p. 285.</ref>\n\nWindham abolished the ballot for the militia to ensure that only volunteers manned the militia. He also wanted to solve the Army's recruiting shortage by limiting service in the Army to seven years. He increased soldiers' wages from 1 shilling to 1s. 6d. if they re-enlisted after the seven years, and to 2 shillings if they re-enlisted after fourteen years. He also introduced pensions for old soldiers.<ref>Richard Glover, ''Britain at Bay.

Vol. II'', p. 348.</ref> Writing to [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]] in September 1809, Windham voiced his opposition to peace with France, even though Wellington had been driven from Spain back into Portugal. He further argued that \"the great thing that is wanted is resistance to the strides that are making, in concurrence with the general tendency of things throughout the world, to turn the country into a democracy\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', pp. 358\u2013359.</ref>\n\n==Support for Old English sports==\n\nWindham was opposed to the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement and their attempt to outlaw traditional English sports: \"Few subjects agitated...Windham...more than the puritanical and Wilberforcian assault on the traditional sports of Englishmen such as boxing and bull-baiting. Windham's speeches in parliament in defense of such practices seem among his most heart-felt\".<ref>Sack, pp. 205\u2013205.</ref> [[William Wilberforce]] wrote to [[Hannah More]]&mdash;a leading evangelical moralist&mdash;on 15 November 1804: \"I really think there scarcely ever were, or can be, two men more different from each other in all their ideas than Windham and myself\".<ref>Robert Isaac Wilberforce and Samuel Wilberforce (eds.), ''The Correspondence of William Wilberforce: Volume I'' (London: John Murray, 1840), p. 340.</ref> Windham said that Wilberforce would delight in sending aristocrats to the guillotine.<ref>Sack, p. 210.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the British victory over the French at the [[Battle of Talavera]], Windham wrote on the subject of [[boxing]] in a letter to a friend dated 17 August 1809:\n\n<blockquote>Why are we to boast so much of the ''native'' valour of our troops, as shewn at Talavera, at [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeira]], and at [[Battle of Maida|Maida]], yet to discourage all the practices and habits which tend to keep alive the same sentiments and feelings? The sentiments that filled the minds of the three thousand spectators who attended the two pugilists, were just the same in kind as those which inspired the higher combatants on the occasions before enumerated. It is the circumstance only in which they are displayed, that makes the difference. ... Bravery is found in all habits, classes, circumstances, and conditions. But have habits and institutions of one sort no tendency to form it, more than of another? Longevity is found in persons of habits the most opposite: but are not certain habits more favourable to it than others? The courage does not arise from mere boxing, from the mere beating or being beat:\u2014but from the sentiments excited by the contemplation and cultivation of such practices. Will it make no difference in the mass of a people, whether their amusements are all of a pacific, pleasurable, and effeminate nature, or whether they are of a sort that calls forth a continued admiration of prowess and hardihood? But when I get on these topicks, I never know how to stop...<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', pp. 351\u2013352.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 8 July 1809, Windham was returning to [[Pall Mall, London]] from a friend's when he saw a house on fire in Conduit Street. His friend Frederick North lived a few doors away from the burning house and possessed a valuable library. Therefore, with the aid of two or three men, Windham succeeded in removing most of the books before the fire reached North's house. However, when removing some heavy books, he fell and bruised his hip. After a tumour grew in the hip he received medical help but this was ineffectual. On 6 May 1810 the surgeon Henry Cline advised him that an operation was imperative, an opinion shared by four of the six physicians Windham consulted.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', pp.  369\u2013370.</ref> Before the operation Windham went to some trouble to receive the Sacrament.<ref>Cecilia Anne Baring (ed.), ''The Diary of the Right Hon. William Windham. 1784 to 1810'' (London: Longmans, Green & Co., 1866), p. 505.</ref> Cline performed the operation on 17 May and, although it was successful, Windham did not recover from the shock. His last words were to Dr. Lynn, who moved him into a more comfortable position on the night of 3 June: \"I thank you; this is the last trouble I shall give you. You fight the battle well, but it will not do\".<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers. Vol. II'', p. 370.</ref> Not long after, he fell asleep and died in the presence of his wife. On 8 June, Windham's body was transported to the family vault at Felbrigg, with a private funeral. In the church window Windham's widow installed a memorial brass with the inscription:\n\n<blockquote>Sacred to the Memory of the Right Honourable William Windham, of Felbrigge, in this County. Born the 14th of May, O.S. 1750, Died the 4th of June, N.S. 1810. He was the only son of William Windham, esqre., by Sarah, relict of Robert Lukin, esqre. He married in 1798 Cecilia, third daughter of the late Commodore Forrest; who erects this Monument in grateful and tender remembrance of him. During a period of twenty-six years he distinguished himself in Parliament by his eloquence and talents; and was repeatedly called to the highest offices of the State. His views and councils were directed more to raising the glory than increasing the wealth of his country. He was above all things anxious to preserve untainted the National Character, and even those National Manners which long habit had associated with that character. As a Statesman, he laboured to exalt the courage, to improve the comforts, and ennoble the profession of a Soldier: As an individual, he exhibited a model of those qualities which denote the most accomplished and enlightened mind. Frank, generous, unassuming, intrepid, compassionate, and pious, he was so highly respected, even by those from whom he most differed in opinion, that, tho' much of his life had passed in political contention, he was accompanied to the grave by the sincere and unqualified regret of his Sovereign and his Country.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers.

The lineaments of his countenance, though they displayed the ravages of the smallpox, were pleasing, and retained a character of animation, blended with spirit and intelligence. Over his whole figure, nature had thrown an air of mind. His manners corresponded with his external appearance; and his conversation displayed the treasures of a highly cultivated understanding. Ardent in his love of civil liberty, for the preservation of which blessing, I believe, he would as cheerfully have shed his blood as did [[John Hampden|Hampden]] or [[Algernon Sidney|Sidney]]; it was constitutional freedom that he venerated, not a republican and impracticable emancipation from limited monarchial government...To Burke, Windham unquestionably bore some analogy; and on ''his'' shoulders may be said to have descended the mantle of Burke...Windham's talents, brilliant and various as they were, always however appeared to me more adapted to speculative, than to practical life.<ref>Nathaniel William Wraxall, ''Posthumous Memoirs of His Own Time.

[but] he was too often the dupe of his own ingenuity; which made him doubt and balance ... His nature ... was to be a follower, if not a worshipper, rather than an original thinker or actor ... Accordingly, first Johnson in private and afterwards Burke on political matters were the deities whom he adored.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Whig historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]], in his essay on Warren Hastings that he wrote in 1841, praised Windham: \"There, with eyes reverentially fixed on Burke, appeared the finest gentleman of the age, his form developed by every manly exercise, his face beaming with intelligence and spirit, the ingenious, the chivalrous, the high-souled Windham\".<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/hastings/txt_complete.html</ref>\n\n[[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] edited Windham's papers in 1913, and said Windham was:\n\n<blockquote>...the finest English gentleman of his or perhaps of all time.

His best qualities, no doubt, as is often the case, he carried almost to excess; for his cherished independence he led to a morbid craving for isolation. But to the charge of vacillation in public affairs he was not obnoxious; he was always true to his faith. But he chose his masters well, Johnson and Burke; the one gave him his religious, the other his political creed. In life he was brilliant and successful. In oratory, in parliament, in society, he was almost supreme. But he can scarcely be said to survive. He left no stamp, no school, no work. To those, however, who care to disinter his memory he displays character and qualities of excellence, rare at all times, rarest in these.<ref>Rosebery, ''Windham Papers.
