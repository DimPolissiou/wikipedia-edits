Broadly speaking, the standard family belongs to the set of [[Software Asset Management]] (or SAM) standards and is integrated with other [[Management system|Management System Standards]].\n\nISO/IEC 19770 day-to-day management comes under ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7/WG21, or Working Group 21 (WG21) [[Chairman|chaired]] by Ron Brill<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronbrill/|title=Ron Brill|author=|date=|website=linkedin.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> as [[convener]] and Trent Allgood<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/trent-allgood-20a96646/|title=Trent Allgood|author=|date=|website=linkedin.com|accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> as [[Secretary (club)|secretary]]. It is WG21 that is responsible for developing, improving and ensuring market needs are met when developing these standards.\n\n==What is the purpose of ISO 19770?==\n\nThe ISO 19770 standard is a concept of ITAM standardization within an organization incorporating ISO/IEC standards.\n\nThe objective of the standard is to give organizations of all sizes information and assistance to assist at the risk and cost minimization of ITAM assets. Through implementation, these same organizations will acquire a competitive advantage through:\n\n* Management of the risk of interrupted IT service delivery, breach of legal agreements and audit;\n* Reducing overall software costs through the implementation of various processes; and\n* Better information availability leading to improved decision-making based on accurate data.\n\nThe major parts of this ITAM standard are detailed below.\n\n# ISO/IEC 19770-1 is a process framework to enable an organization to prove that it is performing ITAM to a standard sufficient to satisfy [[Corporate governance of information technology|corporate governance]] requirements and ensure effective support for [[IT service management]] overall.\n# ISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification tags (\"SWID\").\n# ISO/IEC 19770-3 provides an ITAM data standard for software entitlements, including usage rights, limitations and metrics (\"ENT\").\n# ISO/IEC 19770-4 provides an ITAM data standard for Resource Utilization Measurement (\"RUM\")\n# ISO/IEC 19770-5 provides the overview and vocabulary.\n\n[[File:19770 Family Block Diagram.jpg|thumb|none|19770 Family Block Diagram]]\n\n==ISO/IEC 19770-1: Processes==\nISO/IEC 19770-1 is a framework of ITAM processes to enable an organization to prove that it is performing software asset management to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall. ISO/IEC 19770-1:2017 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an \u201cIT asset management system\u201d (ITAMS).\n\nWhile ISO 55001:2014 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for asset management, referred to as an \u201casset management system\u201d, it is primarily focused on physical assets with little provision for the management of software assets. There are a number of characteristics of IT assets which create additional or more detailed requirements. As a result of these characteristics of IT assets, the 19770-1 management system for IT assets has explicit additional requirements dealing with:\n\n* controls over software modification, duplication and distribution, with particular emphasis on access and integrity controls;\n* audit trails of authorizations and of changes made to IT assets;\n* controls over licensing, underlicensing, overlicensing, and compliance with licensing terms and conditions;\n* controls over situations involving mixed ownership and responsibilities, such as in cloud computing and with \u2018Bring-Your-Own-Device\u2019 (BYOD) practices; and\n* reconciliation of IT asset management data with data in other information systems when justified by business value, in particular with financial information systems recording assets and expenses.\n\n=== Updates to 19770-1===\n\nThe first generation was published in 2006.\n\nThe second generation was published in 2012. It retained the original content (with only minor changes) but splits the standard up into four tiers which can be attained sequentially. These tiers are:\n\n* Tier 1: Trustworthy Data\n* Tier 2: Practical Management\n* Tier 3: Operational Integration\n* Tier 4: Full ISO/IEC ITAM Conformance\n\n'''ISO 19770-1 Edition 3 (current version)'''\n\nThe most recent version, known as ISO 19770-1:2017 and published in December 2017, specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an IT asset management system. ISO 19770-1:2017 was a major update and was rewrote the standard to conform to the ISO Management System Standards (MSS)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/management-system-standards.html|title=ISO MSS Standards|author=|date=|website=ISO.org|accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> format. The tiered structure from 197701:2012 was moved to an appendix within the updated standard.\n\n'''Intended Users'''\n\nThis document can be used by any organization and can be applied to all types of IT assets. The organization determines to which of its IT assets this document applies.\nThis document is primarily intended for use by:\n* those involved in the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of an IT asset management system;\n* those involved in delivering IT asset management activities, including service providers;\n* internal and external parties to assess the organization\u2019s ability to meet legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and the organization\u2019s own requirements.\n\n=== Preview of 19770-1===\nAn [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-1:ed-3:v1:en overview] of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English<ref>[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-1:ed-3:v1:en]</ref>\n\n==ISO/IEC 19770-2: software identification tag==\nISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification (SWID) tags. Software ID tags provide authoritative identifying information for installed software or other licensable item (such as [[Computer font|fonts]] or copyrighted papers).\n\n=== Overview of SWID tags in use ===\n\nThere are three primary methods that may be used to ensure SWID tags are available on devices with installed software:\n* SWID tags created by a software creator or publisher which are installed with the software are the most authoritative for identification purposes.\n* Organizations can create their own SWID tags for any software title that does not include a tag, allowing the organization to more accurately track software installations in their network environment\n* Third party discovery tools may optionally add tags to a device as software titles are discovered\n\nProviding accurate software identification data improves organizational security, and lowers the cost and increases the capability of many IT processes such as  [[Patch (computing)|patch]] management, desktop management, help desk management, software policy compliance, etc.\n\nDiscovery tools, or processes that utilize SWID tag data to determine the [[Database normalization|normalized]] names and values that are associated with a software application and ensure that all tools and processes used by an organization refer to software products with the same exact names and values.\n\n=== Standards development information ===\n\nThis standard was first published in November 2009.<ref>[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-2:ed-1:v1:en ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009(en)]</ref>  A revision of this standard was published in October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=65666|title=ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 - Information technology -- Software asset management -- Part 2: Software identification tag|author=|date=|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSteve Klos<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/steve-klos|title=Steve Klos|author=|date=|website=linkedin.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> is the editor of 19770-2 and works for 1E, Inc as a SAM Subject Matter Expert.\n\n=== Non-profit organizational support ===\n\nIn 2009, a non-profit organization called TagVault.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagvault.org|title=Home - TagVault.org |website=www.tagvault.org |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> was formed under [[IEEE-ISTO]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee-isto.org|title=IEEE-ISTO|author=|date=|website=IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> to press for using SWID tags. TagVault.org acts as a registration and certification authority for ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags (SWID tags) and will provide tools and services allowing all SAM ecosystem members to take advantage of SWID tags faster, with a lower cost and with more industry compatibility than would otherwise be possible. SWID tags can be created by anyone, so individuals and organizations are not required to be part of TagVault.org to create or distribute tags.\n\n=== Commercial organizational support===\n\nNumerous [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] installation packaging tools utilize SWID tags including:\n* Caphyon's Advanced Installer\n* [[Flexera Software]]'s [[InstallShield]]\n* Flexera Software's [[InstallAnywhere]]\n* [[Open-source license|Open Source]] - [[WiX|Windows Installer XML Toolset (WiX)]]\n\nMany software discovery tools already utilize SWID tags, including [[Altiris]], Aspera SmartCollect, DeskCenter Management Suite, [[Belarc]]'s BelManage, Sassafras Software's K2-KeyServer, Snow Inventory, [[CA, Inc.|CA Technologies]] discovery tools, Eracent's EnterpriseAM, Flexera Software's FlexNet Manager Platform, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP's]] Universal Discovery, [[IBM]] [[Tivoli Endpoint Manager|Endpoint Manager]], [[Microsoft Servers|Microsoft's System Center]] 2012 R2 Configuration Manager, and [[Loginventory]].\n\n[[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] has released multiple versions of their [[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suites]] and  [[Adobe Creative Cloud|Creative Cloud]] products with SWID tags.\n\n[[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] has also released multiple products that include SWID tags and is committed to helping move the software community to a more consistent and normalized approach to software identification and eventually to a more automated approach to compliance.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160628120327/http://digimindcenter.com/symantec/ see]</ref>\n\n[[Microsoft]] Corporation has been adding SWID tags to all new releases of software products since [[Windows 8]] was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/sam/en/us/softwareid.aspx|title=Control.

This equates to approximately 300 product releases a month that include SWID tags.\n\n=== Governmental support ===\n\nThe [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] has identified 19770-2 SWID tags as an important aspect of the efforts necessary to manage compliance, logistics and security software processes. The 19770-2 standard is included on the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] Information Standards Registry (DISR) as an emerging standard as of September 2012.

While the specifications provide many opportunities for improvement in entitlement processes and practices, they must be able to handle existing licensing transactions without imposing requirements which would prevent such transactions being codified into Ent records.\n\n====Maximum possible alignment with the software identification tag specification (ISO/IEC 19770-2)====\n\nThis part of ISO/IEC 19770 (entitlement schema) is intended to align closely with part 2 of the standard (software identification tags). This should facilitate both understanding and their joint use. Furthermore, any of the elements, attributes, or other specifications of part 2 which the ENT creator may wish to utilize may be used in this part as well.\n\n===Stakeholder benefits===\n\nIt is intended that this standardized schema will be of benefit to all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, release, installation, and ongoing management of software and software entitlements.\n\n*Benefits to software licensors who provide  ENTs include, but are not limited to:\n** Immediate software customer recognition of details of the usage rights derived from their software entitlement.\n** Ability to specify details to customers that allow software assets to be measured and reported for license compliance purposes.\n** Increased awareness of software license compliance issues on the part of end-customers.\n** Improved software customer relationships through quicker and more effective license compliance audits.\n*Benefits to SAM tool providers, deployment tool providers, re-sellers, value-added re-sellers, packagers and release managers include, but are not limited to:\n** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors and  ENT creators.\n** More consistent and structured entitlement information, supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing.\n** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of  ENTs.\n** Improved SAM tool entitlement reconciliation capabilities resulting from standardization in location and format of software entitlement data.\n** Ability to deliver value-added functionality for compliance management through the consumption of entitlement data.\n*The benefits for software customers, SAM practitioners, IT support professionals and end users of a given software configuration item include, but are not limited to:\n** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors, resellers and SAM tools providers.\n** More consistent and structured entitlement information supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing.\n** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of  ENTs.\n** Improved SAM and software license compliance capabilities stemming from standardized, software licensor-supplied, ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags to reconcile with these  ENTs.\n** Improved ability to avoid software license under-procurement or over-procurement with subsequent cost optimization.\n** Standardized usage across multiple platforms, rendering heterogeneous computing environments more manageable.\n\nThe [https://www.itassetmanagement.net ITAM Review] developed a podcast with the 19770-3 project editor how end-user organizations can leverage this standard to their benefit.

A RUM is a standardized structure containing usage information about the resources that are related to the use of an IT asset. A RUM will often be provided in an XML data file, but the same information may be accessible through other means depending on the platform and the IT asset/product.\n\nThis document contains information structures that are designed to align with the identification information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-2, and with the entitlement information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-3. When used together, these three types of information have the capability to significantly enhance and automate the processes of IT asset management.\n\nThis document supports the IT asset management processes defined in ISO/IEC 19770-1. This document also supports the other parts of the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards that define information structures.\n\nThe RUM is specifically designed to be general-purpose and usable in a wide variety of situations. Like other information structures defined in the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards, the consumer of a RUM may be an organization and/or a tool or other consumers. In contrast to the other information structures in the ISO/IEC 19770 series, the entity creating a RUM data on a periodic basis will likely be an IT asset or an automation tool monitoring an IT asset.\n\nThe definition of a RUM will benefit all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, releasing, installation, and on-going management of IT assets. Key benefits associated with a RUM for three specific groups of stakeholders include:\n\n'''IT asset users'''\n\u2014 RUM data will typically be generated and processed by IT assets and automation tools, within the consumers enterprise boundary, for purpose of IT asset compliance and optimization;\n\u2014 RUM data is human readable and can provide improved visibility into resource utilization within IT assets independent of vendor or third-party supplied tools;\n\u2014 the ability to combine identification, entitlement, and resource utilization information together to perform quantitative and authoritative IT asset management, for example, to meet compliance requirements;\n\u2014 a much-improved ability to perform IT asset management in support of green data center strategies such as optimization of the use of power and air conditioning;\n\n'''IT asset manufacturers'''\n\u2014 the ability to consistently and authoritatively generate resource utilization information for consumption by a central facility that is maintained by the creator, or one or more third-party tools, or by the IT asset users;\n\u2014 the ability to support multiple instances and types of third-party tools with a single set of functionality within the IT asset;\n\u2014 the ability to offer a service to track real-time IT asset usage in the field and, when combined with identification and entitlement information, the ability to give advance warning as resource limits are approached;\n\u2014 the ability to offer an alternative approach to asset utilization measurement to traditional techniques that employ key-based, or platform-restricted licenses;\n\n'''Tool vendors'''\n\u2014 the ability to support multiple IT assets, and types of IT asset, without having to create and maintain unique instrumentation that is associated with each asset;\n\u2014 the ability to more easily aggregate usage information across multiple instances of an asset;\n\u2014 a much-improved ability to track resource utilization and IT assets in near real-time.\n\n=== Preview ISO/IEC 19770-4: Resource Utilization Measurement ===\n\nAn overview of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-4:ed-1:v1:en here.]\n\n== ISO/IEC 19770-5: overview and vocabulary ==\nISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 provides an overview of ITAM, which is the subject of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards, and defines related terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c055999_ISOIEC_19770-5_2013.zip|title=ISO - International Organization for Standardization|first=ISO - International Organization for|last=Standardization|date=29 September 2006|website=standards.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>  ISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 is applicable to all types of organization (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, non-profit organizations).\n\nISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 contains:\n\n# an overview of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards;\n# an introduction to SAM;\n# a brief description of the foundation principles and approaches on which SAM is based; and\n# consistent terms and definitions for use throughout the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards.\n\n=== Free copy of ISO/IEC 19770-5 ===\nA free copy of the overview and vocabulary is available [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c068291_ISOIEC_19770-5_2015.zip here].\n\n== ISO/IEC 19770-8: Guidelines for mapping of industry practices to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards ==\n\nISO/IEC 19770-8 defines requirements, guidelines, formats and approaches for use when producing a mapping document that defines how industry practices map to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 series.

It is WG21 that is responsible for developing, improving and ensuring market needs are met when developing these standards.\n\n==What is the purpose of ISO 19770?==\n\nThe ISO 19770 standard is a concept of ITAM standardization within an organization incorporating ISO/IEC standards.\n\nThe objective of the standard is to give organizations of all sizes information and assistance to assist at the risk and cost minimization of ITAM assets. Through implementation, these same organizations will acquire a competitive advantage through:\n\n* Management of the risk of interrupted IT service delivery, breach of legal agreements and audit;\n* Reducing overall software costs through the implementation of various processes; and\n* Better information availability leading to improved decision-making based on accurate data.\n\nThe major parts of this ITAM standard are detailed below.\n\n# ISO/IEC 19770-1 is a process framework to enable an organization to prove that it is performing ITAM to a standard sufficient to satisfy [[Corporate governance of information technology|corporate governance]] requirements and ensure effective support for [[IT service management]] overall.\n# ISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification tags (\"SWID\").\n# ISO/IEC 19770-3 provides an ITAM data standard for software entitlements, including usage rights, limitations and metrics (\"ENT\").\n# ISO/IEC 19770-4 provides an ITAM data standard for Resource Utilization Measurement (\"RUM\")\n# ISO/IEC 19770-5 provides the overview and vocabulary.\n\n[[File:19770 Family Block Diagram.jpg|thumb|none|19770 Family Block Diagram]]\n\n==ISO/IEC 19770-1: Processes==\nISO/IEC 19770-1 is a framework of ITAM processes to enable an organization to prove that it is performing software asset management to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall. ISO/IEC 19770-1:2017 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an \u201cIT asset management system\u201d (ITAMS).\n\nWhile ISO 55001:2014 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for asset management, referred to as an \u201casset management system\u201d, it is primarily focused on physical assets with little provision for the management of software assets. There are a number of characteristics of IT assets which create additional or more detailed requirements. As a result of these characteristics of IT assets, the 19770-1 management system for IT assets has explicit additional requirements dealing with:\n\n* controls over software modification, duplication and distribution, with particular emphasis on access and integrity controls;\n* audit trails of authorizations and of changes made to IT assets;\n* controls over licensing, underlicensing, overlicensing, and compliance with licensing terms and conditions;\n* controls over situations involving mixed ownership and responsibilities, such as in cloud computing and with \u2018Bring-Your-Own-Device\u2019 (BYOD) practices; and\n* reconciliation of IT asset management data with data in other information systems when justified by business value, in particular with financial information systems recording assets and expenses.\n\n=== Updates to 19770-1===\n\nThe first generation was published in 2006.\n\nThe second generation was published in 2012. It retained the original content (with only minor changes) but splits the standard up into four tiers which can be attained sequentially. These tiers are:\n\n* Tier 1: Trustworthy Data\n* Tier 2: Practical Management\n* Tier 3: Operational Integration\n* Tier 4: Full ISO/IEC ITAM Conformance\n\n'''ISO 19770-1 Edition 3 (current version)'''\n\nThe most recent version, known as ISO 19770-1:2017 and published in December 2017, specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an IT asset management system. ISO 19770-1:2017 was a major update and was rewrote the standard to conform to the ISO Management System Standards (MSS)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/management-system-standards.html|title=ISO MSS Standards|author=|date=|website=ISO.org|accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> format.

The organization determines to which of its IT assets this document applies.\nThis document is primarily intended for use by:\n* those involved in the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of an IT asset management system;\n* those involved in delivering IT asset management activities, including service providers;\n* internal and external parties to assess the organization\u2019s ability to meet legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and the organization\u2019s own requirements.\n\n=== Preview of 19770-1===\nAn [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-1:ed-3:v1:en overview] of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English<ref>[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-1:ed-3:v1:en]</ref>\n\n==ISO/IEC 19770-2: software identification tag==\nISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification (SWID) tags. Software ID tags provide authoritative identifying information for installed software or other licensable item (such as [[Computer font|fonts]] or copyrighted papers).\n\n=== Overview of SWID tags in use ===\n\nThere are three primary methods that may be used to ensure SWID tags are available on devices with installed software:\n* SWID tags created by a software creator or publisher which are installed with the software are the most authoritative for identification purposes.\n* Organizations can create their own SWID tags for any software title that does not include a tag, allowing the organization to more accurately track software installations in their network environment\n* Third party discovery tools may optionally add tags to a device as software titles are discovered\n\nProviding accurate software identification data improves organizational security, and lowers the cost and increases the capability of many IT processes such as  [[Patch (computing)|patch]] management, desktop management, help desk management, software policy compliance, etc.\n\nDiscovery tools, or processes that utilize SWID tag data to determine the [[Database normalization|normalized]] names and values that are associated with a software application and ensure that all tools and processes used by an organization refer to software products with the same exact names and values.\n\n=== Standards development information ===\n\nThis standard was first published in November 2009.<ref>[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-2:ed-1:v1:en ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009(en)]</ref>  A revision of this standard was published in October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=65666|title=ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 - Information technology -- Software asset management -- Part 2: Software identification tag|author=|date=|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSteve Klos<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/steve-klos|title=Steve Klos|author=|date=|website=linkedin.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> is the editor of 19770-2 and works for 1E, Inc as a SAM Subject Matter Expert.\n\n=== Non-profit organizational support ===\n\nIn 2009, a non-profit organization called TagVault.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagvault.org|title=Home - TagVault.org |website=www.tagvault.org |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> was formed under [[IEEE-ISTO]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee-isto.org|title=IEEE-ISTO|author=|date=|website=IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> to press for using SWID tags. TagVault.org acts as a registration and certification authority for ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags (SWID tags) and will provide tools and services allowing all SAM ecosystem members to take advantage of SWID tags faster, with a lower cost and with more industry compatibility than would otherwise be possible. SWID tags can be created by anyone, so individuals and organizations are not required to be part of TagVault.org to create or distribute tags.\n\n=== Commercial organizational support===\n\nNumerous [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] installation packaging tools utilize SWID tags including:\n* Caphyon's Advanced Installer\n* [[Flexera Software]]'s [[InstallShield]]\n* Flexera Software's [[InstallAnywhere]]\n* [[Open-source license|Open Source]] - [[WiX|Windows Installer XML Toolset (WiX)]]\n\nMany software discovery tools already utilize SWID tags, including [[Altiris]], Aspera SmartCollect, DeskCenter Management Suite, [[Belarc]]'s BelManage, Sassafras Software's K2-KeyServer, Snow Inventory, [[CA, Inc.|CA Technologies]] discovery tools, Eracent's EnterpriseAM, Flexera Software's FlexNet Manager Platform, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP's]] Universal Discovery, [[IBM]] [[Tivoli Endpoint Manager|Endpoint Manager]], [[Microsoft Servers|Microsoft's System Center]] 2012 R2 Configuration Manager, and [[Loginventory]].\n\n[[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] has released multiple versions of their [[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suites]] and  [[Adobe Creative Cloud|Creative Cloud]] products with SWID tags.\n\n[[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] has also released multiple products that include SWID tags and is committed to helping move the software community to a more consistent and normalized approach to software identification and eventually to a more automated approach to compliance.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160628120327/http://digimindcenter.com/symantec/ see]</ref>\n\n[[Microsoft]] Corporation has been adding SWID tags to all new releases of software products since [[Windows 8]] was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/sam/en/us/softwareid.aspx|title=Control.

This equates to approximately 300 product releases a month that include SWID tags.\n\n=== Governmental support ===\n\nThe [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] has identified 19770-2 SWID tags as an important aspect of the efforts necessary to manage compliance, logistics and security software processes. The 19770-2 standard is included on the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] Information Standards Registry (DISR) as an emerging standard as of September 2012. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the [[National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence]] (NCCoE) in 2015 [https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/library/project-descriptions/sam-project-description-final.pdf discussed] the need for SWIDs in the marketplace.<ref>A copy of that presentation is available  [http://www.fbcinc.com/e/cif/presentations/Klos_Waltermire_Unlocking_Organizational_Software_Inventory_Data.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120330/http://www.fbcinc.com/e/cif/presentations/Klos_Waltermire_Unlocking_Organizational_Software_Inventory_Data.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n=== Standards development organization support ===\n\nThe [[Trusted Computing Group]] (TCG) is developing a standard TNC SWID Messages and Attributes for IF-M Specification<ref>[http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_swid_messages_and_attributes_for_ifm_specification TNC SWID Messages and Attributes for IF-M Specification]</ref> that utilizes tag data for security purposes.\n\n[[National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence|The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)]] has documented the Software Asset Management Continuous Monitoring building block<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/SAM.pdf|title=NCCoE|author=|date=|website=nccoe.nist.gov|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> that specifies how SWID tags are used for the near real-time identification of software.\n\n[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] is in the process of creating documentation that specifies how SWID tags will be used by governmental organizations including the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]].

While the specifications provide many opportunities for improvement in entitlement processes and practices, they must be able to handle existing licensing transactions without imposing requirements which would prevent such transactions being codified into Ent records.\n\n====Maximum possible alignment with the software identification tag specification (ISO/IEC 19770-2)====\n\nThis part of ISO/IEC 19770 (entitlement schema) is intended to align closely with part 2 of the standard (software identification tags). This should facilitate both understanding and their joint use. Furthermore, any of the elements, attributes, or other specifications of part 2 which the ENT creator may wish to utilize may be used in this part as well.\n\n===Stakeholder benefits===\n\nIt is intended that this standardized schema will be of benefit to all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, release, installation, and ongoing management of software and software entitlements.\n\n*Benefits to software licensors who provide  ENTs include, but are not limited to:\n** Immediate software customer recognition of details of the usage rights derived from their software entitlement.\n** Ability to specify details to customers that allow software assets to be measured and reported for license compliance purposes.\n** Increased awareness of software license compliance issues on the part of end-customers.\n** Improved software customer relationships through quicker and more effective license compliance audits.\n*Benefits to SAM tool providers, deployment tool providers, re-sellers, value-added re-sellers, packagers and release managers include, but are not limited to:\n** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors and  ENT creators.\n** More consistent and structured entitlement information, supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing.\n** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of  ENTs.\n** Improved SAM tool entitlement reconciliation capabilities resulting from standardization in location and format of software entitlement data.\n** Ability to deliver value-added functionality for compliance management through the consumption of entitlement data.\n*The benefits for software customers, SAM practitioners, IT support professionals and end users of a given software configuration item include, but are not limited to:\n** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors, resellers and SAM tools providers.\n** More consistent and structured entitlement information supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing.\n** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of  ENTs.\n** Improved SAM and software license compliance capabilities stemming from standardized, software licensor-supplied, ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags to reconcile with these  ENTs.\n** Improved ability to avoid software license under-procurement or over-procurement with subsequent cost optimization.\n** Standardized usage across multiple platforms, rendering heterogeneous computing environments more manageable.\n\nThe [https://www.itassetmanagement.net ITAM Review] developed a podcast with the 19770-3 project editor how end-user organizations can leverage this standard to their benefit.

A RUM is a standardized structure containing usage information about the resources that are related to the use of an IT asset. A RUM will often be provided in an XML data file, but the same information may be accessible through other means depending on the platform and the IT asset/product.\n\nThis document contains information structures that are designed to align with the identification information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-2, and with the entitlement information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-3. When used together, these three types of information have the capability to significantly enhance and automate the processes of IT asset management.\n\nThis document supports the IT asset management processes defined in ISO/IEC 19770-1. This document also supports the other parts of the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards that define information structures.\n\nThe RUM is specifically designed to be general-purpose and usable in a wide variety of situations. Like other information structures defined in the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards, the consumer of a RUM may be an organization and/or a tool or other consumers. In contrast to the other information structures in the ISO/IEC 19770 series, the entity creating a RUM data on a periodic basis will likely be an IT asset or an automation tool monitoring an IT asset.\n\nThe definition of a RUM will benefit all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, releasing, installation, and on-going management of IT assets. Key benefits associated with a RUM for three specific groups of stakeholders include:\n\n'''IT asset users'''\n\u2014 RUM data will typically be generated and processed by IT assets and automation tools, within the consumers enterprise boundary, for purpose of IT asset compliance and optimization;\n\u2014 RUM data is human readable and can provide improved visibility into resource utilization within IT assets independent of vendor or third-party supplied tools;\n\u2014 the ability to combine identification, entitlement, and resource utilization information together to perform quantitative and authoritative IT asset management, for example, to meet compliance requirements;\n\u2014 a much-improved ability to perform IT asset management in support of green data center strategies such as optimization of the use of power and air conditioning;\n\n'''IT asset manufacturers'''\n\u2014 the ability to consistently and authoritatively generate resource utilization information for consumption by a central facility that is maintained by the creator, or one or more third-party tools, or by the IT asset users;\n\u2014 the ability to support multiple instances and types of third-party tools with a single set of functionality within the IT asset;\n\u2014 the ability to offer a service to track real-time IT asset usage in the field and, when combined with identification and entitlement information, the ability to give advance warning as resource limits are approached;\n\u2014 the ability to offer an alternative approach to asset utilization measurement to traditional techniques that employ key-based, or platform-restricted licenses;\n\n'''Tool vendors'''\n\u2014 the ability to support multiple IT assets, and types of IT asset, without having to create and maintain unique instrumentation that is associated with each asset;\n\u2014 the ability to more easily aggregate usage information across multiple instances of an asset;\n\u2014 a much-improved ability to track resource utilization and IT assets in near real-time.\n\n=== Preview ISO/IEC 19770-4: Resource Utilization Measurement ===\n\nAn overview of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-4:ed-1:v1:en here.]\n\n== ISO/IEC 19770-5: overview and vocabulary ==\nISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 provides an overview of ITAM, which is the subject of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards, and defines related terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c055999_ISOIEC_19770-5_2013.zip|title=ISO - International Organization for Standardization|first=ISO - International Organization for|last=Standardization|date=29 September 2006|website=standards.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>  ISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 is applicable to all types of organization (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, non-profit organizations).\n\nISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 contains:\n\n# an overview of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards;\n# an introduction to SAM;\n# a brief description of the foundation principles and approaches on which SAM is based; and\n# consistent terms and definitions for use throughout the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards.\n\n=== Free copy of ISO/IEC 19770-5 ===\nA free copy of the overview and vocabulary is available [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c068291_ISOIEC_19770-5_2015.zip here].\n\n== ISO/IEC 19770-8: Guidelines for mapping of industry practices to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards ==\n\nISO/IEC 19770-8 defines requirements, guidelines, formats and approaches for use when producing a mapping document that defines how industry practices map to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 series.

They sought to spread their faith to the native [[Ukrainians#Ethnonym|Ruthenian/Ukrainian]] population, so Slavs were invited to Anabaptist prayer meetings and Bible studies.\n\nThe first Baptist [[baptism]] (or \"baptism by faith\" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in 1864 on the river [[Inhul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kropyvnytskyi]] region), in a [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|German settlement]]. In 1867, the first [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian-speaking]] Baptist communities were organized in that area.

The Buccaneers compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division. The club joined the NFL in {{nfly|1976}} as an [[expansion team]], along with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Tampa Bay played its first season in the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. After the season, the team switched conferences with the Seahawks and became a member of the [[NFC North|NFC Central]] division. During the 2002 league realignment, the Buccaneers joined three former [[NFC West]] teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the [[Malcolm Glazer|Glazer family]], and plays its home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers are the first post-[[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] [[expansion team]] to win a division championship, a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game; all three accomplishments occurred during the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]]. They are also the first team since the merger to complete a winning season when starting 10 or more rookies, which happened in the 2010 season.  In 1976 and 1977, the Buccaneers lost their first 26 games. They would not win their first game in franchise history until Week 13, of 14, in 1977. After a brief winning era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team suffered through 14 consecutive losing seasons. Then, for a 10-year period, they were consistent playoff contenders and won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] at the end of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], but have not yet returned to the Super Bowl.\n\n==\"Tampa Bay\"==\nThe name [[Tampa Bay Area|\"Tampa Bay\"]] is often used to describe a geographic metropolitan area which encompasses the cities around the body of water known as [[Tampa Bay]], including [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] and several smaller cities. Unlike in the case of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], there is no municipality known as \"Tampa Bay\". The \"Tampa Bay\" in the names of local professional sports franchises, such as the Buccaneers, [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Lightning]], [[Tampa Bay Rays|Rays]], [[Tampa Bay Rowdies|Rowdies]], and the former [[Tampa Bay Storm|Storm]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny|Mutiny]], denotes that they represent the entire region, not just the city of Tampa.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to [[Thomas McCloskey|Tom McCloskey]], a construction company owner from [[Philadelphia]]. McCloskey soon entered a financial dispute with the NFL,<ref>Mizell, Hubert. \"Economics chase McCloskey out\". ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''.

In the first, [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the [[1979 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u201322.

The Bucs lost to the Rams 9\u20130. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.\n\nThe Bucs made the playoffs again by winning their division in the [[1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1981 season]]. It came down to a thrilling final game at [[1981 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR [[Kevin House]] and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] sealed the win for the Bucs. In the playoffs, the [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the Bucs, 38\u20130, in the divisional round.\n\nThe [[1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1982 season]] started 0\u20133 for the Bucs, before a [[1982 NFL Players Strike|player's strike]] shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \"Cardiac Kids\" for winning five of their next six games, all in the final moments, to go 5\u20134 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at Dallas, losing 30\u201317. As it turned out, this would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse's ownership.\n\n===1983\u20131996===\nBefore the 1983 season, Williams bolted to the [[United States Football League]] in a salary dispute. The Bucs lost their first nine games of the 1983 season en route to finishing 2\u201314, the first of 12 consecutive seasons with at least ten losses\u2014an NFL record. Included was the drafting of [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Bo Jackson]] with the first pick in the [[1986 NFL Draft|1986 draft]]. Jackson had let it be known that he would never play a down for Hugh Culverhouse at Tampa Bay. Making good on his threat, he opted instead to play baseball for the [[Kansas City Royals]] and would later return for parts of football seasons with the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]]. Along with Williams, who later was a Super Bowl champion QB for Washington, two other Buc quarterbacks during this era led other teams to Super Bowl wins. [[Steve Young]] won with the 49ers and [[Trent Dilfer]] won with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nUnder Culverhouse, the Bucs were one of the NFL's more profitable teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players. Attendance also sagged; at one point the Buccaneers went parts of three whole seasons without having a home game televised locally, and when they did it was more attributed to a strong visiting team with a large following in the area, such as the Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers.\n\n[[Hardy Nickerson]], a future 5-time Pro Bowl linebacker, signed as a free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers. [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], a future Pro Bowl strong safety, was drafted in 1993. In the [[1995 NFL draft]] the Buccaneers drafted two future Hall of Famers: [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]]. Pro Bowl Fullback, [[Mike Alstott]], was drafted the next year in the 1996 draft.\n\n===1994\u20131996===\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a team close to [[bankruptcy]], which surprised many observers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} His son, [[Miami]] attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr., practically forced{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the franchise in Tampa. Interested parties included [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]], the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to [[Baltimore]], as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time.\n\nHowever, in a last-minute surprise, real estate magnate [[Malcolm Glazer]] outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons [[Bryan Glazer|Bryan]], [[Edward Glazer|Edward]], and [[Joel Glazer|Joel]] in charge of the team's financial affairs. He stated that he had every intention of keeping the team in Tampa, but informed area citizens its current stadium deal would not support the record paid amount and that a new stadium would be required. The Glazers convinced [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of what would become [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nThe Glazers' deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team\u2013in Tampa Bay\u2013finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator [[Tony Dungy]] as head coach, jettisoned the old uniform designs (see below).\n\n===1996\u20132001: Tony Dungy era===\nDuring [[1996 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Dungy's first season in 1996]], the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1\u20138. But in the second half of the season they finished 5\u20132, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by [[Hardy Nickerson]] and the maturing of Sam Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his [[Football coverage shells#Cover 2|Cover 2]] defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by [[defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]] and linebackers coach [[Lovie Smith]], became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Dungy to Join Buccaneers Ring of Honor|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/tony-dungy-to-join-buccaneers-ring-of-honor-20639092|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=February 4, 2019|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the [[Tampa 2]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Varley|first=Teresa|title=Tony Dungy credits Chuck Noll with his defensive philosophy|url=http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Steelers.com|date=January 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209171311/http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|archive-date=February 9, 2007|access-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has been brought to the [[Chicago Bears]] by Smith, [[Detroit Lions]] by Rod Marinelli, [[Kansas City Chiefs]] by [[Herman Edwards]] and to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.\n\nThe team started the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1997 season]] 5\u20130, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 September 8, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122458/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|title=SI.com \u2013 September 29, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122508/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref>  The Bucs went 10\u20136 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team.

They lost at [[Lambeau Field]] to the eventual NFC champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 21\u20137.

On the strength of the NFL's number 3 overall defense and a performance by rookie QB [[Shaun King (American football)|Shaun King]], the Bucs finished the season with an 11\u20135 record and won their third NFC Central Division Championship.

The Bucs' loss was controversial, highlighted by the reversal of a pass from King to WR [[Bert Emanuel]], which ended the Bucs' chances at continuing their last-minute drive. In league meetings following the season, the NFL changed the rules regarding what constituted an [[incomplete pass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2000/03/28/meetings_celebrations_ap/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120731052158/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2000/03/28/meetings_celebrations_ap/|url-status=dead|title=CNNSI.com - NFL Football - NFL competition committee advises reducing\u2026|author=|date=July 31, 2012|archivedate=July 31, 2012|website=archive.is|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Bucs played well in [[2000 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2000]] and [[2001 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2001]] and made the playoffs in each season, they were unable to fulfill their primary goal of a Super Bowl victory.

Several potential candidates were offered the job, including [[University of Florida]] head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) [[Steve Spurrier]], former [[New York Giants]] head coach [[Bill Parcells]], and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]]. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer\u2014the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise.

The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was [[Jon Gruden]]; however, he was still under contract with the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nWhile talks with the Raiders were secretly under way, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]].

This was their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance, with their last being in the 2007 season. Also, the Bucs finished last in the NFC South for the seventh time in nine seasons.\n\nThe Bucs began the 2018 season 2\u20130 for the first time since the [[2010 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2010 season]]. Journeyman quarterback [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] started the first two games after Jameis Winston was suspended during the off-season for the first three games. Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards and 4 touchdowns in the two-game winning streak, coming against the Saints (the eventual NFC South winner) and the Eagles (the defending [[Super Bowl LII|Super Bowl champions]]). Fitzpatrick would continue the success in week 3's Monday night game against the Steelers, throwing for another 400 yards and becoming the first player in NFL history to throw for 400 or more yards in three consecutive games. After Winston's suspension was up following the Monday Night game, Fitzpatrick remained the starter for week 4's matchup against the Bears. Fitzpatrick struggled and was benched after halftime for Winston. Winston returned as the starter in week 6. Despite the quarterback controversy, the Bucs had a top 3 offense, averaging 27.8 points during the first six games. However, their defense continued to struggle. After week 6's loss to the Falcons, defensive coordinator [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] was fired and linebackers coach [[Mark Duffner]] was named the interim defensive coordinator. After a close overtime win against the Browns, Winston threw four interceptions against the Bengals the following week. After returning from suspension, Winston threw at least two interceptions per game, and due to that, Fitzpatrick was once again named the starter in week 9. Fitzpatrick, again, struggled, and Winston was renamed the starter for week 12's game against the 49ers. Winston improved, and the team won two straight. However, they dropped their last four games. After a second consecutive last-place season where the team finished with a 5\u201311 record, Koetter was fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25649986/dirk-koetter-tampa-bay-buccaneers-head-coach |title=Dirk Koetter out as Bucs coach after going 5-11 in 3rd season |last=Laine |first=Jenna |date=December 30, 2018 |website=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====2019\u2013present: Bruce Arians era, \"TB\" to TB====\nFollowing the termination of [[Dirk Koetter]], the Buccaneers named [[Bruce Arians]] as the 12th head coach in franchise history on January 8, 2019.

It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end [[Lee Roy Selmon]] with their first pick ever in 1976. Three Buccaneer players have been named the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|AP Defensive Player of the Year]], and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions. The 2002 Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the number one Defense that year and it was one of the Greatest NFL Defenses of All Time along  with the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2015 Broncos. All four of the Buccaneers [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductees are defensive players or coaches. \n===1978\u20131982===\nLed by Selmon, Linebackers [[Dewey Selmon]], [[Richard Wood (American football)|Richard Wood]], [[Dave Lewis (linebacker)|Dave Lewis]], and [[Mike Washington]], [[Mark Cotney]], and [[Cedric Brown]] in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team. Their 3\u20134 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the [[Super Bowl]] as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9\u20130 loss to the [[Los Angeles Rams]].\n\n===1997\u20132008: The Tampa 2===\n{{main|Tampa 2}}\nThe team drafted franchise cornerstones [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] in 1993, and [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]] in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]]. That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator [[Monte Kiffin]] in 1996. The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history. From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league's top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts. Kiffin along with head coach [[Tony Dungy]] created the \"[[Tampa 2]]\" defense, a modified version of the established [[Cover 2]] scheme.\n\nKiffin's defenses were known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have come close to the success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers, [[Derrick Brooks]] and [[Warren Sapp]], and Pro Bowlers, [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Hardy Nickerson]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Donnie Abraham]], and [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] MVP [[Dexter Jackson (safety)|Dexter Jackson]]. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the [[National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team|1990s All-Decade 2nd Team]] while the [[National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team|2000s All-Decade Team]] featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.\n\n====2002 defense====\n[[File:Tampabaybucsplayersreunion.JPG|thumb|175px|Players from the 2002 team along with head coach Jon Gruden]]\nThe 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 2015 Broncos, 1976 Steelers, and few others. In the regular season Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). [[Derrick Brooks]] was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12\u20134 regular season. The team was even better in the postseason allowing only 37 points in three games combined \u2013 all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes \u2013 returning 4 for touchdowns \u2013 and collected 11 sacks.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], the Buccaneers delivered one of the most impressive defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Playing against the #1 offense in the league led by league MVP [[Rich Gannon]], the defense actually outscored the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] offense, allowing 2 offensive touchdowns while returning 3 interceptions for touchdowns. The defense set two records in the 48\u201321 blowout, one for most interceptions in a Super Bowl (5), and one for most interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl (3). In 19 total games in 2002, the Buccaneers recorded 40 interceptions, 53 sacks, and 9 defensive touchdowns.\n\n==Team facilities==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width =\n | image1 = Tampa Stadium1.jpg\n | width1 = 227\n | caption1 = [[Tampa Stadium]], where the Buccaneers played for their first 22 seasons\n | image2 = Raymond James Stadium01.jpg\n | width2 = 201\n | caption2 = [[Raymond James Stadium]], where the Buccaneers play\n}}\nSince 1998 the Buccaneers have played their home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa.

The team utilized the unspectacular facility through the 1990s and into the early 2000s. As other NFL clubs began replacing and upgrading their respective facilities, Buccaneers players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the constant aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms, and decrepit condition of One Buc Place. Then-head coach Jon Gruden sarcastically referred to the facility as \"The Woodshed\", and some of the coaches' offices were actually converted broom [[closet]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/18/news_pf/Bucs/Time_to_say_goodbye.shtml|title=Time to say goodbye|publisher=St. Pete Times|first=Rick|last=Stroud|date=August 18, 2006|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> For much of the team's existence, the Buccaneers held [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] on the [[University of Tampa]] campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex|Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex]] near Orlando (2002\u20132008).\n\n[[File:Raymond James Stadium03.jpg|thumb|175px|The pirate ship at Raymond James Stadium]]\nIn August 2006, the Buccaneers unveiled a new $30 million training facility. Conveniently located across the street from [[Raymond James Stadium]] (on the former site of [[Tampa Bay Center]]), the state-of-the-art ({{convert|145000|sqft|adj=on}} facility on {{convert|33|acre}}) is one of the largest in the NFL. Its features include offices and meeting rooms, three natural grass practice fields, a theater for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a fully equipped kitchen and dining room, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. An indoor practice field, featuring artificial turf, was completed in 2017.

The flagpole was another larger sabre. The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, ''Totally Gothic'', and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white.

This new color scheme loosely resembled that of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], the [[United States Football League|USFL]] team that played in the region during their three-season existence from 1983 to 1985 and had a color scheme of red, silver, black and white.\n\nThe new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during preseason and early regular season games, while the red-on-white combination has been used much less sparingly. The red-on-white has been used for some prime time home games, and other selected home games. Most games, home and away, have utilized pewter trousers.\n\nIn {{nfly|2003}}, the Buccaneers introduced a practice jersey that featured orange piping. In {{nfly|2004}}, a pewter practice jersey was used, with numerals in the ''Totally Gothic'' font. For 2005, the uniform featured a patch commemorating the club's 30th season.\n\nLike many other NFL teams located in [[subtropical climate]]s, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white road jerseys at home during the first half of the season \u2013 forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] games. The west sideline is in the shade. In {{nfly|1989}}, the Buccaneers started to wear white at home to accommodate [[Vinny Testaverde]]'s color blindness.

During the preseason, the Buccaneers usually wear white for their home games. The Buccaneers have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match up against the [[New York Giants|Giants]]. The Buccaneers wore white that day instead, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high.

The Buccaneers compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division. The club joined the NFL in {{nfly|1976}} as an [[expansion team]], along with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Tampa Bay played its first season in the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. After the season, the team switched conferences with the Seahawks and became a member of the [[NFC North|NFC Central]] division. During the 2002 league realignment, the Buccaneers joined three former [[NFC West]] teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the [[Malcolm Glazer|Glazer family]], and plays its home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers are the first post-[[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] [[expansion team]] to win a division championship, a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game; all three accomplishments occurred during the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]]. They are also the first team since the merger to complete a winning season when starting 10 or more rookies, which happened in the 2010 season.  In 1976 and 1977, the Buccaneers lost their first 26 games. They would not win their first game in franchise history until Week 13, of 14, in 1977. After a brief winning era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team suffered through 14 consecutive losing seasons. Then, for a 10-year period, they were consistent playoff contenders and won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] at the end of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], but have not yet returned to the Super Bowl.\n\n==\"Tampa Bay\"==\nThe name [[Tampa Bay Area|\"Tampa Bay\"]] is often used to describe a geographic metropolitan area which encompasses the cities around the body of water known as [[Tampa Bay]], including [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] and several smaller cities. Unlike in the case of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], there is no municipality known as \"Tampa Bay\". The \"Tampa Bay\" in the names of local professional sports franchises, such as the Buccaneers, [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Lightning]], [[Tampa Bay Rays|Rays]], [[Tampa Bay Rowdies|Rowdies]], and the former [[Tampa Bay Storm|Storm]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny|Mutiny]], denotes that they represent the entire region, not just the city of Tampa.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to [[Thomas McCloskey|Tom McCloskey]], a construction company owner from [[Philadelphia]]. McCloskey soon entered a financial dispute with the NFL,<ref>Mizell, Hubert. \"Economics chase McCloskey out\". ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. December 6, 1974</ref> so the league found a replacement in [[Hugh Culverhouse]], a wealthy [[tax law|tax attorney]] from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. Culverhouse's handshake deal to purchase the [[Los Angeles Rams]] from the estate of [[Dan Reeves (NFL owner)|Dan Reeves]] was thwarted by [[Robert Irsay]]'s purchase of the team, which he then traded to [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] in exchange for the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]], a complete trade of teams between two owners. Culverhouse filed antitrust lawsuits in which he accused the NFL of conspiracy for preventing his purchase of the Rams, and as part of his settlement with the league, he was given priority when the NFL expanded soon thereafter.<ref>Zier, Patrick, and Bill Clark.  \"Bucs' Ownership Part Of Settlement?\".

The following year, they were moved to the [[NFC North|NFC Central]], while the other 1976 expansion team, the [[Seattle Seahawks]], switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Answer Man, Series 2, Vol. 18|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/the-answer-man-series-2-vol-18-2145514|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=June 20, 2005|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their [[1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|second season]], starting with a record of 0\u201326 (though the Bucs had beaten the [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], 17\u20133, in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season).<ref>Underwood, John. \"A Three-hour Time Difference\".

In the first, [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the [[1979 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u201322. STP was wasted again the following week as the Bucs were shut out 14\u20130 by the [[1979 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], and in [[O. J. Simpson]]'s final home game in [[1979 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]], Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which came in with a 1\u201313 record. However, in the season finale at home against the [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history, Tampa Bay pulled out a 3\u20130 victory. Finishing with a 10\u20136 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Bears. In an upset, the Bucs defeated the [[1979 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 24\u201317 in the divisional round of the [[NFL playoffs, 1979-80|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 January 7, 1980|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064908/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|archivedate=June 12, 2007|df=}}</ref> Because the [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[1979 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the [[NFC Championship Game]] the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9\u20130. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.\n\nThe Bucs made the playoffs again by winning their division in the [[1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1981 season]]. It came down to a thrilling final game at [[1981 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR [[Kevin House]] and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] sealed the win for the Bucs. In the playoffs, the [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the Bucs, 38\u20130, in the divisional round.\n\nThe [[1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1982 season]] started 0\u20133 for the Bucs, before a [[1982 NFL Players Strike|player's strike]] shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \"Cardiac Kids\" for winning five of their next six games, all in the final moments, to go 5\u20134 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at Dallas, losing 30\u201317. As it turned out, this would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse's ownership.\n\n===1983\u20131996===\nBefore the 1983 season, Williams bolted to the [[United States Football League]] in a salary dispute. The Bucs lost their first nine games of the 1983 season en route to finishing 2\u201314, the first of 12 consecutive seasons with at least ten losses\u2014an NFL record. Included was the drafting of [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Bo Jackson]] with the first pick in the [[1986 NFL Draft|1986 draft]]. Jackson had let it be known that he would never play a down for Hugh Culverhouse at Tampa Bay. Making good on his threat, he opted instead to play baseball for the [[Kansas City Royals]] and would later return for parts of football seasons with the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]]. Along with Williams, who later was a Super Bowl champion QB for Washington, two other Buc quarterbacks during this era led other teams to Super Bowl wins. [[Steve Young]] won with the 49ers and [[Trent Dilfer]] won with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nUnder Culverhouse, the Bucs were one of the NFL's more profitable teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players. Attendance also sagged; at one point the Buccaneers went parts of three whole seasons without having a home game televised locally, and when they did it was more attributed to a strong visiting team with a large following in the area, such as the Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers.\n\n[[Hardy Nickerson]], a future 5-time Pro Bowl linebacker, signed as a free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers. [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], a future Pro Bowl strong safety, was drafted in 1993. In the [[1995 NFL draft]] the Buccaneers drafted two future Hall of Famers: [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]]. Pro Bowl Fullback, [[Mike Alstott]], was drafted the next year in the 1996 draft.\n\n===1994\u20131996===\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a team close to [[bankruptcy]], which surprised many observers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} His son, [[Miami]] attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr., practically forced{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the franchise in Tampa. Interested parties included [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]], the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to [[Baltimore]], as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time.\n\nHowever, in a last-minute surprise, real estate magnate [[Malcolm Glazer]] outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons [[Bryan Glazer|Bryan]], [[Edward Glazer|Edward]], and [[Joel Glazer|Joel]] in charge of the team's financial affairs. He stated that he had every intention of keeping the team in Tampa, but informed area citizens its current stadium deal would not support the record paid amount and that a new stadium would be required. The Glazers convinced [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of what would become [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nThe Glazers' deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team\u2013in Tampa Bay\u2013finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator [[Tony Dungy]] as head coach, jettisoned the old uniform designs (see below).\n\n===1996\u20132001: Tony Dungy era===\nDuring [[1996 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Dungy's first season in 1996]], the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1\u20138. But in the second half of the season they finished 5\u20132, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by [[Hardy Nickerson]] and the maturing of Sam Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his [[Football coverage shells#Cover 2|Cover 2]] defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by [[defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]] and linebackers coach [[Lovie Smith]], became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Dungy to Join Buccaneers Ring of Honor|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/tony-dungy-to-join-buccaneers-ring-of-honor-20639092|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=February 4, 2019|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the [[Tampa 2]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Varley|first=Teresa|title=Tony Dungy credits Chuck Noll with his defensive philosophy|url=http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Steelers.com|date=January 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209171311/http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|archive-date=February 9, 2007|access-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has been brought to the [[Chicago Bears]] by Smith, [[Detroit Lions]] by Rod Marinelli, [[Kansas City Chiefs]] by [[Herman Edwards]] and to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.\n\nThe team started the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1997 season]] 5\u20130, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 September 8, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122458/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|title=SI.com \u2013 September 29, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122508/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref>  The Bucs went 10\u20136 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team. In the Bucs' final home game at [[Houlihan's Stadium]] (formerly Tampa Stadium), the team defeated the [[1997 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] 20\u201310. They lost at [[Lambeau Field]] to the eventual NFC champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 21\u20137. Still, there was reason for optimism, and the expectations were high for the following season.\n\nThe [[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1998 season]], the first to be played in the newly constructed [[Raymond James Stadium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raymondjamesstadium.com/stadium-history/|title=Stadium History \u2013 Raymond James Stadium|author=|date=|website=raymondjamesstadium.com|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> saw the Bucs lose several close games en route to a disappointing 8\u20138 record. The Bucs had to play the first 6 football games of the year (including preseason) on the road as the new stadium was not quite finished.\n\nThe [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1999 season]] brought much better fortune. On the strength of the NFL's number 3 overall defense and a performance by rookie QB [[Shaun King (American football)|Shaun King]], the Bucs finished the season with an 11\u20135 record and won their third NFC Central Division Championship. They beat [[1999 Washington Redskins season|Washington]] 14\u201313 in the Divisional round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl Champion [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in a low-scoring NFC Championship Game, 11\u20136. The Bucs' loss was controversial, highlighted by the reversal of a pass from King to WR [[Bert Emanuel]], which ended the Bucs' chances at continuing their last-minute drive. In league meetings following the season, the NFL changed the rules regarding what constituted an [[incomplete pass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2000/03/28/meetings_celebrations_ap/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120731052158/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2000/03/28/meetings_celebrations_ap/|url-status=dead|title=CNNSI.com - NFL Football - NFL competition committee advises reducing\u2026|author=|date=July 31, 2012|archivedate=July 31, 2012|website=archive.is|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Bucs played well in [[2000 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2000]] and [[2001 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2001]] and made the playoffs in each season, they were unable to fulfill their primary goal of a Super Bowl victory. The wild card spots that Tampa Bay earned forced them to go on the road for their postseason opener in each year, and both road games took them into frigid Philadelphia to play the Eagles. The two losses also continued an unusual losing streak for Tampa Bay: they remained winless all-time in games played when the temperature was less than 32&nbsp;\u00b0F (0&nbsp;\u00b0C).{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===2002\u20132008: Jon Gruden era ===\n{{further|2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season}}\n[[File:Jon Gruden2.jpg|thumbnail|[[Jon Gruden]] coached the Buccaneers to a [[Super Bowl]] win in 2002.]]\nDungy was fired by the Buccaneers following a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles 31\u20139 in the Wildcard Round of 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Bucs-fire-coach-Tony-Dungy/16651011067698/|title=Bucs fire coach Tony Dungy|author=|date=|website=UPI|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> and soon thereafter hired as the head coach of the [[Indianapolis Colts]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/23/sports/pro-football-dungy-will-sign-contract-with-colts.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Dungy Will Sign Contract With Colts|first=The Associated|last=Press|date=January 23, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> while the Bucs mounted a prolonged and much-maligned{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} search for his replacement. Several potential candidates were offered the job, including [[University of Florida]] head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) [[Steve Spurrier]], former [[New York Giants]] head coach [[Bill Parcells]], and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]]. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer\u2014the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise. Bucs' general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis. The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was [[Jon Gruden]]; however, he was still under contract with the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nWhile talks with the Raiders were secretly under way, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]]. Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and their general manager, Raiders owner [[Al Davis]] agreed to release Gruden to Tampa Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/19/sports/pro-football-buccaneers-get-gruden-but-pay-a-steep-price.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Buccaneers Get Gruden, But Pay a Steep Price|first=Buster|last=Olney|date=February 19, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Glazers' shrewd move eventually paid off in acquiring Gruden, but it was costly. The team hired Gruden away from the Raiders on February 20, 2002, but the price was four [[Draft (sports)|draft]] picks, including the Bucs' first and second round picks in 2002, their first round pick in 2003, and their second round selection in 2004, along with $8 million in cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/sports/pro-football-raiders-get-a-pirate-s-booty-for-gruden.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Raiders Get a Pirate's Booty for Gruden|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=February 24, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>  (The league as a result prohibited any further trading of draft picks for coaches.) Gruden was frustrated by the limitation of his coaching authority by Davis and was more than pleased to return to Tampa Bay.

St. Petersburg Times. February 19, 2002</ref>\n\nUpon his arrival in Tampa, Gruden immediately went to work, retooling a sluggish offense, changing over 50% of the starting offense. With a new Tailback, Wide Receiver, Two Tight Ends, Left Tackle, and Left Guard, Gruden put his stamp on the teams offense to remove the term \"Dungy's Team\" label.

Tampa Bay entered the game as heavy underdogs and fell behind early. However, the Bucs persevered and took a ten-point lead into the fourth quarter.

However, during the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2003 season]], the Gruden-McKay relationship deteriorated as the Bucs struggled on the field.

After a loss to the Detroit Lions, they were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs with a 4\u20139 record. The Bucs finished the season 5-11. This was their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance, with their last being in the 2007 season. Also, the Bucs finished last in the NFC South for the seventh time in nine seasons.\n\nThe Bucs began the 2018 season 2\u20130 for the first time since the [[2010 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2010 season]]. Journeyman quarterback [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] started the first two games after Jameis Winston was suspended during the off-season for the first three games. Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards and 4 touchdowns in the two-game winning streak, coming against the Saints (the eventual NFC South winner) and the Eagles (the defending [[Super Bowl LII|Super Bowl champions]]). Fitzpatrick would continue the success in week 3's Monday night game against the Steelers, throwing for another 400 yards and becoming the first player in NFL history to throw for 400 or more yards in three consecutive games. After Winston's suspension was up following the Monday Night game, Fitzpatrick remained the starter for week 4's matchup against the Bears. Fitzpatrick struggled and was benched after halftime for Winston. Winston returned as the starter in week 6. Despite the quarterback controversy, the Bucs had a top 3 offense, averaging 27.8 points during the first six games. However, their defense continued to struggle. After week 6's loss to the Falcons, defensive coordinator [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] was fired and linebackers coach [[Mark Duffner]] was named the interim defensive coordinator. After a close overtime win against the Browns, Winston threw four interceptions against the Bengals the following week. After returning from suspension, Winston threw at least two interceptions per game, and due to that, Fitzpatrick was once again named the starter in week 9. Fitzpatrick, again, struggled, and Winston was renamed the starter for week 12's game against the 49ers. Winston improved, and the team won two straight. However, they dropped their last four games. After a second consecutive last-place season where the team finished with a 5\u201311 record, Koetter was fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25649986/dirk-koetter-tampa-bay-buccaneers-head-coach |title=Dirk Koetter out as Bucs coach after going 5-11 in 3rd season |last=Laine |first=Jenna |date=December 30, 2018 |website=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====2019\u2013present: Bruce Arians era, \"TB\" to TB====\nFollowing the termination of [[Dirk Koetter]], the Buccaneers named [[Bruce Arians]] as the 12th head coach in franchise history on January 8, 2019.

It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end [[Lee Roy Selmon]] with their first pick ever in 1976. Three Buccaneer players have been named the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|AP Defensive Player of the Year]], and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions. The 2002 Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the number one Defense that year and it was one of the Greatest NFL Defenses of All Time along  with the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2015 Broncos. All four of the Buccaneers [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductees are defensive players or coaches. \n===1978\u20131982===\nLed by Selmon, Linebackers [[Dewey Selmon]], [[Richard Wood (American football)|Richard Wood]], [[Dave Lewis (linebacker)|Dave Lewis]], and [[Mike Washington]], [[Mark Cotney]], and [[Cedric Brown]] in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team. Their 3\u20134 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the [[Super Bowl]] as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9\u20130 loss to the [[Los Angeles Rams]].\n\n===1997\u20132008: The Tampa 2===\n{{main|Tampa 2}}\nThe team drafted franchise cornerstones [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] in 1993, and [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]] in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]]. That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator [[Monte Kiffin]] in 1996. The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history. From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league's top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts. Kiffin along with head coach [[Tony Dungy]] created the \"[[Tampa 2]]\" defense, a modified version of the established [[Cover 2]] scheme.\n\nKiffin's defenses were known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have come close to the success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers, [[Derrick Brooks]] and [[Warren Sapp]], and Pro Bowlers, [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Hardy Nickerson]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Donnie Abraham]], and [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] MVP [[Dexter Jackson (safety)|Dexter Jackson]]. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the [[National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team|1990s All-Decade 2nd Team]] while the [[National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team|2000s All-Decade Team]] featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.\n\n====2002 defense====\n[[File:Tampabaybucsplayersreunion.JPG|thumb|175px|Players from the 2002 team along with head coach Jon Gruden]]\nThe 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 2015 Broncos, 1976 Steelers, and few others. In the regular season Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). [[Derrick Brooks]] was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12\u20134 regular season. The team was even better in the postseason allowing only 37 points in three games combined \u2013 all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes \u2013 returning 4 for touchdowns \u2013 and collected 11 sacks.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], the Buccaneers delivered one of the most impressive defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Playing against the #1 offense in the league led by league MVP [[Rich Gannon]], the defense actually outscored the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] offense, allowing 2 offensive touchdowns while returning 3 interceptions for touchdowns. The defense set two records in the 48\u201321 blowout, one for most interceptions in a Super Bowl (5), and one for most interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl (3). In 19 total games in 2002, the Buccaneers recorded 40 interceptions, 53 sacks, and 9 defensive touchdowns.\n\n==Team facilities==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width =\n | image1 = Tampa Stadium1.jpg\n | width1 = 227\n | caption1 = [[Tampa Stadium]], where the Buccaneers played for their first 22 seasons\n | image2 = Raymond James Stadium01.jpg\n | width2 = 201\n | caption2 = [[Raymond James Stadium]], where the Buccaneers play\n}}\nSince 1998 the Buccaneers have played their home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa.

The team utilized the unspectacular facility through the 1990s and into the early 2000s. As other NFL clubs began replacing and upgrading their respective facilities, Buccaneers players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the constant aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms, and decrepit condition of One Buc Place. Then-head coach Jon Gruden sarcastically referred to the facility as \"The Woodshed\", and some of the coaches' offices were actually converted broom [[closet]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/18/news_pf/Bucs/Time_to_say_goodbye.shtml|title=Time to say goodbye|publisher=St. Pete Times|first=Rick|last=Stroud|date=August 18, 2006|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> For much of the team's existence, the Buccaneers held [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] on the [[University of Tampa]] campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex|Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex]] near Orlando (2002\u20132008).\n\n[[File:Raymond James Stadium03.jpg|thumb|175px|The pirate ship at Raymond James Stadium]]\nIn August 2006, the Buccaneers unveiled a new $30 million training facility. Conveniently located across the street from [[Raymond James Stadium]] (on the former site of [[Tampa Bay Center]]), the state-of-the-art ({{convert|145000|sqft|adj=on}} facility on {{convert|33|acre}}) is one of the largest in the NFL. Its features include offices and meeting rooms, three natural grass practice fields, a theater for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a fully equipped kitchen and dining room, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. An indoor practice field, featuring artificial turf, was completed in 2017. In 2009, the team began holding training camp at the new upgraded facilities in Tampa.\n\nIn the second week of September 2007, statues of important figures from the Bucs 2002 championship season were moved into the lobby area in an exhibit called \"Moment of Victory\". The life-size statues included players [[Mike Alstott]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Derrick Brooks]], [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]], [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Warren Sapp]], and head coach [[Jon Gruden]].

Home uniforms included orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in red\u2014the now-infamous \"[[Creamsicle]]\" uniforms. Road white jerseys originally had orange numerals outlined in red, but these colors were reversed for year two and beyond. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes.\n\nLong-time ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' cartoonist and [[Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla]] member [[Lamar Sparkman]] designed the first team logo.<ref>Gershman, Rick. \"101 Gasparilla\".

[[Beloit College]], located in Beloit, Wisconsin, received a notice from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the college's illegitimate use of their mascot. Beloit College's buccaneer is the mirror image of the Tampa Bay buccaneer, with the creamsicle colors replaced with Beloit's school colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mascotdb.com/team.php?id=40206 |title=Beloit College Buccaneers |publisher=MASCOTdb.com |date= |access-date=September 3, 2012}}</ref> Athletic Director Ed DeGeorge said Beloit's Buccaneers have used the logo since the early 1980s, when he chose it from a book while ordering decals for the football team's helmets. The NFL's Buccaneers joined the league in 1976.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, the Buccaneers withdrew their claim against Beloit College because of the independent decision to redesign the logo.\n\nIn 1992, the Buccaneers introduced orange pants to be worn with the white jerseys. Prior to the team's season finale in 1995 against the [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], coach [[Sam Wyche]] suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange pants with their orange jerseys.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]].\n\nFor the 1993 season, following Culverhouse's death, the Buccaneers added a commemorative patch to the right sleeve of their orange away uniforms, which read  \"Mr C\" in cursive script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|title=Collecting game-worn Buccaneer jerseys|author=Jake Jahimiak|date=May 2010|work=Bucpower.com|accessdate=December 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928051240/http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132013===\n[[File:NFCS-Uniform-TB.png|thumb|left|250px|Buccaneer uniforms worn in the [[2012 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2012 season]], including the throwback orange uniform]]\n[[File:TBHelmet.jpg|thumbnail|Buccaneer helmet worn from 1997 to 2013]]\nFor the {{nfly|1997}} season, the Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image. The Buccaneers changed their team colors to red, [[pewter]], black, and orange. \"Bucco Bruce\" was replaced by a red wind-swept flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed [[sabre]]s which is a modified [[Jolly Roger]] (similar to that of [[Calico Jack]]). The flagpole was another larger sabre. The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, ''Totally Gothic'', and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white.

This new color scheme loosely resembled that of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], the [[United States Football League|USFL]] team that played in the region during their three-season existence from 1983 to 1985 and had a color scheme of red, silver, black and white.\n\nThe new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during preseason and early regular season games, while the red-on-white combination has been used much less sparingly. The red-on-white has been used for some prime time home games, and other selected home games. Most games, home and away, have utilized pewter trousers.\n\nIn {{nfly|2003}}, the Buccaneers introduced a practice jersey that featured orange piping. In {{nfly|2004}}, a pewter practice jersey was used, with numerals in the ''Totally Gothic'' font. For 2005, the uniform featured a patch commemorating the club's 30th season.\n\nLike many other NFL teams located in [[subtropical climate]]s, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white road jerseys at home during the first half of the season \u2013 forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] games. The west sideline is in the shade. In {{nfly|1989}}, the Buccaneers started to wear white at home to accommodate [[Vinny Testaverde]]'s color blindness. Vinny Testaverde had bad performances in the darker (orange) uniforms and persuaded head coach [[Ray Perkins]] to change the team's home uniform to white.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tampa Bay Buccaneers|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-11-16/sports/0080260159_1_testaverde-playing-time-miami|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=November 16, 1988|access-date=September 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Fred|title=Testaverde Stats Unsightly|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-11-17/sports/8802170489_1_colorblind-rose-colored-bears|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=November 17, 1988|access-date=September 17, 2016}}</ref> In certain years such as 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1996 \u2013 the last year of the original uniforms, the Buccaneers generally wore white at home for the entire season including preseason. Since the new uniforms were adopted, the Buccaneers wear their red jerseys home games during the second half of the season, and for most nighttime home games. During the preseason, the Buccaneers usually wear white for their home games. The Buccaneers have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match up against the [[New York Giants|Giants]]. The Buccaneers wore white that day instead, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high. At [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], in which Tampa Bay was the designated home team, they elected to wear their red home jerseys. This was despite the kickoff temperature of {{convert|81|F|C}}, one of the hottest Super Bowls on record.<ref>{{cite news|title=Super Bowl Game-Time Temperatures|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/super-bowl-game-time-temperatures/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|access-date=March 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Buccaneers' 1997 uniform change prompted a 2003 lawsuit by the Raiders, who claimed that the NFL and the Buccaneers had infringed upon key [[trademark]] elements of the Raiders' brand, including the Raiders' pirate logo. In the same suit, the Raiders challenged the Carolina Panthers' color scheme, which included silver and black. The Raiders wanted the courts to bar the Buccaneers and Panthers from wearing their uniforms while playing in California. However, since the lawsuit was filed in a [[California]] state court, the lawsuit was tossed out because only federal courts have jurisdiction on [[intellectual property]] issues.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucs free to use pirate logo after Raiders suit is tossed|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/22/Sports/Bucs_free_to_use_pira.shtml|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=April 22, 2003|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2014\u20132019===\nThe Buccaneers unveiled a slightly altered logo and helmet on February 20, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Scott|title=Bucs Unveil Enhanced Logo and Helmet|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/bucs-unveil-enhanced-logo-and-helmet-12647675|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=February 20, 2014|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Tampa Bay Buccaneers update helmet, logo for 2014|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000327102/article/tampa-bay-buccaneers-update-helmet-logo-for-2014|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=February 20, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}</ref> On March 3, 2014, they unveiled the entire new uniform to be used starting in the 2014 season.

Geologically, it is built on the confluence of [[Quaternary]] lava flows to the west, [[Silurian]] [[mudstone]]s to the east, and [[Holocene]] sand accumulation to the southeast along [[Port Phillip]]. The southeastern suburbs are situated on the [[Selwyn fault]] which transects [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]] and [[Cranbourne, Victoria|Cranbourne]].\n\nMelbourne extends along the [[Yarra River]] towards the [[Yarra Valley]] and the [[Dandenong Ranges]] to the east. It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra's tributaries\u2014[[Moonee Ponds Creek]] (toward Tullamarine Airport), [[Merri Creek]], [[Darebin Creek]] and [[Plenty River]]\u2014to the outer suburban growth corridors of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]] and [[Whittlesea, Victoria|Whittlesea]].\n\nThe city reaches southeast through [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] to the growth corridor of [[Pakenham, Victoria|Pakenham]] towards [[West Gippsland]], and southward through the [[Dandenong Creek]] valley and the city of [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]]. In the west, it extends along the [[Maribyrnong River]] and its tributaries north towards [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] and the foothills of the [[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Macedon Ranges]], and along the flat volcanic plain country towards [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] in the west, [[Werribee]] at the foothills of the [[You Yangs]] [[granite]] ridge south west of the CBD. The Little River, and the township of the same name, marks the border between Melbourne and neighbouring Geelong city.\n\nMelbourne's major bayside beaches are in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay, in areas like [[Port Melbourne]], [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], [[Elwood, Victoria|Elwood]], [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], [[Sandringham, Victoria|Sandringham]], [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] and Werribee South.

This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.\n\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\" similar to the \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]].

These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower.

Geologically, it is built on the confluence of [[Quaternary]] lava flows to the west, [[Silurian]] [[mudstone]]s to the east, and [[Holocene]] sand accumulation to the southeast along [[Port Phillip]]. The southeastern suburbs are situated on the [[Selwyn fault]] which transects [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]] and [[Cranbourne, Victoria|Cranbourne]].\n\nMelbourne extends along the [[Yarra River]] towards the [[Yarra Valley]] and the [[Dandenong Ranges]] to the east. It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra's tributaries\u2014[[Moonee Ponds Creek]] (toward Tullamarine Airport), [[Merri Creek]], [[Darebin Creek]] and [[Plenty River]]\u2014to the outer suburban growth corridors of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]] and [[Whittlesea, Victoria|Whittlesea]].\n\nThe city reaches southeast through [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] to the growth corridor of [[Pakenham, Victoria|Pakenham]] towards [[West Gippsland]], and southward through the [[Dandenong Creek]] valley and the city of [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]]. In the west, it extends along the [[Maribyrnong River]] and its tributaries north towards [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] and the foothills of the [[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Macedon Ranges]], and along the flat volcanic plain country towards [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] in the west, [[Werribee]] at the foothills of the [[You Yangs]] [[granite]] ridge south west of the CBD. The Little River, and the township of the same name, marks the border between Melbourne and neighbouring Geelong city.\n\nMelbourne's major bayside beaches are in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay, in areas like [[Port Melbourne]], [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], [[Elwood, Victoria|Elwood]], [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], [[Sandringham, Victoria|Sandringham]], [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] and Werribee South.

This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.\n\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\" similar to the \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]]. Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually.

These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having \"four seasons in one day\",<ref name=autogenerated1>{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> a phrase that is part of local [[popular culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |title=Welcome to Melbourne |publisher=City of Melbourne |accessdate=18 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171215/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}</ref> The lowest temperature on record is {{convert|-2.8|C|F}}, on 21 July 1869.<ref name=\"snow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=123&p_display_type=dailyDataFile&p_startYear=1869&p_c=-1481637067&p_stn_num=86071 |title=Bureau of Meteorology \u2013 Climate Data Online |accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref> The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was {{convert|46.4|C|F}}, on [[Black Saturday bushfires|7 February 2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |title = Monthly climate statistics | publisher= Bureau of Meteorology | accessdate = 30 March 2012}}</ref> While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 March 2009|title=BOM -
