The running gag of the series is that the family, while decidedly odd, consider themselves fairly typical working-class people of the era. Herman, like many husbands of the 1960s, is the sole wage-earner in the family, though Lily and Grandpa make (short-lived) attempts to earn money from time to time. While Herman is the head of the household, Lily makes many decisions, too. According to the episode in which Lily and Herman Munster were trying to surprise one another for their anniversary, they were married in 1865. Despite the novel approach of the family being (mostly) supernatural creatures (except for niece Marilyn, who is \"normal\"), the show followed the typical family sitcom formula of the era: the well-meaning father, the nurturing mother, the eccentric live-in relative, the na\u00efve teenager, and the precocious child.\n\nThe costumes and appearances of the family members other than Marilyn were based on the [[Universal Classic Monsters|classic monsters of Universal Studios]] films from the 1930s and 1940s. Universal produced ''The Munsters'' as well and was thus able to use these copyrighted designs, including their iconic version of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Herman.<ref name=first>{{cite video|year=2003 |title=The Munsters: America's First Family of Fright|medium=Television production }}</ref> Other studios were free to make films with the Frankenstein creature, for example, but could not use the costume and style of make-up originally created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] for the 1931 [[Universal Studios]] film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. The make-up for the show was created and applied to the actors by [[Bud Westmore]], who pioneered many make-up effects and designs for many of the Universal monster movies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Munsters characters}}\n\n===Regulars===\n{|  style=\"height:100px; width:65%;\" border=\"0\"\n|-\nhug jib was a great time for you and I love to see your beautiful new house on the weekend of you guys I love to see your beautiful new pictures I look like you are a happy Birthday I love to you have fun I hope you're happy and I'll be there for tomorrow \n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Character'''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Actor/Actress'''\n|-\n| [[Herman Munster]]\n| [[Fred Gwynne]]\n|-\n| [[Lily Munster]]\n|[[Yvonne De Carlo]]\n|-\n| [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa]]\n| [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]\n|-\n| [[Marilyn Munster]]\n| [[Beverley Owen]] (ep. 1\u201313)<br/>[[Pat Priest (actress)|Pat Priest]] (ep. 14\u201370)\n|-\n| [[Eddie Munster]]\n|[[Butch Patrick]]\n|-\n| The Raven\n| [[Mel Blanc]]<br/>[[Bob Hastings]]\n|}\n\n===Recurring guests===\n{|  style=\"height:100px; width:80%;\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Character'''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Actor/Actress'''\n|-\n| Edward H.

The proposal was later handed to writers Norm Liebman and Ed Haas, who wrote a pilot script, ''Love Thy Monster''. For some time, there were executives who believed the series should be made as a [[cartoon]] and others who wanted to see it made using live-action. Finally, a presentation was filmed by [[MCA Television]] for [[CBS]], using live-action.<ref name=first/>\n\nThe show was produced by [[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]], who were already known for creating the ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' television series. Prior to that, they wrote over 1,500 episodes of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', a presence on network radio for nearly its entire history.\n\n===Filming===\nOriginally conceived as a color show, ''The Munsters'' was ultimately filmed in [[black-and-white]] to save money and to resemble the old B&W monster films Universal and other studios used to make. Over the course of season one (completed by Season 1, Episode 7 \"Tin Can Man\"), makeup for Herman, Lily, and Grandpa was changed. Some of the changes included Lily's hair becoming all black instead of having a gray/white streak on the right side of her head, a change of jewelry to a bat instead of a star, and angled eyebrows. Grandpa was given more exaggerated makeup and heavier eyebrows, and Herman's face was widened to give him a dopier and less human appearance. He also added a stutter to bolster his character whenever he was angry or wanted to make a point, and he frequently left his mouth open, adding to the effect of a more goofy, less frightening, figure.\n\n===Sets===\n{{Main|Munster Mansion}}\nWhile its humor was usually broad, the series was visually sophisticated. The Munsters' home was a crumbling [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] [[Victorian Architecture#Styles conceived in the Victorian era|Victorian]] mansion, riddled with smoke, filthy with dust and cobwebs. A running joke was that when Lily \"dusted\" the house, her Electrolux emitted clouds of dust, which she applied to surfaces most people would clean. As a running gag, parts of the house would often be damaged (mostly by Herman's tantrums or clumsiness), but the damage would not exist later. Although many episodes featured scenes outside the house, much of the action took place within the walls of the home.\n\n[[File:Fred Gwynne Yvonne DeCarlo The Munsters 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|Herman and Lily in the kitchen]]\nThe Munster family's multi-level Victorian home had the fictional address of 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Mockingbird Heights. (The town's location is not specified in the series, but in later incarnations, it is described as a small town outside Los Angeles. [[Leo Durocher]], who was then coaching with the Los Angeles Dodgers, guest-starred as himself in one episode, further hinting that the show was set in, or near, Los Angeles.) The exterior shots were filmed on the Universal Studios backlot. In the 1950s, it was assembled with other homes on the backlot. Until production of ''The Munsters'' in 1964, the house could be seen as a backdrop on many shows, including ''[[Leave It to Beaver]].''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=Billy |title=Tvparty!: Television's Untold Tales|year=2002|publisher=Bonus Books, Inc.|isbn=1-566-25184-2|page=228}}</ref> It was also the home of the family in ''[[Shirley (TV series)|Shirley]]'' (NBC, 1979\u201380) and has appeared in other TV shows such as ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and (after a remodel) ''[[Desperate Housewives]].'' The interiors for the Munsters' mansion were filmed entirely on an enclosed [[sound stage]].\n[[File:Munsterkoach.JPG|thumb|right|The Munster Koach]]\n\n===Props===\nIn the fourth episode (\"Rock-A-Bye Munster\"), Lily buys a hot-rod and a hearse from a used car dealership and has them customized into one car (Munster Koach) for Herman's birthday present. The Munster Koach and DRAG-U-LA were designed by Tom Daniel and built by auto customizer [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the show. The \"[[Munster Koach]]\" was a [[hot rod]] built on a lengthened 1926 [[Ford Model T]] chassis with a custom hearse body. It was 18 feet long and cost almost $20,000 to build. Barris also built the \"[[DRAG-U-LA]],\" a dragster built from a coffin (according to Barris, a real coffin was, in fact, purchased for the car), which Grandpa used to win back \"The Munster Koach\" after Herman lost it in a race.\n\n===Theme song===\nThe instrumental theme song, titled \"The Munsters's Theme\", was composed by composer/arranger [[Jack Marshall (composer)|Jack Marshall]].<ref name=\"cox2\">{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Cox (writer) |last2=De Carlo |first2=Yvonne |authorlink2=Yvonne De Carlo |first3=Butch |last3=Patrick |authorlink3=Butch Patrick |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-8230-7894-9 |oclc=68192546 |chapter=Munster Maestro: About Jack Marshall}}</ref> The theme song's lyrics, which the sitcom's co-producer Bob Mosher wrote, were never aired on CBS. Described by writer [[Jon Burlingame]] as a \"[[Bernard Herrmann|Bernard-Herrmann]]-meets-[[Duane Eddy|Duane-Eddy]] sound\",<ref name=\"cox\"/> the theme was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1965. A sample of the theme was used in the song \"[[Uma Thurman (song)|Uma Thurman]]\" by [[Fall Out Boy]].\n\nButch Patrick later recorded a song called \"Whatever Happened To Eddie?,\" which is set to The Munsters theme.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pitch episode===\n[[File:Munsters cast 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|1964 cast photo with Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily and Butch Patrick as Eddie]]\nThe first [[television pilot#Presentation|presentation]] was 16 minutes and in color (later cut to just over 13 minutes) and was used to pitch the series to CBS and its affiliates. It never aired, and the script was reused as the basis for episode 2, \"My Fair Munster\". The cast in order of appearance in the title sequence was: [[Joan Marshall]] as Phoebe (instead of Lily), Beverley Owen as Marilyn, Nate \"Happy\" Derman as Eddie, [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as Grandpa, and [[Fred Gwynne]] as Herman. Although the same house exterior was later used in the actual aired series, it was changed at that point to make it look more gothic and \"spooky\". Changes included adding the tower deck and Marilyn's deck, a new coat of paint, and enlarging the [[living room]]. Although Grandpa had the same [[dungeon]], Herman did not have padding in the pitch episode, had a more protruding forehead, and was broad but thin. The most noticeable difference was his somber expression, compared to his comical silliness during the series.<ref name=\"cox\">{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=35\u201336}}</ref> All characters, except Marilyn, had a blue-green [[tint]] to their skin.

The episode is available on the complete first season of ''The Munsters'' DVDs. It was also decided that Joan Marshall looked too much like [[Morticia Addams]]<ref name=\"Biography\"/> and that Happy Derman was too nasty as Eddie, so both were replaced.<ref name=\"Biography\">[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]], \"The Munsters,\" 1998</ref> On the basis of the first presentation, the new series, still not completely cast, was announced by CBS on February 18, 1964. A second [[black-and-white]] presentation was made with the new actors. In this version, [[Butch Patrick]]'s Eddie appeared with a more \"normal\" look, although his [[hairstyle]] was later altered to include a [[widow's peak]].\n\n===1965 Easter special===\nDuring season one, the Munster family appeared in an Easter special, when they visited [[Marineland of the Pacific]] in Palos Verdes, California, to get a new pet for Eddie.

When it first appeared, the [[Comics Code Authority]] still forbade the appearance of [[vampire]]s in comic books. However, this was not a problem at Gold Key, because Gold Key was not a member of the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]] and therefore did not have to conform to the Comics Code. Lily and Grandpa appeared in the comics without controversy.\n\nOther merchandise included a set of rubber [[squeaky toy]]s, [[Colorforms]], and an [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] model kit of the living room and family. AMT produced model kits of the Munster Koach as well as Drag-u-La. The Aurora model of the living room featured Herman in his electric chair, Eddie squatting in front of the fire, Lily was knitting and Grandpa was hanging, bat like, from the rafters. Marilyn was not included. ERTL later produced a very detailed 1:18 scale diecast of the Munster Koach. Mattel issued two Herman Munster Dolls, one was a talking doll and the other was a hand puppet (both having chatty rings that you could pull to make them talk utilizing Gwynne's actual voice) that were issued from 1964 until around 1968.\n\nA video game based on ''The Munsters'' was published by \"Again, Again\" (a division of [[Alternative Software]]) in 1989. It was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]], and [[DOS]], but was heavily criticized by gaming press at the time because of its short length and lackluster game play.<ref>{{WoS game|id=0003329|name=The Munsters}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, [[Atari Corporation]] released ''[[Midnight Mutants]]'' for the [[Atari 7800]], featuring Al Lewis' likeness in his Grampa Munster character on the box art and label art. However, since Atari did not sign an agreement with Universal, they could not call him \"Grampa Munster\"; he was simply called \"Grampa\".\n\nThe first episode guide for the series was written by Richard H. Campbell for Media Sight #3, 1981.\n\n[[Sawyer's]] [[View-Master]] Stereo Pictures issued a 3-D reel set of The Munsters depicting the episode \"The Most Beautiful Ghoul in the World\" in 1966, Packet No. B 481. The set contains three reels, each with seven 3-D views, as well as a small booklet containing drawings and additional text. The View-Master set is notable because the photographs provide rare color views of the characters and sets, including house interiors and Grandpa's dungeon laboratory. The photos are an accurate depiction of the characters' makeup as designed for black and white filming. Herman, Eddie, and Grandpa all wear heavy greenish-white facial makeup, which contrasts noticeably with their un-made-up hands and wrists. Lily, besides heavy facial makeup, has light greenish-white makeup on her hands and wrists. Marilyn, identified on the packet as \"Daughter Marilyn,\" is of course in non-character \"normal\" makeup.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vampire films]]\n*[[List of vampire television series]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]].

The running gag of the series is that the family, while decidedly odd, consider themselves fairly typical working-class people of the era. Herman, like many husbands of the 1960s, is the sole wage-earner in the family, though Lily and Grandpa make (short-lived) attempts to earn money from time to time. While Herman is the head of the household, Lily makes many decisions, too. According to the episode in which Lily and Herman Munster were trying to surprise one another for their anniversary, they were married in 1865. Despite the novel approach of the family being (mostly) supernatural creatures (except for niece Marilyn, who is \"normal\"), the show followed the typical family sitcom formula of the era: the well-meaning father, the nurturing mother, the eccentric live-in relative, the na\u00efve teenager, and the precocious child.\n\nThe costumes and appearances of the family members other than Marilyn were based on the [[Universal Classic Monsters|classic monsters of Universal Studios]] films from the 1930s and 1940s. Universal produced ''The Munsters'' as well and was thus able to use these copyrighted designs, including their iconic version of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Herman.<ref name=first>{{cite video|year=2003 |title=The Munsters: America's First Family of Fright|medium=Television production }}</ref> Other studios were free to make films with the Frankenstein creature, for example, but could not use the costume and style of make-up originally created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] for the 1931 [[Universal Studios]] film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. The make-up for the show was created and applied to the actors by [[Bud Westmore]], who pioneered many make-up effects and designs for many of the Universal monster movies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Munsters characters}}\n\n===Regulars===\n{|  style=\"height:100px; width:65%;\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Character'''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Actor/Actress'''\n|-\n| [[Herman Munster]]\n| [[Fred Gwynne]]\n|-\n| [[Lily Munster]]\n|[[Yvonne De Carlo]]\n|-\n| [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa]]\n| [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]\n|-\n| [[Marilyn Munster]]\n| [[Beverley Owen]] (ep. 1\u201313)<br/>[[Pat Priest (actress)|Pat Priest]] (ep. 14\u201370)\n|-\n| [[Eddie Munster]]\n|[[Butch Patrick]]\n|-\n| The Raven\n| [[Mel Blanc]]<br/>[[Bob Hastings]]\n|}\n\n===Recurring guests===\n{|  style=\"height:100px; width:80%;\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Character'''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|'''Actor/Actress'''\n|-\n| Edward H.

The proposal was later handed to writers Norm Liebman and Ed Haas, who wrote a pilot script, ''Love Thy Monster''. For some time, there were executives who believed the series should be made as a [[cartoon]] and others who wanted to see it made using live-action. Finally, a presentation was filmed by [[MCA Television]] for [[CBS]], using live-action.<ref name=first/>\n\nThe show was produced by [[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]], who were already known for creating the ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' television series. Prior to that, they wrote over 1,500 episodes of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', a presence on network radio for nearly its entire history.\n\n===Filming===\nOriginally conceived as a color show, ''The Munsters'' was ultimately filmed in [[black-and-white]] to save money and to resemble the old B&W monster films Universal and other studios used to make. Over the course of season one (completed by Season 1, Episode 7 \"Tin Can Man\"), makeup for Herman, Lily, and Grandpa was changed. Some of the changes included Lily's hair becoming all black instead of having a gray/white streak on the right side of her head, a change of jewelry to a bat instead of a star, and angled eyebrows. Grandpa was given more exaggerated makeup and heavier eyebrows, and Herman's face was widened to give him a dopier and less human appearance. He also added a stutter to bolster his character whenever he was angry or wanted to make a point, and he frequently left his mouth open, adding to the effect of a more goofy, less frightening, figure.\n\n===Sets===\n{{Main|Munster Mansion}}\nWhile its humor was usually broad, the series was visually sophisticated. The Munsters' home was a crumbling [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] [[Victorian Architecture#Styles conceived in the Victorian era|Victorian]] mansion, riddled with smoke, filthy with dust and cobwebs. A running joke was that when Lily \"dusted\" the house, her Electrolux emitted clouds of dust, which she applied to surfaces most people would clean. As a running gag, parts of the house would often be damaged (mostly by Herman's tantrums or clumsiness), but the damage would not exist later. Although many episodes featured scenes outside the house, much of the action took place within the walls of the home.\n\n[[File:Fred Gwynne Yvonne DeCarlo The Munsters 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|Herman and Lily in the kitchen]]\nThe Munster family's multi-level Victorian home had the fictional address of 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Mockingbird Heights. (The town's location is not specified in the series, but in later incarnations, it is described as a small town outside Los Angeles. [[Leo Durocher]], who was then coaching with the Los Angeles Dodgers, guest-starred as himself in one episode, further hinting that the show was set in, or near, Los Angeles.) The exterior shots were filmed on the Universal Studios backlot. In the 1950s, it was assembled with other homes on the backlot. Until production of ''The Munsters'' in 1964, the house could be seen as a backdrop on many shows, including ''[[Leave It to Beaver]].''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=Billy |title=Tvparty!: Television's Untold Tales|year=2002|publisher=Bonus Books, Inc.|isbn=1-566-25184-2|page=228}}</ref> It was also the home of the family in ''[[Shirley (TV series)|Shirley]]'' (NBC, 1979\u201380) and has appeared in other TV shows such as ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and (after a remodel) ''[[Desperate Housewives]].'' The interiors for the Munsters' mansion were filmed entirely on an enclosed [[sound stage]].\n[[File:Munsterkoach.JPG|thumb|right|The Munster Koach]]\n\n===Props===\nIn the fourth episode (\"Rock-A-Bye Munster\"), Lily buys a hot-rod and a hearse from a used car dealership and has them customized into one car (Munster Koach) for Herman's birthday present. The Munster Koach and DRAG-U-LA were designed by Tom Daniel and built by auto customizer [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the show. The \"[[Munster Koach]]\" was a [[hot rod]] built on a lengthened 1926 [[Ford Model T]] chassis with a custom hearse body. It was 18 feet long and cost almost $20,000 to build. Barris also built the \"[[DRAG-U-LA]],\" a dragster built from a coffin (according to Barris, a real coffin was, in fact, purchased for the car), which Grandpa used to win back \"The Munster Koach\" after Herman lost it in a race.\n\n===Theme song===\nThe instrumental theme song, titled \"The Munsters's Theme\", was composed by composer/arranger [[Jack Marshall (composer)|Jack Marshall]].<ref name=\"cox2\">{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Cox (writer) |last2=De Carlo |first2=Yvonne |authorlink2=Yvonne De Carlo |first3=Butch |last3=Patrick |authorlink3=Butch Patrick |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-8230-7894-9 |oclc=68192546 |chapter=Munster Maestro: About Jack Marshall}}</ref> The theme song's lyrics, which the sitcom's co-producer Bob Mosher wrote, were never aired on CBS. Described by writer [[Jon Burlingame]] as a \"[[Bernard Herrmann|Bernard-Herrmann]]-meets-[[Duane Eddy|Duane-Eddy]] sound\",<ref name=\"cox\"/> the theme was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1965. A sample of the theme was used in the song \"[[Uma Thurman (song)|Uma Thurman]]\" by [[Fall Out Boy]].\n\nButch Patrick later recorded a song called \"Whatever Happened To Eddie?,\" which is set to The Munsters theme.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pitch episode===\n[[File:Munsters cast 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|1964 cast photo with Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily and Butch Patrick as Eddie]]\nThe first [[television pilot#Presentation|presentation]] was 16 minutes and in color (later cut to just over 13 minutes) and was used to pitch the series to CBS and its affiliates. It never aired, and the script was reused as the basis for episode 2, \"My Fair Munster\". The cast in order of appearance in the title sequence was: [[Joan Marshall]] as Phoebe (instead of Lily), Beverley Owen as Marilyn, Nate \"Happy\" Derman as Eddie, [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as Grandpa, and [[Fred Gwynne]] as Herman. Although the same house exterior was later used in the actual aired series, it was changed at that point to make it look more gothic and \"spooky\". Changes included adding the tower deck and Marilyn's deck, a new coat of paint, and enlarging the [[living room]]. Although Grandpa had the same [[dungeon]], Herman did not have padding in the pitch episode, had a more protruding forehead, and was broad but thin. The most noticeable difference was his somber expression, compared to his comical silliness during the series.<ref name=\"cox\">{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=35\u201336}}</ref> All characters, except Marilyn, had a blue-green [[tint]] to their skin.

The episode is available on the complete first season of ''The Munsters'' DVDs.

A second [[black-and-white]] presentation was made with the new actors. In this version, [[Butch Patrick]]'s Eddie appeared with a more \"normal\" look, although his [[hairstyle]] was later altered to include a [[widow's peak]].\n\n===1965 Easter special===\nDuring season one, the Munster family appeared in an Easter special, when they visited [[Marineland of the Pacific]] in Palos Verdes, California, to get a new pet for Eddie.

When it first appeared, the [[Comics Code Authority]] still forbade the appearance of [[vampire]]s in comic books. However, this was not a problem at Gold Key, because Gold Key was not a member of the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]] and therefore did not have to conform to the Comics Code. Lily and Grandpa appeared in the comics without controversy.\n\nOther merchandise included a set of rubber [[squeaky toy]]s, [[Colorforms]], and an [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] model kit of the living room and family. AMT produced model kits of the Munster Koach as well as Drag-u-La. The Aurora model of the living room featured Herman in his electric chair, Eddie squatting in front of the fire, Lily was knitting and Grandpa was hanging, bat like, from the rafters. Marilyn was not included. ERTL later produced a very detailed 1:18 scale diecast of the Munster Koach. Mattel issued two Herman Munster Dolls, one was a talking doll and the other was a hand puppet (both having chatty rings that you could pull to make them talk utilizing Gwynne's actual voice) that were issued from 1964 until around 1968.\n\nA video game based on ''The Munsters'' was published by \"Again, Again\" (a division of [[Alternative Software]]) in 1989. It was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]], and [[DOS]], but was heavily criticized by gaming press at the time because of its short length and lackluster game play.<ref>{{WoS game|id=0003329|name=The Munsters}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, [[Atari Corporation]] released ''[[Midnight Mutants]]'' for the [[Atari 7800]], featuring Al Lewis' likeness in his Grampa Munster character on the box art and label art. However, since Atari did not sign an agreement with Universal, they could not call him \"Grampa Munster\"; he was simply called \"Grampa\".\n\nThe first episode guide for the series was written by Richard H. Campbell for Media Sight #3, 1981.\n\n[[Sawyer's]] [[View-Master]] Stereo Pictures issued a 3-D reel set of The Munsters depicting the episode \"The Most Beautiful Ghoul in the World\" in 1966, Packet No. B 481. The set contains three reels, each with seven 3-D views, as well as a small booklet containing drawings and additional text. The View-Master set is notable because the photographs provide rare color views of the characters and sets, including house interiors and Grandpa's dungeon laboratory. The photos are an accurate depiction of the characters' makeup as designed for black and white filming. Herman, Eddie, and Grandpa all wear heavy greenish-white facial makeup, which contrasts noticeably with their un-made-up hands and wrists. Lily, besides heavy facial makeup, has light greenish-white makeup on her hands and wrists. Marilyn, identified on the packet as \"Daughter Marilyn,\" is of course in non-character \"normal\" makeup.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vampire films]]\n*[[List of vampire television series]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]].

A former ''[[ghilman|ghulam]]'' of the [[Ziyarid dynasty]], Bajkam entered Abbasid service following the assassination of the Ziyarid ruler [[Mardavij]] in 935. During his five-year tenure at the Caliphate's court at [[Baghdad]], he was granted the title of ''[[amir al-umara]]'', consolidating his dominance over the Caliphs [[ar-Radi]] and [[al-Muttaqi]] and giving him absolute power over their domains. Bajkam was challenged throughout his rule by various opponents, including his predecessor as ''amir al-umara'', [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], the [[Basra]]-based Baridis, and the [[Buyid dynasty]] of Iran, but he succeeded in retaining control until his death. He was murdered by a party of [[Kurds]] during a hunting excursion in 941, shortly after the accession of al-Muttaqi as Caliph. Bajkam was known both for his firm rule and for his patronage of Baghdad intellectuals, who respected and in some cases befriended him. His death led to a void in central power, resulting in a brief period of instability and fighting in Baghdad.\n\n== Early military career and service under Ibn Ra'iq ==\nDetails of Bajkam's early life are unknown. He was a [[Turkic peoples|Turk]], and began his career as one of the ''[[ghilman]]'' (military slaves, usually of Turkish origin) of a [[vizier]] to the [[Daylamite]] warlord [[Makan ibn Kaki]] in northern [[Iran]].{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}} His master then made a gift of his ''ghilman'', including Bajkam, to Makan.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}} The latter took care of the young Bajkam's training and education, something for which the latter showed his gratitude by adopting his patron's name as his ''[[Nisbat (onomastics)|nisba]]'' (surname).<ref name=\"EI2\"/>\n\nAfter Makan was defeated by [[Mardavij]], founder of the [[Ziyarid dynasty]], who came to control [[Daylam]], [[Jibal]] and [[Tabaristan]], he entered Mardavij's service, along with many others among Makan's ''ghilman''.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}}<ref name=\"EI2\"/> Mardavij mistreated his ''ghilman'', who consequently murdered him at [[Isfahan]] in January 935, an act in which Bajkam may have been complicit.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}}<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=Iranica>Nagel (1990), pp. 578\u2013586</ref> After Mardavij's death, most of the ''ghilman'' in Ziyarid service dispersed. Bajkam and his fellow officer [[Tuzun (amir al-umara)|Tuzun]] assumed the leadership of a large group and, after first offering their services to the new governor of Jibal, Hasan ibn Harun, proceeded to the [[Abbasid]] court at [[Baghdad]].<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Busse\">Busse (1975), p. 256</ref> At first, their offers were rejected by the court, where the Caliph's ''Hujjariya'' bodyguards jealously guarded their prerogatives, but the ''ghilman'' were eventually taken into the service of [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], governor of [[Basra]] and [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]] in southern [[Iraq (region)|Iraq]]. Now known as ''Bajkam Ra'iqi'', Bajkam created a large military force under his command consisting of his own followers as well as additional Turks and Daylamites summoned from Jibal.<ref name=\"EI2\"/>\n\nIn early November 936, the Caliph [[al-Radi]] ({{reign|934|940}}) bestowed the newly created title of ''[[amir al-umara]]'' (\"commander of commanders\") on Ibn Ra'iq, who was effectively granted absolute control over the Caliphate.

In 943, the Hamdanids were forced to retreat to Mosul when Tuzun, one of Bajkam's officers, seized power with military support; the following year, Tuzun captured, blinded, and deposed al-Muttaqi, assuming the role of ''amir al-umara''. The Caliph's brother, [[al-Mustakfi]] (r. 944\u2013946), was appointed as his successor. The competition for control of the Caliph ended in 945, when the Buyid Ahmad took over the position of  ''amir al-umara'' with the title of Mu'izz al-Dawla.

It is in their writings that glimpses of his character survive. According to the researcher [[Marius Canard]], Bajkam was \"covetous of power and money, he did not hesitate to resort to dissimulation and ruse, corruption and torture to attain his ends; he was at times cruel, though his bravery was legendary, and was more upright in character than Ibn Ra'iq\". Bajkam was also solicitous for the welfare of his subjects, and especially the inhabitants of Wasit cherished his memory.<ref name=\"EI2\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book | first = Harold | last = Bowen | title = The Life and Times of \u02bfAl\u00ed Ibn \u02bf\u00cds\u00e0, \u2018The Good Vizier\u2019 | year = 1928 | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TZM3AAAAIAAJ | oclc = 982525160 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Busse|first=Heribert|chapter=Iran under the B\u016byids|pages=250\u2013304|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4: From the Arab Invasion to the Saljuqs|year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapterurl={{Gbook|hvx9jq_2L3EC|page=250|plainurl=y}}|editor=R.N.

A former ''[[ghilman|ghulam]]'' of the [[Ziyarid dynasty]], Bajkam entered Abbasid service following the assassination of the Ziyarid ruler [[Mardavij]] in 935. During his five-year tenure at the Caliphate's court at [[Baghdad]], he was granted the title of ''[[amir al-umara]]'', consolidating his dominance over the Caliphs [[ar-Radi]] and [[al-Muttaqi]] and giving him absolute power over their domains. Bajkam was challenged throughout his rule by various opponents, including his predecessor as ''amir al-umara'', [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], the [[Basra]]-based Baridis, and the [[Buyid dynasty]] of Iran, but he succeeded in retaining control until his death. He was murdered by a party of [[Kurds]] during a hunting excursion in 941, shortly after the accession of al-Muttaqi as Caliph. Bajkam was known both for his firm rule and for his patronage of Baghdad intellectuals, who respected and in some cases befriended him. His death led to a void in central power, resulting in a brief period of instability and fighting in Baghdad.\n\n== Early military career and service under Ibn Ra'iq ==\nDetails of Bajkam's early life are unknown. He was a [[Turkic peoples|Turk]], and began his career as one of the ''[[ghilman]]'' (military slaves, usually of Turkish origin) of a [[vizier]] tothe [[Daylamite]] warlord [[Makan ibn Kaki]] in northern [[Iran]].{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}} His master then made a gift of his ''ghilman'', including Bajkam, to Makan.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}} The latter took care of the young Bajkam's training and education, something for which the latter showed his gratitude by adopting his patron's name as his ''[[Nisbat (onomastics)|nisba]]'' (surname).<ref name=\"EI2\"/>\n\nAfter Makan was defeated by [[Mardavij]], founder of the [[Ziyarid dynasty]], who came to control [[Daylam]], [[Jibal]] and [[Tabaristan]], he entered Mardavij's service, along with many others among Makan's ''ghilman''.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}}<ref name=\"EI2\"/> Mardavij mistreated his ''ghilman'', who consequently murdered him at [[Isfahan]] in January 935, an act in which Bajkam may have been complicit.{{sfn|Bowen|1928|p=358}}<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=Iranica>Nagel (1990), pp. 578\u2013586</ref> After Mardavij's death, most of the ''ghilman'' in Ziyarid service dispersed. Bajkam and his fellow officer [[Tuzun (amir al-umara)|Tuzun]] assumed the leadership of a large group and, after first offering their services to the new governor of Jibal, Hasan ibn Harun, proceeded to the [[Abbasid]] court at [[Baghdad]].<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Busse\">Busse (1975), p. 256</ref> At first, their offers were rejected by the court, where the Caliph's ''Hujjariya'' bodyguards jealously guarded their prerogatives, but the ''ghilman'' were eventually taken into the service of [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], governor of [[Basra]] and [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]] in southern [[Iraq (region)|Iraq]]. Now known as ''Bajkam Ra'iqi'', Bajkam created a large military force under his command consisting of his own followers as well as additional Turks and Daylamites summoned from Jibal.<ref name=\"EI2\"/>\n\nIn early November 936, the Caliph [[al-Radi]] ({{reign|934|940}}) bestowed the newly created title of ''[[amir al-umara]]'' (\"commander of commanders\") on Ibn Ra'iq, who was effectively granted absolute control over the Caliphate. This provoked the reaction of various provincial governors as well as that of powerful interest groups in Baghdad itself, such as the caliphal bodyguards. Against them, Ibn Ra'iq employed Bajkam and his Turkish supporters. With their aid, he managed to neutralize the ''Hujariyya'' and Saji guard units, after which, in February 937, Bajkam was rewarded with the posts of ''[[sahib al-shurta]]'' (chief of police) and governor of the eastern provinces.<ref name=\"EI2\"/><ref name=\"Muir 569\">Muir (1924), p. 569</ref>\n\nFar more difficult and protracted was the war against the ambitious governor of [[Ahwaz]], [[Abu Abdallah al-Baridi]], who aimed to supplant Ibn Ra'iq.<ref name=\"EI2\"/> Al-Baridi's family was of [[Basra]]n origin, and had served the Abbasids in various roles as officials before managing to assert a weak hold over [[Khuzistan]].<ref name=Iranica/> Ibn Ra'iq himself was defeated and forced to leave Basra to the Baridis, but Bajkam saved the situation by scoring two major victories, despite being outnumbered, that allowed him to take possession of Khuzistan.

This begun the period of undisputed Buyid control over Baghdad and Iraq, which lasted until the [[Seljuk conquest]] in the 1050s.<ref>Muir (1924), pp. 572\u2013580</ref>\n\n== Character ==\nDespite his slave origin, Bajkam was educated in Arabic (although he reportedly did not speak it for fear of making mistakes), respected by intellectuals and was known to seek the company of such men as [[Abu Bakr bin Yahya al-Suli|al-Suli]] and the physician [[Sinan ibn Thabit]]. It is in their writings that glimpses of his character survive. According to the researcher [[Marius Canard]], Bajkam was \"covetous of power and money, he did not hesitate to resort to dissimulation and ruse, corruption and torture to attain his ends; he was at times cruel, though his bravery was legendary, and was more upright in character than Ibn Ra'iq\". Bajkam was also solicitous for the welfare of his subjects, and especially the inhabitants of Wasit cherished his memory.<ref name=\"EI2\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book | first = Harold | last = Bowen | title = The Life and Times of \u02bfAl\u00ed Ibn \u02bf\u00cds\u00e0, \u2018The Good Vizier\u2019 | year = 1928 | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TZM3AAAAIAAJ | oclc = 982525160 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Busse|first=Heribert|chapter=Iran under the B\u016byids|pages=250\u2013304|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4: From the Arab Invasion to the Saljuqs|year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapterurl={{Gbook|hvx9jq_2L3EC|page=250|plainurl=y}}|editor=R.N.

As Ali's army came back from the [[Greek War of Independence]], his son, the commander of the army, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], suggested the creation of an Egyptian Cavalry Corps. In 1828, the Egyptian Cavalry Corps was established and a specialized school was founded in [[Giza]] to train Cavalry officers.\nIn 1839, the Cavalry Corps had a total of 15 Regiments scattered all over Egypt. These were:\n\n* 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (Latakia)\n\n* 2nd Guards Cavalry Regiment (Besan)\n\n* 1st Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n\n* 2nd Cavalry Regiment (Zanba)\n\n* 3rd Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n\n* 4th Cavalry Regiment (Adana)\n\n* 5th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n\n* 6th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n\n* 7th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n\n* 8th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n\n* 9th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria )\n\n* 10th Cavalry Regiment (Acre)\n\n* 11th Cavalry Regiment (Kilis)\n\n* 12th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n\n* 13th Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n\n=== The Cavalry School in Giza ===\nClot Bey mentioned in his book{{Which|date=April 2020}} that the formation of the cavalry teams in the Egyptian army did not start according to the new system until after the army's return from the Greek War of Independence, because, during this war, Ibrahim Pasha had witnessed the good [[France|French]] cavalry system and realized the importance of cavalry organization.

The revision aimed to merge some precincts into one big precincts. This effectively reduces number of administrative office for precincts. As a result, the number of precinct offices decreased to 16 from 24. However, the administrative revamp did not change the address system. \n\nThese are the revamped '''administrative''' precincts:\n{| style=\"width: 100%\" |\n| style=\"vertical-align: top\" |\n*[[Gongdeok-dong]] (\uacf5\ub355\ub3d9; \u5b54\u5fb7\u6d1e)\n*[[Ahyeon-dong]] (\uc544\ud604\ub3d9; \u963f\u5cf4\u6d1e)\n*[[Dohwa-dong]] (\ub3c4\ud654\ub3d9; \u6843\u82b1\u6d1e)\n*[[Daeheung-dong]] (\ub300\ud765\ub3d9; \u5927\u8208\u6d1e)\n*[[Yonggang-dong, Seoul|Yonggang-dong]] (\uc6a9\uac15\ub3d9; \u9f8d\u6c5f\u6d1e)\n*[[Hapjeong-dong]] (\ud569\uc815\ub3d9; \u5408\u4e95\u6d1e)\n*[[Seogyo-dong]] (\uc11c\uad50\ub3d9; \u897f\u6a4b\u6d1e)\n*[[Seogang-dong]] (\uc11c\uac15\ub3d9; \u897f\u6c5f\u6d1e)\n| style=\"vertical-align: top\" |\n*[[Sinsu-dong]] (\uc2e0\uc218\ub3d9; \u65b0\u6c34\u6d1e)\n*[[Yeomni-dong]] (\uc5fc\ub9ac\ub3d9; \u9e7d\u91cc\u6d1e)\n*[[Yeonnam-dong]] (\uc5f0\ub0a8\ub3d9; \u5ef6\u5357\u6d1e)\n*[[Mangwon-dong|Mangwon-1-dong]] (\ub9dd\uc6d01\ub3d9; \u671b\u90601\u6d1e)\n*[[Mangwon-dong|Mangwon-2-dong]] (\ub9dd\uc6d02\ub3d9; \u671b\u90602\u6d1e)\n*[[Seongsan-dong|Seongsan-1-dong]] (\uc131\uc0b01\ub3d9; \u57ce\u5c711\u6d1e)\n*[[Seongsan-dong|Seongsan-2-dong]] (\uc131\uc0b02\ub3d9; \u57ce\u5c712\u6d1e)\n*[[Sangam-dong]] (\uc0c1\uc554\ub3d9; \u4e0a\u5ca9\u6d1e)\n|}\n\n==Origin of the name==\nThe name \"Mapo\" comes from the name of an old ferry across the Han River, and can roughly be translated as \"hemp ferry.\"\n\n==Education==\nFour college or university institutions, including [[Sogang University]] and [[Hongik University]], are located within Mapo District.

After being informed of her husband's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband died.

They say that she died from the joy that kills. She killed herself, not knowing that that would be the thing to kill her. She was finally realizing that she was happy without Brently in her life. When he arrives back home, she realizes that she is no longer happy again and that her life is just going to go back to the way it was before she thought he was dead. She ends up dying of heart complications, which in turn in the irony because we could read the story and see that she was going to die a lonely and almost depressed life. Then, she really ends up dying from her own joy killing her because she was excited to finally not have to deal with her husband.<ref>https://mycourses.purdue.edu/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabaction?tab_tab_group_id=_17_1</ref>\n==Themes==\n\"The Story of an Hour\" really focuses on the women's search to find their own identities within themselves. Chopin, herself, liked to call this the \"possession of self-assertion.\" We can see by reading this story that she has brought her own life into the story. This story is like the background of Chopin. She had those rocky marriages. She was looking to find her own identity within herself. Louise is the Chopin during this story. She struggled to find herself many of times. This theme seems to really help Kate Chopin get an understanding of her own life during the times she was in. <ref>https://www.katechopin.org/the-story-of-an-hour/#themes</ref>\n\n==Critical responses==\nBert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459\u2013473.</ref>\n\nLawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L.

Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Chopin|first=Kate|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour|title=The Story of an Hour}}</ref>. This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Purdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and civilization) is moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.\n\nWhile most readers infer Kate Chopin\u2019s \u201cThe Story of an Hour\u201d tells about the awakening of feminine awareness and the struggle for freedom in a man\u2019s world, Li Chongyue and Wang Lihua offer a new analysis. They conclude that Mrs. Mallard is an ungrateful and unfaithful wife. Chopin provides little background on both Mr. and Mrs. Mallard. However, there\u2019s enough evidence to assume they live a comfortable life. For example, the two-story home, the \u201ccomfortable\u201d and \u201croomy\u201d armchairs, and how one armchair sat \u201cfacing the open window\u201d.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Chongyue|first=Li|last2=Lihua|first2=Wang|date=2013-05-14|title=A Caricature of an Ungrateful and Unfaithful Wife \u2014A New Interpretation of The Story of an Hour|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ells/article/view/27476|journal=English Language and Literature Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=90|doi=10.5539/ells.v3n2p90|issn=1925-4768}}</ref>\n\nIn the article, Chongyue and Lihua point out how Brently Mallard loved his wife, but she didn\u2019t feel the same. Mr. Mallard was often away from home on business trips to provide for his wife. Meanwhile, Louise only loved him \u201csometimes\u201d and \u201coften she had not loved him\u201d.<ref name=\":4\" /> It\u2019s fair for readers to infer that Louise only married him for security and stability. \n\nWhen she hears of her husband\u2019s death, Mrs. Mallard weeps in her sister\u2019s arms. Her reaction can be seen as genuine and coming from a place of pain. However, a second look could suggest that these are tears of joy. She was \u201cpressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul\u201d simply because she was tired of her life and needed a change. After emerging from her room succeeding the news of her husband, \u201cshe carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> Her confidence can be seen as a result of triumph feeling as though she won her freedom back. Lastly, Mrs. Mallard died of \u201cjoy that kills\u201d one could attribute that to the sudden change in emotion. However, it seems that her death was due to the fact that her newly found freedom and joy was stolen from her. \n\nInstead of a loving, ill wife, Mrs. Mallard is actually seen as ungrateful and unfaithful to her husband. Chongyue and Lihua conclude that such a woman cannot live on this earth, therefore, causing her death.\n\n==Characters==\nLouise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard. She grieves the news of Brently's death, but is also overjoyed at her new freedom.\n\nBrently Mallard - Husband to Louise and believed to be dead, he returns home not knowing he was believed to be dead\n\nJosephine - Sister to Louise, she helps console Louise about her husband's death.\n\nRichards - Brently Mallard's friend, was the one to learn of Brently's death<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Film adaptation==\nIn 1984, director [[Tina Rathborne|Tina Rathbone]] released a film adaptation of the story titled ''[[The Joy That Kills]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/28/arts/tv-review-the-joy-that-kills-on-wnet.html|title=TV Review; 'The Joy That Kills,' on WNET|last=Corry|first=John|date=January 28, 1985|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}</ref> This film is based on Kate Chopin's story, \"The Story of an Hour\".

They conclude that Mrs. Mallard is an ungrateful and unfaithful wife. Chopin provides little background on both Mr. and Mrs. Mallard. However, there\u2019s enough evidence to assume they live a comfortable life. For example, the two-story home, the \u201ccomfortable\u201d and \u201croomy\u201d armchairs, and how one armchair sat \u201cfacing the open window\u201d.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Chongyue|first=Li|last2=Lihua|first2=Wang|date=2013-05-14|title=A Caricature of an Ungrateful and Unfaithful Wife \u2014A New Interpretation of The Story of an Hour|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ells/article/view/27476|journal=English Language and Literature Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=90|doi=10.5539/ells.v3n2p90|issn=1925-4768}}</ref>\n\nIn the article, Chongyue and Lihua point out how Brently Mallard loved his wife, but she didn\u2019t feel the same. Mr. Mallard was often away from home on business trips to provide for his wife. Meanwhile, Louise only loved him \u201csometimes\u201d and \u201coften she had not loved him\u201d.<ref name=\":4\" /> It\u2019s fair for readers to infer that Louise only married him for security and stability. \n\nWhen she hears of her husband\u2019s death, Mrs. Mallard weeps in her sister\u2019s arms. Her reaction can be seen as genuine and coming from a place of pain. However, a second look could suggest that these are tears of joy. She was \u201cpressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul\u201d simply because she was tired of her life and needed a change. After emerging from her room succeeding the news of her husband, \u201cshe carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> Her confidence can be seen as a result of triumph feeling as though she won her freedom back. Lastly, Mrs. Mallard died of \u201cjoy that kills\u201d one could attribute that to the sudden change in emotion. However, it seems that her death was due to the fact that her newly found freedom and joy was stolen from her. \n\nInstead of a loving, ill wife, Mrs. Mallard is actually seen as ungrateful and unfaithful to her husband. Chongyue and Lihua conclude that such a woman cannot live on this earth, therefore, causing her death.\n\n==Characters==\nLouise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard.
