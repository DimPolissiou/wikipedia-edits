Yorktown is one of the three points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]]. It is the site of the last battle and surrender of British forces in 1781 at the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when the patriots gained independence from [[Great Britain]].\n\nIn modern times, several important U.S. military installations have been developed in the county. It also has miles of waterfront residential and recreational areas. York County adjoins the [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] [[theme park]] and includes within its borders the affiliated [[Water Country USA]] [[water park]], the [[Yorktown Riverfront]] area, [[Colonial_National_Historical_Park#Yorktown_Battlefield |Yorktown Battlefield and Visitor Center]] and [[American Revolution Museum at Yorktown]]. Yorktown is linked by the [[National Park Service|National Park Service's]] bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and historic attractions at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Heritage tourism to the Historic Triangle draws international visitors and is a major economic activity for the county.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American Indians===\nThe area which is now York County was long inhabited by succeeding cultures of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. These were [[hunter-gatherer]] groups during the late [[Woodland Period]] (1000 BC to AD 1000) and earlier.\n\nBy the late 16th century, much of the [[Atlantic coastal plain|coastal plain]] draining to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] of the current Commonwealth of Virginia was called ''[[Tenakomakah]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], meaning \"densely inhabited land\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Capossela|first1=Julie Ann|title=Jamestown from a Non-Western Perspective|url=http://www.wm.edu/niahd/journals/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965 |website=wm.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022073344/http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965&svr=www|archivedate=22 October 2008|date=2 February 2006}} ''c.f.'' [[Anishinaabe language]]: ''danakamigaa'': \"activity-grounds\", ''i.e.'' \"land of much events [for the People]\"</ref> The historic tribes of the Tidewater area spoke related Algonquian languages. Other Algonquian-speaking peoples occupied coastal areas north and into present-day Canada, as well as to the South.\n\nIn the Virginia region, a [[weroance]] (or chief) named [[Wahunsunacock]] (1547\u20131618) of the [[Powhatan people]] created a powerful empire of eastern-Algonquian language-speaking peoples known as the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]; he conquered or allied by agreement with approximately 30 tribes. Known as the Powhatan, meaning the paramount chief, he was from a village also known as \"Powhatan\", near the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] of the [[James River]]. (The Powhatan Hill neighborhood of the current city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was developed near this former site.) Chief Powhatan later established a second capital village, known as [[Werowocomoco]], in a centrally located position in Tenakomakah. Rediscovered in the early 21st century by archeological work, it was located along the north bank of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in present-day [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]].<ref>[http://powhatan.wm.edu/history/index.htm Powhatan: \"Powhatan: Werowocomoco\"], College of William and Mary</ref>\n\nThe [[Chiskiack]] tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy lived in York County along the York River until the 1630s. Escalating conflicts with the expanding English colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] caused them to move to the west. The English developed a village settlement near the village of Chiskiack and adopted its name. (It is sometimes spelled \"Kiskiack\"). This became part of the developments included within the present-day [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] near Yorktown and are included in the military base. Cheesecake Road and Cheesecake Cemetery are also within the base; their names are thought to derive from the early Chiskiack people.\n\nAfter the Powhatan moved his capital from this area in 1609, the site believed to have been Werowocomoco near [[Purtan Bay]] was lost to history. It was rediscovered in the early 21st century, and has been under continuing [[archaeological]] study projects. The discoveries and ongoing research led by the [[College of William and Mary]] hold great promise in expanding understanding of the lives of the Native Americans in the area during that era of York County's history.\n\n{{details|Powhatan Confederacy}}\n\n===Ajac\u00e1n Mission===\nIn 1570, Spanish [[Jesuit]] priests founded the [[Ajac\u00e1n Mission]] in this area. They were guided by interpreter [[Don Luis]], a Native American from this area who had been taken captive by an earlier expedition. He was taken to Spain and later to Mexico, where he was baptized as Don Luis and educated in the Jesuit system. Ten years later after returning to Virginia, he soon abandoned the Spanish group. In February 1571 he led an attack on the Jesuits; all of the party except a young boy were killed. The following year, a Spanish force returned to the region for punishment and reclaimed the youth Alonso. The Spanish did not attempt another mission in this part of North America.\n\n===Virginia Colony===\nAbout 30 years later, English colonists arrived and established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 on the southern shore of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]]. In 1619, the area which is now York County was included in two of the four incorporations (or \"citties\") of the proprietary [[Virginia Company of London]] which were known as [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]].\n\nIn 1634, what is now York County was formed as [[Charles River Shire]], one of the eight original [[shires of Virginia]]<ref name=\"archive.org\"/> and named for [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. Charles River Shire took its name from the younger son of King [[James I of England|James I]]. In the 21st century, it was one of the five original shires considered extant in essentially its same political form, making it one of the oldest counties in the United States.\n\nIn 1643 Charles River County and the Charles River (also named for the king) were changed to York County<ref name=\"William Waller Hening 1809 page 249\"/> and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], respectively. The river, county, and town of [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] are believed to have been named for [[York]], a city in [[Northern England]].\n\n===Yorktown===\n[[File:YorkHallYorktown.jpg|thumb|175px|York Hall]]\n\nThe first courthouse and jail were located near what is now [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] although the community, founded as a port for shipping [[tobacco]] to Europe, as variously called Port of York, Borough of York, York, Town of York, until Yorktown was established in 1691, when the [[House of Burgesses]] required each county to designate a port of entry and build warehousing. Although never formally incorporated as a town, Yorktown is the [[county seat]] of York County. The only town ever incorporated within the county's boundaries was [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which was incorporated in 1952 and became an [[independent city]] in 1975.\n\n[[Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Porto Bello]], the hunting lodge of [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], last royal governor of Virginia, still stands on the grounds of Camp Peary. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIt is most famous as the site of the surrender of General [[Cornwallis]] to General [[George Washington]] in 1781, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Yorktown also figured prominently in the [[American Civil War]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in 1862.\n\n===Other communities, boundary changes===\nThe small unincorporated town of [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] and a nearby area known as \"the Reservation\" were taken over by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War I]]. This is now part of the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]]. Many of the displaced [[African American]] landowners were eventually relocated to [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], along the border between York and James counties.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the sites of three other small York County towns were absorbed into U.S. government reservations. [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]] was the site of a [[World War I]] munitions facility operated by the [[DuPont]] company, and was made a part of [[Cheatham Annex]]) in 1943. To the west of Penniman, which is reported to have had a peak population of 15,000, on land which is now part of [[Camp Peary]], the smaller towns of [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]] and [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]] were located. Much of Magruder's population and at least one church were relocated to Grove, increasing its population.\n\nIn 1949, the county grew by {{convert|4|sqmi|km2|0}}, as land in that amount was ceded to York County by neighboring [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]]. At the time, the move was part of a successful attempt by Warwick County to block an annexation suit brought by the [[Newport News, Virginia|City of Newport News]]. Warwick eventually consolidated with the city in 1958 by mutual agreement. (The reduction in size allowed Warwick County to claim an exemption from the proposed annexation at the time).\n\nIn 1975, the county lost {{convert|15.5|sqmi|km2|1}} of land as the [[incorporated town]] of [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which had been within York County, became an [[independent city]], although ties between the county and the new city remained close. Over 40 years later, they continue to share courts, sheriff's office, a jail, and some constitutional services.\n\nYork County also adjoins another small independent city, Williamsburg, which was long located within James City County. In the 20th century, some areas of York County adjacent to Williamsburg were lost to the growing small city through annexation.\n\n===York County in the late 20th and early 21st centuries===\nFrom the 1980s to modern times, York County experienced a rapid transition from a rural county to a bedroom community for the neighboring core cities of [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].\n\nIn modern times, York County and Yorktown in particular are part of an important historical area of attractions known as the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]], which includes Yorktown, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. Yorktown is the northern terminus of the scenic [[Colonial Parkway]] operated by the U.S. [[National Park Service]] which links the three. In 2005, the county completed Riverwalk Landing, a successful pseudo-colonial waterfront development at Yorktown to revitalize the previously deteriorating beach and town district and complement the 2007 celebration of Jamestown.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Entering Coleman Bridge from Yorktown Side.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Coleman Bridge connects York County and neighboring Gloucester County]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|215|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|105|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} (51.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the third-smallest county in Virginia by land area. It is near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAlso, in terms of population clusters, the County is divided by a vast expanse of federal land in the midsection of the county, much of which is densely wooded park land, and military training areas. The southern portion of the County is dense with suburban developments and contains the majority of the county's population. There is little room for additional growth in the southern portion of York County because it is a relatively small area, and was essentially fully developed by the early 2000s. A small industrial area along the York River just East of Yorktown contains a power plant owned by Dominion Virginia Power, and a petroleum terminal on the former site of an oil refinery that ceased operation in 2010.\n\nThe northern portion is more connected with the Williamsburg community than Yorktown and, although less populous than the south, is also fairly dense. Having not seen a significant amount of growth until recently, the northern portion is now seeing the development of new residential communities and shopping areas.\n\n===Adjacent counties and cities===\n\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n* [[Gloucester County, Virginia]] (north)\n* [[Mathews County, Virginia]] (northeast)\n* [[Northampton County, Virginia]] (east)\n* [[Poquoson, Virginia]] (southeast)\n|\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]] (south)\n* [[Newport News, Virginia]] (southwest)\n* [[James City County, Virginia]] (west)\n* [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] (west)\n|}\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Colonial National Historical Park]] (part)\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{climate chart\n| Yorktown, VA <ref>http://www.usa.com/yorktown-va-weather.htm#HistoricalTemperature</ref>\n|28.3|48.1|3.6\n|30.5|51.6|3.2\n|36.6|59.9|4.3\n|45.4|70.1|3.3\n|54.6|77.4|3.9\n|63.6|85.1|3.5\n|68|88.8|4.6\n|66.3|86.6|4.7\n|59.7|80.8|4.2\n|48.4|71.2|3.4\n|39.7|61.6|3.3\n|31.5|51.6|3.4\n|units = imperial\n|clear = both }}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 5233\n|1800= 3231\n|1810= 5187\n|1820= 4384\n|1830= 5354\n|1840= 4720\n|1850= 4460\n|1860= 4949\n|1870= 7198\n|1880= 7349\n|1890= 7596\n|1900= 7482\n|1910= 7757\n|1920= 8046\n|1930= 7615\n|1940= 8857\n|1950= 11750\n|1960= 21583\n|1970= 33203\n|1980= 35463\n|1990= 42422\n|2000= 56297\n|2010= 65464\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=67846\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Located along the York River, small portions of each base extend into adjacent James City County as well.\n\nThe [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] was originally established during [[World War I]] by order of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and now includes the formerly separate Cheatham Annex Supply Complex. [[Camp Peary]] was established during [[World War II]] as a [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] Training Base. As the war progressed, it became valuable to the Allied Forces to house sensitive prisoners-of-war from captured German naval vessels; it was important for Nazi authorities to be unaware of their capture, since that also meant secret code books thought lost-at sea may also have been compromised. Many of these POWs made Virginia and the United States their new homeland after the War. Separating these two large military reservations is [[Queen's Creek]], which originates in the western reaches of the county and drains to the York River.\n\nYork County contains some [[Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia|former towns]] including Yorke, and a large number when the military reservations were created in the first half of the 20th century. These include the original [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] (known locally as \"the Reservation\"), [[Halstead's Point, Virginia|Halstead's Point]], [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]], [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]], and [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]]. Many relocated residents and their descendants, many of whom were farmers and watermen, now live in such places as Yorktown, Gloucester, [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]], [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], and [[Lightfoot, Virginia|Lightfoot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Virginia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Publications===\n* McCartney, Martha W.

Yorktown is one of the three points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]]. It is the site of the last battle and surrender of British forces in 1781 at the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when the patriots gained independence from [[Great Britain]].\n\nIn modern times, several important U.S. military installations have been developed in the county. It also has miles of waterfront residential and recreational areas. York County adjoins the [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] [[theme park]] and includes within its borders the affiliated [[Water Country USA]] [[water park]], the [[Yorktown Riverfront]] area, [[Yorktown Battlefield and Visitor Center]] and [[American Revolution Museum at Yorktown]]. Yorktown is linked by the [[National Park Service|National Park Service's]] bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and historic attractions at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Heritage tourism to the Historic Triangle draws international visitors and is a major economic activity for the county.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American Indians===\nThe area which is now York County was long inhabited by succeeding cultures of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. These were [[hunter-gatherer]] groups during the late [[Woodland Period]] (1000 BC to AD 1000) and earlier.\n\nBy the late 16th century, much of the [[Atlantic coastal plain|coastal plain]] draining to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] of the current Commonwealth of Virginia was called ''[[Tenakomakah]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], meaning \"densely inhabited land\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Capossela|first1=Julie Ann|title=Jamestown from a Non-Western Perspective|url=http://www.wm.edu/niahd/journals/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965 |website=wm.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022073344/http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965&svr=www|archivedate=22 October 2008|date=2 February 2006}} ''c.f.'' [[Anishinaabe language]]: ''danakamigaa'': \"activity-grounds\", ''i.e.'' \"land of much events [for the People]\"</ref> The historic tribes of the Tidewater area spoke related Algonquian languages. Other Algonquian-speaking peoples occupied coastal areas north and into present-day Canada, as well as to the South.\n\nIn the Virginia region, a [[weroance]] (or chief) named [[Wahunsunacock]] (1547\u20131618) of the [[Powhatan people]] created a powerful empire of eastern-Algonquian language-speaking peoples known as the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]; he conquered or allied by agreement with approximately 30 tribes. Known as the Powhatan, meaning the paramount chief, he was from a village also known as \"Powhatan\", near the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] of the [[James River]]. (The Powhatan Hill neighborhood of the current city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was developed near this former site.) Chief Powhatan later established a second capital village, known as [[Werowocomoco]], in a centrally located position in Tenakomakah. Rediscovered in the early 21st century by archeological work, it was located along the north bank of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in present-day [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]].<ref>[http://powhatan.wm.edu/history/index.htm Powhatan: \"Powhatan: Werowocomoco\"], College of William and Mary</ref>\n\nThe [[Chiskiack]] tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy lived in York County along the York River until the 1630s. Escalating conflicts with the expanding English colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] caused them to move to the west. The English developed a village settlement near the village of Chiskiack and adopted its name. (It is sometimes spelled \"Kiskiack\"). This became part of the developments included within the present-day [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] near Yorktown and are included in the military base. Cheesecake Road and Cheesecake Cemetery are also within the base; their names are thought to derive from the early Chiskiack people.\n\nAfter the Powhatan moved his capital from this area in 1609, the site believed to have been Werowocomoco near [[Purtan Bay]] was lost to history. It was rediscovered in the early 21st century, and has been under continuing [[archaeological]] study projects. The discoveries and ongoing research led by the [[College of William and Mary]] hold great promise in expanding understanding of the lives of the Native Americans in the area during that era of York County's history.\n\n{{details|Powhatan Confederacy}}\n\n===Ajac\u00e1n Mission===\nIn 1570, Spanish [[Jesuit]] priests founded the [[Ajac\u00e1n Mission]] in this area. They were guided by interpreter [[Don Luis]], a Native American from this area who had been taken captive by an earlier expedition. He was taken to Spain and later to Mexico, where he was baptized as Don Luis and educated in the Jesuit system. Ten years later after returning to Virginia, he soon abandoned the Spanish group. In February 1571 he led an attack on the Jesuits; all of the party except a young boy were killed. The following year, a Spanish force returned to the region for punishment and reclaimed the youth Alonso. The Spanish did not attempt another mission in this part of North America.\n\n===Virginia Colony===\nAbout 30 years later, English colonists arrived and established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 on the southern shore of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]]. In 1619, the area which is now York County was included in two of the four incorporations (or \"citties\") of the proprietary [[Virginia Company of London]] which were known as [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]].\n\nIn 1634, what is now York County was formed as [[Charles River Shire]], one of the eight original [[shires of Virginia]]<ref name=\"archive.org\"/> and named for [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. Charles River Shire took its name from the younger son of King [[James I of England|James I]]. In the 21st century, it was one of the five original shires considered extant in essentially its same political form, making it one of the oldest counties in the United States.\n\nIn 1643 Charles River County and the Charles River (also named for the king) were changed to York County<ref name=\"William Waller Hening 1809 page 249\"/> and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], respectively. The river, county, and town of [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] are believed to have been named for [[York]], a city in [[Northern England]].\n\n===Yorktown===\n[[File:YorkHallYorktown.jpg|thumb|175px|York Hall]]\n\nThe first courthouse and jail were located near what is now [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] although the community, founded as a port for shipping [[tobacco]] to Europe, as variously called Port of York, Borough of York, York, Town of York, until Yorktown was established in 1691, when the [[House of Burgesses]] required each county to designate a port of entry and build warehousing. Although never formally incorporated as a town, Yorktown is the [[county seat]] of York County. The only town ever incorporated within the county's boundaries was [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which was incorporated in 1952 and became an [[independent city]] in 1975.\n\n[[Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Porto Bello]], the hunting lodge of [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], last royal governor of Virginia, still stands on the grounds of Camp Peary. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIt is most famous as the site of the surrender of General [[Cornwallis]] to General [[George Washington]] in 1781, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Yorktown also figured prominently in the [[American Civil War]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in 1862.\n\n===Other communities, boundary changes===\nThe small unincorporated town of [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] and a nearby area known as \"the Reservation\" were taken over by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War I]]. This is now part of the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]]. Many of the displaced [[African American]] landowners were eventually relocated to [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], along the border between York and James counties.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the sites of three other small York County towns were absorbed into U.S. government reservations. [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]] was the site of a [[World War I]] munitions facility operated by the [[DuPont]] company, and was made a part of [[Cheatham Annex]]) in 1943. To the west of Penniman, which is reported to have had a peak population of 15,000, on land which is now part of [[Camp Peary]], the smaller towns of [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]] and [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]] were located. Much of Magruder's population and at least one church were relocated to Grove, increasing its population.\n\nIn 1949, the county grew by {{convert|4|sqmi|km2|0}}, as land in that amount was ceded to York County by neighboring [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]]. At the time, the move was part of a successful attempt by Warwick County to block an annexation suit brought by the [[Newport News, Virginia|City of Newport News]]. Warwick eventually consolidated with the city in 1958 by mutual agreement. (The reduction in size allowed Warwick County to claim an exemption from the proposed annexation at the time).\n\nIn 1975, the county lost {{convert|15.5|sqmi|km2|1}} of land as the [[incorporated town]] of [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which had been within York County, became an [[independent city]], although ties between the county and the new city remained close. Over 40 years later, they continue to share courts, sheriff's office, a jail, and some constitutional services.\n\nYork County also adjoins another small independent city, Williamsburg, which was long located within James City County. In the 20th century, some areas of York County adjacent to Williamsburg were lost to the growing small city through annexation.\n\n===York County in the late 20th and early 21st centuries===\nFrom the 1980s to modern times, York County experienced a rapid transition from a rural county to a bedroom community for the neighboring core cities of [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].\n\nIn modern times, York County and Yorktown in particular are part of an important historical area of attractions known as the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]], which includes Yorktown, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. Yorktown is the northern terminus of the scenic [[Colonial Parkway]] operated by the U.S. [[National Park Service]] which links the three. In 2005, the county completed Riverwalk Landing, a successful pseudo-colonial waterfront development at Yorktown to revitalize the previously deteriorating beach and town district and complement the 2007 celebration of Jamestown.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Entering Coleman Bridge from Yorktown Side.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Coleman Bridge connects York County and neighboring Gloucester County]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|215|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|105|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} (51.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the third-smallest county in Virginia by land area. It is near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAlso, in terms of population clusters, the County is divided by a vast expanse of federal land in the midsection of the county, much of which is densely wooded park land, and military training areas. The southern portion of the County is dense with suburban developments and contains the majority of the county's population. There is little room for additional growth in the southern portion of York County because it is a relatively small area, and was essentially fully developed by the early 2000s. A small industrial area along the York River just East of Yorktown contains a power plant owned by Dominion Virginia Power, and a petroleum terminal on the former site of an oil refinery that ceased operation in 2010.\n\nThe northern portion is more connected with the Williamsburg community than Yorktown and, although less populous than the south, is also fairly dense. Having not seen a significant amount of growth until recently, the northern portion is now seeing the development of new residential communities and shopping areas.\n\n===Adjacent counties and cities===\n\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n* [[Gloucester County, Virginia]] (north)\n* [[Mathews County, Virginia]] (northeast)\n* [[Northampton County, Virginia]] (east)\n* [[Poquoson, Virginia]] (southeast)\n|\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]] (south)\n* [[Newport News, Virginia]] (southwest)\n* [[James City County, Virginia]] (west)\n* [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] (west)\n|}\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Colonial National Historical Park]] (part)\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{climate chart\n| Yorktown, VA <ref>http://www.usa.com/yorktown-va-weather.htm#HistoricalTemperature</ref>\n|28.3|48.1|3.6\n|30.5|51.6|3.2\n|36.6|59.9|4.3\n|45.4|70.1|3.3\n|54.6|77.4|3.9\n|63.6|85.1|3.5\n|68|88.8|4.6\n|66.3|86.6|4.7\n|59.7|80.8|4.2\n|48.4|71.2|3.4\n|39.7|61.6|3.3\n|31.5|51.6|3.4\n|units = imperial\n|clear = both }}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 5233\n|1800= 3231\n|1810= 5187\n|1820= 4384\n|1830= 5354\n|1840= 4720\n|1850= 4460\n|1860= 4949\n|1870= 7198\n|1880= 7349\n|1890= 7596\n|1900= 7482\n|1910= 7757\n|1920= 8046\n|1930= 7615\n|1940= 8857\n|1950= 11750\n|1960= 21583\n|1970= 33203\n|1980= 35463\n|1990= 42422\n|2000= 56297\n|2010= 65464\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=67846\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Located along the York River, small portions of each base extend into adjacent James City County as well.\n\nThe [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] was originally established during [[World War I]] by order of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and now includes the formerly separate Cheatham Annex Supply Complex. [[Camp Peary]] was established during [[World War II]] as a [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] Training Base. As the war progressed, it became valuable to the Allied Forces to house sensitive prisoners-of-war from captured German naval vessels; it was important for Nazi authorities to be unaware of their capture, since that also meant secret code books thought lost-at sea may also have been compromised. Many of these POWs made Virginia and the United States their new homeland after the War. Separating these two large military reservations is [[Queen's Creek]], which originates in the western reaches of the county and drains to the York River.\n\nYork County contains some [[Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia|former towns]] including Yorke, and a large number when the military reservations were created in the first half of the 20th century. These include the original [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] (known locally as \"the Reservation\"), [[Halstead's Point, Virginia|Halstead's Point]], [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]], [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]], and [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]]. Many relocated residents and their descendants, many of whom were farmers and watermen, now live in such places as Yorktown, Gloucester, [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]], [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], and [[Lightfoot, Virginia|Lightfoot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Virginia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Publications===\n* McCartney, Martha W.

It was released on September 29, 2009 by [[Island Records]]. After promotion for her previous album, ''[[E=MC\u00b2 (Mariah Carey album)|E=MC\u00b2]]'' (2008) ended, Carey began to work on a new album, producing songs with [[The-Dream|Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash]] and [[Tricky Stewart|Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart]], and revealed the album's title through Twitter. Carey said that ''Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel'' would have \"big ballads\", and that \"each song is its own snapshot of a moment in a story\".\n\nFive singles were released to promote the album. The [[lead single]], \"[[Obsessed (Mariah Carey song)|Obsessed]]\", became the album's  most successful song, peaking at number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and reaching the top twenty in Japan, Canada and Australia and the top ten in Italy and France. The second single, \"[[I Want to Know What Love Is#Mariah Carey version|I Want to Know What Love Is]]\", reached number 60 on ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and topped the [[Brasil Hot 100 Airplay]] chart for twenty-seven non-consecutive weeks. Other singles released were \"[[H.A.T.E.U.]]\", \"[[Up Out My Face]]\", and \"[[Angels Cry (song)|Angels Cry]]\", with the last two being originally intended for the subsequently-cancelled remix album, ''Angels Advocate''.\n\nUpon its release, ''Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel'' received positive reviews from music critics. They felt that \"their team-up with Carey is canny; Stewart and Nash loosen up the diva's sometimes overblown on-record persona\", and also \"one of her most sonically consistent\". Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 168,000 copies sold in its first week, and peaked within the top ten in other five countries. To promote the album, Carey made a pre-show in [[Madison Square Garden]] in 2009, embarked on the [[Angels Advocate Tour]] (2010), and performed on several television programs, including ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]''.\n\n==Background and production==\nIn early 2009, singer and songwriter [[The-Dream]] stated that he and Carey had already begun working on her next studio album: \"I think it's about just writing an album that includes the focus of all the hits that she's had. She can't take a loss; she has to do everything to the T. So it's basically like we're trying to make a greatest hits album without using the greatest hits\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/mariah-carey/news/91254-mariah-carey-works-with-husband |title=  MTV: Carey Works with Nick Cannon & The-Dream |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=interview}}</ref> In February 2009, The-Dream told to MySpace Music that he and Carey had finished seven songs for the album.\n\nIn May, Carey revealed that she was calling the album ''Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel'' because it was going to be \"very personal and dedicated to the fans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/1862589658 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: Bcuz I Love U, I want u to |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> She says that she chose to use three images for the cover art because \"there are a lot of different emotions and stories revealed on this album\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2330849884 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: The reason I chose to use |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> Carey also stated that she loves \"the whole album\" and she's \"completely immersed in it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2087974810 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: Seriously, this is one of |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> On June 16, Carey said on Twitter that there will be \"big ballads\" on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2201876796 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: I know everyone has their |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> Carey also said that she \"tried to make something for all who love [[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|''Butterfly'']], and even older albums\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2096136483 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: So\"Obsessed\" is an uptempo |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2096184531 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: ..

Despite the majority of the project being written and produced by Carey, Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, the main goal was to avoid having a \"redundant or stale\" album.<ref name=amazon />\nIn an interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' Carey described the sound of her new album: \"Each song is its own snapshot of a moment in a story. But overall, the vibe is R&B hip-hop with a lot of slow jams. [...] Each song has its own mood; some flow seamlessly into each other, and that was the purpose, and others are very different. The album has a sense of humor, [you can hear me laughing out loud at certain points], but it also has deep and introspective moments.\"<ref>[http://www.elle.com/Entertainment/Movies-TV/Mariah-Carey Elle Magazine, Mariah], September 9, 2009</ref>\n\n==Concept and packaging==\nDuring an interview with music retailer [[Amazon.com]], Carey revealed her inspiration and motivation for the album. \"Each song tells its own story. Each one is like an intimate conversation or entry in a private diary. A lot of the songs reflect specific, different times in my life, actual events that happened to me, some of which are from way back in the past. Others were inspired by movies or from a friend of mine that may have told me their story.<ref name=amazon>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DSM8UC Amazon.com: Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel].

This was due to the inclusion of two discs, the first housed the album itself whilst the second housed an enhanced CD featuring the music video for lead single \"Obsessed\" as well as the video for \"Obsessed\" (official remix featuring [[Gucci Mane]]) and three other remixes. The packaging includes a 34-page [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'']] mini-magazine which takes an exclusive in-depth look at Carey's life and career.<ref name=amazon /> The mini-magazine is mixed in with lyrics and other traditional liner-note materials as well as upscale ads to cut the production costs of the booklet.

It was released on September 29, 2009 by [[Island Records]]. After promotion for her previous album, ''[[E=MC\u00b2 (Mariah Carey album)|E=MC\u00b2]]'' (2008) ended, Carey began to work on a new album, producing songs with [[The-Dream|Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash]] and [[Tricky Stewart|Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart]], and revealed the album's title through Twitter. Carey said that ''Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel'' would have \"big ballads\", and that \"each song is its own snapshot of a moment in a story\".\n\nFive singles were released to promote the album. The [[lead single]], \"[[Obsessed (Mariah Carey song)|Obsessed]]\", became the album's  most successful song, peaking at number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and reaching the top twenty in Japan, Canada and Australia and the top ten in Italy and France. The second single, \"[[I Want to Know What Love Is#Mariah Carey version|I Want to Know What Love Is]]\", reached number 60 on ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and topped the [[Brasil Hot 100 Airplay]] chart for twenty-seven non-consecutive weeks. Other singles released were \"[[H.A.T.E.U.]]\", \"[[Up Out My Face]]\", and \"[[Angels Cry (song)|Angels Cry]]\", with the last two being originally intended for the subsequently-cancelled remix album, ''Angels Advocate''.\n\nUpon its release, ''Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel'' received positive reviews from music critics. They felt that \"their team-up with Carey is canny; Stewart and Nash loosen up the diva's sometimes overblown on-record persona\", and also \"one of her most sonically consistent\". Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 168,000 copies sold in its first week, and peaked within the top ten in other five countries. To promote the album, Carey made a pre-show in [[Madison Square Garden]] in 2009, embarked on the [[Angels Advocate Tour]] (2010), and performed on several television programs, including ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]''.\n\n==Background and production==\nIn early 2009, singer and songwriter [[The-Dream]] stated that he and Carey had already begun working on her next studio album: \"I think it's about just writing an album that includes the focus of all the hits that she's had. She can't take a loss; she has to do everything to the T. So it's basically like we're trying to make a greatest hits album without using the greatest hits\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/mariah-carey/news/91254-mariah-carey-works-with-husband |title=  MTV: Carey Works with Nick Cannon & The-Dream |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=interview}}</ref> In February 2009, The-Dream told to MySpace Music that he and Carey had finished seven songs for the album.\n\nIn May, Carey revealed that she was calling the album ''Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel'' because it was going to be \"very personal and dedicated to the fans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/1862589658 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: Bcuz I Love U, I want u to |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> She says that she chose to use three images for the cover art because \"there are a lot of different emotions and stories revealed on this album\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2330849884 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: The reason I chose to use |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> Carey also stated that she loves \"the whole album\" and she's \"completely immersed in it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2087974810 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: Seriously, this is one of |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> On June 16, Carey said on Twitter that there will be \"big ballads\" on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2201876796 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: I know everyone has their |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> Carey also said that she \"tried to make something for all who love [[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|''Butterfly'']], and even older albums\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2096136483 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: So\"Obsessed\" is an uptempo |via=Twitter |accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/2096184531 |title=Twitter / Mariah Carey: ..

Despite the majority of the project being written and produced by Carey, Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, the main goal was to avoid having a \"redundant or stale\" album.<ref name=amazon />\nIn an interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' Carey described the sound of her new album: \"Each song is its own snapshot of a moment in a story. But overall, the vibe is R&B hip-hop with a lot of slow jams. [...] Each song has its own mood; some flow seamlessly into each other, and that was the purpose, and others are very different. The album has a sense of humor, [you can hear me laughing out loud at certain points], but it also has deep and introspective moments.\"<ref>[http://www.elle.com/Entertainment/Movies-TV/Mariah-Carey Elle Magazine, Mariah], September 9, 2009</ref>\n\n==Concept and packaging==\nDuring an interview with music retailer [[Amazon.com]], Carey revealed her inspiration and motivation for the album. \"Each song tells its own story. Each one is like an intimate conversation or entry in a private diary. A lot of the songs reflect specific, different times in my life, actual events that happened to me, some of which are from way back in the past. Others were inspired by movies or from a friend of mine that may have told me their story.<ref name=amazon>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DSM8UC Amazon.com: Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel].

This was due to the inclusion of two discs, the first housed the album itself whilst the second housed an enhanced CD featuring the music video for lead single \"Obsessed\" as well as the video for \"Obsessed\" (official remix featuring [[Gucci Mane]]) and three other remixes. The packaging includes a 34-page [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'']] mini-magazine which takes an exclusive in-depth look at Carey's life and career.<ref name=amazon /> The mini-magazine is mixed in with lyrics and other traditional liner-note materials as well as upscale ads to cut the production costs of the booklet.

[[Entomological warfare|Entomological (insect) warfare]] is a subtype of BW. \n\nBiological warfare is distinct from [[nuclear warfare]], [[chemical warfare]] and [[radiological warfare]], which together with biological warfare make up [[CBRN defense|CBRN]] , the military initialism for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs). None of these are considered [[conventional weapons]], which are deployed primarily for their [[explosion|explosive]], [[kinetic energy|kinetic]], or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] potential.\n\nBiological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments. Like some [[chemical weapon]]s, biological weapons may also be useful as [[area denial weapon]]s. These agents may be lethal or [[Non-lethal weapon|non-lethal]], and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by [[nation state]]s or by non-national groups.

This is because the potential organism has an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving terrorists a lead.\n\nA technique called Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeat ([[CRISPR]]) is now so cheap and widely available that scientists fear that the amateurs will start experimenting with them. In this technique, a DNA sequence is cut off and replaced with a new sequence or code that codes for a particular protein or characteristic, which could potentially show up in the required organism. Though this technique is a breakthrough and is commendable, it can cause serious issues and potential danger if used by people with wrong intentions. Concerns have emerged regarding do-it-yourself biology research organizations due to their associated risk that a rogue amateur DIY researcher could attempt to develop dangerous bioweapons using genome editing technology.<ref>Millet, P., Kuiken, T., & Grushkin, D.

The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program. EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=\"sunshine\">\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002. Retrieved 25 December 2008.</ref> The insects then act as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that the destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotic (epidemics among plants).

Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.\n\nThe traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.\n\nThe growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a \"sandwich immunoassay\", in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|title=Physorg.com, \"Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons\", 12:50 EST, 10 August 2006.|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231844/http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the company [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has designed [[BiosparQ|Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment]] (BiosparQ).

EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=\"sunshine\">\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections.

In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.\n\nThe traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.\n\nThe growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials.

Despite originally being a sympathizer for the right of [[secession]], she fought bravely on both sides. She followed her husband, William Blalock, and joined the [[Confederate States of America|CSA's]] [[26th North Carolina Regiment]], disguising herself as a young man and calling herself Samuel Blalock. The couple eventually escaped by crossing Confederate lines and joining the Union partisans in the mountains of western North Carolina. During the last years of the war, she was a pro-Union [[Partisan (military)|marauder]] raiding the [[Appalachia]] region. Today she is one of the most remembered female combatants of the Civil War.\n\n==Early life and marriage==\nSarah Pritchard was born March 10, 1839, in [[Caldwell County, North Carolina]]<ref name=Eggleston>Eggleston, Larry G.

There, she attended a single-room schoolhouse.\n\nShe became a close friend of William McKesson Blalock, nicknamed \"Keith\" after a contemporary boxer, due to his skill at boxing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5V0rAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&dq=Rebels+in+Blue:+The+Story+of+Keith+and+Malinda+Blalock.#v=onepage&q=Rebels%20in%20Blue:%20The%20Story%20of%20Keith%20and%20Malinda%20Blalock.&f=false|title=Rebels in Blue: The Story of Keith and Malinda Blalock|last=Stevens|first=Peter F.|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=1999|isbn=9781461709312|location=|pages=12|language=en}}</ref>  Despite their families having been rivals for many years, she married William in 1861, aged 19.<ref name=Eggleston />\n\n==Civil War==\nAfter the Civil War began, the western North Carolina communities in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] were divided over their political adherences. Neighbors and families argued with each other. Originally Malinda expressed her sympathy for the right of secession, but Keith and his stepfather Austin Coffey were ardent unionists, although Keith was opposed to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], and they had planned to desert toward the Union someday. The Blalocks' opposing views did not affect their marriage.\n\t\nWhen the Confederate 26th North Carolina Infantry, commanded by Colonel [[Zebulon Vance]], showed up in the region to recruit, Keith began to plan an escape across the frontier from his local political enemies. He was hesitant about whether to flee directly toward [[Kentucky]] or enroll temporarily with the Confederate Army to desert across the enemy lines later.\n\t\nKeith also considered the consequences of an untimely escape on Malinda, fearful that local distaste of his actions would cause her to be scapegoated in his absence. Spurred by the good pay in serving the \"Greys\", Keith trusted that he would receive a light military commission, possibly to northern [[Virginia]] for example, from where it would be easy to desert to the nearest \"Yankee\" regiment. He accompanied his neighbors to the recruitment office, signing up with the Confederate infantry.\n\n===Samuel Blalock===\nFearing for Malinda, Keith had made sure that all local secessionists would see him leaving with the Confederates. However, when arriving at the enlistment gathering at the town's railroad depot, someone began to walk by his side, a mysterious recruit who was wearing a [[forage cap]] and had a particularly little physique and delicate features.  Surprisingly, \"He\" turned out to be Malinda, his own wife.<ref name=\"Eggleston\" /> \n\nMalinda was officially registered on March 20 of 1862 at [[Lenoir, North Carolina]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X2GeBUmW_MgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Women+in+the+American+Civil+War.#v=onepage&q=blalock&f=false|title=Women in the American Civil War|last=Mays|first=Gwen Thomas|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=9781851096008|editor-last=Frank|editor-first=Lisa Tendrich|location=|pages=132|language=en}}</ref> as \"Samuel 'Sammy' Blalock\", Keith's 20-year-old brother.<ref name=\"Eggleston\" />  This document and her discharge papers survive as one of the few existing records of a female soldier from North Carolina, from the many ones who may have actually served.\n\n===Confederate military life===\nTheir plan to defect proved unworkable because, already before their arrival, the 26th had fought its biggest battle, which was the loss to the Union of the town of [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] in eastern North Carolina. Instead of moving to Virginia's battlefront, they remained stationed far from the northern frontier at [[Kinston, North Carolina]], on the [[Neuse River]]. \n\t\nWhile maintaining her hidden identity, Malinda was a good soldier. One of their assistant surgeons, named Underwood, pointed out that \"her disguise was never penetrated. She drilled and did the duties of a soldier as any other member of the Company, and was very adept at learning the manual and drill.\"<ref name=\"cojoweb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cojoweb.com/malinda_blaylock.html|title=Keith and Malinda Blaylock (Blaylock)|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|accessdate=22 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612013745/http://www.cojoweb.com/malinda_blaylock.html|archive-date=12 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\t\nLater Keith became a respected brevet sergeant, ordering Malinda then to \"stay close to him\". They fought in three battles together, but \"Samuel\"'s true identity remained still unknown.\n\n===The desertion===\nIn April 1862, Keith's squad received the order to range the Neuse River's region by fording it during the night, to detect any enemy guarding-posts. Their ultimate objective was to track down the location of a particular Union regiment commanded by US General [[Ambrose Burnside]].\n\t\nAt one point of the mission, a hard skirmish began. Most of Keith's squad retreated to safety, crossing back over the Neuse River. However, after regrouping, it was found that \"Samuel\" was missing. Keith promptly returned to the battlefield. He found Malinda clinging to a pine and bleeding profusely, with a bullet lodged in her left shoulder.<ref name=Eggleston />  \n\t\nAs quickly as he could, Keith carried Malinda back to the 26th. He brought her to the infirmary tent where she was attended by its surgeon, Dr. Thomas J. Boykin. The bullet was successfully removed, but the truth about \"Samuel\" was discovered during the medical examination. \n\t\nAfter obtaining a promise from Boykin that he would spare them some time before reporting, Keith went to a nearby field of [[poison ivy]]. He stripped his clothes and flailed through the underbrush for about half an hour. \n\t\nThe next morning, he suffered a persistent fever while his affected skin was inflamed and covered by blisters. Keith told the doctors that he had a serious recurrent illness which was highly contagious, adding the ailment of a hernia also. Fearing an outbreak of smallpox, the doctors discharged Keith expeditiously from the regiment and confined him to his tent.\n\t\nMalinda would remain stranded in the camp because her recent wound didn't yet merit a discharge. She decided to confront Colonel Vance once and for all. She offered herself as a volunteer to aid the sick Sergeant Keith on his return to Watauga. Vance's response was a clear \"no\", communicating to \"Samuel\" that instead \"he\" would be his new personal orderly. \n\t\nAt that point Malinda decided to tell Vance the truth. Vance's first reaction was of disbelief while calling the surgeon and commenting to him: \"Oh Surgeon, have I a case for you!\" However, the physician corroborated Malinda's statement. Immediately, Vance discharged \"Samuel\" and demanded the restitution of \"his\" original enlisting reward of 50 dollars.\n\n==Marauders==\nMalinda and her husband could return to Watauga then. Once there, though, Keith was soon required by the local Confederate forces, which demanded that he enlist again\u2014after noting his healthy status\u2014and return to the front. Otherwise, he would be judged by the new Confederate laws of military draft.\n\t\nTherefore, Malinda and Keith fled again, toward [[Grandfather Mountain]]. There, they found more local deserters in the same condition. They stayed with them until the Confederate Army intercepted the group, injuring Keith in his arm.\n\t\nMalinda and Keith moved then to [[Tennessee]], where they joined the US-[[10th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|10th Michigan Cavalry]] of Colonel [[George Washington Kirk]], who was later succeeded by General [[George Stoneman]]. For some time, Keith accomplished some administrative chores as a recruitment agent. \n\t\nHowever, the couple decided to enter in action again, this time for the Union, by joining Colonel Kirk's voluntary guerrilla squadrons, the [[3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry]], on scouting and raiding missions throughout the Appalachia region of North Carolina.\n\t\nWith Malinda next to him, Keith began in [[Blowing Rock, North Carolina]], as one of the leaders of the guides for the [[Watauga Underground Railroad]]. This was a way of escape from the Confederate jail at [[Salisbury, North Carolina]], which was the largest facility of the state. Keith had to guide the escaped Union soldiers to safety in Tennessee. However, from 1863 on, the skirmishes against the patrolling enemy forces in the region were increasingly tougher. \n\t\nKeith's pro-union guerrilla forces began to raid Watauga County. Because once they had been harshly humbled by the southern loyalists, the outlaws pitilessly raided their farms, stole and killed.

Despite originally being a sympathizer for the right of [[secession]], she fought bravely on both sides. She followed her husband and joined the CSA's [[26th North Carolina Regiment]], disguising herself as a young man and calling herself Samuel Blalock. The couple eventually escaped by crossing Confederate lines and joining the Union partisans in the mountains of western North Carolina. During the last years of the war, she was a pro-Union [[Partisan (military)|marauder]] raiding the [[Appalachia]] region. Today she is one of the most remembered female combatants of the Civil War.\n\n==Early life and marriage==\nSarah Pritchard was born March 10, 1839, in [[Caldwell County, North Carolina]]<ref name=Eggleston>Eggleston, Larry G.

There, she attended a single-room schoolhouse.\n\nShe became a close friend of William McKesson Blalock, nicknamed \"Keith\" after a contemporary boxer, due to his skill at boxing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5V0rAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&dq=Rebels+in+Blue:+The+Story+of+Keith+and+Malinda+Blalock.#v=onepage&q=Rebels%20in%20Blue:%20The%20Story%20of%20Keith%20and%20Malinda%20Blalock.&f=false|title=Rebels in Blue: The Story of Keith and Malinda Blalock|last=Stevens|first=Peter F.|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=1999|isbn=9781461709312|location=|pages=12|language=en}}</ref>  Despite their families having been rivals for many years, she married William in 1861, aged 19.<ref name=Eggleston />\n\n==Civil War==\nAfter the Civil War began, the western North Carolina communities in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] were divided over their political adherences. Neighbors and families argued with each other. Originally Malinda expressed her sympathy for the right of secession, but Keith and his stepfather Austin Coffey were ardent unionists, although Keith was opposed to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], and they had planned to desert toward the Union someday. The Blalocks' opposing views did not affect their marriage.\n\t\nWhen the Confederate 26th North Carolina Infantry, commanded by Colonel [[Zebulon Vance]], showed up in the region to recruit, Keith began to plan an escape across the frontier from his local political enemies. He was hesitant about whether to flee directly toward [[Kentucky]] or enroll temporarily with the Confederate Army to desert across the enemy lines later.\n\t\nKeith also considered the consequences of an untimely escape on Malinda, fearful that local distaste of his actions would cause her to be scapegoated in his absence. Spurred by the good pay in serving the \"Greys\", Keith trusted that he would receive a light military commission, possibly to northern [[Virginia]] for example, from where it would be easy to desert to the nearest \"Yankee\" regiment. He accompanied his neighbors to the recruitment office, signing up with the Confederate infantry.\n\n===Samuel Blalock===\nFearing for Malinda, Keith had made sure that all local secessionists would see him leaving with the Confederates. However, when arriving at the enlistment gathering at the town's railroad depot, someone began to walk by his side, a mysterious recruit who was wearing a [[forage cap]] and had a particularly little physique and delicate features.  Surprisingly, \"He\" turned out to be Malinda, his own wife.<ref name=\"Eggleston\" /> \n\nMalinda was officially registered on March 20 of 1862 at [[Lenoir, North Carolina]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X2GeBUmW_MgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Women+in+the+American+Civil+War.#v=onepage&q=blalock&f=false|title=Women in the American Civil War|last=Mays|first=Gwen Thomas|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=9781851096008|editor-last=Frank|editor-first=Lisa Tendrich|location=|pages=132|language=en}}</ref> as \"Samuel 'Sammy' Blalock\", Keith's 20-year-old brother.<ref name=\"Eggleston\" />  This document and her discharge papers survive as one of the few existing records of a female soldier from North Carolina, from the many ones who may have actually served.\n\n===Confederate military life===\nTheir plan to defect proved unworkable because, already before their arrival, the 26th had fought its biggest battle, which was the loss to the Union of the town of [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] in eastern North Carolina. Instead of moving to Virginia's battlefront, they remained stationed far from the northern frontier at [[Kinston, North Carolina]], on the [[Neuse River]]. \n\t\nWhile maintaining her hidden identity, Malinda was a good soldier. One of their assistant surgeons, named Underwood, pointed out that \"her disguise was never penetrated. She drilled and did the duties of a soldier as any other member of the Company, and was very adept at learning the manual and drill.\"<ref name=\"cojoweb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cojoweb.com/malinda_blaylock.html|title=Keith and Malinda Blaylock (Blaylock)|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|accessdate=22 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612013745/http://www.cojoweb.com/malinda_blaylock.html|archive-date=12 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\t\nLater Keith became a respected brevet sergeant, ordering Malinda then to \"stay close to him\". They fought in three battles together, but \"Samuel\"'s true identity remained still unknown.\n\n===The desertion===\nIn April 1862, Keith's squad received the order to range the Neuse River's region by fording it during the night, to detect any enemy guarding-posts. Their ultimate objective was to track down the location of a particular Union regiment commanded by US General [[Ambrose Burnside]].\n\t\nAt one point of the mission, a hard skirmish began. Most of Keith's squad retreated to safety, crossing back over the Neuse River. However, after regrouping, it was found that \"Samuel\" was missing. Keith promptly returned to the battlefield. He found Malinda clinging to a pine and bleeding profusely, with a bullet lodged in her left shoulder.<ref name=Eggleston />  \n\t\nAs quickly as he could, Keith carried Malinda back to the 26th. He brought her to the infirmary tent where she was attended by its surgeon, Dr. Thomas J. Boykin. The bullet was successfully removed, but the truth about \"Samuel\" was discovered during the medical examination. \n\t\nAfter obtaining a promise from Boykin that he would spare them some time before reporting, Keith went to a nearby field of [[poison ivy]]. He stripped his clothes and flailed through the underbrush for about half an hour. \n\t\nThe next morning, he suffered a persistent fever while his affected skin was inflamed and covered by blisters. Keith told the doctors that he had a serious recurrent illness which was highly contagious, adding the ailment of a hernia also. Fearing an outbreak of smallpox, the doctors discharged Keith expeditiously from the regiment and confined him to his tent.\n\t\nMalinda would remain stranded in the camp because her recent wound didn't yet merit a discharge. She decided to confront Colonel Vance once and for all. She offered herself as a volunteer to aid the sick Sergeant Keith on his return to Watauga. Vance's response was a clear \"no\", communicating to \"Samuel\" that instead \"he\" would be his new personal orderly. \n\t\nAt that point Malinda decided to tell Vance the truth. Vance's first reaction was of disbelief while calling the surgeon and commenting to him: \"Oh Surgeon, have I a case for you!\" However, the physician corroborated Malinda's statement. Immediately, Vance discharged \"Samuel\" and demanded the restitution of \"his\" original enlisting reward of 50 dollars.\n\n==Marauders==\nMalinda and her husband could return to Watauga then. Once there, though, Keith was soon required by the local Confederate forces, which demanded that he enlist again\u2014after noting his healthy status\u2014and return to the front. Otherwise, he would be judged by the new Confederate laws of military draft.\n\t\nTherefore, Malinda and Keith fled again, toward [[Grandfather Mountain]]. There, they found more local deserters in the same condition. They stayed with them until the Confederate Army intercepted the group, injuring Keith in his arm.\n\t\nMalinda and Keith moved then to [[Tennessee]], where they joined the US-[[10th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|10th Michigan Cavalry]] of Colonel [[George Washington Kirk]], who was later succeeded by General [[George Stoneman]]. For some time, Keith accomplished some administrative chores as a recruitment agent. \n\t\nHowever, the couple decided to enter in action again, this time for the Union, by joining Colonel Kirk's voluntary guerrilla squadrons, the [[3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry]], on scouting and raiding missions throughout the Appalachia region of North Carolina.\n\t\nWith Malinda next to him, Keith began in [[Blowing Rock, North Carolina]], as one of the leaders of the guides for the [[Watauga Underground Railroad]]. This was a way of escape from the Confederate jail at [[Salisbury, North Carolina]], which was the largest facility of the state. Keith had to guide the escaped Union soldiers to safety in Tennessee. However, from 1863 on, the skirmishes against the patrolling enemy forces in the region were increasingly tougher. \n\t\nKeith's pro-union guerrilla forces began to raid Watauga County. Because once they had been harshly humbled by the southern loyalists, the outlaws pitilessly raided their farms, stole and killed. Marauding throughout North Carolina's Appalachia region, they were soon feared by the entire state.\n\t\nIn 1863 Malinda realised she was pregnant, so she travelled to Tennessee to stay with another of the marauders wives. Giving birth to a son on 8 April, 1864, she spent some time with relatives in the area before leaving her young son with them and returning to military activities.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xB6leqwlKSYC&pg=PA39&dq=Rebels+in+Blue:+The+Story+of+Keith+and+Malinda+Blalock.#v=onepage&q=Rebels%20in%20Blue:%20The%20Story%20of%20Keith%20and%20Malinda%20Blalock.&f=false|title=Women During the Civil War: An Encyclopedia|last=Harper|first=Judith E.|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2004|isbn=9780415937238|location=|pages=36\u201340|language=en}}</ref>\n\t\nConfederate vigilantes then murdered Keith's stepfather, Austin Coffey, and one of Austin's four brothers (William), while the other two survived the attack.

In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \"[[Country Gardens]]\".\n\nGrainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in [[Frankfurt]]. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with [[Frederick Delius]] and [[Edvard Grieg]]. He became a champion of [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely [[racism|racial]] or [[anti-Semitic]] terms.\n\nIn 1914, Grainger moved to the [[United States]], where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the [[United States Army]] during the [[First World War]] through 1917\u201318, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the [[Grainger Museum]] in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the [[Second World War]], ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year before his death.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Family background ===\n[[File:Princes Bridge Melbourne 01a.jpg|thumb|left|Princes Bridge, Melbourne, designed by John Grainger]]\nPercy Grainger was born on 8 July 1882 in [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]], Australia.

Grainger's first known composition, \"A Birthday Gift to Mother\", is dated 1893.<ref name= ADB /> Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.<ref name= Bird20>Bird, pp. 20\u201322</ref>\n\nAfter Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's [[Royal Exhibition Building]]. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\".<ref>Bird, p. 23</ref> This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.<ref>Bird, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he maintained considerable patriotic feelings for his native land,<ref name= Scott /> and was proud of his Australian heritage.<ref name= ADB />\n\n=== Frankfurt ===\n[[File:Percy Grainger in 1901.jpg|thumb|upright|Grainger aged 18, towards the end of his Frankfurt years]]\nIn Frankfurt, Rose established herself as a teacher of English; her earnings were supplemented by contributions from John Grainger, who had settled in [[Perth]]. The Hoch Conservatory's reputation for piano teaching had been enhanced by the tenure, until 1892, of [[Clara Schumann]] as head of piano studies. Grainger's piano tutor was [[James Kwast]], who developed his young pupil's skills to the extent that, within a year, Grainger was being lauded as a prodigy.<ref name=Bird26>Bird, pp. 26\u201329</ref> Grainger had difficult relations with his original composition teacher, [[Iwan Knorr]];<ref name= Simon2 /> he withdrew from Knorr's classes to study composition privately with Karl Klimsch, an amateur composer and folk-music enthusiast, whom he would later honour as \"my only composition teacher\".<ref name= ADB />\n\nTogether with a group of slightly older British students \u2013 [[Roger Quilter]], [[H. Balfour Gardiner|Balfour Gardiner]], [[Cyril Scott]] and [[Norman O'Neill]], all of whom became his friends \u2013 Grainger helped form the [[Frankfurt Group]]. Their long-term objective was to rescue British and Scandinavian music from what they considered the negative influences of central European music.<ref name= Simon2>Simon, pp. 2\u20133</ref> Encouraged by Klimsch, Grainger turned away from composing classical pastiches reminiscent of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]],<ref>Bird, p. 35</ref> and developed a personal compositional style, the originality and maturity of which quickly impressed and astonished his friends.<ref name= Scott /> At this time Grainger discovered the poetry of [[Rudyard Kipling]] and began setting it to music; according to Scott, \"No poet and composer have been so suitably wedded since [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and Schumann.\"<ref name= Scott>Scott, pp. 51\u201354</ref>\n\nAfter accompanying her son on an extended European tour in the summer of 1900, Rose, whose health had been poor for some time, suffered a nervous collapse and could no longer work.<ref name= Bird39 /> To replace lost income, Grainger began giving piano lessons and public performances; his first solo recital was in Frankfurt on 6 December 1900.<ref name= ADB /> Meanwhile he continued his studies with Kwast, and increased his repertoire until he was confident he could support himself and his mother as a concert pianist. Having chosen London as his future base, in May 1901 Grainger abandoned his studies. With Rose, he left Frankfurt for the UK.<ref name= Bird39>Bird, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\nBefore leaving Frankfurt, Grainger had fallen in love with Kwast's daughter Mimi.<ref name= Bird39 /> In an autobiographical essay dated 1947, he says that he was \"already sex-crazy\" at this time, when he was 19.<ref name= Bird42 /> John Bird, Grainger's biographer, records that during his Frankfurt years, Grainger began to develop sexual appetites that were \"distinctly abnormal\"; by the age of 16 he had started to experiment in [[flagellation]] and other [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] practices, which he continued to pursue through most of his adult life. Bird surmises that Grainger's fascination with themes of punishment and pain derived from the harsh discipline to which Rose had subjected him as a child.<ref name= Bird42>Bird, pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\n== London years ==\n\n=== Concert pianist ===\nIn London, Grainger's charm, good looks and talent (with some assistance from the local Australian community) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons. He was soon performing in concerts in private homes. ''The Times'' critic reported after one such appearance that Grainger's playing \"revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight\".<ref>Bird, pp. 63\u201365</ref> In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals.<ref>Bird, pp. 66 and 73</ref> Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours \u2013 he termed the relationship a \"love-serve job\".<ref name= ODNB /> She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced \"an overpowering landslide\" of feeling, and that \"I thought I was about to die. If I remember correctly, I only experienced fear of death. I don't think that any joy entered into it\".<ref>Pear (\"Grainger: The Formative Years\"), p. 6</ref>\n\nIn February 1902 Grainger made his first appearance as a piano soloist with an orchestra, playing [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto]] with the Bath Pump Room Orchestra. In October of that year he toured Britain in a concert party with [[Adelina Patti]], the Italian-born opera singer. Patti was greatly taken by the young pianist and prophesied a glorious career for him.<ref>Bird, p. 69</ref> The following year he met the German-Italian composer and pianist [[Ferruccio Busoni]]. Initially the two men were on cordial terms (Busoni offered to give Grainger lessons free of charge) and, as a result, Grainger spent part of the 1903 summer in Berlin as Busoni's pupil.<ref name= ADB /> However, the visit was not a success; as Bird notes, Busoni had expected \"a willing slave and adoring disciple\", a role Grainger was not willing to fulfill.<ref>Bird, p. 81</ref> Grainger returned to London in July 1903; almost immediately he departed with Rose on a 10-month tour of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, as a member of a party organised by the Australian contralto [[Ada Crossley]].<ref>Bird, pp. 83\u201388</ref>\n\n=== Emergent composer ===\n[[File:Percy Grainger at the Aeolian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Notice for a 1907 Grainger recital, Aeolian Hall, London]]\nBefore going to London Grainger had composed numerous Kipling settings, and his first mature orchestral pieces.<ref name= Txx>Thwaites (ed.) p. xx</ref> In London, when he found time he continued to compose; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 indicates that he was working on his ''Marching Song of Democracy'' (a [[Walt Whitman]] setting), and had made good progress with the experimental works ''[[Train Music]]'' and ''Charging Irishrey''.<ref>Dreyfus (ed.), p. 2</ref> In his early London years he also composed ''Hill Song Number 1'' (1902), an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni.<ref name= Txx /><ref>Bird, p. 79</ref>\n\nIn 1905, inspired by a lecture given by the pioneer folk-song historian [[Lucy Broadwood]], Grainger began to collect original folk songs. Starting at [[Brigg]] in [[Lincolnshire]], over the next five years he gathered and transcribed more than 300 songs from all over the country, including much material that had never been written down before. From 1906 Grainger used a phonograph, one of the first collectors to do so, and by this means he assembled more than 200 [[phonograph cylinder|Edison cylinder]] recordings of native folk singers.<ref name= Simon5 /><ref>Tall, pp. 55\u201356</ref> These activities coincided with what Bird calls \"the halcyon days of the 'First English Folksong Revival'\".<ref>Bird, p. 102</ref>\n\nAs his stature in the music world increased, Grainger became acquainted with many of its leading figures, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]].<ref name= Simon5 /> In 1907 he met [[Frederick Delius]], with whom he achieved an immediate rapport \u2013 the two musicians had similar ideas about composition and harmony, and shared a dislike for the classical German masters.<ref name= C33 /> Both were inspired by folk music;<ref>Palmer, pp. 79\u201382</ref> Grainger gave Delius his setting of the folk song ''[[Brigg Fair]]'', which the older composer developed into his well-known orchestral rhapsody, dedicated to Grainger.<ref name= C33>Carley, pp. 33\u201334</ref> The two remained close friends until Delius's death in 1934.<ref>Carley, pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nGrainger first met [[Edvard Grieg]] at the home of the London financier [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], in May 1906.<ref>Bird, p. 116</ref> As a student, Grainger had learned to appreciate the Norwegian's harmonic originality, and by 1906 had several Grieg pieces in his concert repertoire, including the [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|piano concerto]].<ref name= GE1 /> Grieg was greatly impressed with Grainger's playing, and wrote: \"I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.\"<ref>Bird, p. 117</ref> During 1906\u201307 the two maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence, which culminated in Grainger's ten-day visit in July 1907 to the composer's Norwegian home, \"Troldhaugen\" near [[Bergen]]. Here the two spent much time revising and rehearsing the piano concerto in preparation for that year's [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]]. Plans for a long-term working relationship were ended by Grieg's sudden death in September 1907; nevertheless, this relatively brief acquaintance had a considerable impact on Grainger, and he championed Grieg's music for the rest of his life.<ref name= GE1>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Gillies\n  | first = Malcolm\n  |author2=Pear, David\n  | title = Great Expectations: Grieg and Granger\n  | journal = The Musical Times\n  | volume = 148\n  | issue = 1900\n  | pages =7\u20139\n  | date = Autumn 2007\n  | language =\n  | doi=10.2307/25434475\n  | jstor = 25434475\n  }}{{subscription}}</ref>\n[[File:GraingerandGrieg1907.jpg|thumb|Grainger (centre), with [[Edvard Grieg]] (left of picture), [[Nina Grieg]] and [[Julius R\u00f6ntgen]], at \"Troldhaugen\", July 1907.]]\nAfter fulfilling a hectic schedule of concert engagements in Britain and continental Europe, in August 1908 Grainger accompanied Ada Crossley on a second Australasian tour, during which he added several cylinders of Maori and Polynesian music to his collection of recordings.<ref name= Simon5>Simon, pp. 5\u20136</ref> He had resolved to establish himself as a top-ranking pianist before promoting himself as a composer,<ref name= OMO /> though he continued to compose both original works and folk-song settings.

In 1908 he obtained the tune of \"Country Gardens\" from the folk music specialist [[Cecil Sharp]], though he did not fashion it into a performable piece for another ten years.<ref>Tall, p. 63</ref><ref>Ould, p. 26</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Grainger finally felt confident enough of his standing as a pianist to begin large-scale publishing of his compositions.

[[Thomas Beecham]], who was one of the festival's guest conductors, reported to Delius that \"Percy was good in the ''forte'' passages, but made far too much noise in the quieter bits\".<ref name= Bird150>Bird, pp. 150\u201351</ref> Grainger was receiving increasing recognition as a composer; leading musicians and orchestras were adding his works to their repertoires.<ref name= Bird148 /> His decision to leave England for America in early September 1914, after the outbreak of the [[First World War]], damaged his reputation among his patriotically minded British friends.<ref name= ADB /> Grainger wrote that the reason for this abrupt departure was \"to give mother a change\" \u2013 she had been unwell for years.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 13</ref> However, according to Bird, Grainger often explained that his reason for leaving London was that \"he wanted to emerge as Australia's first composer of worth, and to have laid himself open to the possibility of being killed would have rendered his goal unattainable\".<ref>Bird, p. 152</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' music critic Robin Legge accused him of cowardice, and told him not to expect a welcome in England after the war,<ref name= ODNB /> words that hurt Grainger deeply.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 35\u201339</ref>\n\nGrainger's first American tour began on 11 February 1915 with a recital at New York's [[Aeolian Hall (New York)|Aeolian Hall]]. He played works by Bach, [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], Handel and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] alongside two of his own compositions: \"Colonial Song\" and \"Mock Morris\". In July 1915 Grainger formally registered his intention to apply for US citizenship.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 36</ref> Over the next two years his engagements included concerts with Melba in [[Boston]] and [[Pittsburgh]] and a command performance before President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. In addition to his concert performances, Grainger secured a contract with [[Duo-Art]] for making [[pianola]] rolls, and signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name= OMO />\n\nIn April 1917 Grainger received news of his father's death in Perth.<ref>Bird, p. 158</ref> On 9 June 1917, after America's entry into the war, he enlisted as a bandsman in the U.S. Army with the 15th Coastal Artillery Corps Band in New York City.

The piece became instantly popular; sheet music sales quickly broke many publishing records.<ref>Foreman (\"Miscellaneous Works\"), pp. 137\u201338</ref> The work was to become synonymous with Grainger's name through the rest of his life, though he came in time to detest it.<ref name=\"Simon, p. 7\">Simon, p. 7</ref> On 3 June 1918 he became a naturalised American citizen.<ref name=\"Gillies and Pear eds, p. xv\">Gillies and Pear (eds), p. xv</ref>\n\n=== Career zenith ===\n[[File:Rose and Percy Grainger.jpg|thumb|left|Rose and Percy Grainger, c.&nbsp;1920]]\nAfter leaving the army in January 1919, Grainger refused an offer to become conductor of the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]] and resumed his career as a concert pianist.<ref>Bird, p. 162</ref> He was soon performing around 120 concerts a year,<ref>Tan, p. 15</ref> generally to great critical acclaim, and in April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York's [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]]. Grainger commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as [[Carnegie Hall]] and the Aeolian.<ref>Bird, pp. 167\u201368</ref> In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at [[Chicago Musical College]], the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.<ref name=\"Gillies and Pear eds, p. xv\" /><ref>Bird, p. 166</ref>\n\nAmid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his ''Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away'', and the orchestral version of ''The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart'' both originated in this period.<ref>Bird, pp. 163\u201364</ref> He also began to develop the technique of [[elastic scoring]], a form of flexible orchestration which enabled works to be performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small [[chamber music|chamber]] groups up to full orchestral strength.<ref>Fairfax, pp. 75\u201377</ref>\n\nIn April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in [[White Plains, New York]] in what is now known as the [[Percy Grainger Home and Studio]]. This was his home for the remainder of his life.<ref name= ODNB /> From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from delusions and nightmares, and became fearful that her illness would harm her son's career.<ref>Bird, p. 170</ref> Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been rumours that their relationship was incestuous;<ref name=\"Simon, p. 7\" /> in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough.<ref name= ARM52>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 52</ref> From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City.<ref>Bird, pp. 173\u201374</ref> The letter, which began \"I am out of my mind and cannot think properly\", asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to Lotta of \"improper love\".

In autumn 1922 he left for a year-long trip to Europe, where he collected and recorded Danish folk songs before a concert tour that took him to Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and England. In Norway he stayed with Delius at the latter's summer home. Delius was by now almost blind; Grainger helped fulfill his friend's wish to see a Norwegian sunset by carrying him (with some assistance) to the top of a nearby mountain peak.<ref>Fenby, pp. 74\u201375</ref> He returned to White Plains in August 1923.<ref>Bird, p. 183</ref>\n\nAlthough now less committed to a year-round schedule of concerts, Grainger remained a very popular performer. His eccentricities, often exaggerated for publicity reasons, reportedly included running into auditoriums in gym kit and leaping over the piano to create a grand entrance.<ref>Simon, p. 9</ref> While he continued to revise and re-score his compositions, he increasingly worked on arrangements of music by other composers,<ref>Ould, p. 25</ref> in particular works by Bach, Brahms, [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9|Faur\u00e9]] and Delius.<ref>Bird, pp. 279\u201381</ref> Away from music, Grainger's preoccupation with Nordic culture led him to develop a form of English which, he maintained, reflected the character of the language before the [[Norman conquest]]. Words of Norman or Latin origin were replaced by supposedly Nordic word-forms, such as \"blend-band\" (orchestra), \"forthspeaker\" (lecturer) and \"writ-piece\" (article). He called this \"blue-eyed\" English.<ref>Bird, p. 53. See also Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 107</ref> His convictions of Nordic superiority eventually led Grainger, in letters to friends, to express his views in crudely racial and anti-Semitic terms; the music historian David Pear describes Grainger as, \"at root, a racial bigot of no small order\".<ref name= G&P4>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 4\u20136</ref>{{#tag:ref|Some of Grainger's earliest published letters contain anti-Semitic comments, for example to Karen Holten in 1905.<ref>Dreyfus (ed.), p. 54</ref> He later asserted that the Jewish race was less capable of producing good music than the Nordic races,<ref>Pear (\"Grainger the Social Commentator\"), p.&nbsp;36</ref> and his letter to Quilter of 25 February 1939 is cited by Gillies and Pear as an example of his racial intolerance.<ref name= G&P4 /><ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 156\u201363</ref>|group= n}}\n\nGrainger made further trips to Europe in 1925 and 1927, collecting more Danish folk music with the aid of the octogenarian ethnologist [[Evald Tang Kristensen]]; this work formed the basis of the ''Suite on Danish Folksongs'' of 1928\u201330.<ref name= OMO /> He also visited Australia and New Zealand, in 1924 and again in 1926. In November 1926, while returning to America, he met Ella Str\u00f6m, a Swedish-born artist with whom he developed a close friendship. On arrival in America the pair separated, but were reunited in England the following autumn after Grainger's final folk-song expedition to Denmark. In October 1927 the couple agreed to marry.<ref>Bird, pp. 194\u201396</ref> Ella had a daughter, Elsie, who had been [[Legitimacy (family law)|born out of wedlock]] in 1909. Grainger always acknowledged her as a family member, and developed a warm personal relationship with her.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. xix</ref>\n\nAlthough Bird asserts that before her marriage, Ella knew nothing of Grainger's sado-masochistic interests,<ref name=Bird200>Bird. pp. 200\u201301</ref> in a letter dated 23 April 1928 (four months before the wedding) Grainger writes to her: \"As far as my taste goes, blows [with the whip] are most thrilling on breasts, bottom, inner thighs, sexparts\". He later adds, \"I shall thoroly thoroly {{sic}} understand if you cannot in any way see yr way to follow up this hot wish of mine\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 94\u2013100</ref> The couple were married on 9 August 1928 at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], at the end of a concert which, in honour of the bride, had included the first performance of Grainger's bridal song \"To a Nordic Princess\".<ref name= OMO />\n\n==== Educator ====\nFrom the late 1920s and early 1930s Grainger became involved increasingly with educational work in schools and colleges,<ref name= OMO /> and in late 1931 accepted a year's appointment for 1932\u201333 as professor of music at [[New York University]] (NYU). In this role he delivered a series of lectures under the heading \"A General Study of the Manifold Nature of Music\", which introduced his students to a wide range of ancient and modern works.<ref name= OMO /> On 25 October 1932 his lecture was illustrated by [[Duke Ellington]] and his band, who appeared in person; Grainger admired Ellington's music, seeing harmonic similarities with Delius. On the whole, however, Grainger did not enjoy his tenure at NYU; he disliked the institutional formality, and found the university generally unreceptive to his ideas.

To finance the project, Grainger embarked on a series of concerts and broadcasts,<ref>Bird, pp. 206\u201307</ref> in which he subjected his audiences to a vast range of the world's music in accordance with his \"universalist\" view. Controversially, he argued for the superior achievements of Nordic composers over traditionally recognised masters such as Mozart and Beethoven.<ref name= ADB />\n\nAmong various new ideas, Grainger introduced his so-called \"free-music\" theories. He believed that conformity with the traditional rules of set scales, rhythms and harmonic procedures amounted to \"absurd goose-stepping\", from which music should be set free.<ref name= PGstatement>Statement by Percy Grainger entitled \"Free Music\", dated 6 December 1938, in Thwaites (ed.), pp. 207\u201308</ref> He demonstrated two experimental compositions of free music, performed initially by a string quartet and later by the use of electronic [[theremins]].<ref name= ODNB /> He believed that ideally, free music required non-human performance, and spent much of his later life developing machines to realize this vision.<ref>Simon, p.12</ref>\n\nWhile the building of the museum proceeded, the Graingers visited England for several months in 1936, during which Grainger made his first BBC broadcast. In this, he conducted \"Love Verses from ''The Song of Solomon''\" in which the tenor soloist was the then unknown [[Peter Pears]].<ref>Bird, p. 210</ref> After spending 1937 in America, Grainger returned to Melbourne in 1938 for the official opening of the Museum; among those present at the ceremony was his old piano teacher Adelaide Burkitt. The museum did not open to the general public during Grainger's lifetime, but was available to scholars for research.<ref name= Bird214>Bird, pp. 214\u201315</ref><ref name= S11>Simon, p. 11</ref>\n\nIn the late 1930s Grainger spent much time arranging his works in settings for wind bands. He wrote ''[[Lincolnshire Posy]]'' for the March 1937 convention of the American Band Masters' Association in [[Milwaukee]],<ref>Bird, p. 212</ref> and in 1939, on his last visit to England before the Second World War, he composed \"The Duke of Marlborough's Fanfare\", giving it the subtitle \"British War Mood Grows\".<ref name= Bird214 />\n\n== Later career ==\n\n=== Second World War ===\nThe outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 curtailed Grainger's overseas travelling. In the autumn of 1940, alarmed that the war might precipitate an invasion of the United States eastern seaboard, he and Ella moved to [[Springfield, Missouri]], in the centre of the continent.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 170</ref> From 1940 Grainger played regularly in charity concerts, especially after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] brought the United States into the war in December 1941; the historian Robert Simon calculates that Grainger made a total of 274 charity appearances during the war years, many of them at [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Army Air Forces|Air Force]] camps.<ref name= S11 /> In 1942 a collection of his Kipling settings, the ''Jungle Book'' cycle, was performed in eight cities by the band of the [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] from [[St. Peter, Minnesota]].<ref>Bird, pp. 217\u201318</ref>\n\n=== Postwar decline ===\nExhausted from his wartime concerts routine, Grainger spent much of 1946 on holiday in Europe. He was suffering a sense of career failure; in 1947, when refusing the Chair of Music at [[University of Adelaide|Adelaide University]], he wrote: \"If I were 40 years younger, and not so crushed by defeat in every branch of music I have essayed, I am sure I would have welcomed such a chance\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 214\u201319</ref> In January 1948 he conducted the premiere of his [[wind band]] setting of ''The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart'', written for the [[Goldman Band]] to celebrate the 70th birthday of its founder. Afterward, Grainger denigrated his own music as \"commonplace\" while praising [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''Suite Fran\u00e7aise'', with which it had shared the programme.<ref>Bird, pp. 224\u201325</ref>\n[[File:BBC Proms 31.jpg|thumb|A Promenade concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. The \"promenade\" section is the standing area immediately in front of the orchestra (2005 photograph).]]\n\nOn 10 August 1948, Grainger appeared at the London [[The Proms|Proms]], playing the piano part in his ''Suite on Danish Folksongs'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Basil Cameron]]. On 18 September he attended the [[Last Night of the Proms]], standing in the promenade section for Delius's ''Brigg Fair''.<ref>Bird, p. 226</ref> Over the next few years several friends died: Gardiner in 1950, Quilter and Karen Holten in 1953. In October 1953 Grainger was operated on for abdominal cancer; his fight against this disease would last for the rest of his life.<ref>Bird, pp. 238 and 242</ref> He continued to appear at concerts, often performed in church halls and educational establishments rather than major concert venues.<ref name= OMO />\n\nIn 1954, after his last Carnegie Hall appearance, Grainger's long promotion of Grieg's music was recognised when he was awarded the [[St. Olav Medal]] by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon of Norway]].<ref name= Bird241 /> But he expressed a growing bitterness in his writings and correspondence; in a letter to the Danish composer Herman Sandby, a lifelong friend, he bemoaned the continuing ascendency in music of the \"German form\", and asserted that \"all my compositional life I have been a leader without followers\".<ref name= Bird241>Bird, pp. 241\u201342</ref>\n\nAfter 1950 Grainger virtually ceased to compose. His principal creative activity in the last decade of his life was his work with Burnett Cross, a young physics teacher, on free music machines. The first of these was a relatively simple device controlled by an adapted [[pianola]].<ref name= CG /> Next was the \"Estey-reed tone-tool\", a form of giant harmonica which, Grainger expectantly informed his stepdaughter Elsie in April 1951, would be ready to play free music \"in a few weeks\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 248</ref> A third machine, the \"Cross-Grainger Kangaroo-pouch\", was completed by 1952. Developments in transistor technology encouraged Grainger and Cross to begin work on a fourth, entirely electronic machine, which was incomplete when Grainger died.<ref name= ODNB /><ref name= CG>{{cite web|last= Davies|first= Hugh|title= Cross-Grainger free music machine|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/47637|work= Oxford Music Online|year= 2007|accessdate= 2 May 2011}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1955 Grainger made his final visit to Australia, where he spent nine months organising and arranging exhibits for the [[Grainger Museum]]. He refused to consider a \"Grainger Festival\", as suggested by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, because he felt that his homeland had rejected him and his music. Before leaving Melbourne, he deposited in a bank a parcel that contained an essay and photographs related to his sex life, not to be opened until 10 years after his death.<ref name= Bird243>Bird, pp. 243\u201345</ref>\n\n=== Last years ===\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Dartmouth Hall 02.JPG|thumb|left|Dartmouth College, venue for Grainger's last concert, April 1960]]\nBy 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration.<ref>Gillies and Pear, p. xvii</ref> Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a [[BBC]] \"Concert Hour\" programme when he played \"Handel in the Strand\" on the piano.

On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], although by now his illness was affecting his concentration.

Besides these, he wrote many settings of other composers' works.<ref name= ODNB /><ref name= OMO /> Despite his conservatory training, he rebelled against the disciplines of the central European tradition, largely rejecting conventional forms such as [[symphony]], [[sonata]], [[concerto]], and [[opera]]. With few exceptions, his original compositions are miniatures, lasting between two and eight minutes. Only a few of his works originated as piano pieces, though in due course almost all of them were, in his phrase, \"dished up\" in piano versions.<ref name= OMO />\n\nThe conductor [[John Eliot Gardiner]] describes Grainger as \"a true original in terms of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation\", whose terseness of expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th-century [[Second Viennese School]] and the Italian [[Madrigal (music)|madrigalists]] of the 16th and 17th centuries.<ref name= JEG>{{cite magazine|authorlink= John Eliot Gardiner|last= Gardiner|first= John Eliot|author2=Achenbach, Andrew|title= Happy to talk|url= http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/the-new-gramophone-digital-archive|magazine= Gramophone|date= April 1996|page=20}} {{subscription}}</ref> [[Malcolm Gillies]], a Grainger scholar, writes of Grainger's style that \"you know it is 'Grainger' when you have heard about one second of a piece\".<ref name= symposium>{{cite web|last= Gillies|first= Malcolm|title= Grainger: Fifty Years On|url= http://www.grainger.unimelb.edu.au/exhibitions/symposium.html|publisher= Grainger Museum (University of Melbourne)|date= 16 October 2010|accessdate= 5 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005005400/http://www.grainger.unimelb.edu.au/exhibitions/symposium.html|archivedate=5 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music's most individual characteristic, Gillies argues, is its [[Texture (music)|texture]] \u2013 \"the weft of the fabric\", according to Grainger.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 32</ref> Different textures are defined by Grainger as \"smooth\", \"grained\" and \"prickly\".<ref name= OMO />\n\nGrainger was a musical democrat; he believed that in a performance each player's role should be of equal importance. His elastic scoring technique was developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give effective performances of his music. Experimentation is evident in Grainger's earliest works; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of [[time signature]] were employed in ''Love Verses from \"The Song of Solomon\"'' (1899), and ''[[Train Music]]'' (1901), long before [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] adopted this practice.<ref name= Simon2 /> In search of specific sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques: solovoxes, [[theremin]]s, [[marimba]]s, [[glass harp|musical glasses]], [[harmoniums]], [[banjo]]s, and [[ukulele]]s.<ref name= Gram /><ref name= Josephson>Josephson, pp. 614\u201317</ref> In one early concert of folk music, [[Roger Quilter|Quilter]] and [[Cyril Scott|Scott]] were conscripted as performers, to whistle various parts.<ref>Bird, p. 74</ref> In \"Random Round\" (1912\u201314), inspired by the communal music-making he had heard in the Pacific Islands on his second Australasian tour, Grainger introduced an element of chance into performances; individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make random choices from a menu of variations.<ref name= OMO /> This experiment in [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by avant-garde composers such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]].<ref>Bird, p. 146</ref>\n\nThe brief \"Sea Song\" of 1907 was an early attempt by Grainger to write \"beatless\" music. This work, initially set over 14 irregular [[Bar (music)|bars]] and occupying about 15 seconds of performing time,<ref>Fairfax, p. 72</ref> was a forerunner of Grainger's [[Free time (music)|free-music]] experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: \"It seems to me absurd to live in an age of flying, and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves.\" The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. \"Out in nature we hear all kinds of lovely and touching \"free\" (non-harmonic) combinations of tones; yet we are unable to take up these beauties\u2026 into the art of music because of our archaic notions of harmony.\"<ref name= PGstatement /> In a 1941 letter to Scott, Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large-scale works in the manner of a [[List of masses, passions and oratorios by Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach oratorio]], a [[Richard Wagner#Operas|Wagner opera]], or a [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms symphony]], but excused this failure on the grounds that all his works before the mid-1930s had been mere preparations for his free music.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 172</ref>\n\nAs a student, Grainger had learned to appreciate the music of [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]] and came to regard the Norwegian as a paragon of Nordic beauty and greatness. Grieg in turn described Grainger as a new way forward for English composition, \"quite different from [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], very original\". After a lifetime interpreting Grieg's works, in 1944 Grainger began adapting the Norwegian's [[Piano Sonata (Grieg)|E&nbsp;minor Piano Sonata, Op. 7]] as a \"Grieg-Grainger Symphony\", but abandoned the project after writing 16 bars of music. By this time, Grainger acknowledged that he had not fulfilled Grieg's high expectations of him, either as a composer or as a pianist. He also reflected on whether it would have been better, from the point of view of his development as a composer, had he never met the Grieg's, \"sweet and dear though they were to me\".<ref name= Bergen>{{cite web|last= Gillies|first= Malcolm|author2=Pear, David|title= Percy Grainger: Grieg's Interpreter and Propagator|url= http://griegsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Gillies-and-Pear-paper-2007.pdf|publisher= International Grieg Society Conference|pages= 2\u20135|date= 30 May 2007|accessdate= 5 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nGrainger was known for his musical experimentation and did not hesitate to exploit the capabilities of the orchestra. One early ambitious work was ''The Warriors'' (1913), an 18-minute orchestral piece, subtitled \"Music to an Imaginary Ballet\", which he dedicated to [[Frederick Delius|Delius]]. The music, which mixes elements of other Grainger works with references to [[Arnold Bax]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Richard Strauss]], requires a huge orchestral ensemble alongside at least three pianos \u2013 in one performance, Grainger used nineteen pianos with thirty pianists \u2013 to be played by \"exceptionally strong vigorous players\".

His pioneering work in the recording and setting of folk songs greatly influenced the following generation of English composers; Benjamin Britten acknowledged the Australian as his master in this respect.<ref>Bird, p. 114</ref> After hearing a broadcast of some Grainger settings, Britten declared that these \"[knocked] all the [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[R.

Likewise, his innovative approaches to instrumentation and scoring have left their mark on modern American band music;<ref name= OMO /> Timothy Reynish, a conductor and teacher of band music in Europe and America, has described him as \"the only composer of stature to consider military bands the equal, if not the superior, in expressive potential to symphony orchestras.\"<ref>Reynish, p. 20</ref> Grainger's attempts to produce \"free music\" by mechanical and later electronic means, which he considered his most important work, produced no follow-up; they were quickly overtaken and nullified by new technological advances. Covell nevertheless remarks that in this endeavour, Grainger's dogged resourcefulness and ingenious use of available materials demonstrate a particularly Australian aspect of the composer's character \u2013 one of which Grainger would have been proud.<ref>Covell, p. 148</ref>\n\n== Assessment ==\n[[File:grainger stone.jpg|thumb|Percy Grainger's tombstone \"World famous composer and pianist\"]]\n\nIn 1945 Grainger devised an informal ratings system for composers and musical styles, based on criteria that included originality, complexity and beauty. Of forty composers and styles, he ranked himself equal ninth \u2013 behind Wagner and\nDelius, but well ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky.<ref name= Bergen /> Nevertheless, in his later years he frequently denigrated his career, for example writing to Scott: \"I have never been a true musician or true artist\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 255</ref> His failure to be recognised as a composer for anything beyond his popular folk-song arrangements was a source of frustration and disappointment;<ref name= Pear32>Pear (\"Grainger the Social Commentator\"), p. 32</ref> for years after his death the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed.<ref>Ould, p. 29</ref> From the 1990s an increase in the number of Grainger recordings has brought a revival of interest in his works, and has enhanced his reputation as a composer.<ref name= ADB /> An unsigned tribute published on the ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' website in February 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Grainger's death opined that \"though he would never be put on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals, he is unorthodox, original and deserves better than to be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical taste\".<ref name= Gram />\n\nOf Grainger the pianist, ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]] wrote that his unique style was expressed with \"amazing skill, personality and vigor\".<ref>Quoted by Bird, pp. 100\u201301, from Schonberg, Harold (1964): ''The Great Pianists'', London, Victor Gollancz</ref> The early enthusiasm which had greeted his concert appearances became muted in later years, and reviews of his performances during the final ten years of his life were often harsh.<ref>Bird, pp. 238\u201339</ref> However, Britten regarded Grainger's late recording of the Grieg concerto, from a live performance at [[Aarhus]] in 1957, as \"one of the noblest ever committed to record\" \u2013 despite the suppression of the disc for many years, because of the proliferation of wrong notes and other faults.<ref name= Bird246>Bird, pp. 246\u201347</ref> Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum, referring to Grainger's early displays of artistic skills, has speculated that had John Grainger's influence not been removed, \"Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be remembered as one of Australia's leading painters and designers, who just happened to have a latent talent as a pianist and composer\".<ref>Allison, p. 53</ref> The [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] John Blacking, while acknowledging Grainger's contribution to social and cultural aspects of music, nevertheless writes that if the continental foundation of Grainger's musical education had not been \"undermined by dilettantism and the disastrous influence of his mother, I am sure that his ultimate contribution to the world of music would have been much greater\".<ref>Blacking, p. 1</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\nBetween 1908 and 1957 Grainger made numerous recordings, usually as pianist or conductor, of his own and other composers' music. His first recordings, for [[HMV Records|The Gramophone Company Ltd]] (later HMV), included the [[cadenza]] to Grieg's piano concerto; he did not record a complete version of this work on disc until 1945.

lived in the United States from 1914 on and became a citizen in 1918. In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century.  Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \"[[Country Gardens]]\".\n\nGrainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in [[Frankfurt]]. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with [[Frederick Delius]] and [[Edvard Grieg]]. He became a champion of [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely [[racism|racial]] or [[anti-Semitic]] terms.\n\nIn 1914, Grainger moved to the [[United States]], where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the [[United States Army]] during the [[First World War]] through 1917\u201318, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the [[Grainger Museum]] in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the [[Second World War]], ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year before his death.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Family background ===\n[[File:Princes Bridge Melbourne 01a.jpg|thumb|left|Princes Bridge, Melbourne, designed by John Grainger]]\nPercy Grainger was born on 8 July 1882 in [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]], Australia.

John's claims to have \"discovered\" her are unfounded, although he may have offered her encouragement.<ref>Bird, p. 9</ref>  John was a heavy drinker and a womaniser who, Rose  learned after the marriage, had fathered a child in England before coming to Australia. His promiscuity placed deep strains upon the relationship. Rose discovered shortly after Percy's birth that she had contracted a form of [[syphilis]], a [[sexually transmitted disease]], from her husband.<ref name= Bird2 /><ref name= Simon2 />  Despite this, the Graingers stayed together until 1890, when John went to England for medical treatment. After his return to Australia, they lived apart. Rose took over the work of raising Percy,<ref>Bird, pp. 14\u201315</ref> while John pursued his career as chief architect to the Western Australian Department of Public Works. He had some private work, designing Nellie Melba's home, Coombe Cottage, at [[Coldstream, Victoria|Coldstream]].<ref name= ADB />\n\n=== Childhood ===\n[[File:Melbourne international exhibition 1880.jpg|thumb|An 1880 lithograph of the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, venue for Percy Grainger's early concerts, October 1894]]\nExcept for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.<ref name= Simon2>Simon, pp. 2\u20133</ref>  Rose, an [[autodidacticism|autodidact]] with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with [[Nordic countries|Nordic culture]]; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic [[Grettis saga|''Saga of Grettir the Strong'']] was \"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\".<ref>Bird, p. 11</ref><ref name= ODNB>{{cite web|authorlink= Malcolm Gillies|last= Gillies|first= Malcolm|title= Grainger, Percy Aldridge|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/search?q=Percy+Grainger&searchBtn=Search&isQuickSearch=true |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online|year= 2004|accessdate= 20 April 2011}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref name= OMO>{{cite dictionary|last= Gillies|first= Malcolm;  Pear, David|title= Grainger, (George) Percy (Aldridge)|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/11596?q=Percy+Grainger&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1|dictionary= Oxford Music Online|year= 2007|accessdate= 20 April 2011}} {{subscription}}</ref> As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music.<ref>Bird, p. 13</ref> At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \"A Birthday Gift to Mother\", is dated 1893.<ref name= ADB /> Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.<ref name= Bird20>Bird, pp. 20\u201322</ref>\n\nAfter Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's [[Royal Exhibition Building]]. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\".<ref>Bird, p. 23</ref> This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.<ref>Bird, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he maintained considerable patriotic feelings for his native land,<ref name= Scott /> and was proud of his Australian heritage.<ref name= ADB />\n\n=== Frankfurt ===\n[[File:Percy Grainger in 1901.jpg|thumb|upright|Grainger aged 18, towards the end of his Frankfurt years]]\nIn Frankfurt, Rose established herself as a teacher of English; her earnings were supplemented by contributions from John Grainger, who had settled in [[Perth]]. The Hoch Conservatory's reputation for piano teaching had been enhanced by the tenure, until 1892, of [[Clara Schumann]] as head of piano studies. Grainger's piano tutor was [[James Kwast]], who developed his young pupil's skills to the extent that, within a year, Grainger was being lauded as a prodigy.<ref name=Bird26>Bird, pp. 26\u201329</ref> Grainger had difficult relations with his original composition teacher, [[Iwan Knorr]];<ref name= Simon2 /> he withdrew from Knorr's classes to study composition privately with Karl Klimsch, an amateur composer and folk-music enthusiast, whom he would later honour as \"my only composition teacher\".<ref name= ADB />\n\nTogether with a group of slightly older British students \u2013 [[Roger Quilter]], [[H. Balfour Gardiner|Balfour Gardiner]], [[Cyril Scott]] and [[Norman O'Neill]], all of whom became his friends \u2013 Grainger helped form the [[Frankfurt Group]]. Their long-term objective was to rescue British and Scandinavian music from what they considered the negative influences of central European music.<ref name= Simon2>Simon, pp. 2\u20133</ref> Encouraged by Klimsch, Grainger turned away from composing classical pastiches reminiscent of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]],<ref>Bird, p. 35</ref> and  developed a personal compositional style, the originality and maturity of which quickly impressed and astonished his friends.<ref name= Scott />  At this time Grainger discovered the poetry of [[Rudyard Kipling]] and began setting it to music; according to Scott, \"No poet and composer have been so suitably wedded since [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and Schumann.\"<ref name= Scott>Scott, pp. 51\u201354</ref>\n\nAfter accompanying her son on an extended European tour in the summer of 1900, Rose, whose health had been poor for some time, suffered a nervous collapse and could no longer work.<ref name= Bird39 /> To replace lost income, Grainger began giving piano lessons and public performances; his first solo recital was in Frankfurt on 6 December 1900.<ref name= ADB /> Meanwhile he continued his studies with Kwast, and increased his repertoire until he was confident he could support himself and his mother as a concert pianist. Having chosen London as his future base, in May 1901 Grainger abandoned his studies. With Rose, he left Frankfurt for the UK.<ref name= Bird39>Bird, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\nBefore leaving Frankfurt, Grainger had fallen in love with Kwast's daughter Mimi.<ref name= Bird39 /> In an autobiographical essay dated 1947, he says that he was \"already sex-crazy\" at this time, when he was 19.<ref name= Bird42 /> John Bird, Grainger's biographer, records that during his Frankfurt years, Grainger began to develop sexual appetites that were \"distinctly abnormal\"; by the age of 16 he had started to experiment in [[flagellation]] and other [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] practices, which he continued to pursue through most of his adult life. Bird surmises that Grainger's fascination with themes of punishment and pain derived from the harsh discipline to which Rose had subjected him as a child.<ref name= Bird42>Bird, pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\n== London years ==\n\n=== Concert pianist ===\nIn London, Grainger's charm, good looks and talent (with some assistance from the local Australian community) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons. He was soon performing in concerts in private homes. ''The Times'' critic reported after one such appearance that Grainger's playing \"revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight\".<ref>Bird, pp. 63\u201365</ref>  In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals.<ref>Bird, pp. 66 and 73</ref> Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours \u2013 he termed the relationship a \"love-serve job\".<ref name= ODNB /> She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced \"an overpowering landslide\" of feeling, and that \"I thought I was about to die. If I remember correctly, I only experienced fear of death. I don't think that any joy entered into it\".<ref>Pear (\"Grainger: The Formative Years\"), p. 6</ref>\n\nIn February 1902 Grainger made his first appearance as a piano soloist with an orchestra, playing [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto]] with the Bath Pump Room Orchestra. In October of that year he toured Britain in a concert party with [[Adelina Patti]], the Italian-born opera singer. Patti was greatly taken by the young pianist and prophesied a glorious career for him.<ref>Bird, p. 69</ref> The following year he met the German-Italian composer and pianist [[Ferruccio Busoni]]. Initially the two men were on cordial terms (Busoni offered to give Grainger lessons free of charge) and, as a result, Grainger spent part of the 1903 summer in Berlin as Busoni's pupil.<ref name= ADB />  However, the visit was not a success; as Bird notes, Busoni had expected \"a willing slave and adoring disciple\", a role Grainger was not willing to fulfill.<ref>Bird, p. 81</ref> Grainger returned to London in July 1903; almost immediately he departed with Rose on a 10-month tour of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, as a member of a party organised by the Australian contralto [[Ada Crossley]].<ref>Bird, pp. 83\u201388</ref>\n\n=== Emergent composer ===\n[[File:Percy Grainger at the Aeolian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Notice for a 1907 Grainger recital, Aeolian Hall, London]]\nBefore going to London Grainger had composed numerous Kipling settings, and his first mature orchestral pieces.<ref name= Txx>Thwaites (ed.) p. xx</ref> In London, when he found time he continued to compose; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 indicates that he was working on his ''Marching Song of Democracy'' (a [[Walt Whitman]] setting), and had made good progress with the experimental works ''[[Train Music]]'' and ''Charging Irishrey''.<ref>Dreyfus (ed.), p. 2</ref> In his early London years he also composed ''Hill Song Number 1'' (1902), an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni.<ref name= Txx /><ref>Bird, p. 79</ref>\n\nIn 1905, inspired by a lecture given by the pioneer folk-song historian [[Lucy Broadwood]], Grainger began to collect original folk songs. Starting at [[Brigg]] in [[Lincolnshire]], over the next five years he gathered and transcribed more than 300 songs from all over the country, including much material that had never been written down before. From 1906 Grainger used a phonograph, one of the first collectors to do so, and by this means he assembled more than 200 [[phonograph cylinder|Edison cylinder]] recordings of native folk singers.<ref name= Simon5 /><ref>Tall, pp. 55\u201356</ref> These activities coincided with what Bird calls \"the halcyon days of the 'First English Folksong Revival'\".<ref>Bird, p. 102</ref>\n\nAs his stature in the music world increased, Grainger became acquainted with many of its leading figures, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]].<ref name= Simon5 /> In 1907 he met [[Frederick Delius]], with whom he achieved an immediate rapport \u2013 the two musicians had similar ideas about composition and harmony, and shared a dislike for the classical German masters.<ref name= C33 /> Both were inspired by folk music;<ref>Palmer, pp. 79\u201382</ref> Grainger gave Delius his setting of the folk song ''[[Brigg Fair]]'', which  the older composer developed  into his well-known orchestral rhapsody, dedicated to Grainger.<ref name= C33>Carley, pp. 33\u201334</ref> The two remained close friends until Delius's death in 1934.<ref>Carley, pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nGrainger first met [[Edvard Grieg]] at the home of the London financier [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], in May 1906.<ref>Bird, p. 116</ref> As a student Grainger  had learned to appreciate the Norwegian's harmonic originality, and by 1906  had  several Grieg pieces in his concert repertoire, including the [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|piano concerto]].<ref name= GE1 /> Grieg was greatly impressed with Grainger's playing, and wrote: \"I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.\"<ref>Bird, p. 117</ref> During 1906\u201307 the two maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence, which culminated in Grainger's ten-day visit in July 1907 to the composer's Norwegian home, \"Troldhaugen\" near [[Bergen]]. Here the two spent much time revising and rehearsing the piano concerto in preparation for that year's [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]]. Plans for a long-term working relationship were ended by Grieg's sudden death in September 1907; nevertheless, this relatively brief acquaintance had a considerable impact on Grainger, and he championed Grieg's music for the rest of his life.<ref name= GE1>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Gillies\n  | first = Malcolm\n  |author2=Pear, David\n  | title = Great Expectations: Grieg and Granger\n  | journal = The Musical Times\n  | volume = 148\n  | issue = 1900\n  | pages =7\u20139\n  | date = Autumn 2007\n  | language =\n  | doi=10.2307/25434475\n  | jstor = 25434475\n  }}{{subscription}}</ref>\n[[File:GraingerandGrieg1907.jpg|thumb|Grainger (centre), with [[Edvard Grieg]] (left of picture), [[Nina Grieg]] and [[Julius R\u00f6ntgen]], at \"Troldhaugen\", July 1907.]]\nAfter fulfilling a hectic schedule of concert engagements in Britain and continental Europe, in August 1908 Grainger accompanied Ada Crossley on a second Australasian tour, during which he added several cylinders of Maori and Polynesian music to his collection of recordings.<ref name= Simon5>Simon, pp. 5\u20136</ref> He had resolved to establish himself as a top-ranking pianist before promoting himself as a composer,<ref name= OMO /> though he continued to compose both original works and folk-song settings.

He played works by Bach, [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], Handel and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] alongside two of his own compositions: \"Colonial Song\" and \"Mock Morris\". In July 1915 Grainger formally registered his intention to apply for US citizenship.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 36</ref> Over the next two years his engagements included  concerts with Melba in [[Boston]] and [[Pittsburgh]] and a command performance before President [[Woodrow Wilson]].

The piece became instantly popular;   sheet music sales quickly broke many publishing records.<ref>Foreman (\"Miscellaneous Works\"), pp. 137\u201338</ref> The work was to become synonymous with Grainger's name through the rest of his life, though he came in time to detest it.<ref name=\"Simon, p. 7\">Simon, p. 7</ref>  On 3 June 1918 he became a naturalised American citizen.<ref name=\"Gillies and Pear eds, p. xv\">Gillies and Pear (eds), p. xv</ref>\n\n=== Career zenith ===\n[[File:Rose and Percy Grainger.jpg|thumb|left|Rose and Percy Grainger, c.&nbsp;1920]]\nAfter leaving the army in January 1919, Grainger refused an offer to become conductor of the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]] and  resumed his career as a concert pianist.<ref>Bird, p. 162</ref>  He  was soon performing around 120 concerts a year,<ref>Tan, p. 15</ref> generally to great critical acclaim, and in  April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York's [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]]. Grainger  commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as [[Carnegie Hall]] and the Aeolian.<ref>Bird, pp. 167\u201368</ref> In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at [[Chicago Musical College]], the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.<ref name=\"Gillies and Pear eds, p. xv\" /><ref>Bird, p. 166</ref>\n\nAmid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his ''Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away'', and the orchestral version of ''The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart'' both originated in this period.<ref>Bird, pp. 163\u201364</ref>   He also began to develop the technique of [[elastic scoring]], a form of flexible orchestration  which enabled works to be  performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small [[chamber music|chamber]] groups  up to full orchestral strength.<ref>Fairfax, pp. 75\u201377</ref>\n\nIn April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in [[White Plains, New York]] in what is now known as the [[Percy Grainger Home and Studio]]. This was  his  home for the remainder of his life.<ref name= ODNB /> From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from  delusions and nightmares, and became  fearful that her illness would harm her son's career.<ref>Bird, p. 170</ref> Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been  rumours that  their relationship was incestuous;<ref name=\"Simon, p. 7\" />  in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough.<ref name= ARM52>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 52</ref> From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window  on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City.<ref>Bird, pp. 173\u201374</ref> The letter, which began \"I am out of my mind and cannot think properly\", asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to Lotta of \"improper love\". She signed the letter: \"Your poor insane mother\".<ref>Bird, p. 175</ref>\n\n=== Inter-war years ===\n\n==== Traveller ====\n[[File:Fritz Delius (1907).jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick Delius, with whom Grainger enjoyed a long professional and personal relationship]]\nAfter Rose's funeral, Grainger sought solace in a return to work. In autumn 1922 he left for a year-long trip to Europe, where he collected and recorded Danish folk songs before a concert tour that took him to Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and England. In Norway he stayed with Delius at the latter's  summer home. Delius was by now almost blind; Grainger helped fulfill his friend's wish to see a Norwegian sunset by carrying him (with some assistance) to the top of a nearby mountain peak.<ref>Fenby, pp. 74\u201375</ref> He returned to White Plains in August 1923.<ref>Bird, p. 183</ref>\n\nAlthough now less committed to a year-round schedule of concerts, Grainger remained a very popular performer. His eccentricities, often exaggerated for publicity reasons, reportedly included running into auditoriums in gym kit and leaping over the piano to create a grand entrance.<ref>Simon, p. 9</ref> While he continued to revise and re-score his compositions, he increasingly worked on arrangements of music by other composers,<ref>Ould, p. 25</ref> in particular works by Bach, Brahms, [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9|Faur\u00e9]] and Delius.<ref>Bird, pp. 279\u201381</ref> Away from music, Grainger's  preoccupation with Nordic culture led him to develop a form of English which, he maintained, reflected the character of the language before the [[Norman conquest]]. Words of Norman or Latin origin were replaced by supposedly Nordic word-forms, such as \"blend-band\" (orchestra), \"forthspeaker\" (lecturer) and \"writ-piece\" (article). He called this \"blue-eyed\" English.<ref>Bird, p. 53. See also Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 107</ref> His convictions of Nordic superiority eventually led Grainger, in letters to friends, to express his views in crudely racial and anti-Semitic terms; the music historian David Pear describes Grainger as, \"at root, a racial bigot of no small order\".<ref name= G&P4>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 4\u20136</ref>{{#tag:ref|Some of Grainger's earliest published letters contain anti-Semitic comments, for example to Karen Holten in 1905.<ref>Dreyfus (ed.), p. 54</ref> He later asserted that the Jewish race was less capable of producing good music than the Nordic races,<ref>Pear (\"Grainger the Social Commentator\"), p.&nbsp;36</ref> and his letter to Quilter of 25 February 1939 is cited by Gillies and Pear as an example of his racial intolerance.<ref name= G&P4 /><ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 156\u201363</ref>|group= n}}\n\nGrainger made further trips to Europe in 1925 and 1927, collecting more Danish folk music with the aid of the octogenarian ethnologist [[Evald Tang Kristensen]]; this work formed the basis of the ''Suite on Danish Folksongs'' of 1928\u201330.<ref name= OMO /> He also visited Australia and New Zealand, in 1924 and again in 1926. In November 1926, while returning to America, he met Ella Str\u00f6m, a Swedish-born artist with whom he developed a close friendship. On arrival in America the pair separated, but were reunited in England the following autumn after Grainger's final folk-song expedition to Denmark. In October 1927 the couple agreed to marry.<ref>Bird, pp. 194\u201396</ref> Ella had a daughter, Elsie, who had been [[Legitimacy (family law)|born out of wedlock]] in 1909. Grainger always acknowledged her as a family member, and developed a warm personal relationship with her.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. xix</ref>\n\nAlthough Bird asserts that before her marriage, Ella knew nothing of Grainger's sado-masochistic interests,<ref name=Bird200>Bird. pp. 200\u201301</ref> in a letter dated 23 April 1928 (four months before the wedding) Grainger writes to her: \"As far as my taste goes, blows [with the whip] are most thrilling on breasts, bottom, inner thighs, sexparts\". He later adds, \"I shall thoroly thoroly {{sic}} understand if you cannot in any way see yr way to follow up this hot wish of mine\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 94\u2013100</ref> The couple were married on 9 August 1928 at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], at the end of a concert which, in honour of the bride, had included the first performance of Grainger's bridal song \"To a Nordic Princess\".<ref name= OMO />\n\n==== Educator ====\nFrom the late 1920s and early 1930s Grainger became involved increasingly with educational work in schools and colleges,<ref name= OMO /> and in late 1931 accepted a year's appointment for 1932\u201333 as  professor of music at [[New York University]] (NYU). In this role he delivered a series of lectures under the heading \"A General Study of the Manifold Nature of Music\", which introduced his students to a wide range of ancient and modern works.<ref name= OMO /> On 25 October 1932 his lecture was illustrated by [[Duke Ellington]] and his band, who appeared in person; Grainger admired Ellington's music, seeing  harmonic similarities with Delius. On the whole, however, Grainger did not enjoy his tenure at NYU; he disliked the institutional formality, and found the university generally unreceptive to his ideas. Despite many offers he never accepted another formal academic appointment, and refused all offers of [[honorary degree]]s.<ref name= Bird204>Bird, pp. 204\u201305</ref>{{#tag:ref|In April 1945 Grainger declined an honorary doctorate from [[McGill University]] in Montreal, on the grounds that having had only three months' formal schooling, his music \"must be regarded as a product of non-education\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 197\u201398</ref>|group= n}} His New York lectures became the basis for a series of radio talks which he gave for the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]] in 1934\u201335; these were later summarised and published  as ''Music: A  Commonsense  View of All Types''.<ref name= ADB />   In 1937 Grainger began an association with the [[Interlochen Center for the Arts|Interlochen National Music Camp]], and taught regularly at its summer schools until 1944.<ref>Bird, p. 213</ref>\n\n==== Innovator ====\n{{further|Grainger Museum}}\n[[File:Grainger museum university of melbourne.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Grainger Museum]] in Melbourne]]\nThe idea of establishing a Grainger Museum in Australia had first occurred to Grainger in 1932. He began collecting and recovering from friends letters and artifacts, even those demonstrating the most private aspects of his life,<ref>Bird, p. 203</ref> such as whips, bloodstained shirts and revealing photographs.<ref>Piggott, p. 42</ref> In September 1933 he and Ella went to Australia to begin supervising the building work. To finance the project, Grainger embarked on a series of concerts and broadcasts,<ref>Bird, pp. 206\u201307</ref>  in which he subjected his audiences to a vast range of the world's music in accordance with his \"universalist\" view. Controversially, he argued for the  superior achievements of Nordic composers  over traditionally recognised masters such as Mozart and Beethoven.<ref name= ADB />\n\nAmong various new ideas, Grainger introduced his so-called \"free-music\" theories. He believed  that conformity with the traditional rules of set scales, rhythms and harmonic procedures amounted to \"absurd goose-stepping\", from which music should be set free.<ref name= PGstatement>Statement by Percy Grainger entitled \"Free Music\", dated 6 December 1938, in Thwaites (ed.), pp. 207\u201308</ref> He demonstrated two experimental compositions of free music, performed initially by a string quartet and later by the use of electronic [[theremins]].<ref name= ODNB /> He believed that ideally, free music required non-human performance, and spent much of  his later life developing machines to realize this vision.<ref>Simon, p.12</ref>\n\nWhile the building of the museum proceeded, the Graingers visited England for several months in 1936, during which Grainger made his first BBC broadcast. In this, he conducted \"Love Verses from ''The Song of Solomon''\" in which the tenor soloist was the then unknown [[Peter Pears]].<ref>Bird, p. 210</ref> After spending 1937 in America, Grainger returned to Melbourne in 1938 for the official opening of the Museum; among those present at the ceremony was his old piano teacher Adelaide Burkitt.

He wrote  ''A [[Lincolnshire Posy]]'' for the March 1937 convention of the American Band Masters' Association in [[Milwaukee]],<ref>Bird, p. 212</ref> and in 1939, on his last visit to England before the Second World War, he composed \"The Duke of Marlborough's Fanfare\", giving it the subtitle \"British War Mood Grows\".<ref name= Bird214 />\n\n== Later career ==\n\n=== Second World War ===\nThe outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 curtailed Grainger's overseas travelling. In the autumn of 1940, alarmed that the war might precipitate an invasion of the United States eastern seaboard, he and Ella moved to [[Springfield, Missouri]], in the centre of the continent.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 170</ref>  From 1940 Grainger played regularly in charity concerts, especially after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] brought the United States into the war in December 1941; the historian Robert Simon calculates that Grainger made a total of 274 charity appearances during the war years, many of them at [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Army Air Forces|Air Force]] camps.<ref name= S11 /> In 1942 a collection of his Kipling settings, the ''Jungle Book'' cycle, was performed in eight cities by the band of the [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] from [[St. Peter, Minnesota]].<ref>Bird, pp. 217\u201318</ref>\n\n=== Postwar decline ===\nExhausted from his wartime concerts routine, Grainger spent much of 1946 on holiday in Europe. He was suffering a sense of career failure; in 1947, when refusing the Chair of Music at [[University of Adelaide|Adelaide University]], he wrote: \"If I were 40 years younger, and not so crushed by defeat in every branch of music I have essayed, I am sure I would have welcomed such a chance\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), pp. 214\u201319</ref> In January 1948 he conducted the premiere of his [[wind band]] setting of ''The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart'', written for the [[Goldman Band]] to celebrate the 70th birthday of its founder. Afterward, Grainger denigrated his own music as \"commonplace\" while praising  [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''Suite Fran\u00e7aise'', with which it had shared the programme.<ref>Bird, pp. 224\u201325</ref>\n[[File:BBC Proms 31.jpg|thumb|A Promenade concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].

On 18 September he attended the [[Last Night of the Proms]], standing in the promenade section for Delius's ''Brigg Fair''.<ref>Bird, p. 226</ref>  Over the next few years several friends died: Gardiner in 1950, Quilter and Karen Holten in 1953. In October 1953 Grainger was operated on for abdominal cancer; his fight against this disease would last for the rest of his life.<ref>Bird, pp. 238 and 242</ref> He continued to appear at concerts, often performed in church halls and educational establishments rather than major concert venues.<ref name= OMO />\n\nIn 1954, after his last Carnegie Hall appearance, Grainger's long promotion of Grieg's music was recognised when he was awarded the  [[St. Olav Medal]] by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon of Norway]].<ref name= Bird241 /> But he expressed a growing bitterness in his writings and correspondence; in a letter to the Danish composer Herman Sandby, a lifelong friend, he bemoaned the continuing ascendency in music of the \"German form\", and asserted that \"all my compositional life I have been a leader without followers\".<ref name= Bird241>Bird, pp. 241\u201342</ref>\n\nAfter 1950 Grainger virtually ceased to compose. His principal creative activity in the last decade of his life was his work with Burnett Cross, a young physics teacher, on free music machines. The first of these was a relatively simple device controlled by an adapted [[pianola]].<ref name= CG /> Next was the \"Estey-reed tone-tool\", a form of giant harmonica which, Grainger expectantly informed  his stepdaughter Elsie in April 1951, would be ready to play free music \"in a few weeks\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 248</ref> A third machine, the \"Cross-Grainger Kangaroo-pouch\", was completed by 1952.

He refused to consider a \"Grainger Festival\", as suggested by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, because he felt that his homeland had rejected him and his music.

On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital  went well, but his conducting in the afternoon  was, in his own words, \"a fiasco\".<ref>Bird, p. 249</ref><ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 283</ref>  Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie  that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 285</ref>  His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record  attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \"I have been trying to write score for several days.

Besides these, he wrote many  settings of other composers' works.<ref name= ODNB /><ref name= OMO />  Despite his conservatory training, he rebelled against the disciplines of the central European tradition, largely rejecting conventional forms such as  [[symphony]], [[sonata]], [[concerto]], and [[opera]]. With few exceptions, his original compositions are miniatures, lasting between two and eight minutes. Only a few of his works originated as piano pieces, though in due course almost all of them were, in his phrase, \"dished up\" in piano versions.<ref name= OMO />\n\nThe conductor [[John Eliot Gardiner]] describes Grainger as \"a true original in terms of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation\", whose terseness of expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th-century [[Second Viennese School]] and the Italian [[Madrigal (music)|madrigalists]] of the 16th and 17th centuries.<ref name= JEG>{{cite magazine|authorlink= John Eliot Gardiner|last= Gardiner|first= John Eliot|author2=Achenbach, Andrew|title= Happy to talk|url= http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/the-new-gramophone-digital-archive|magazine= Gramophone|date= April 1996|page=20}} {{subscription}}</ref> [[Malcolm Gillies]], a Grainger scholar, writes of Grainger's  style  that \"you know it is 'Grainger' when you have heard about one second of a piece\".<ref name= symposium>{{cite web|last= Gillies|first= Malcolm|title= Grainger: Fifty Years On|url= http://www.grainger.unimelb.edu.au/exhibitions/symposium.html|publisher= Grainger Museum (University of Melbourne)|date= 16 October 2010|accessdate= 5 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005005400/http://www.grainger.unimelb.edu.au/exhibitions/symposium.html|archivedate=5 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music's most individual characteristic, Gillies argues, is its [[Texture (music)|texture]] \u2013 \"the weft of the fabric\", according to Grainger.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 32</ref> Different textures are defined by Grainger as \"smooth\", \"grained\" and \"prickly\".<ref name= OMO />\n\nGrainger was a musical democrat; he believed that in a performance each player's role should be of equal importance. His elastic scoring technique was developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give effective performances of his music. Experimentation is evident in Grainger's earliest works; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of [[time signature]] were employed in ''Love Verses from \"The Song of Solomon\"'' (1899), and ''[[Train Music]]'' (1901), long before [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] adopted this practice.<ref name= Simon2 /> In search of specific sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques: solovoxes, [[theremin]]s, [[marimba]]s, [[glass harp|musical glasses]], [[harmoniums]], [[banjo]]s, and [[ukulele]]s.<ref name= Gram /><ref name= Josephson>Josephson, pp. 614\u201317</ref>  In one early concert of folk music, [[Roger Quilter|Quilter]] and [[Cyril Scott|Scott]] were conscripted as performers, to whistle various parts.<ref>Bird, p. 74</ref>  In \"Random Round\" (1912\u201314), inspired by the communal music-making he had heard in the Pacific Islands on his second Australasian tour, Grainger introduced an element of chance into performances; individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make random choices from a menu of variations.<ref name= OMO />  This experiment in [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by avant-garde composers such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]].<ref>Bird, p. 146</ref>\n\nThe brief \"Sea Song\" of 1907 was an early attempt by Grainger to write \"beatless\" music. This work, initially set over 14 irregular [[Bar (music)|bars]] and occupying about 15 seconds of performing time,<ref>Fairfax, p. 72</ref> was a forerunner of Grainger's [[Free time (music)|free-music]] experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: \"It seems to me absurd to live in an age of flying, and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves.\" The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. \"Out in nature we hear all kinds of lovely and touching \"free\" (non-harmonic) combinations of tones; yet we are unable to take up these beauties\u2026 into the art of music because of our archaic notions of harmony.\"<ref name= PGstatement /> In a 1941 letter to Scott, Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large-scale works in the manner of a [[List of masses, passions and oratorios by Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach oratorio]], a [[Richard Wagner#Operas|Wagner opera]], or a [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms symphony]], but excused this failure on the grounds that all his works before the mid-1930s had been mere preparations for his free music.<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 172</ref>\n\nAs a student, Grainger had learned to appreciate the music of [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]] and came to regard the Norwegian as a paragon of Nordic beauty and greatness. Grieg in turn described Grainger as a new way forward for English composition, \"quite different from [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], very original\". After a lifetime interpreting Grieg's works, in 1944 Grainger began adapting the Norwegian's [[Piano Sonata (Grieg)|E&nbsp;minor Piano Sonata, Op. 7]] as a \"Grieg-Grainger Symphony\", but abandoned the project after writing 16 bars of music. By this time, Grainger acknowledged that he had not fulfilled Grieg's high expectations of him, either as a composer or as a pianist. He also reflected on whether it would have been better, from the point of view of his development as a composer, had he never met the Grieg's, \"sweet and dear though they were to me\".<ref name= Bergen>{{cite web|last= Gillies|first= Malcolm|author2=Pear, David|title= Percy Grainger: Grieg's Interpreter and Propagator|url= http://griegsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Gillies-and-Pear-paper-2007.pdf|publisher= International Grieg Society Conference|pages= 2\u20135|date= 30 May 2007|accessdate= 5 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nGrainger was known for his musical experimentation and did not hesitate to exploit the capabilities of the orchestra. One early ambitious work was ''The Warriors'' (1913), an 18-minute orchestral piece, subtitled \"Music to an Imaginary Ballet\", which he dedicated to [[Frederick Delius|Delius]]. The music, which mixes elements of other Grainger works with references to [[Arnold Bax]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Richard Strauss]], requires a huge orchestral ensemble alongside at least three pianos \u2013 in one performance, Grainger used nineteen pianos with thirty pianists \u2013 to be played by \"exceptionally strong vigorous players\". Critics were undecided as to whether the work was \"magnificent\", or merely \"a magnificent failure\".<ref>{{cite web|last= Servadei|first= Alessandro|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130906120206/http://www.chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%209584.pdf |title= Percy Grainger:  Orchestral works 2 (in Notes to CD Chan 9584)|publisher= Chandos Records|year= 2008|accessdate= 17 May 2016|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130906120206/http://www.chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%209584.pdf|archivedate= 6 September 2013|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nGrainger considered himself an Australian composer who, he said, wrote music \"in the hopes of bringing honor and fame to my native land\".<ref>Covell, p. 141</ref>  However, much of Grainger's working life was spent elsewhere, and the extent to which he influenced  Australian music, within his lifetime and thereafter, is debatable.<ref name= Covell147 /> His efforts to educate the Australian musical public in the mid-1930s were indifferently received, and did not attract disciples;<ref name= Covell145>Covell, pp. 145\u201346</ref>  writing in 2010, the academic and critic [[Roger Covell]] identifies only one significant contemporary Australian musician \u2013 the English-born horn player, pianist and conductor [[David Stanhope]] \u2013 working in the Grainger idiom.<ref name= Covell147>Covell, p. 147</ref> In 1956, the suggestion by  the composer [[Keith Humble]] that Grainger  be invited to write  music for the opening of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in Melbourne was rejected by the organisers of the Games.<ref name= Bird243 /> A \"Percy Grainger Festival\" was held in London in 1970, organised by Australian expatriates [[Bryan Fairfax]] and [[William McKie (musician)|William McKie]] and supported financially by the Australian government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-2200|title=Percy Grainger Festival \u2013 Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton|date=19 March 1970|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)]]}}</ref>\n\nGrainger was a life-long atheist and believed he would only endure in the body of work he left behind.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=http://www.percygrainger.org/biograf3.htm\n|title=A Source Guide to the Music of Percy Grainger\n|author=Thomas P.

His pioneering work in the recording and setting of folk songs greatly influenced the following generation of English composers; Benjamin Britten acknowledged the Australian as his master in this respect.<ref>Bird, p. 114</ref> After hearing a broadcast of some Grainger settings, Britten   declared that these \"[knocked] all the [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[R. O. Morris]] arrangements into a cocked hat\".<ref>Lloyd, p. 21</ref> In the United States, Grainger left a strong educational legacy through his involvement, over 40 years, with high school, summer school and college students. Likewise, his innovative approaches to instrumentation and scoring have left their mark on modern American band music;<ref name= OMO /> Timothy Reynish, a conductor and teacher of band music in Europe and America, has described him as \"the only composer of stature to consider military bands the equal, if not the superior, in expressive potential to symphony orchestras.\"<ref>Reynish, p. 20</ref> Grainger's attempts to produce \"free music\" by mechanical and later electronic means, which he considered his most important work, produced no follow-up; they were quickly overtaken and nullified  by new technological advances. Covell nevertheless remarks that in this endeavour, Grainger's dogged resourcefulness and ingenious  use of available materials demonstrate a particularly Australian aspect of the composer's character \u2013 one of which Grainger would have been proud.<ref>Covell, p. 148</ref>\n\n== Assessment ==\n[[File:grainger stone.jpg|thumb|Percy Grainger's tombstone \"World famous composer and pianist\"]]\n\nIn 1945 Grainger devised an informal ratings system for composers and musical styles, based on  criteria that included originality, complexity and beauty. Of forty composers and styles, he ranked himself equal ninth \u2013 behind Wagner and\nDelius, but well ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky.<ref name= Bergen /> Nevertheless, in his later years he  frequently denigrated  his career, for example writing to Scott: \"I have never been a true musician or true artist\".<ref>Gillies and Pear (eds), p. 255</ref>  His failure to be recognised as a composer for anything beyond his  popular folk-song arrangements was a source of frustration and disappointment;<ref name= Pear32>Pear (\"Grainger the Social Commentator\"), p. 32</ref> for years after his death  the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed.<ref>Ould, p. 29</ref> From the 1990s an increase in the number of Grainger  recordings has brought a revival of interest in his works, and has enhanced his reputation as a composer.<ref name= ADB /> An unsigned tribute published on the ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' website in February 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Grainger's death opined that \"though he would never be put on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals, he is unorthodox, original and deserves better than to be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical taste\".<ref name= Gram />\n\nOf Grainger the pianist, ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]] wrote that his unique style was  expressed with \"amazing skill, personality and vigor\".<ref>Quoted by Bird, pp. 100\u201301, from Schonberg, Harold (1964): ''The Great Pianists'', London, Victor Gollancz</ref>  The early enthusiasm which had greeted his concert appearances became muted in later years, and reviews of his performances during the final ten years of his life were often harsh.<ref>Bird, pp. 238\u201339</ref>  However, Britten regarded Grainger's late recording of the Grieg concerto, from a live performance at [[Aarhus]] in 1957, as \"one of the noblest ever committed to record\" \u2013 despite the suppression of the disc for many years, because of the proliferation of wrong notes and other faults.<ref name= Bird246>Bird, pp. 246\u201347</ref>  Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum, referring to Grainger's early displays of artistic skills, has speculated that had John Grainger's influence not been removed, \"Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be remembered as one of Australia's leading painters and designers, who just happened to have a latent talent as a pianist and composer\".<ref>Allison, p. 53</ref> The [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] John Blacking, while acknowledging Grainger's contribution to social and cultural aspects of music, nevertheless writes that if the continental foundation of Grainger's musical education had not been \"undermined by dilettantism and the disastrous influence of his mother, I am sure that his ultimate contribution to the world of music would have been much greater\".<ref>Blacking, p. 1</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\nBetween 1908 and 1957 Grainger made numerous recordings, usually as pianist or conductor, of his own and other composers' music. His first recordings, for [[HMV Records|The Gramophone Company Ltd]] (later HMV), included the [[cadenza]] to Grieg's piano concerto; he did not record a complete version of this work on disc until 1945. Much of his recording work was done between 1917 and 1931, under contract with  [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. At other times he recorded for [[Decca Records|Decca]] (1944\u201345 and 1957), and [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] (1957). Of his own compositions and arrangements, \"Country Gardens\", \"Shepherd's Hey\" and \"[[Molly on the Shore]]\" and \"Lincolnshire Posy\" were recorded most frequently; in recordings of other composers, piano works by Bach, Brahms, Chopin, Grieg, [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]  figure most often.<ref>Thwaites (ed.), pp. 227\u201332</ref> Grainger's complete 78&nbsp;rpm solo piano recordings are now available on compact disc as a CD box set.<ref>{{cite web|last= Woolf|first= Jonathan|title= Percy Grainger; the complete 78rpm solo recordings|url= http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2011/June11/grainger_78_recs_7501.htm|publisher= MusicWeb International|year=2011|accessdate= 16 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring his association with the [[Duo-Art]] company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 [[piano roll]]s of his own and others' music using a wooden robot designed to play a [[grand piano|concert grand piano]] via an array of precision mechanical fingers and feet; replayings of many of these rolls have subsequently been recorded on to [[compact disc]].<ref>Bird, pp. 304\u201306</ref><ref>Thwaites (ed.), pp. 233\u201335</ref> This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the [[Albert Hall]], London, during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Grieg's Piano Concerto]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pianola Institute concerts \u2013 archive |url=http://www.pianola.org/concerts/concerts_archive.cfm |publisher=The Pianola Institute |accessdate=17 May 2016 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916125735/http://www.pianola.org/concerts/concerts_archive.cfm |archivedate=16 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSince Grainger's death, recordings of his works have been undertaken by many artists and issued under many different labels.
