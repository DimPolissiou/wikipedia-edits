Chinese doctor Cheng Maoxian, born in 1581, lived and practiced medicine in Yangzhou in the 1610s and 1620s. He took diligent care to write case studies of his interactions with his patients and their ailments as well as his prescribed medicines.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292}}</ref> Doctors such as Maoxian treated men as well as women, however Cheng described each case study with reference to contemporary social structures.\n\nIn encounters between sick women and their male doctors, women were often shy about their issues and frequently made the doctor's work more difficult by concealing the extent all symptoms. Even if they did confess all their symptoms, doctors, such as Cheng, would consider the majority of the illness to be linked to some problem concerning the woman's reproductive system or cycle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Congzhou|first1=Cheng}}</ref> One of the stories Cheng discussed in his case studies was that of Fan Jisuo's teenage daughter, who could not be diagnosed because she was unwilling to speak on her symptoms. In this particular case, the illness involved discharge from her intimate areas. Cheng insisted on asking more about her illness and the patient's modesty became a frustrating obstacle.\n\nWhen a woman fell ill, an appropriate adult man was to call the doctor and remain present during the examination, for the woman could not be left alone with the doctor. However, this was not always the case. In particular cases, when a woman dealt with complications of pregnancy or birth, older women became involved and assumed the role of the formal authority. Men in these situations would not have much power to interfere.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, when a doctor's visit was absolutely necessary, a breaking of norms was sometimes necessary. To properly examine the patient, doctors were faced with the task of going beyond the norm of female modesty. As Cheng describes, there were four standard methods of diagnosis\u2014looking, asking, listening and smelling and touching (for pulse-taking). To maintain some form of modesty, women would often stay hidden behind curtains and screens. The doctor was allowed to touch enough of her body to complete his examination, often just the pulse taking. This would lead to situations where the symptoms and the doctor's diagnosis did not agree and the doctor would have to ask to see more of the patient.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History: 960\u20131665|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292|page=248}}</ref>\n\n=== Yin Yang and Gender ===\nGender was presumed to influence the movement of energy and a well-trained physician would be expected to read the pulse and should have been able to identify two dozen or more energy flows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canon of the Pulse (Maijing)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Yin and yang concepts were applied to the feminine and masculine aspects of all bodies at large, implying that in nature the differences between men and women begin at the level of this energy flow.

Second, women were often silent about their issues with doctors and male figures due to the societal expectation of female modesty and the presence of a male figure in the room.<ref name=\":03\" /> Third, the presence of male authority in the sick room and the patriarchal dominated society also caused doctors to reference their women and children patients \"the anonymous category of family members (''Jia Ren'') or household (''Ju Jia'')\"<ref name=\":03\" /> in their journals.

Ancient Roman doctors were forbidden from performing this procedure on living women, however.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/gynecology/ |title = Ancient Gynecology}}</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine's attempts to grapple with pregnancy are documented from at least the seventeenth century. According to Charlotte Furth, \"a pregnancy (in the seventeenth century) as a known bodily experience emerged [...] out of the liminality of menstrual irregularity, as uneasy digestion, and a sense of fullness\".<ref name=\":03\" /> These symptoms were common among other illness as well, so the diagnosis of pregnancy often came later in the term. The ''Canon of the Pulse'' or the use of pulse in diagnosis stated that pregnancy was \"a condition marked by symptoms of disorder in one whose pulse is normal\" or \"where the pulse and symptoms do not agree\".<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Diagnosis for Pulse-Taking and Pulse Subtlety|date=March 2019|pages=69\u201377|publisher=WORLD SCIENTIFIC|isbn=9789813273573|doi=10.1142/9789813273580_0017|title=The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine \u2013 Essential Questions}}</ref> Just as in the normal diagnosis process, women were often silent about suspected pregnancy, this led to many men in the households not knowing their wife or daughter was pregnant until complications arrived.\n\nComplications through the misdiagnosis and silence of pregnancies often involved medically induced abortions, according to Furth's book, Dr.Cheng (her case study) \"was unapologetic about endangering a fetus when pregnancy risked a mother's well being\".<ref name=\":03\" /> The method of abortion was used through the ingestion of certain herbs and medicinal foods. Dr.Cheng gave his wife \"peach kemel and Tibetan crocus (to break up blood and abort [the lump in her stomach]\".<ref name=\":03\" /> The practice of abortion was contrasted with the families disappointment and disapproval of the loss of the fetus and often led to familial complications down the line.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n=== Postpartum ===\nIf the baby and mother survived the term of the pregnancy, childbirth was then the next step.

According to Charlotte Furth and her book, ''A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China\u2019s Medical History'', yin and yang showed the embodiment of nature within human bodies, and with it the natural phenomena that we understand as gendered differences.<ref name=\":13\" /> Yin and yang ruled the body, the body being a microcosm of the universe and the earth. In addition, gender in the body was understood as homologous, the two genders operating in synchronization.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nOperating within yin and yang, bodily functions could be categorized through systems. In many drawings and diagrams, the twelve channels and their visceral systems were organized by yin and yang, and that organization was identical in female and male bodies. This points to the understanding in traditional Chinese medicine that female and male bodies were no different on the plane of yin and yang. Their gendered differences were not acknowledged in diagrams of the human body. Medical journals were filled with illustrations of male bodies or androgynous bodies, those that did not display gendered characteristics.<ref>Wu, Yi-Li, and {{lang|zh|\u5433\u4e00\u7acb}}. \"The Gendered Medical Iconography of the Golden Mirror, Yuzuan Yizong Jinjian {{lang|zh|\u5fa1\u7e82\u91ab\u5b97\u91d1\u9451}}, 1742.\" In ''Imagining Chinese Medicine'', edited by Lo Vivienne, {{lang|zh|\u7f85\u7dad\u524d}}, Barrett Penelope, Dear David, Di Lu, {{lang|zh|\u8606\u7b1b}}, Reynolds Lois, Yang Dolly, and {{lang|zh|\u694a\u5fb7\u79c0}}, 111\u201332.

As in other cultures, fertility and menstruation dominate female health in Chinese medicine. However, it was not physical, anatomical structures that differentiated women from men, but physiological and pathological processes of the body.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is an important distinction, because it refers back to the traditional Chinese understanding of Yin and Yang and gender differences. Bodies looked the same, and were governed by the same forces, but their processes looked different in men and women.\n\nFor example, understanding the womb and its fundamental difference from male bodies was irrelevant. Traditional Chinese medicine did not recognize the womb as the place of reproduction. For the Chinese, the abdominal cavity presented pathologies that were similar in both men and women, which included tumors, growths, hernias, and swellings of the genitals. The \"master system\" as Charlotte Furth identifies, is the kidney visceral system, which governed reproductive functions in TCM.<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, it was not the anatomical structures in women that allowed for pregnancy, but the difference in female processes that allowed for the affliction of pregnancy to occur.\n\nSocial and cultural beliefs were often barriers to learning more about female health, with women themselves often being the most formidable barrier. Women were often uncomfortable talking about their illnesses, especially in front of the male chaperones that attended medical examinations.<ref name=\":13\" /> Women would choose to omit certain symptoms as a means of upholding their chastity and honor. One such examples is the case in which a teenage girl was unable to be diagnosed because she failed to mention her symptom of vaginal discharge.<ref name=\":13\" /> Silence was their way of maintaining control in these situations, but it often came at the expense of their health and the advancement of female health and medicine. This silence and control was most obviously seen when the health problem was related to the core of Ming ''fuke'', or the sexual body.<ref name=\":13\" /> It was often in these diagnostic settings that women would choose silence. In addition, there would be conflict between patient and doctor on the probability of her diagnosis. For example, a woman who thought herself to be past the point of child-bearing age, might not believe a doctor who diagnoses her as pregnant.<ref name=\":13\" /> This only resulted in more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, female health and medicine was a topic that was not well understood by TCM. Although ''yin'' and ''yang'' were central to understanding female bodies, it was often only through the lens of male bodies. Women were seen as variations of male bodies, with similar structures but different processes. This was also compounded by the autonomy of women who chose to stay silent during diagnostics, and thus complicate the issue of female health and medicine.\n\n==== Infertility ====\nInfertility was also not very well understood in TCM, however it posed serious social and cultural repercussions.\n\nOne of the most cited scholar that mentions female health is 7th-century scholar Sun Simiao. He is often quoted to the likes of \"those who have prescriptions for women's distinctiveness take their differences of pregnancy, childbirth and [internal] bursting injuries as their basis.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Even in contemporary ''fu ke'' does Sun's observations about female reproductive functions, it stills remains an important function of women's health. The propensity to place more emphasis on reproductive functions, rather than the entire health of the woman, seems to suggest that the main function of ''fu ke'' is to produce children.\n\nOnce again, the kidney visceral system governs the \"source ''Qi,''\" which governs the reproductive systems in both sexes. This source ''Qi'' was thought to \"be slowly depleted through sexual activity, menstruation and childbirth.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> It was also understood that the depletion of source Qi could result from the movement of an external pathology that moved through the outer visceral systems before causing more permanent damage to the home of source Qi, the kidney system. In addition, the view that only very serious ailments ended in the damage of this system means that those who had trouble with their reproductive systems or fertility were seriously ill.\n\nAccording to traditional Chinese medical texts, infertility can be summarized into different syndrome types. These were spleen and kidney depletion (yang depletion), liver and kidney depletion (yin depletion), blood depletion, phlegm damp, liver oppression, and damp heat. This is important because, while most other issues were complex in Chinese medical physiology, women's fertility issues were simple. Most syndrome types revolved around menstruation, or lack thereof. The patient was entrusted with recording not only the frequency, but also the \"volume, color, consistency, and odor of menstrual flow.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This placed responsibility of symptom recording on the patient, and was compounded by the earlier discussed issue of female chastity and honor. This meant that diagnosing female infertility was difficult, because the only symptoms that were recorded and monitored by the physician was the pulse and color of the tongue.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of infertility shows how social and cultural barriers affected the practice of traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n== Concept of disease ==\nIn general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xu\u0115, z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Therapy is based on which \"pattern of disharmony\" can be identified.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> Thus, \"pattern discrimination\" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n\nTo determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref>\"Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine\", Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}</ref> For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: \"Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.\"<ref name=Deadman>Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji.

Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the \"Eight Principles\" ({{zh|c=\u516b\u7eb2 |labels=no|p=b\u0101 g\u0101ng}}).<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\nThese eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:\n* ''Yin and yang'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as \"yin patterns\" and \"yang patterns\" respectively.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Exterior'' ({{zh|c=\u8868|labels=no|p=bi\u01ceo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body \u2013 skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a \"floating\" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Interior'' ({{zh|c=\u91cc|labels=no|p=l\u01d0}}) refers to disease manifestation in the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected z\u00e0ng or f\u01d4 entity.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Cold'' ({{zh|c=\u5bd2|labels=no|p=h\u00e1n}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Heat'' ({{zh|c=\u70ed|labels=no|p=r\u00e8}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Deficiency'' ({{zh|c=\u865a|labels=no|p=x\u016b}}), can be further differentiated into deficiency of [[#Qi|qi]], xu\u011b, [[#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Yin deficiency can also cause \"empty-heat\".<ref name=\"Kaptchuck 2000\"/>\n* ''Excess'' ({{zh|c=\u5b9e|labels=no|p=sh\u00ed}}) generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a deficient pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> or a pattern of stagnation (of qi, xu\u011b, etc.).<ref>Tierra & Tierra 1998, p. 108</ref> In a concurrent exterior pattern, excess is characterized by the absence of sweating.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\nAfter the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight

Details of the tongue, including shape, size, color, texture, cracks, teethmarks, as well as tongue coating are all considered as part of [[tongue diagnosis]]. Various regions of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the z\u00e0ng-f\u016d organs. For example, redness on the tip of the tongue might indicate heat in the Heart, while redness on the sides of the tongue might indicate a heat in the Liver.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maciocia |first1=Giovanni |title=Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine |date=2001}}</ref>\n\nPulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain z\u00e0ng-f\u016d. The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like \"floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick\"; each of these qualities indicate certain [[#Patterns|disease patterns]].

Chinese doctor Cheng Maoxian, born in 1581, lived and practiced medicine in Yangzhou in the 1610s and 1620s. He took diligent care to write case studies of his interactions with his patients and their ailments as well as his prescribed medicines.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292}}</ref> Doctors such as Maoxian treated men as well as women, however Cheng described each case study with reference to contemporary social structures.\n\nIn encounters between sick women and their male doctors, women were often shy about their issues and frequently made the doctor's work more difficult by concealing the extent all symptoms. Even if they did confess all their symptoms, doctors, such as Cheng, would consider the majority of the illness to be linked to some problem concerning the woman's reproductive system or cycle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Congzhou|first1=Cheng}}</ref> One of the stories Cheng discussed in his case studies was that of Fan Jisuo's teenage daughter, who could not be diagnosed because she was unwilling to speak on her symptoms. In this particular case, the illness involved discharge from her intimate areas. Cheng insisted on asking more about her illness and the patient's modesty became a frustrating obstacle.\n\nWhen a woman fell ill, an appropriate adult man was to call the doctor and remain present during the examination, for the woman could not be left alone with the doctor. However, this was not always the case. In particular cases, when a woman dealt with complications of pregnancy or birth, older women became involved and assumed the role of the formal authority. Men in these situations would not have much power to interfere.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, when a doctor's visit was absolutely necessary, a breaking of norms was sometimes necessary. To properly examine the patient, doctors were faced with the task of going beyond the norm of female modesty. As Cheng describes, there were four standard methods of diagnosis\u2014looking, asking, listening and smelling and touching (for pulse-taking). To maintain some form of modesty, women would often stay hidden behind curtains and screens. The doctor was allowed to touch enough of her body to complete his examination, often just the pulse taking. This would lead to situations where the symptoms and the doctor's diagnosis did not agree and the doctor would have to ask to see more of the patient.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History: 960\u20131665|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292|page=248}}</ref>\n\n=== Yin Yang and Gender ===\nGender was presumed to influence the movement of energy and a well-trained physician would be expected to read the pulse and should have been able to identify two dozen or more energy flows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canon of the Pulse (Maijing)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Yin and yang concepts were applied to the feminine and masculine aspects of all bodies at large, implying that in nature the differences between men and women begin at the level of this energy flow.

Second, women were often silent about their issues with doctors and male figures due to the societal expectation of female modesty and the presence of a male figure in the room.<ref name=\":03\" /> Third, the presence of male authority in the sick room and the patriarchal dominated society also caused doctors to reference their women and children patients \"the anonymous category of family members (''Jia Ren'') or household (''Ju Jia'')\"<ref name=\":03\" /> in their journals.

The term [[Caesarean section]] derives from an ancient Roman, or Caesarean (from Caesar) law that demanded that when a pregnant woman died, her body could not be buried until the unborn child had been removed. Ancient Roman doctors were forbidden from performing this procedure on living women, however.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/gynecology/ |title = Ancient Gynecology}}</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine's attempts to grapple with pregnancy are documented from at least the seventeenth century. According to Charlotte Furth, \"a pregnancy (in the seventeenth century) as a known bodily experience emerged [...] out of the liminality of menstrual irregularity, as uneasy digestion, and a sense of fullness\".<ref name=\":03\" /> These symptoms were common among other illness as well, so the diagnosis of pregnancy often came later in the term.

According to Charlotte Furth and her book, ''A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China\u2019s Medical History'', yin and yang showed the embodiment of nature within human bodies, and with it the natural phenomena that we understand as gendered differences.<ref name=\":13\" /> Yin and yang ruled the body, the body being a microcosm of the universe and the earth. In addition, gender in the body was understood as homologous, the two genders operating in synchronization.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nOperating within yin and yang, bodily functions could be categorized through systems. In many drawings and diagrams, the twelve channels and their visceral systems were organized by yin and yang, and that organization was identical in female and male bodies. This points to the understanding in traditional Chinese medicine that female and male bodies were no different on the plane of yin and yang. Their gendered differences were not acknowledged in diagrams of the human body. Medical journals were filled with illustrations of male bodies or androgynous bodies, those that did not display gendered characteristics.<ref>Wu, Yi-Li, and {{lang|zh|\u5433\u4e00\u7acb}}. \"The Gendered Medical Iconography of the Golden Mirror, Yuzuan Yizong Jinjian {{lang|zh|\u5fa1\u7e82\u91ab\u5b97\u91d1\u9451}}, 1742.\" In ''Imagining Chinese Medicine'', edited by Lo Vivienne, {{lang|zh|\u7f85\u7dad\u524d}}, Barrett Penelope, Dear David, Di Lu, {{lang|zh|\u8606\u7b1b}}, Reynolds Lois, Yang Dolly, and {{lang|zh|\u694a\u5fb7\u79c0}}, 111\u201332.

As in other cultures, fertility and menstruation dominate female health in Chinese medicine. However, it was not physical, anatomical structures that differentiated women from men, but physiological and pathological processes of the body.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is an important distinction, because it refers back to the traditional Chinese understanding of Yin and Yang and gender differences. Bodies looked the same, and were governed by the same forces, but their processes looked different in men and women.\n\nFor example, understanding the womb and its fundamental difference from male bodies was irrelevant. Traditional Chinese medicine did not recognize the womb as the place of reproduction. For the Chinese, the abdominal cavity presented pathologies that were similar in both men and women, which included tumors, growths, hernias, and swellings of the genitals. The \"master system\" as Charlotte Furth identifies, is the kidney visceral system, which governed reproductive functions in TCM.<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, it was not the anatomical structures in women that allowed for pregnancy, but the difference in female processes that allowed for the affliction of pregnancy to occur.\n\nSocial and cultural beliefs were often barriers to learning more about female health, with women themselves often being the most formidable barrier. Women were often uncomfortable talking about their illnesses, especially in front of the male chaperones that attended medical examinations.<ref name=\":13\" /> Women would choose to omit certain symptoms as a means of upholding their chastity and honor. One such examples is the case in which a teenage girl was unable to be diagnosed because she failed to mention her symptom of vaginal discharge.<ref name=\":13\" /> Silence was their way of maintaining control in these situations, but it often came at the expense of their health and the advancement of female health and medicine. This silence and control was most obviously seen when the health problem was related to the core of Ming ''fuke'', or the sexual body.<ref name=\":13\" /> It was often in these diagnostic settings that women would choose silence. In addition, there would be conflict between patient and doctor on the probability of her diagnosis. For example, a woman who thought herself to be past the point of child-bearing age, might not believe a doctor who diagnoses her as pregnant.<ref name=\":13\" /> This only resulted in more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, female health and medicine was a topic that was not well understood by TCM. Although ''yin'' and ''yang'' were central to understanding female bodies, it was often only through the lens of male bodies. Women were seen as variations of male bodies, with similar structures but different processes. This was also compounded by the autonomy of women who chose to stay silent during diagnostics, and thus complicate the issue of female health and medicine.\n\n==== Infertility ====\nInfertility was also not very well understood in TCM, however it posed serious social and cultural repercussions.\n\nOne of the most cited scholar that mentions female health is 7th-century scholar Sun Simiao. He is often quoted to the likes of \"those who have prescriptions for women's distinctiveness take their differences of pregnancy, childbirth and [internal] bursting injuries as their basis.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Even in contemporary ''fu ke'' does Sun's observations about female reproductive functions, it stills remains an important function of women's health. The propensity to place more emphasis on reproductive functions, rather than the entire health of the woman, seems to suggest that the main function of ''fu ke'' is to produce children.\n\nOnce again, the kidney visceral system governs the \"source ''Qi,''\" which governs the reproductive systems in both sexes. This source ''Qi'' was thought to \"be slowly depleted through sexual activity, menstruation and childbirth.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> It was also understood that the depletion of source Qi could result from the movement of an external pathology that moved through the outer visceral systems before causing more permanent damage to the home of source Qi, the kidney system. In addition, the view that only very serious ailments ended in the damage of this system means that those who had trouble with their reproductive systems or fertility were seriously ill.\n\nAccording to traditional Chinese medical texts, infertility can be summarized into different syndrome types. These were spleen and kidney depletion (yang depletion), liver and kidney depletion (yin depletion), blood depletion, phlegm damp, liver oppression, and damp heat. This is important because, while most other issues were complex in Chinese medical physiology, women's fertility issues were simple. Most syndrome types revolved around menstruation, or lack thereof. The patient was entrusted with recording not only the frequency, but also the \"volume, color, consistency, and odor of menstrual flow.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This placed responsibility of symptom recording on the patient, and was compounded by the earlier discussed issue of female chastity and honor. This meant that diagnosing female infertility was difficult, because the only symptoms that were recorded and monitored by the physician was the pulse and color of the tongue.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of infertility shows how social and cultural barriers affected the practice of traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n== Concept of disease ==\nIn general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xu\u0115, z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Therapy is based on which \"pattern of disharmony\" can be identified.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> Thus, \"pattern discrimination\" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n\nTo determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref>\"Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine\", Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}</ref> For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: \"Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.\"<ref name=Deadman>Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji.

Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the \"Eight Principles\" ({{zh|c=\u516b\u7eb2 |labels=no|p=b\u0101 g\u0101ng}}).<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\nThese eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:\n* ''Yin and yang'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as \"yin patterns\" and \"yang patterns\" respectively.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Exterior'' ({{zh|c=\u8868|labels=no|p=bi\u01ceo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body \u2013 skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a \"floating\" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Interior'' ({{zh|c=\u91cc|labels=no|p=l\u01d0}}) refers to disease manifestation in the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected z\u00e0ng or f\u01d4 entity.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Cold'' ({{zh|c=\u5bd2|labels=no|p=h\u00e1n}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Heat'' ({{zh|c=\u70ed|labels=no|p=r\u00e8}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Deficiency'' ({{zh|c=\u865a|labels=no|p=x\u016b}}), can be further differentiated into deficiency of [[#Qi|qi]], xu\u011b, [[#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Yin deficiency can also cause \"empty-heat\".<ref name=\"Kaptchuck 2000\"/>\n* ''Excess'' ({{zh|c=\u5b9e|labels=no|p=sh\u00ed}}) generally refers to any disease that can't be

Details of the tongue, including shape, size, color, texture, cracks, teethmarks, as well as tongue coating are all considered as part of [[tongue diagnosis]]. Various regions of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the z\u00e0ng-f\u016d organs. For example, redness on the tip of the tongue might indicate heat in the Heart, while redness on the sides of the tongue might indicate a heat in the Liver.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maciocia |first1=Giovanni |title=Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine |date=2001}}</ref>\n\nPulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain z\u00e0ng-f\u016d. The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like \"floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick\"; each of these qualities indicate certain [[#Patterns|disease patterns]].

Most stories attribute its creation to Lord Lamington's chef, the French-born Armand Galland, who was called upon at short notice to feed unexpected guests. Using only the limited ingredients available, Galland cut up some left-over [[French cuisine|French]] [[vanilla]] [[sponge cake]] baked the day before, dipped the slices in chocolate and set them in coconut. Impressed by Galland's creation, Lamington's guests were said to have later asked for the recipe. This version of events is supported by Lady Lamington's memoirs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/galland-attempt-to-please-a-lady-takes-the-cake-20090605-bylq.html |first=Cosima |last=Marriner |title=Galland attempt to please a Lady takes the Cake |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |issn=03126315 |date=6 June 2009 |quote=Lady Lamington refers to the cake in memoirs she wrote for her children. \"She makes the point the lamington was created by their French chef Armand Galland,\" curator Katie McConnel says. |access-date=27 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515041945/https://www.smh.com.au/national/galland-attempt-to-please-a-lady-takes-the-cake-20090605-bylq.html |archive-date=15 May 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Coconut was not widely used in European cooking at that time, but was known to Galland, whose wife was from [[Tahiti]], where coconut was a common ingredient.\n\n[[File:Lamingtons on a plate.jpg|alt=multiple cakes served with fruit on a plate|thumb|A plate of lamingtons with fruit]]\nOne account suggests that the lamington was first served in [[Toowoomba]], when Lord Lamington took his entourage to Harlaxton House to escape the steamy heat of [[Brisbane]],<ref>{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Halmagyi |url=http://www.fast-ed.com.au/a-brief-history-of-lamingtons/ |title=A brief history of lamingtons |date=6 July 2011 |website=www.fast-ed.com.au |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055930/http://www.fast-ed.com.au/a-brief-history-of-lamingtons/ |archive-date=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> whereas another claims that it was created by Galland at [[Old Government House, Queensland|Queensland's Government House]] in Brisbane during the busy period leading up to [[Federation of Australia|Federation in 1901]].

Using only the limited ingredients available, Galland cut up some left-over [[French cuisine|French]] [[vanilla]] [[sponge cake]] baked the day before, dipped the slices in chocolate and set them in coconut. Impressed by Galland's creation, Lamington's guests were said to have later asked for the recipe.

{"title_page": "Fisher hypothesis", "text_new": "In [[economics]], the '''Fisher hypothesis'''  (sometimes called the Fisher effect)  is the proposition by [[Irving Fisher]] that the [[real interest rate]] is independent of monetary measures, specifically the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] interest rate and the expected [[inflation rate]]. The term \"nominal interest rate\" refers to the actual interest rate giving the amount by which a number of dollars or other unit of currency owed by a borrower to a lender grows over time; the term \"real interest rate\" refers to the amount by which the purchasing power of those dollars grows over time&mdash;that is the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of the loan proceeds.\n\nThe relation between the nominal and real rates is approximately given by the [[Fisher equation]] which is\n\n:<math>r = i - \\pi^e.</math>\n\nThis states that the [[real interest rate]] (<math>r</math>) equals the [[nominal interest rate]] (<math>i</math>) minus the expected [[inflation rate]] (<math>\\pi^e</math>).

The term \"nominal interest rate\" refers to the actual interest rate giving the amount by which a number of dollars or other unit of currency owed by a borrower to a lender grows over time; the term \"real interest rate\" refers to the amount by which the purchasing power of those dollars grows over time&mdash;that is, the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of the loan proceeds.\n\nThe relation between the nominal and real rates is approximately given by the [[Fisher equation]], which is\n\n:<math>r = i - \\pi^e.</math>\n\nThis states that the [[real interest rate]] (<math>r</math>) equals the [[nominal interest rate]] (<math>i</math>) minus the expected [[inflation rate]] (<math>\\pi^e</math>).

Their next \u2013 ''Ghajini'', a Bollywood movie starring Aamir Khan grossed over $45 million at box office, making it the highest grossing Indian film. The smashing blockbuster ''[[Magadheera]]'', a big-budget swords and sandal epic that grossed $25 million at the box office.

The smashing blockbuster ''[[Magadheera]]'', a big-budget swords and sandal epic that grossed $25 million at the box office.
