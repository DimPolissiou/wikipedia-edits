Presently he is a member of [[Malaysian United Indigenous Party]] (PPBM), a component of [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH) ruling coalition since he quitted UMNO to join PPBM on 4 June 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/06/04/rais-yatim-joins-pribumi/|title=Rais Yatim joins Pribumi|date=4 June 2018|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/06/04/umno-veteran-rais-yatim-joins-ppbm/|title=Umno veteran Rais Yatim joins PPBM|date=4 June 2018|author=Minderjeet Kaur |publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving active politics he became the President of the [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] (IIUM) from 2013 to 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rais Yatim dilantik Presiden UIAM|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/nasional/rais-yatim-dilantik-presiden-uiam-1.178651|accessdate=4 August 2013|newspaper=Sinar Harian|date=3 July 2013|language=Malay}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nRais was born to a Minangkabau family.<ref>[http://www.antaranews.com/print/83140/ris-copper-exports-projected-at-431000-tons-this-year Menbudpar Indonesia-Malaysia Bertemu], Antara News.com, 20 May 2013</ref> A lawyer by profession, he graduated from Language Institute (also known as Language Teaching College), Kuala Lumpur in 1964. In 1968, he taught [[Bahasa Malaysia]] to the American [[Peace Corps]] in the United States. He obtained his honours degree from [[National University of Singapore]].

He had been appointed a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, [[Menteri Besar]] of [[Negeri Sembilan]] (1978\u20131982), [[Ministry of Rural and Regional Development (Malaysia)|Minister of Land and Regional Development]] (1982\u20131984), [[Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (Malaysia)|Minister of Information]] (1984\u20131986) and [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|Foreign Minister]] (1986\u20131987).\n\nWhen he fell out of favour of the UMNO leadership in April 1987, he resumed his law career. He worked with a firm, Ram, Rais & Partner, from 1987 to 1999. During the 1990s he became the deputy leader of the opposition [[Semangat 46]], a breakaway party led by UMNO members dissatisfied with [[Mahathir Mohamad]]'s leadership. Like most Semangat 46 leaders, he rejoined UMNO by the end of the decade.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/10/20/Rais-says-goodbye-with-40page-booklet/|title=Rais says goodbye with 40-page booklet|date=20 October 2013|work=Bernama|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> Upon his return to the ministry in 1999, as Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, he was effusive in his praise for Mahathir, who had outlasted the Semangat 46 movement with successive election victories.<ref>{{cite book|last=M.

During the 1990s he became the deputy leader of the opposition [[Semangat 46]], a breakaway party led by UMNO members dissatisfied with [[Mahathir Mohamad]]'s leadership.

However, there are exceptions to this rule, including black-and-white [[fine art photography]], as well as many [[film|motion pictures]] and [[art film]]s.\n\n===Motion pictures===\nMost early forms of [[film|motion pictures or film]] were black and white. Some color film processes, including hand coloring were experimented with, and in limited use, from the earliest days of motion pictures. The switch from most films being in black-and-white to most being in color was gradual, taking place from the 1930s to the 1960s. Even when most [[film studio]]s had the capability to make color films, the technology's popularity was limited, as using  the [[Technicolor]] process was expensive and cumbersome. For many years, it was not possible for films in color<!-- NB: Technicolor used 3 strips of bw film. --> to render realistic hues, thus its use was restricted to historical films, musicals, and cartoons until the 1950s, while many directors preferred to use black-and-white stock. For the years 1940\u20131966, a separate [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]] was given for black-and-white movies along with one for color; similarly, from 1939\u20131966 (excepting 1957), a separate [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] was given for both black-and-white and color movies.\n\n===Television=== \nThe earliest [[television]] broadcasts  were transmitted in black-and-white, and received and displayed by black-and-white only television sets.<ref>For the effect this caused for team uniforms in televised sports, see: [[Away colours]].</ref> Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's [[Color television#All-mechanical color|first color television transmission]] on July 3, 1928 using a mechanical process.  Some color broadcasts in the U.S. began in the 1950s, with color becoming common in western industrialized nations during the late 1960s. In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) settled on a color [[NTSC]] standard in 1953, and the [[NBC]] network began broadcasting a limited [[color television]] schedule in January 1954. Color television became more widespread in the U.S. between 1963 and 1967, when major networks like [[CBS Television Studios|CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] joined NBC in broadcasting full color schedules. Some TV stations (small and medium) in the US were still broadcasting in B&W until the late 80s to early 90s, depending on network. [[Canada]] began airing color television in 1966 while the [[United Kingdom]] began to use an entirely different color system from July 1967 known as [[PAL]]. The Republic of Ireland followed in 1970. [[Australia]] experimented with color television in 1967 but continued to broadcast in black-and-white until 1975, and [[New Zealand]] experimented with color broadcasting in 1973 but did not convert until 1975. In [[China]], black-and-white television sets were the norm until as late as the 1990s, color TVs not outselling them until about 1989. In 1969, Japanese electronics manufacturers standardized the first format for industrial/non-broadcast [[videotape recorder]]s (VTRs) called [[EIAJ-1]], which initially offered only black-and-white video recording and playback. While seldom used professionally now, many consumer [[camcorder]]s have the ability to record in black-and-white.boobs eat mine\n\n===Photography===\n<!-- Links to monochrome & color photography?-->\n[[File:Looking across lake, \"McDonald Lake, Glacier National Park,\" Montana., 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519873.tif|thumb|right|McDonald Lake, Glacier National Park, Montana \u2013 Ansel Adams \u2013 Taken between 1933 and 1942]]\nThroughout the 19th century, most [[photography]] was [[monochrome photography]]: images were either black-and-white or shades of sepia. Occasionally personal and commercial photographs might be hand tinted. [[Colour photography]] was originally rare and expensive and again often containing inaccurate hues. Color photography became more common from the mid-20th century.\n\nHowever, black-and-white photography has continued to be a popular medium for art photography, as shown in the picture by the well-known photographer [[Ansel Adams]]. This can take the form of black-and-white film or digital conversion to grayscale, with optional [[digital image editing]] manipulation to enhance the results. For amateur use certain companies such as [[Kodak]] manufactured black-and-white [[disposable camera]]s until 2009. Also, certain films are produced today which give black-and-white images using the ubiquitous [[C-41 process#Use with black-and-white films|C41 color process]].\n\n===Printing===\n[[Printing]] is an ancient art, and color printing has been possible in some ways from the time colored inks were produced. In the modern era, for financial and other practical reasons, black-and-white printing has been quite common through the 20th century.  However, with the technology of the 21st century, home color printers, which can produce color photographs, are common and relatively inexpensive, a technology relatively unimaginable in the mid-20th century.\n\nMost American newspapers were black-and-white until the early 1980s; ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' remained in black-and-white until the 1990s. Some claim that ''[[USA Today]]'' was the major impetus for the change to color. In the UK, color was only slowly introduced from the mid-1980s. Even today, many newspapers restrict color photographs to the front and other prominent pages since mass-producing photographs in black-and-white is considerably less expensive than color. Similarly, [[Daily strip|daily comic strips]] in newspapers were traditionally black-and-white with color reserved for [[Sunday strip]]s.  Color printing is more expensive. Sometimes color is reserved for the cover. Magazines such as ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine were either all or mostly black-and-white until the end of the 2000s when it became all-color. [[Manga]] (Japanese or Japanese-influenced comics) are typically published in black-and-white although now it is part of its image. Many school [[yearbook]]s are still entirely or mostly in black-and-white.\n\n== Films with a color/black-and-white mix ==\n[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'']] (1939) is in color when Dorothy is in Oz, but in black-and-white when she is in Kansas, although the latter scenes were actually in sepia when the film was originally released. In a similar manner, in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' (1979), the ''zone'', in which natural laws do not apply, is in colour, and the world outside the ''zone'' generally in sepia. In contrast, the British film ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946) depicts the other world in black-and-white (a character says \"one is starved of Technicolor \u2026 up there\"), and earthly events in color. Similarly, [[Wim Wenders]]'s film ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' (1987) uses sepia-tone black-and-white for the scenes shot from the angels' perspective. When Damiel, the angel (the film's main character), becomes a human the film changes to color, emphasising his new \"real life\" view of the world.\n\nThe films ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]'' (1998), and ''[[Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino]]'' (2002), play with the concept of black-and-white as an [[anachronism]], using it to selectively portray scenes and characters who are either more or less outdated or duller than the characters and scenes shot in full-color. This manipulation of color is used in the film ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005) and the occasional [[television commercial]]. The film ''[[American History X]]'' (1998) is told in a [[nonlinear narrative]] in which the portions of the plot that take place \"in the past\" are shown entirely in black and white, while the \"present\" storyline's scenes are displayed in color. In the documentary film Night and Fog (1955) a mix of black-and-white documentary footage is contrasted with color film of the present.\n\nIn a black and white pre-credits opening sequence in the 2006 Bond film, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', a young James Bond (played by Daniel Craig) gains his licence to kill and status as a 00 agent by assassinating the traitorous MI6 section chief Dryden at the British Embassy in Prague, as well as his terrorist contact, Fisher, in a bathroom in Lahore. The remainder of the film starting with the opening credits is shown in color.\n\n== Contemporary use ==\n[[File:The Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise or Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) - Santa Cruz Island.jpeg|thumb|left|Contemporary photo of a [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]] (''Chelonoidis nigra'') on [[Santa Cruz Island (Gal\u00e1pagos)|Santa Cruz Island]]]]\nSince the late 1960s, few mainstream films have been shot in black-and-white. The reasons are frequently commercial, as it is difficult to sell a film for television broadcasting if the film is not in color. 1961 was the last year in which the majority of Hollywood films were released in black and white.<ref>Robertson, Patrick (2001). ''Film Facts'', Billboard Books, p. 167. {{ISBN|9780823079438}}</ref>\n\nSome modern [[film director]]s will occasionally shoot movies in black-and-white as an artistic choice, though it is much less common for a major [[Hollywood]] production. The use of black-and-white in the [[mass media]] often connotes something \"nostalgic\" or historic. The film director [[Woody Allen]] has used black-and-white a number of times since ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979), which also had a [[George Gershwin]] derived score. The makers of ''[[The Good German]]'' (2006) used camera lenses from the 1940s, and other equipment from that era, so that their black-and-white film imitated the look of early ''noir''.\n\nMonochrome [[film stock]] is now rarely used at the time of shooting, even if the films are intended to be presented theatrically in black-and-white. Movies such as [[John Boorman]]'s ''[[The General (1998 film)|The General]]'' (1998) and [[Joel Coen]]'s ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' (2001) were filmed in color despite being presented in black-and-white for artistic reasons. ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980) and ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994) are two of the few well-known modern films deliberately shot in black-and-white. In the case of ''Clerks'', because of the extremely low budget, the production team could not afford the added costs of shooting in color. Although the difference in film stock price would have been slight, the store's fluorescent lights could not have been used to light for color. By shooting in black-and-white, the filmmakers did not have to rent lighting equipment.\n\nThe movie ''[[Pi (film)|Pi]]'' is filmed entirely in black-and-white, with a grainy effect until the end.\n\nIn black-and-white still [[photography]], many photographers choose to shoot in solely black-and-white since the stark contrasts enhance the subject matter.\n\nSome formal photo portraits still use black-and-white. Many visual-art photographers use black-and-white in their work.\n\nAs a form of censorship when movies and TV series are aired on [[Television in the Philippines|Philippine television]], many gory scenes are shown in black-and-white. Sometimes the exposure of innards or other scenes too bloody or gruesome are also blurred, not just rendered in monochrome, in compliance with Philippine broadcasting standards.\n\n== Computing ==\nMost [[computer]]s had [[monochrome]] (black-and-white, black and green, or black and [[amber (color)|amber]]) [[Computer monitor|screens]] until the late 1980s, although some [[home computer]]s could be connected to television screens to eliminate the extra cost of a monitor. These took advantage of [[NTSC]] or [[PAL]] encoding to offer a range of colors from as low as 4 (IBM [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]]) to 128 ([[Atari 800]]) to 4096 ([[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]]).  Early videogame consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]] supported both black-and-white and color modes via a switch, as did some of the early home computers; this was to accommodate black-and-white TV sets, which would display a color signal poorly.  (Typically a different shading scheme would be used for the display in the black-and-white mode.)\n\nIn [[computing]] terminology, ''black-and-white'' is sometimes used to refer to a [[binary image]] consisting solely of pure black [[pixel]]s and pure white pixels; what would normally be called a black-and-white image, that is, an image containing shades of gray, is referred to in this context as [[grayscale]].<ref>Renner, Honey (2011).

However, there are exceptions to this rule, including black-and-white [[fine art photography]], as well as many [[film|motion pictures]] and [[art film]]s.\n\n===Motion pictures===\nMost early forms of [[film|motion pictures or film]] were black and white. Some color film processes, including hand coloring were experimented with, and in limited use, from the earliest days of motion pictures. The switch from most films being in black-and-white to most being in color was gradual, taking place from the 1930s to the 1960s. Even when most [[film studio]]s had the capability to make color films, the technology's popularity was limited, as using  the [[Technicolor]] process was expensive and cumbersome. For many years, it was not possible for films in color<!-- NB: Technicolor used 3 strips of bw film. --> to render realistic hues, thus its use was restricted to historical films, musicals, and cartoons until the 1950s, while many directors preferred to use black-and-white stock. For the years 1940\u20131966, a separate [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]] was given for black-and-white movies along with one for color; similarly, from 1939\u20131966 (excepting 1957), a separate [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] was given for both black-and-white and color movies.\n\n===Television=== \nThe earliest [[television]] broadcasts  were transmitted in black-and-white, and received and displayed by black-and-white only television sets.<ref>For the effect this caused for team uniforms in televised sports, see: [[Away colours]].</ref> Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's [[Color television#All-mechanical color|first color television transmission]] on July 3, 1928 using a mechanical process.

Zulhasnan was the first deputy minister to be appointed to the ministry.\n\n[[Mohd Isa Abdul Samad]] was the first minister to be appointed. However, Isa was dismissed from office after he was found guilty of corruption charges related to money politics during the [[UMNO]] General Assembly Election of 2005. [[Shahrizat Abdul Jalil]] (then the [[Minister of Women, Family and Community Development (Malaysia)|Minister for Women, Family and Community Development]]) assumed the responsibilities of acting minister until a replacement could be found.\n\nOn 16 February 2006, Zulhasnan was appointed the Federal Territories Minister.<ref name=pilot/> Under the leadership of Zulhasnan, a strategic plan that focused on development plans for all three Federal Territories was created. In the [[2008 Malaysian general election|2008 election]], he was reelected again as a Member of Parliament. He was dropped from the new cabinet on 9 April 2009 by [[Najib Abdul Razak]] who took over as the 6th Prime Minister. He was not chosen by Barisan Nasional to recontest the Setiawangsa seat in the [[2013 Malaysian general election|2013 election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/setiawangsa-zulhasnan-not-one-to-rest-on-his-laurel/|title=Setiawangsa : Zulhasnan not one to rest on his laurels|last=Lingham|first=Mitra|date=3 April 2013|work=The Malaysian Times|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe was appointed as the [[Malaysian Ambassador to the United States]], replacing [[Awang Adek Hussin]] in December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiandigest.com/frontpage/29-4-tile/650202-former-ft-minister-zulhasnan-appointed-as-the-new-malaysian-ambassador-to-united-states.html|title=Former FT Minister Zulhasnan Appointed As The New Malaysian Ambassador To United States|work=Malaysian Digest}}</ref> But he resigned in April 2018 to contest in the [[2018 Malaysian general election|2018 election]] the Setiawangsa constituency again.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/04/28/barisans-zulhasnan-making-a-comeback-in-setiawangsa/|title=Barisan\u2019s Zulhasnan making a comeback in Setiawangsa|author= Intan Farhana Zainul|first=|last=|date=28 April 2018|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref> Following the huge swing of votes to the now-governing coalition [[Pakatan Harapan]], he lost and failed to win back his former parliamentary seat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/bns-big-names-toppled-one-after-another|title=Malaysia Votes 2018: BN's big names toppled, one after another|first=Nadirah|last=H.

Later his taste expanded to different drummers like [[Vinnie Colaiuta]], [[Dave Weckl]], [[Steve Gadd]], [[Thomas Lang]], and [[Mike Mangini]].<ref name=A/>\n\nHe previously drummed for Sickening Horror, a [[death metal]] band. He also used to be in the Greek [[melodic death metal]] band [[Nightfall (band)|Nightfall]], but left the band in 2005 to join [[Nile (band)|Nile]].\n\nKollias made an instructional drumming DVD called ''Intense Metal Drumming'' that was released in July 2008.<ref name = \"Youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XagspfIdhqk |title=George Kollias - Intense Metal Drumming DVD (part 1) preview |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwsdq2Zaofk |title=GEORGE KOLLIAS-INTENSE METAL DRUMMING DVD-OUT NOW!!!: Intense Metal Drumming preview |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>\n\nHe has a brother named Iraklis Kollias, who was the guitarist for the band Extremity Obsession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drumlessons.com/drummers/george-kollias/ |title=\u00bb George Kollias Biography, Drum Videos and Pictures &#124; Famous Drummers |publisher=Drumlessons.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref>\n\n==Technique==\nKollias uses a foot technique in between heel up and heel down. His heels remain close to the bases of the pedals, but he doesn't actually touch the pedal board. All the weight of his legs fall on the balls of his feet. When playing at slower bpms, Kollias's legs do the vast majority of the movement of a kick, moving up and down as much as the pedal does itself. However, as his speed increases, the heels of his feet move less and less, until the [[Tempo|bpm]] is high enough that all the movement of the pedals stems from his ankles. Once he gets up to speeds that are this fast, he employs a swivel technique. In this technique, he uses his feet to keep count of the beats he has hit, moving his ankles to the right side of the pedal and then swinging them over to the other side of the pedal.

He also used to be in the Greek [[melodic death metal]] band [[Nightfall (band)|Nightfall]], but left the band in 2005 to join [[Nile (band)|Nile]].\n\nKollias made an instructional drumming DVD called ''Intense Metal Drumming'' that was released in July 2008.<ref name = \"Youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XagspfIdhqk |title=George Kollias - Intense Metal Drumming DVD (part 1) preview |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwsdq2Zaofk |title=GEORGE KOLLIAS-INTENSE METAL DRUMMING DVD-OUT NOW!!!: Intense Metal Drumming preview |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>\n\nHe has a brother named Iraklis Kollias, who was the guitarist for the band Extremity Obsession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drumlessons.com/drummers/george-kollias/ |title=\u00bb George Kollias Biography, Drum Videos and Pictures &#124; Famous Drummers |publisher=Drumlessons.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref>\n\n==Technique==\nKollias uses a foot technique in between heel up and heel down. His heels remain close to the bases of the pedals, but he doesn't actually touch the pedal board. All the weight of his legs fall on the balls of his feet. When playing at slower bpms, Kollias's legs do the vast majority of the movement of a kick, moving up and down as much as the pedal does itself. However, as his speed increases, the heels of his feet move less and less, until the [[Tempo|bpm]] is high enough that all the movement of the pedals stems from his ankles. Once he gets up to speeds that are this fast, he employs a swivel technique. In this technique, he uses his feet to keep count of the beats he has hit, moving his ankles to the right side of the pedal and then swinging them over to the other side of the pedal. In this way, as he explains, the extra energy that one's legs waste when they work so hard is utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA4Sq0mqU-k |title=George Kollias Foot technique |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-06-30 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>\n\nKollias's hand technique allows him great precision as well, though it is not nearly as individualistic as his foot technique. Kollias grips the stick fully with his index through ring finger, letting them stretch forward and wrap around the stick. He does not use his thumb and index finger to create a swivel. Instead, all of his speed stems from his wrists, much like his ankle usage in the kick.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDEA9Jy5VcA |title=George Kollias Blast Beat |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-11 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===With [[Nile (band)|Nile]]===\n{{further|Nile discography}}\n* ''[[Annihilation of the Wicked]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Ithyphallic (album)|Ithyphallic]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Those Whom the Gods Detest]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[At the Gate of Sethu]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[What Should Not Be Unearthed]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Vile Nilotic Rites]]'' (2019)\n\n===With Cerebrum===\n* ''Spectral Extravagance'' (2009)\n* ''Cosmic Enigma'' (2013)\n\n===With Sickening Horror===\n* ''When Landscapes Bled Backwards'' (2007)\n\n===With [[Nightfall (Greek band)|Nightfall]]===\n* ''[[I Am Jesus]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Lyssa: Rural Gods and Astonishing Punishments]]'' (2004)\n\n===With Extremity Obsession===\n* ''Extremity Obsession'' (Demo, 1996)\n* ''Everlasting'' (Demo, 1997)\n\n===With Deus Infestus===\n* ''Swansongs For This Stillborn Race'' (2010)\n\n===Personal releases===\n* ''Intense Metal Drumming DVD'' (DVD, 2008)\n* ''Intense Metal Drumming II DVD'' (DVD, 2012)\n* ''[[Invictus (George Kollias album)|Invictus]]'' (LP, 2015)\n\n===With ADE===\n* ''Spartacus'' (2013)\n\n===With [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]]===\n* ''Valkyrja'' (2013)\n\n===With Contrarian===\n* ''Predestined'' (2014)\n* ''Polemic'' (2015)\n* ''To Perceive Is To Suffer'' (2017)\n\n===With Demonstealer===\n* ''This Burden Is Mine'' (2016)\n\n==Gear==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{intricate detail|date=December 2016}}\n*[[Pearl]] Reference Pure Series in # Piano Black<ref name=\"www.pearleurope.com\"/>\n** 22 x 18 Kick\n** 22 x 18 Kick\n** 08 x 07 Tom\n** 10 x 08 Tom\n** 12 x 09 Tom\n** 13 x 10 Tom\n** 14 x 12 Tom (left side)\n** 14 x 14 Floor Tom\n** 16 x 16 Floor Tom\n** 14 x 6.5 Snare\n** 12 x 5 Snare\n*[[Vic Firth]] Drumsticks<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vicfirth.com/artists/kollias.php |title=Vic Firth Artist: George Kollias |publisher=Vicfirth.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214858/http://www.vicfirth.com/artists/kollias.php |archive-date=2011-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n**SGK George Kollias Signature\n*[[Pearl]] Hardware\n**DR-503C, DR-501C and RJ-50 complete Rack System.\n**DP-2002 Powershift Eliminator Double Pedal\n**H-2000 Eliminator Hi Hat Stand.\n**RH-2000 Eliminator Remote Hi Hat Stand\n**CLH-1000 Hi Hat Arms\n**S-2000 Snare Stand\n**B-1000 Boom Stands\n**CH-1000 Boom Arms\n**PCX-100 and PCX-200 Pipe Clamps\n**D-1000 Roadster Throne\n**TH-2000I and TH-2000S Tom Holders\n**OptiMount Suspension System for all toms\n**AX-20, AX-25 and AX-28 Adapters\n**UX-80 Universal Clamp\n*Extreme Isolation Headphones\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Sabian]] Cymbals<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabian.com/EN/artists/George_Kollias.cfm |title=George Kollias &#124;

The Baton Rouge Red Sticks played in the [[Cotton States]] League (1903\u20131904), [[East Dixie League]] (1934) and the [[Evangeline League]] (1946\u20131955).\n\nBaton Rouge teams played in the Cotton States League (1902, 1905\u20131906), [[Dixie League (1933 baseball)|Dixie League]] (1933), Evangeline League (1956\u20131957) and [[Gulf States League]] (1976). Later, the [[Baton Rouge Blue Marlins]] (2001) played in [[All-American Association]] and the [[Baton Rouge Riverbats]] (2002\u20132003) played in the independent [[Southeastern League]].\n\nThe Red Sticks were an affiliate of the [[St. Louis Browns]] (1947) and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (1948).\n\n==History==\n[[Minor League baseball]] began in Baton Rouge with the 1902 '''Baton Rouge Cajuns''' as charter members of the [[Cotton States League]]. In 1903, the team changed its' moniker to the Baton Rouge Red Sticks and captured the 1903 Cotton League Championship.
