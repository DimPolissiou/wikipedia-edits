This account suggests new friends to Miles, people in his hometown of [[New York City]], who will require assistance. Initially skeptical, Miles decides to follow these suggestions to help people. His first suggestion had been a doctor who lost a patient and was on the verge of losing his girlfriend. While following up on his second suggestion, he meets and befriends Cara (Beane), a struggling magazine writer. Together with Cara and his hacker friend Rakesh (Sharma), Miles tries to find out who is behind the \"God\" account while still providing help to the account's continuing friend suggestions.  Miles' atheist views sometimes causes friction with his father (Morton), who is the pastor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Use of Facebook==\n''God Friended Me'' uses [[Facebook]] frequently as a narrative device. The \"Friended\" in the title ''God Friended Me'' refers to the act of [[Friending and following|friending]] someone on social media, granting that person special privileges (on the service in question) with respect to oneself.{{sfn|Palfrey|Gasser|2010|p=25}} In ''God Friended Me'', this allows for God to contact Miles.\n\nWhile the majority of Facebook's revenue is advertisement-derived,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jolie O'Dell 203 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ |title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010 |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> show creator Steven Lilien says that their conversations with Facebook have been limited to discussing \"how much we can portray it.\"<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/god-friended-me-not-highway-to-heaven-facebook-greg-berlanti-tca-1202440479/|title='God Friended Me' Is No 'Highway to Heaven' EPs Insist|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> According to executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt, the \"God\" of the show will be active on Facebook outside the show, with liking pages and changing their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]] given as examples of their possible online activities.<ref name=\"Activity\">{{cite web|author=Tim Surette |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/god-friended-me-god-catholic-christian-cbs/|title=''God Friended Me'' Won't Just Be About One God|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n*[[Brandon Micheal Hall]]<ref name=\"order\" /> as Miles Finer, a skeptical atheist who hosts a podcast about his atheism.

It turns out that Beaker is Fliss's lost love. He's gay, so they won't be romantic, but Fliss decides she will move to New York anyway to restart her life and be Beaker's friend.

They were fighting at the time, and Rachel believes nothing can fix the fact that her sister hated her at the moment of her death. Miles finds the man credited with pulling Rachel from the car before it exploded, and learns that the man was just a bystander; in fact, Rachel's sister pulled her from the car, and died going back for her cell phone to call 911. Miles tells Rachel that her sister obviously loved her, and Rachel finds peace and strives to become sober. Meanwhile, Rakesh finds out Jaya has a medical fellowship that will take her away from New York for up to a year. He reacts badly at first, but on Ali's advice, throws Jaya a congratulations party and tells her he is happy for her. After talking with his father, Miles comes to terms with the idea that he might have a calling to do good in the world, and the God account reappears.

Hasan confronts Tara and David (and Miles) at the courthouse just before their marriage. Miles tries to reason with Hasan, but fails, and Tara reluctantly leaves with her father. At a loss, Miles consults with his father, who explains how a child losing faith can feel to a parent like losing them altogether.

Despite Cara asking him to stay out of it, Miles implores Paul to do the right thing. After almost fleeing to Canada, Paul instead takes a plea deal that will result in him spending one to two years in prison. Cara accuses Miles of putting the God account before her, much like Gideon suggested might happen. Elsewhere, Arthur finds his new agenda being blocked by Reverend Elias, a very conservative member of his board who cites Arthur's children and out-of-wedlock relationship with Trish as reasons he should step down. Surprisingly, it's Trish who gets Arthur to stand up for what he believes is best for the church.

Despite wanting to walk away from the God account, Cara agrees to help when she learns a life is in danger, and she retrieves Miguel's wife to help talk him down. Miles insists that between his podcast and Cara's journalism outlets, they can raise the money to help Ava. However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution. Miles had told Cara that Miguel will be his last friend suggestion, as he wants to choose her over the account.

Now convinced that Alphonse is the source of the God account, Miles tries to win back Cara.

This account suggests new friends to Miles, people in his hometown of [[New York City]], who will require assistance. Initially skeptical, Miles decides to follow these suggestions to help people. His first suggestion had been a doctor who lost a patient and was on the verge of losing his girlfriend. While following up on his second suggestion, he meets and befriends Cara (Beane), a struggling magazine writer. Together with Cara and his hacker friend Rakesh (Sharma), Miles tries to find out who is behind the \"God\" account while still providing help to the account's continuing friend suggestions.  Miles' atheist views sometimes causes friction with his father (Morton), who is the pastor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Use of Facebook==\n''God Friended Me'' uses [[Facebook]] frequently as a narrative device. The \"Friended\" in the title ''God Friended Me'' refers to the act of [[Friending and following|friending]] someone on social media, granting that person special privileges (on the service in question) with respect to oneself.{{sfn|Palfrey|Gasser|2010|p=25}} In ''God Friended Me'', this allows for God to contact Miles.\n\nWhile the majority of Facebook's revenue is advertisement-derived,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jolie O'Dell 203 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ |title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010 |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> show creator Steven Lilien says that their conversations with Facebook have been limited to discussing \"how much we can portray it.\"<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/god-friended-me-not-highway-to-heaven-facebook-greg-berlanti-tca-1202440479/|title='God Friended Me' Is No 'Highway to Heaven' EPs Insist|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> According to executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt, the \"God\" of the show will be active on Facebook outside the show, with liking pages and changing their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]] given as examples of their possible online activities.<ref name=\"Activity\">{{cite web|author=Tim Surette |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/god-friended-me-god-catholic-christian-cbs/|title=''God Friended Me'' Won't Just Be About One God|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n*[[Brandon Micheal Hall]]<ref name=\"order\" /> as Miles Finer, a skeptical atheist who hosts a podcast about his atheism.

Miles tells Rachel that her sister obviously loved her, and Rachel finds peace and strives to become sober. Meanwhile, Rakesh finds out Jaya has a medical fellowship that will take her away from New York for up to a year.

Hasan confronts Tara and David (and Miles) at the courthouse just before their marriage. Miles tries to reason with Hasan, but fails, and Tara reluctantly leaves with her father. At a loss, Miles consults with his father, who explains how a child losing faith can feel to a parent like losing them altogether. Meanwhile, Rakesh breaks the God account's encryption with Cara's help, and they learn about a particular train leaving Grand Central Station later that night. Hasan confronts Miles at his uncle's 25th wedding anniversary party because Tara has run away. Miles realizes that the train isn't the location of whoever is behind the God account, but of David and Tara.

Despite wanting to walk away from the God account, Cara agrees to help when she learns a life is in danger, and she retrieves Miguel's wife to help talk him down. Miles insists that between his podcast and Cara's journalism outlets, they can raise the money to help Ava. However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution. Miles had told Cara that Miguel will be his last friend suggestion, as he wants to choose her over the account. Seeing how Miles just effectively saved two lives, Cara insists she could never live with the thought that she prevented Miles from doing more good work, and she ends their relationship. Elsewhere, Arthur makes good on his promise to balance church duties with spending time with Trish, causing Trish to say she wants to marry him as soon as possible.

The hacker reveals he was hired by a man named Alphonse Jeffries to create the back door. While Rakesh tracks down that lead, Miles and Joy help an elderly holocaust survivor named Abe ([[Judd Hirsch]]), who noticed his father's gold watch on a jewelry auction site and hopes it can lead him to answers about his long-lost sister, Rose. Soon after a successful resolution of that case, Miles learns that Alphonse and Arthur served in Vietnam together and, in fact, Arthur saved Alphonse's life. Having revealed that he and Trish are getting married that weekend, Arthur says he invited Alphonse to the wedding. Now convinced that Alphonse is the source of the God account, Miles tries to win back Cara. Cara agrees that their love is worth any risk, but she's also hiding a secret: she saw Ali at the hospital while her mother was applying for a nursing job, and Ali revealed she was getting tested for cancer.\n |LineColor       = 549FC3\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 32\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n |Title           = BFF\n |DirectedBy      = Annabelle Frost\n |WrittenBy       = Steven Lilien & Bryan Wynbrandt\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|12}}\n |ProdCode        = T40.10212\n |Viewers         = 6.19<ref name=\"2.12\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-jan-12-2020/|title=NFL adjusts up, 'Bob's Burgers' and 'Bless the Harts' adjust down: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 14, 2020|accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = While preparing to confront Alphonse Jeffries at Arthur's wedding, Miles receives a friend suggestion that turns out to be Trish's daughter, Julia ([[Amber Stevens West]]).

He tells Jeffries he knows he's behind the God account, but Jeffries denies it. Miles then asks Jeffries why he would hire a hacker to create a back door for the New York Sun client information, and Jeffries replies he didn't hire anyone. Miles, Rakesh and Joy then race to the apartment where they previously met the hacker, and find it completely cleaned out except for one item: a Queen of Hearts playing card.

Mr. Johnson says that they are closing the cinema for good in two days.

Many scientific drawings including ''[[Vitruvian Man|The Vitruvian Man]]''.\n}}\n[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519) was an Italian [[polymath]], regarded as the epitome of the \"Renaissance Man\", displaying skills in numerous diverse areas of study. Whilst most famous for his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and the ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', Leonardo is also renowned in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geometry]], [[hydrodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[optics]], [[physics]], [[pyrotechnics]], and [[zoology]].  \n\nWhile the full extent of his scientific studies has only become recognized in the last 150 years, during his lifetime he was employed for his engineering and skill of invention. Many of his designs, such as the movable [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the [[parachute]], the [[helicopter]], an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated [[solar power]], a [[calculator]], a rudimentary theory of [[plate tectonics]] and the [[double hull]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Innocenzi |first1=Plinio |title=The innovators behind Leonardo: The True Story of the Scientific and Technological Renaissance |date=2018 |publisher=Cham: Springer International Publishing |isbn=9783319904481}}</ref> In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], civil engineering, optics, and the study of water (hydrodynamics).\n\nLeonardo's most famous drawing, the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent the concept of [[macrocosm and microcosm]] in [[Renaissance humanism]].\n\n==Condensed biography==\n{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci}}\n[[File:Study of a Tuscan Landscape.jpg|thumb|The Arno Valley]]\n\n:NOTE: This is a brief summary of Leonardo's early life and journals with particular emphasis on his introduction to science.<!--- Please do not expand this section unless it relates SPECIFICALLY to Leonardo's study of science--->\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 \u2013 May 2, 1519) was born the illegitimate son of Messer Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. His early life was spent in the region of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the valley of the [[Arno River]] near [[Florence]], firstly with his mother and in later childhood in the household of his father, grandfather and uncle Francesco.\n\nHis curiosity and interest in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of [[Diary|journals]] set an example which he was to follow for most of his life, diligently recording in his own journals both the events of the day, his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams for the construction of a [[Early flying machines#The Renaissance|flying machine]].\n\nIn 1466, Leonardo was sent to Florence to the workshop of the artist [[Verrocchio]], in order to learn the skills of an artist. At the workshop, as well as painting and drawing, he learnt the study of topographical anatomy.<ref>''Topographical anatomy'' is the anatomy that is visible on the surface of the body.</ref>  He was also exposed to a very wide range of technical skills such as [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[set construction]], [[plaster]]working, paint chemistry, and [[metallurgy]].\n[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|From Leonardo's journals \u2013 studies of an old man and the action of water.]]\n\nAmong the older artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's scientific interest was [[Piero della Francesca]], then a man in his 60s, who was one of the earliest artists to systematically employ [[linear perspective]] in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the [[Annunciation]] show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was profoundly observant of nature, his curiosity having been stimulated in early childhood by his discovery of a deep cave in the mountains and his intense desire to know what lay inside. His earliest dated drawing, 1473, is of the valley of the Arno River, where he lived. It displays some of the many scientific interests that were to obsess him all his life, in particular geology and hydrology.\n<ref name=LB>Liana Bortolon, ''The Life and Times of Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, 1967</ref>\n\n==Approach to scientific investigation==\n[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|upright|Investigating the motion of the arm.]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the study of art and science was not perceived as mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach to the art of painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.\n\nAs a scientist, Leonardo had no formal education in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]] and did not attend a [[university]]. Because of these factors, his scientific studies were largely ignored by other scholars. Leonardo's approach to science was one of intense observation and detailed recording, his tools of investigation being almost exclusively his eyes. His journals give insight into his investigative processes.\n\nAs a researcher, Leonardo divided nature and phenomena into ever smaller segments, concretely with knives and measuring instruments, intellectually with formulas and numbers, to wrest the secrets of creation from it. The smaller the particles, runs the assumption; the closer one will get to the solution of the enigmas.<ref>{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Marc van den Broek]]|Title=Leonardo da Vinci Spirits of Invention. A Search for Traces |Publisher=A.TE.M. |PublicationPlace=Hamburg|ISBN=978-3-00-063700-1|Date=2019|language=English}}</ref>\n\nA recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by [[Fritjof Capra]] argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and other scientists who followed him, his theorizing and hypothesizing integrating the arts and particularly painting. Capra sees Leonardo's unique integrated, holistic views of science as making him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought.<ref>Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Leonardo's notes and journals==\n\nLeonardo kept a series of [[Diary|journals]] in which he wrote almost daily, as well as separate notes and sheets of observations, comments and plans. He wrote and drew with his left hand, and most of his writing is in [[Mirror writing|mirror script]], which makes it difficult to read. Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.\n\nOn his death, the writings were left mainly to his pupil and heir [[Francesco Melzi]], with the apparent intention that his scientific work should be published. Sometime before 1542, Melzi gathered together the papers for ''A Treatise on Painting'' from eighteen of Leonardo's 'books' (two-thirds of which have gone missing).{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=170}} The publishing did not take place in Melzi's lifetime, and the writings were eventually bound in different forms and dispersed. Some of his works were published as a ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]'' 165 years after his  death.\n\n==Publication==\n\nLeonardo illustrated a book on mathematical proportion in art written by his friend [[Luca Pacioli]] and called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'', published in 1509. He was also preparing a major treatise on his scientific observations and mechanical inventions. It was to be divided into a number of sections or \"Books\", Leonardo leaving some instructions as to how they were to be ordered. Many sections of it appear in his notebooks.\n\nThese pages deal with scientific subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon the creation of artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a great deal about the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.<ref name=JPR>''Jean Paul Richter'' editor 1880, ''[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci]'' Dover, 1970, {{ISBN|0-486-22572-0}}. (accessed 2007-02-04)</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Begun at Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the 22nd day of March 1508. And this is to be a collection without order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [all] and say: \u2018I will not write this because I wrote it before.\u2019 And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.<ref name= JPR/></blockquote>\n\n==Natural science==\n[[File:Study of the Graduations of Shadows on Spheres.jpg|thumb|upright|Study of the graduations of light and shade on a sphere ([[chiaroscuro]]).]]\n\n===Light===\n[https://english-biography.com/leonardo-da-vinci-biography/ Leonardo da Vinci] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These are; diffused light as that of the atmosphere; And Direct, as that of the sun; The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes through [translucent] bodies, as linen or paper etc.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'']]\n\nFor an artist working in the 15th century, some study of the nature of [[light]] was essential. It was by the effective painting of light falling on a surface that ''modelling'', or a three-dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, [[Verrocchio]], that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colors that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except [[Piero della Francesca]] actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.\n\nAt the time when Leonardo commenced painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade. Faces, in particular, were shadowed in a manner that was bland and maintained all the features and contours clearly visible. Leonardo broke with this.\nIn the painting generally titled ''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'' (about 1483) he sets the figure [[diagonal]]ly to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back of her head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused in such a way that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.\n\nLeonardo's treatment of light in paintings such as ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' was to change forever the way in which artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, this is probably the one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.\n\n===Human anatomy===\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\n...to obtain a true and perfect knowledge ... I have dissected more than ten human bodies, destroying all the other members, and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded, ... and as one single body would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences...<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Proportions of the Head.jpg|thumb|Study of the proportions of the head.]]\n\n====Topographic anatomy====\nLeonardo began the formal study of the topographical [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] when apprenticed to [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. As a student he would have been taught to draw the human body from life, to memorize the muscles, tendons and visible subcutaneous structure and to familiarise himself with the mechanics of the various parts of the skeletal and muscular structure. It was common workshop practice to have plaster casts of parts of the human anatomy available for students to study and draw.\n[[File:Anatomy of a Male Nude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Two anatomical studies]]\nIf, as is thought to be the case, Leonardo painted the torso and arms of Christ in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his understanding of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of [[John the Baptist]] in the same painting.\n\nIn the 1490s he wrote about demonstrating muscles and sinews to students:\n\n<blockquote>Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nHis continued investigations in this field occupied many pages of notes, each dealing systematically with a particular aspect of anatomy. It appears that the notes were intended for publication, a task entrusted on his death to his pupil [[Francesco Melzi|Melzi]].\n\nIn conjunction with studies of aspects of the body are drawings of faces displaying different emotions and many drawings of people suffering facial deformity, either congenital or through illness. Some of these drawings, generally referred to as \"caricatures\", on analysis of the skeletal proportions, appear to be based on anatomical studies.\n\n====Dissection====\n{{see also|Studies of the Fetus in the Womb}}\n[[File:View of a Skull III.jpg|thumb|upright|Dissection of the skull.]]\nAs Leonardo became successful as an artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence. Later he dissected in Milan at the hospital Maggiore, and in Rome at the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Ospedale di Santo Spirito]] (the first mainland Italian hospital). From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]].\n\n<blockquote>I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn 30 years, Leonardo dissected 30 male and female corpses of different ages. Together with Marcantonio, he prepared to publish a theoretical work on anatomy and made more than 200 drawings. However, his book was published only in 1680 (161 years after his death) under the heading ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]''.\n[[File:DaVinciCardiovascularWoman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The organs of a woman's body]]\nAmong the detailed images that Leonardo drew are many studies of the [[human skeleton]]. He was the first to describe the double S form of the [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. He also studied the inclination of [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] and stressed that sacrum was not uniform, but composed of five fused [[vertebrae]]. He also studied the anatomy of the human foot and its connection to the leg, and from these studies, he was able to further his studies in biomechanics.\n\nLeonardo was a [[Physiology|physiologist]] as well as an anatomist, studying the function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the [[human skull]] and cross-sections of the [[human brain|brain]], [[Transverse plane|transversal]], [[sagittal]], and [[Frontal bone|frontal]]. These drawings may be linked to a search for the ''[[sensus communis]]'', the locus of the human senses,<ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.\n\n[[File:Views of a Foetus in the Womb.jpg|thumb|Studies of a f\u0153tus from Leonardo's journals]]\nLeonardo studied internal organs, being the first to draw the human [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and the [[lung]]s, [[mesentery]], [[urinary tract]], [[reproductive organs]], the muscles of the [[cervix]] and a detailed cross-section of [[coitus]]. He was one of the first to draw a scientific representation of the [[fetus]] in the intrautero.\n\nLeonardo studied the [[vascular system]] and drew a dissected [[heart]] in detail. He correctly worked out how heart valves ebb the flow of blood yet he  did not fully understand [[Blood circulation|circulation]], as he believed that blood was pumped to the muscles where it was consumed. In 2005 a UK heart surgeon, Francis Wells, from Papworth Hospital Cambridge, pioneered repair to damaged hearts, using Leonardo's depiction of the opening phase of the mitral valve to operate without changing its diameter allowing an individual to recover more quickly. Wells said \"Leonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body \u2013 its structure and function \u2013 that perhaps has been overlooked by some.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/health/4289204.stm |title=Da Vinci clue for heart surgeon |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's observational acumen, drawing skill, and the clarity of depiction of bone structures reveal him at his finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered by the lack of preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman <small>(See left)</small> reveal many traditional misconceptions.<ref name=MK>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}</ref><ref>[http://www.livescience.com/20046-10-odd-facts-female-reproductive-system.html Live Science]</ref>\n\nLeonardo's study of [[human anatomy]] led also to the design of an [[automaton]] which has come to be called [[Leonardo's robot]], was probably made around the year 1495 but was rediscovered only in the 1950s.\n\n===Comparative anatomy===\n[[File:Leonardo anatomy of dog and man.JPG|thumb|upright|Comparison of the leg of a man and a dog.]]\nLeonardo not only studied human anatomy, but the anatomy of many other animals as well. He dissected [[cows]], [[birds]], [[monkeys]] and [[frogs]], comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, a snarling lion and a snarling man.\n\n<blockquote>I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn the early 1490s Leonardo was commissioned to create a monument in honour of [[Francesco Sforza]]. In his notebooks are a series of plans for an equestrian monument. There are also a large number of related anatomical studies of horses. They include several [[Leonardo's horse|diagrams of a standing horse]] with the angles and proportions annotated, anatomical studies of horses' heads, a dozen detailed drawings of hooves and numerous studies and sketches of horses rearing.\n\nHe studied the topographical anatomy of a bear in detail, making many drawings of its paws. There is also a drawing of the muscles and tendons of the bear's hind feet.\nOther drawings of particular interest include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the hindquarters of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.\n\n===Botany===\nThe science of [[botany]] was long established by Leonardo's time, a treatise on the subject having been written as early as 300&nbsp;BCE.<ref>E.g. Theophrastus, ''On the History of Plants''.</ref> Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form the parts of the plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual plants and flowers of a single variety differed from one another.\n\n[[File:Sedge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Study of sedge]]\n\nOne such study shows a page with several species of flower of which ten drawings are of wild violets. Along with a drawing of the growing plant and a detail of a leaf, Leonardo has repeatedly drawn single flowers from different angles, with their heads set differently on the stem.\n\nApart from flowers the notebooks contain many drawings of crop plants including several types of grain and a variety of berries including a detailed study of [[bramble]]. There are also water plants such as [[Iris (plant)|irises]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]. His notebooks also direct the artist to observe how light reflects from foliage at different distances and under different [[weather|atmospheric conditions]].\n\nA number of the drawings have their equivalents in Leonardo's paintings. An elegant study of a stem of [[lily|lilies]] may have been for one of Leonardo's early Annunciation paintings, carried in the hand of the Archangel Gabriel. In both the Annunciation pictures the grass is dotted with blossoming plants.\n\nThe plants which appear in both the versions of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' reflects the results of Leonardo's studies in a meticulous realism that makes each plant readily identifiable to the botanist.\n\nIn his writings, da Vinci proposed the following [[da Vinci branching rule|branching rule]]:\n\n<blockquote>All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them].<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Leonardo topographical map.JPG|thumb|upright|A topographical map]]\n\nAs an adult, Leonardo had only two childhood memories, one of which was the finding of a cave in the Apennines. Although fearing that he might be attacked by a wild beast, he ventured in driven \"by the burning desire to see whether there might be any marvelous thing within.\"\n\nLeonardo's earliest dated drawing is a study of the [[Arno valley]], strongly emphasizing its geological features. His notebooks contain landscapes with a wealth of geological observation from the regions of both [[Florence]] and [[Milan]], often including atmospheric effects such as a heavy rainstorm pouring down on a town at the foot of a mountain range.\n\nIt had been observed for many years that [[Stratum|strata]] in mountains often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these could be explained by the [[Great Flood]] described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.\n\n[[File:Virgin of the Rocks (Louvre).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'']]\n\n<blockquote>And a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate, a [[tufa]] has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nThis quotation makes clear the breadth of Leonardo's understanding of [[geology]], including the action of water in creating [[sedimentary rock]], the [[plate tectonics|tectonic action]] of the Earth in raising the sea bed and the action of [[erosion]] in the creation of [[landform|geographical features]].\n\nIn Leonardo's earliest paintings we see the remarkable attention given to the small [[landscape]]s of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in a misty light. In the larger of the ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' paintings is a town on the edge of a lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical strata. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] and [[Lago d'Iseo]] in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'', which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.<ref>The London painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' is denounced by the geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso, [http://www.leonardosgeology.com] of New York, as largely by the hand of someone other than Leonardo, because the rocks appear incongruous and the lake looks like a fjord. Pizzorusso says \"Fjords do not exist in Italy and it is highly unlikely the glacial lakes of the Lombard region would have such steep relief surrounding them.\" In fact, the [[glacial lake]], Garda, has just such steep geological formations. The sedimentary red limestone which appears in the picture is also typical of Italy.</ref>\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Town plan of Imola.jpg|thumb|Leonardo's accurate map of Imola for Cesare Borgia.]]\nIn the early 16th century [[map]]s were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo produced several extremely accurate maps such as the town plan of [[Imola]] created in 1502 in order to win the [[patronage]] of [[Cesare Borgia]]. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a [[military engineer]] and [[architect]]. Leonardo also produced a map of [[Chiana Valley]] in [[Tuscany]], which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by pacing the distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.\n\nRecent research by Donato Pezzutto suggests that the background landscapes in Leonardo\u2019s paintings depict specific locations as aerial views with enhanced depth, employing a technique called [[Cartography|cartographic perspective]]. Pezzutto  identifies the location of the ''Mona Lisa'' to the Val di Chiana, the ''Annunciation'' to the Arno Valley, the ''[[Madonna of the Yarnwinder]]'' to the Adda Valley and ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St Anne]]'' to the Sessia Valley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opusej.org/library/leonardos-landscapes-as-maps-cover-page/|publisher=OPUSeJ|first=Donato|last=Pezzutto|title=Leonardo\u2019s Landscapes as Maps|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrodynamics===\n[[File:Studies of Water passing Obstacles and falling.jpg|thumb|upright|Studies of water]]\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAll the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nAmong Leonardo's drawings are many that are studies of the motion of water, in particular the forms taken by fast-flowing water on striking different surfaces.\n\nMany of these drawings depict the spiralling nature of water. The [[spiral]] form had been studied in the art of the [[Ancient Greek art|Classical era]] and strict [[Golden ratio|mathematical proportion]] had been applied to its use in art and [[architecture]]. An awareness of these rules of proportion had been revived in the early [[italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. In Leonardo's drawings can be seen the investigation of the spiral as it occurs in water.\n\nThere are several elaborate drawings of water curling over an object placed at a diagonal to its course. There are several drawings of water dropping from a height and curling upwards in spiral forms. One such drawing, as well as curling waves, shows splashes and details of spray and bubbles.\n\nLeonardo's interest manifested itself in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The knowledge that he gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly in relation to the Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.\n\n===Astronomy===\nLeonardo lived at a time when [[geocentric]] theories were the most widely used explanations to account for the relationship between the Earth and Sun's movement. He wrote that \"The Sun has substance, shape, movement, radiance, heat, and generative power; and these qualities all emanate from itself without its diminution.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Dr. Mario |title=The Da Vinci Astronomy |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-da-vinci-astronomy_b_4065100 |website=Huff Post |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> He further wrote,\n<blockquote>The earth is not in the centre of the Sun's orbit nor at the centre of the universe, but in the centre of its companion elements, and united with them. And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both beneath us, would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A63kDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT312 Da Vinci's notebooks] on astronomy.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn one of his notebooks, there is a note in the margin which states, \"The Sun does not move,\" which may indicate Leonardo's support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Leonardo Da Vinci |url=http://giantsofscience.weebly.com/leonardo-da-vinci-vj.html |website=Giants of Science |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy===\nClaims are sometimes made that Leonardo da Vinci was an [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. He was trained in the workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending [[Pigment|paint pigment]]. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' deteriorating within a century, and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (Leonardo)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, there are some that pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learned as a student.<ref name=Moran>Bruce T. Moran, ''Distilling Knowledge, Chemistry, Alchemy and the Scientific Revolution'', (2005) {{ISBN|0-674-01495-2}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's scientific process was based mainly upon observation. His practical experiments are also founded in observation rather than belief. Leonardo, who questioned the order of the [[solar system]] and the deposit of fossils by the [[Noah's Ark|Great Flood]], had little time for the alchemical quests to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]] or create a [[Philosopher's stone|potion]] that gave eternal life.\n\nLeonardo said about alchemists:\n\n<blockquote>The false interpreters of nature declare that quicksilver is the common seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety of the things she desires to produce in the world.<ref name= JPR /><ref>\"Quicksilver\" is an old name for mercury.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Old alchemists... have never either by chance or by experiment succeeded in creating the smallest element that can be created by nature; however [they] deserve unmeasured praise for the usefulness of things invented for the use of men, and would deserve it even more if they had not been the inventors of noxious things like poisons and other similar things which destroy life or mind.\"''<ref name=Notebooks>Irma Ann Richter and Teresa Wells, ''Leonardo da Vinci \u2013 Notebooks'', Oxford University Press (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-19-929902-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Mathematical studies==\n\n===Perspective===\n<blockquote>The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 15th century, both [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] made studies of [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. In 1436 Alberti published ''[[De pictura]]'' (\"On Painting\"), which includes his findings on linear perspective. [[Piero della Francesca]] carried his work forward and by the 1470s a number of artists were able to produce works of art that demonstrated a full understanding of the principles of linear perspective. \n[[File:Leonardo study AdorationofMagi.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Draft of the perspective for ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'']]\n\nLeonardo studied linear perspective and employed it in his earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two [[Annunciation]]s is daring, as he uses various features such as the corner of a building, a [[walled garden]] and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.\n\nThe unfinished ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' was intended to be a masterpiece revealing much of Leonardo's knowledge of figure drawing and perspective. There exists a number of studies that he made, including a detailed study of the perspective, showing the complex background of ruined [[Roman architecture|Classical buildings]] that he planned for the left of the picture. In addition, Leonardo is credited with the first use of [[anamorphosis]], the use of a \"perspective\" to produce an image that is intelligible only with a curved mirror or from a specific vantage point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionworks.com/mod/anamorph.htm# |title=Animations of anamorphosis of Leonardo and other artists |publisher=Illusionworks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|upright|The [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as published in ''[[De divina proportione]]'']]\nWhile in Milan in 1496, Leonardo met a traveling [[monk]] and academic, [[Luca Pacioli]]. Under him, Leonardo studied [[mathematic]]s. Pacioli, who first codified and recorded the [[double entry]] system of bookkeeping,<ref>[http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm L. Murphy Smith, ''Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055709/http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm |date=2011-08-18 }}</ref> had already published a major treatise on mathematical knowledge, collaborated with Leonardo in the production of a book called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'' about mathematical and artistic proportion. Leonardo prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates. ''De divina proportione'' was published in 1509.\n\n<blockquote>All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of [[mathematician]]s, which are:\u2014the point, the line, the angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Engineering and invention==\n[[Vasari]] in ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|The Lives]]''  says of Leonardo:\n\n<blockquote>He made designs for mills, [[fulling]] machines<!-- a fulling machine is used in the production of cloth --> and engines that could be driven by water-power... In addition he used to make models and plans showing how to excavate and tunnel through mountains without difficulty, so as to pass from one level to another; and he demonstrated how to lift and draw great weights by means of levers, hoists and winches, and ways of cleansing harbours and using pumps to suck up water from great depths.</blockquote>\n\n===Practical inventions and projects===\n{{see also|Leonardo's self-propelled cart|Leonardo's robot}}\n[[File:Leonardo machine for grinding convex lenses.JPG|thumb|upright|A machine for grinding convex lenses]]\nWith the same rational and analytical approach that he used in anatomic studies, Leonardo faced the study and design of a bewildering number of machines and devices. He drew their \u201canatomy\u201d with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, include a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects have been collected in his codices and fill more than 5,000 pages.<ref name=\"guarnieri1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2019|title=Reconsidering Leonardo|journal= IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=13|issue=3|pages=35\u201338|doi=10.1109/MIE.2019.2929366|ref=harv}}</ref> Leonardo was a master of mechanical principles. He utilized [[lever]]age and [[cantilever]]ing, [[pulley]]s, [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]], [[gear]]s, including angle [[gears]] and [[rack and pinion]] gears; [[Watt's linkage|parallel linkage]], [[lubrication]] systems and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s. He understood the principles governing [[momentum]], [[centripetal force]], [[tribology|friction]] and the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of [[Amontons#Amontons' laws of friction|Amontons' laws of friction]] by 150 years.<ref name= NW>{{cite web|url=http://www.nano-world.org/frictionmodule/content/0200makroreibung/0400historisch/0100leonardo/?=lang=en |title=Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) |publisher=Nano-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIt is impossible to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over the lives of many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated [[bobbin]] winder, the [[rolling mill]], the machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire and the [[lens (optics)|lens]]-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed [[ratio]] determined by the gear.\n\nAs an inventor, Leonardo was not prepared to tell all that he knew:\n\n<blockquote>How by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Bridges and hydraulics===\n[[File:Leonardo machines.JPG|thumb|upright|Various hydraulic machines]]\nLeonardo's study of the motion of water led him to design machinery that utilized its force. Much of his work on [[hydraulics]] was for [[Ludovico il Moro]]. Leonardo wrote to Ludovico describing his skills and what he could build:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.</blockquote>\n\nAmong his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood [[Pisa]]. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed [[Venice]] and came up with a plan to create a movable [[Dike (construction)|dyke]] for the city's protection against invaders.\n\nIn 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span 240&nbsp;m (720&nbsp;ft) bridge as part of a [[civil engineering]] project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Istanbul]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosphorus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebj\u00f8rn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in [[Norway]].\nA stone model of the bridge was evaluated in 2019 by [[MIT]] researchers. The self-supporting 1:500 [[scale ratio|scale]] model was built from 126 [[3D printing|3D-printed]] stone cross-sections, held together [[dry stone|without mortar]]. Researchers concluded that the bridge would've been able to support its own weight, and maintain stability under load and [[wind shear]] forces.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/leonardo-da-vinci-bridge-test-1010 |title=Engineers put Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s bridge design to the test |last=Chandler |first=David L. |date=2019-10-09 |work=MIT News |access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===War machines===\n{{see also|Architonnerre|Rapid fire crossbow}}\n[[File:An Artillery Park.jpg|thumb|An arsenal]]\nLeonardo's letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]] assured him:\n\n<blockquote>When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.</blockquote>\n\nIn Leonardo's notebooks there is an array of war machines which includes [[Leonardo's fighting vehicle|a vehicle]] to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the vehicle would never progress in a forward direction. In a [[BBC]] documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears in order to make the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/13/1039656218782.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Da Vinci war machines \"designed to fail\" | date=December 14, 2002}}</ref> Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.\n\n[[File:Leonardo tank.JPG|thumb|left|Leonardo's proposed vehicle]]\n\nLeonardo's notebooks also show [[cannon]]s which he claimed \"to hurl small stones like a storm with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion.\" He also designed an [[Leonardo's crossbow|enormous crossbow]]. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the [[British Army]], but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three racks of barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The \"fan type\" gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.\n\nLeonardo was the first to sketch the [[wheel-lock]] [[musket]] c. 1500&nbsp;AD (the precedent of the [[flintlock]] musket which first appeared in Europe by 1547), although as early as the 14th century the [[History of China|Chinese]] had used a flintlock 'steel wheel' in order to detonate [[land mine]]s.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 199\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.</ref>\n\nWhile Leonardo was working in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early [[diving suit]], to be used in the destruction of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzglSdu120c&feature=BF&list=PLC219B9E53A3E82D5&index=8| title=Youtube Video of the BBC documentary}}</ref>\nHis inventions were very futuristic which meant they were very expensive and proved not to be useful.\n\n===Flight===\n{{see also|Great Kite}}\n[[File:Leonardo flight of bird.JPG|thumb|upright|The flight of a bird]]\nIn Leonardo's infancy a hawk had once hovered over his cradle. Recalling this incident, Leonardo saw it as prophetic:\n\n<blockquote>An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|left|Design for a flying machine with wings based closely upon the structure of a bat's wings.]]\nThe desire to fly is expressed in the many studies and drawings. His later journals contain a detailed study of the flight of birds and several different designs for wings based in structure upon those of bats which he described as being less heavy because of the impenetrable nature of the membrane. There is a legend that Leonardo tested the flying machine on [[Monte Ceceri]] with one of his apprentices, and that the apprentice fell and broke his leg.<ref>Liana Bortolon, ''Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, (1967)</ref> Experts Martin Kemp and Liana Bortolon agree that there is no evidence of such a test, which is not mentioned in his journals.\n\nOne design that he produced shows a flying machine to be lifted by a man-powered [[helicopter rotor|rotor]].<ref name=\"leonardodavincisinventions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardodavincisinventions.com/inventions-for-flight/leonardo-da-vinci-helicopter/ |title=The Helicopter &#187; Leonardo Da Vinci&#039;s Inventions |publisher=leonardodavincisinventions.com|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref> It would not have worked since the body of the craft itself would have rotated in the opposite direction to the rotor.<ref>see [[Helicopter]] for detailed description of solutions and types of functional helicopter.</ref>\n\nWhile he designed a number of man powered flying machines with mechanical wings that flapped, he also designed a [[parachute]] and a light [[hang glider]] which could have flown.<ref>U.S. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), ''Leonardo's Dream Machine'', October 2005</ref>\n\n===Musical instrument===\n{{Main|Viola organista|Harpsichord-viola}}\n[[File:Viola organista.jpg|thumb|Viola organista (''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', 1488\u20131489)]]\nThe viola organista was an [[experimental musical instrument]] invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It was the first bowed [[keyboard instrument]] (of which any record has survived) ever to be devised.\n\nLeonardo's original idea, as preserved in his notebooks of 1488\u20131489 and in the drawings in the [[Codex Atlanticus]], was to use one or more wheels, continuously rotating, each of which pulled a looping bow, rather like a fanbelt in an automobile engine, and perpendicular to the instrument's strings.\n\n==Leonardo's inventions made reality==\n[[File:20110726 Museo Milan 6187.jpg|thumb|Model of wing by Leonardo da Vinci, in the [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci|National Museum of Science and Technology]], Milan]]\n\nIn the late 20th century, interest in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There have been many projects which have sought to turn diagrams on paper into working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for [[Early flying machines|flying machines]].\n\nA difficulty encountered in the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential in order to make a machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus, many models that are created, such as some of those on display at [[Clos Luc\u00e9]], Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.\n\n===Exhibitions===\n* Leonardo da Vinci Gallery at [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] in Milan; permanent exhibition, the biggest collection of Leonardo's projects and inventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/leonardo/leonardo.asp|title=Leonardo|website=Museoscienzaorg|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n* Models of Leonardo's designs are on permanent display at Clos Luc\u00e9.\n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, held an exhibition called \"Leonardo da Vinci: Experience, Experiment, and Design\" in 2006\n* Logitech Museum\n* \"The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition\" was held in a pavilion in the Cultural Forecourt, at South Bank, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2009.

Whilst most famous for his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and the ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', Leonardo is also renowned in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geometry]], [[hydrodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[optics]], [[physics]], [[pyrotechnics]], and [[zoology]].  \n\nWhile the full extent of his scientific studies has only become recognized in the last 150 years, during his lifetime he was employed for his engineering and skill of invention. Many of his designs, such as the movable [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the [[parachute]], the [[helicopter]], an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated [[solar power]], a [[calculator]], a rudimentary theory of [[plate tectonics]] and the [[double hull]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Innocenzi |first1=Plinio |title=The innovators behind Leonardo: The True Story of the Scientific and Technological Renaissance |date=2018 |publisher=Cham: Springer International Publishing |isbn=9783319904481}}</ref> In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], civil engineering, optics, and the study of water (hydrodynamics).\n\nLeonardo's most famous drawing, the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent the concept of [[macrocosm and microcosm]] in [[Renaissance humanism]].\n\n==Condensed biography==\n{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci}}\n[[File:Study of a Tuscan Landscape.jpg|thumb|The Arno Valley]]\n\n:NOTE: This is a brief summary of Leonardo's early life and journals with particular emphasis on his introduction to science.<!--- Please do not expand this section unless it relates SPECIFICALLY to Leonardo's study of science--->\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 \u2013 May 2, 1519) was born the illegitimate son of Messer Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. His early life was spent in the region of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the valley of the [[Arno River]] near [[Florence]], firstly with his mother and in later childhood in the household of his father, grandfather and uncle Francesco.\n\nHis curiosity and interest in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of [[Diary|journals]] set an example which he was to follow for most of his life, diligently recording in his own journals both the events of the day, his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams for the construction of a [[Early flying machines#The Renaissance|flying machine]].\n\nIn 1466, Leonardo was sent to Florence to the workshop of the artist [[Verrocchio]], in order to learn the skills of an artist. At the workshop, as well as painting and drawing, he learnt the study of topographical anatomy.<ref>''Topographical anatomy'' is the anatomy that is visible on the surface of the body.</ref>  He was also exposed to a very wide range of technical skills such as [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[set construction]], [[plaster]]working, paint chemistry, and [[metallurgy]].\n[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|From Leonardo's journals \u2013 studies of an old man and the action of water.]]\n\nAmong the older artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's scientific interest was [[Piero della Francesca]], then a man in his 60s, who was one of the earliest artists to systematically employ [[linear perspective]] in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the [[Annunciation]] show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was profoundly observant of nature, his curiosity having been stimulated in early childhood by his discovery of a deep cave in the mountains and his intense desire to know what lay inside. His earliest dated drawing, 1473, is of the valley of the Arno River, where he lived. It displays some of the many scientific interests that were to obsess him all his life, in particular geology and hydrology.\n<ref name=LB>Liana Bortolon, ''The Life and Times of Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, 1967</ref>\n\n==Approach to scientific investigation==\n[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|upright|Investigating the motion of the arm.]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the study of art and science was not perceived as mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach to the art of painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.\n\nAs a scientist, Leonardo had no formal education in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]] and did not attend a [[university]]. Because of these factors, his scientific studies were largely ignored by other scholars. Leonardo's approach to science was one of intense observation and detailed recording, his tools of investigation being almost exclusively his eyes. His journals give insight into his investigative processes.\n\nAs a researcher, Leonardo divided nature and phenomena into ever smaller segments, concretely with knives and measuring instruments, intellectually with formulas and numbers, to wrest the secrets of creation from it. The smaller the particles, runs the assumption; the closer one will get to the solution of the enigmas.<ref>{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Marc van den Broek]]|Title=Leonardo da Vinci Spirits of Invention. A Search for Traces |Publisher=A.TE.M. |PublicationPlace=Hamburg|ISBN=978-3-00-063700-1|Date=2019|language=English}}</ref>\n\nA recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by [[Fritjof Capra]] argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and other scientists who followed him, his theorizing and hypothesizing integrating the arts and particularly painting. Capra sees Leonardo's unique integrated, holistic views of science as making him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought.<ref>Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Leonardo's notes and journals==\n\nLeonardo kept a series of [[Diary|journals]] in which he wrote almost daily, as well as separate notes and sheets of observations, comments and plans. He wrote and drew with his left hand, and most of his writing is in [[Mirror writing|mirror script]], which makes it difficult to read. Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.\n\nOn his death, the writings were left mainly to his pupil and heir [[Francesco Melzi]], with the apparent intention that his scientific work should be published. Sometime before 1542, Melzi gathered together the papers for ''A Treatise on Painting'' from eighteen of Leonardo's 'books' (two-thirds of which have gone missing).{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=170}} The publishing did not take place in Melzi's lifetime, and the writings were eventually bound in different forms and dispersed. Some of his works were published as a ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]'' 165 years after his  death.\n\n==Publication==\n\nLeonardo illustrated a book on mathematical proportion in art written by his friend [[Luca Pacioli]] and called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'', published in 1509. He was also preparing a major treatise on his scientific observations and mechanical inventions. It was to be divided into a number of sections or \"Books\", Leonardo leaving some instructions as to how they were to be ordered. Many sections of it appear in his notebooks.\n\nThese pages deal with scientific subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon the creation of artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a great deal about the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.<ref name=JPR>''Jean Paul Richter'' editor 1880, ''[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci]'' Dover, 1970, {{ISBN|0-486-22572-0}}. (accessed 2007-02-04)</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Begun at Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the 22nd day of March 1508. And this is to be a collection without order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [all] and say: \u2018I will not write this because I wrote it before.\u2019 And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.<ref name= JPR/></blockquote>\n\n==Natural science==\n[[File:Study of the Graduations of Shadows on Spheres.jpg|thumb|upright|Study of the graduations of light and shade on a sphere ([[chiaroscuro]]).]]\n\n===Light===\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These are; diffused light as that of the atmosphere; And Direct, as that of the sun; The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes through [translucent] bodies, as linen or paper etc.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'']]\n\nFor an artist working in the 15th century, some study of the nature of [[light]] was essential. It was by the effective painting of light falling on a surface that ''modelling'', or a three-dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, [[Verrocchio]], that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colors that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except [[Piero della Francesca]] actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.\n\nAt the time when Leonardo commenced painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade. Faces, in particular, were shadowed in a manner that was bland and maintained all the features and contours clearly visible. Leonardo broke with this.\nIn the painting generally titled ''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'' (about 1483) he sets the figure [[diagonal]]ly to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back of her head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused in such a way that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.\n\nLeonardo's treatment of light in paintings such as ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' was to change forever the way in which artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, this is probably the one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.\n\n===Human anatomy===\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\n...to obtain a true and perfect knowledge ... I have dissected more than ten human bodies, destroying all the other members, and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded, ... and as one single body would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences...<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Proportions of the Head.jpg|thumb|Study of the proportions of the head.]]\n\n====Topographic anatomy====\nLeonardo began the formal study of the topographical [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] when apprenticed to [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. As a student he would have been taught to draw the human body from life, to memorize the muscles, tendons and visible subcutaneous structure and to familiarise himself with the mechanics of the various parts of the skeletal and muscular structure. It was common workshop practice to have plaster casts of parts of the human anatomy available for students to study and draw.\n[[File:Anatomy of a Male Nude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Two anatomical studies]]\nIf, as is thought to be the case, Leonardo painted the torso and arms of Christ in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his understanding of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of [[John the Baptist]] in the same painting.\n\nIn the 1490s he wrote about demonstrating muscles and sinews to students:\n\n<blockquote>Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nHis continued investigations in this field occupied many pages of notes, each dealing systematically with a particular aspect of anatomy. It appears that the notes were intended for publication, a task entrusted on his death to his pupil [[Francesco Melzi|Melzi]].\n\nIn conjunction with studies of aspects of the body are drawings of faces displaying different emotions and many drawings of people suffering facial deformity, either congenital or through illness. Some of these drawings, generally referred to as \"caricatures\", on analysis of the skeletal proportions, appear to be based on anatomical studies.\n\n====Dissection====\n{{see also|Studies of the Fetus in the Womb}}\n[[File:View of a Skull III.jpg|thumb|upright|Dissection of the skull.]]\nAs Leonardo became successful as an artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence. Later he dissected in Milan at the hospital Maggiore, and in Rome at the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Ospedale di Santo Spirito]] (the first mainland Italian hospital). From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]].\n\n<blockquote>I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn 30 years, Leonardo dissected 30 male and female corpses of different ages. Together with Marcantonio, he prepared to publish a theoretical work on anatomy and made more than 200 drawings. However, his book was published only in 1680 (161 years after his death) under the heading ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]''.\n[[File:DaVinciCardiovascularWoman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The organs of a woman's body]]\nAmong the detailed images that Leonardo drew are many studies of the [[human skeleton]]. He was the first to describe the double S form of the [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. He also studied the inclination of [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] and stressed that sacrum was not uniform, but composed of five fused [[vertebrae]]. He also studied the anatomy of the human foot and its connection to the leg, and from these studies, he was able to further his studies in biomechanics.\n\nLeonardo was a [[Physiology|physiologist]] as well as an anatomist, studying the function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the [[human skull]] and cross-sections of the [[human brain|brain]], [[Transverse plane|transversal]], [[sagittal]], and [[Frontal bone|frontal]]. These drawings may be linked to a search for the ''[[sensus communis]]'', the locus of the human senses,<ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.\n\n[[File:Views of a Foetus in the Womb.jpg|thumb|Studies of a f\u0153tus from Leonardo's journals]]\nLeonardo studied internal organs, being the first to draw the human [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and the [[lung]]s, [[mesentery]], [[urinary tract]], [[reproductive organs]], the muscles of the [[cervix]] and a detailed cross-section of [[coitus]]. He was one of the first to draw a scientific representation of the [[fetus]] in the intrautero.\n\nLeonardo studied the [[vascular system]] and drew a dissected [[heart]] in detail. He correctly worked out how heart valves ebb the flow of blood yet he  did not fully understand [[Blood circulation|circulation]], as he believed that blood was pumped to the muscles where it was consumed. In 2005 a UK heart surgeon, Francis Wells, from Papworth Hospital Cambridge, pioneered repair to damaged hearts, using Leonardo's depiction of the opening phase of the mitral valve to operate without changing its diameter allowing an individual to recover more quickly. Wells said \"Leonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body \u2013 its structure and function \u2013 that perhaps has been overlooked by some.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/health/4289204.stm |title=Da Vinci clue for heart surgeon |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's observational acumen, drawing skill, and the clarity of depiction of bone structures reveal him at his finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered by the lack of preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman <small>(See left)</small> reveal many traditional misconceptions.<ref name=MK>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}</ref><ref>[http://www.livescience.com/20046-10-odd-facts-female-reproductive-system.html Live Science]</ref>\n\nLeonardo's study of [[human anatomy]] led also to the design of an [[automaton]] which has come to be called [[Leonardo's robot]], was probably made around the year 1495 but was rediscovered only in the 1950s.\n\n===Comparative anatomy===\n[[File:Leonardo anatomy of dog and man.JPG|thumb|upright|Comparison of the leg of a man and a dog.]]\nLeonardo not only studied human anatomy, but the anatomy of many other animals as well. He dissected [[cows]], [[birds]], [[monkeys]] and [[frogs]], comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, a snarling lion and a snarling man.\n\n<blockquote>I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn the early 1490s Leonardo was commissioned to create a monument in honour of [[Francesco Sforza]]. In his notebooks are a series of plans for an equestrian monument. There are also a large number of related anatomical studies of horses. They include several [[Leonardo's horse|diagrams of a standing horse]] with the angles and proportions annotated, anatomical studies of horses' heads, a dozen detailed drawings of hooves and numerous studies and sketches of horses rearing.\n\nHe studied the topographical anatomy of a bear in detail, making many drawings of its paws. There is also a drawing of the muscles and tendons of the bear's hind feet.\nOther drawings of particular interest include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the hindquarters of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.\n\n===Botany===\nThe science of [[botany]] was long established by Leonardo's time, a treatise on the subject having been written as early as 300&nbsp;BCE.<ref>E.g. Theophrastus, ''On the History of Plants''.</ref> Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form the parts of the plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual plants and flowers of a single variety differed from one another.\n\n[[File:Sedge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Study of sedge]]\n\nOne such study shows a page with several species of flower of which ten drawings are of wild violets. Along with a drawing of the growing plant and a detail of a leaf, Leonardo has repeatedly drawn single flowers from different angles, with their heads set differently on the stem.\n\nApart from flowers the notebooks contain many drawings of crop plants including several types of grain and a variety of berries including a detailed study of [[bramble]]. There are also water plants such as [[Iris (plant)|irises]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]. His notebooks also direct the artist to observe how light reflects from foliage at different distances and under different [[weather|atmospheric conditions]].\n\nA number of the drawings have their equivalents in Leonardo's paintings. An elegant study of a stem of [[lily|lilies]] may have been for one of Leonardo's early Annunciation paintings, carried in the hand of the Archangel Gabriel. In both the Annunciation pictures the grass is dotted with blossoming plants.\n\nThe plants which appear in both the versions of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' reflects the results of Leonardo's studies in a meticulous realism that makes each plant readily identifiable to the botanist.\n\nIn his writings, da Vinci proposed the following [[da Vinci branching rule|branching rule]]:\n\n<blockquote>All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them].<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Leonardo topographical map.JPG|thumb|upright|A topographical map]]\n\nAs an adult, Leonardo had only two childhood memories, one of which was the finding of a cave in the Apennines. Although fearing that he might be attacked by a wild beast, he ventured in driven \"by the burning desire to see whether there might be any marvelous thing within.\"\n\nLeonardo's earliest dated drawing is a study of the [[Arno valley]], strongly emphasizing its geological features. His notebooks contain landscapes with a wealth of geological observation from the regions of both [[Florence]] and [[Milan]], often including atmospheric effects such as a heavy rainstorm pouring down on a town at the foot of a mountain range.\n\nIt had been observed for many years that [[Stratum|strata]] in mountains often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these could be explained by the [[Great Flood]] described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.\n\n[[File:Virgin of the Rocks (Louvre).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'']]\n\n<blockquote>And a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate, a [[tufa]] has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nThis quotation makes clear the breadth of Leonardo's understanding of [[geology]], including the action of water in creating [[sedimentary rock]], the [[plate tectonics|tectonic action]] of the Earth in raising the sea bed and the action of [[erosion]] in the creation of [[landform|geographical features]].\n\nIn Leonardo's earliest paintings we see the remarkable attention given to the small [[landscape]]s of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in a misty light. In the larger of the ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' paintings is a town on the edge of a lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical strata. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] and [[Lago d'Iseo]] in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'', which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.<ref>The London painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' is denounced by the geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso, [http://www.leonardosgeology.com] of New York, as largely by the hand of someone other than Leonardo, because the rocks appear incongruous and the lake looks like a fjord. Pizzorusso says \"Fjords do not exist in Italy and it is highly unlikely the glacial lakes of the Lombard region would have such steep relief surrounding them.\" In fact, the [[glacial lake]], Garda, has just such steep geological formations. The sedimentary red limestone which appears in the picture is also typical of Italy.</ref>\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Town plan of Imola.jpg|thumb|Leonardo's accurate map of Imola for Cesare Borgia.]]\nIn the early 16th century [[map]]s were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo produced several extremely accurate maps such as the town plan of [[Imola]] created in 1502 in order to win the [[patronage]] of [[Cesare Borgia]]. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a [[military engineer]] and [[architect]]. Leonardo also produced a map of [[Chiana Valley]] in [[Tuscany]], which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by pacing the distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.\n\nRecent research by Donato Pezzutto suggests that the background landscapes in Leonardo\u2019s paintings depict specific locations as aerial views with enhanced depth, employing a technique called [[Cartography|cartographic perspective]]. Pezzutto  identifies the location of the ''Mona Lisa'' to the Val di Chiana, the ''Annunciation'' to the Arno Valley, the ''[[Madonna of the Yarnwinder]]'' to the Adda Valley and ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St Anne]]'' to the Sessia Valley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opusej.org/library/leonardos-landscapes-as-maps-cover-page/|publisher=OPUSeJ|first=Donato|last=Pezzutto|title=Leonardo\u2019s Landscapes as Maps|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrodynamics===\n[[File:Studies of Water passing Obstacles and falling.jpg|thumb|upright|Studies of water]]\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAll the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nAmong Leonardo's drawings are many that are studies of the motion of water, in particular the forms taken by fast-flowing water on striking different surfaces.\n\nMany of these drawings depict the spiralling nature of water. The [[spiral]] form had been studied in the art of the [[Ancient Greek art|Classical era]] and strict [[Golden ratio|mathematical proportion]] had been applied to its use in art and [[architecture]]. An awareness of these rules of proportion had been revived in the early [[italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. In Leonardo's drawings can be seen the investigation of the spiral as it occurs in water.\n\nThere are several elaborate drawings of water curling over an object placed at a diagonal to its course. There are several drawings of water dropping from a height and curling upwards in spiral forms. One such drawing, as well as curling waves, shows splashes and details of spray and bubbles.\n\nLeonardo's interest manifested itself in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The knowledge that he gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly in relation to the Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.\n\n===Astronomy===\nLeonardo lived at a time when [[geocentric]] theories were the most widely used explanations to account for the relationship between the Earth and Sun's movement. He wrote that \"The Sun has substance, shape, movement, radiance, heat, and generative power; and these qualities all emanate from itself without its diminution.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Dr. Mario |title=The Da Vinci Astronomy |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-da-vinci-astronomy_b_4065100 |website=Huff Post |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> He further wrote,\n<blockquote>The earth is not in the centre of the Sun's orbit nor at the centre of the universe, but in the centre of its companion elements, and united with them. And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both beneath us, would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A63kDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT312 Da Vinci's notebooks] on astronomy.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn one of his notebooks, there is a note in the margin which states, \"The Sun does not move,\" which may indicate Leonardo's support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Leonardo Da Vinci |url=http://giantsofscience.weebly.com/leonardo-da-vinci-vj.html |website=Giants of Science |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy===\nClaims are sometimes made that Leonardo da Vinci was an [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. He was trained in the workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending [[Pigment|paint pigment]]. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' deteriorating within a century, and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (Leonardo)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, there are some that pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learned as a student.<ref name=Moran>Bruce T. Moran, ''Distilling Knowledge, Chemistry, Alchemy and the Scientific Revolution'', (2005) {{ISBN|0-674-01495-2}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's scientific process was based mainly upon observation. His practical experiments are also founded in observation rather than belief. Leonardo, who questioned the order of the [[solar system]] and the deposit of fossils by the [[Noah's Ark|Great Flood]], had little time for the alchemical quests to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]] or create a [[Philosopher's stone|potion]] that gave eternal life.\n\nLeonardo said about alchemists:\n\n<blockquote>The false interpreters of nature declare that quicksilver is the common seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety of the things she desires to produce in the world.<ref name= JPR /><ref>\"Quicksilver\" is an old name for mercury.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Old alchemists... have never either by chance or by experiment succeeded in creating the smallest element that can be created by nature; however [they] deserve unmeasured praise for the usefulness of things invented for the use of men, and would deserve it even more if they had not been the inventors of noxious things like poisons and other similar things which destroy life or mind.\"''<ref name=Notebooks>Irma Ann Richter and Teresa Wells, ''Leonardo da Vinci \u2013 Notebooks'', Oxford University Press (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-19-929902-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Mathematical studies==\n\n===Perspective===\n<blockquote>The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 15th century, both [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] made studies of [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. In 1436 Alberti published ''[[De pictura]]'' (\"On Painting\"), which includes his findings on linear perspective. [[Piero della Francesca]] carried his work forward and by the 1470s a number of artists were able to produce works of art that demonstrated a full understanding of the principles of linear perspective. \n[[File:Leonardo study AdorationofMagi.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Draft of the perspective for ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'']]\n\nLeonardo studied linear perspective and employed it in his earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two [[Annunciation]]s is daring, as he uses various features such as the corner of a building, a [[walled garden]] and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.\n\nThe unfinished ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' was intended to be a masterpiece revealing much of Leonardo's knowledge of figure drawing and perspective. There exists a number of studies that he made, including a detailed study of the perspective, showing the complex background of ruined [[Roman architecture|Classical buildings]] that he planned for the left of the picture. In addition, Leonardo is credited with the first use of [[anamorphosis]], the use of a \"perspective\" to produce an image that is intelligible only with a curved mirror or from a specific vantage point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionworks.com/mod/anamorph.htm# |title=Animations of anamorphosis of Leonardo and other artists |publisher=Illusionworks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|upright|The [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as published in ''[[De divina proportione]]'']]\nWhile in Milan in 1496, Leonardo met a traveling [[monk]] and academic, [[Luca Pacioli]]. Under him, Leonardo studied [[mathematic]]s. Pacioli, who first codified and recorded the [[double entry]] system of bookkeeping,<ref>[http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm L. Murphy Smith, ''Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055709/http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm |date=2011-08-18 }}</ref> had already published a major treatise on mathematical knowledge, collaborated with Leonardo in the production of a book called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'' about mathematical and artistic proportion. Leonardo prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates. ''De divina proportione'' was published in 1509.\n\n<blockquote>All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of [[mathematician]]s, which are:\u2014the point, the line, the angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Engineering and invention==\n[[Vasari]] in ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|The Lives]]''  says of Leonardo:\n\n<blockquote>He made designs for mills, [[fulling]] machines<!-- a fulling machine is used in the production of cloth --> and engines that could be driven by water-power... In addition he used to make models and plans showing how to excavate and tunnel through mountains without difficulty, so as to pass from one level to another; and he demonstrated how to lift and draw great weights by means of levers, hoists and winches, and ways of cleansing harbours and using pumps to suck up water from great depths.</blockquote>\n\n===Practical inventions and projects===\n{{see also|Leonardo's self-propelled cart|Leonardo's robot}}\n[[File:Leonardo machine for grinding convex lenses.JPG|thumb|upright|A machine for grinding convex lenses]]\nWith the same rational and analytical approach that he used in anatomic studies, Leonardo faced the study and design of a bewildering number of machines and devices. He drew their \u201canatomy\u201d with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, include a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects have been collected in his codices and fill more than 5,000 pages.<ref name=\"guarnieri1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2019|title=Reconsidering Leonardo|journal= IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=13|issue=3|pages=35\u201338|doi=10.1109/MIE.2019.2929366|ref=harv}}</ref> Leonardo was a master of mechanical principles. He utilized [[lever]]age and [[cantilever]]ing, [[pulley]]s, [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]], [[gear]]s, including angle [[gears]] and [[rack and pinion]] gears; [[Watt's linkage|parallel linkage]], [[lubrication]] systems and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s. He understood the principles governing [[momentum]], [[centripetal force]], [[tribology|friction]] and the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of [[Amontons#Amontons' laws of friction|Amontons' laws of friction]] by 150 years.<ref name= NW>{{cite web|url=http://www.nano-world.org/frictionmodule/content/0200makroreibung/0400historisch/0100leonardo/?=lang=en |title=Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) |publisher=Nano-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIt is impossible to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over the lives of many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated [[bobbin]] winder, the [[rolling mill]], the machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire and the [[lens (optics)|lens]]-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed [[ratio]] determined by the gear.\n\nAs an inventor, Leonardo was not prepared to tell all that he knew:\n\n<blockquote>How by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Bridges and hydraulics===\n[[File:Leonardo machines.JPG|thumb|upright|Various hydraulic machines]]\nLeonardo's study of the motion of water led him to design machinery that utilized its force. Much of his work on [[hydraulics]] was for [[Ludovico il Moro]]. Leonardo wrote to Ludovico describing his skills and what he could build:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.</blockquote>\n\nAmong his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood [[Pisa]]. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed [[Venice]] and came up with a plan to create a movable [[Dike (construction)|dyke]] for the city's protection against invaders.\n\nIn 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span 240&nbsp;m (720&nbsp;ft) bridge as part of a [[civil engineering]] project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Istanbul]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosphorus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebj\u00f8rn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in [[Norway]].\nA stone model of the bridge was evaluated in 2019 by [[MIT]] researchers. The self-supporting 1:500 [[scale ratio|scale]] model was built from 126 [[3D printing|3D-printed]] stone cross-sections, held together [[dry stone|without mortar]]. Researchers concluded that the bridge would've been able to support its own weight, and maintain stability under load and [[wind shear]] forces.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/leonardo-da-vinci-bridge-test-1010 |title=Engineers put Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s bridge design to the test |last=Chandler |first=David L. |date=2019-10-09 |work=MIT News |access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===War machines===\n{{see also|Architonnerre|Rapid fire crossbow}}\n[[File:An Artillery Park.jpg|thumb|An arsenal]]\nLeonardo's letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]] assured him:\n\n<blockquote>When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.</blockquote>\n\nIn Leonardo's notebooks there is an array of war machines which includes [[Leonardo's fighting vehicle|a vehicle]] to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the vehicle would never progress in a forward direction. In a [[BBC]] documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears in order to make the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/13/1039656218782.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Da Vinci war machines \"designed to fail\" | date=December 14, 2002}}</ref> Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.\n\n[[File:Leonardo tank.JPG|thumb|left|Leonardo's proposed vehicle]]\n\nLeonardo's notebooks also show [[cannon]]s which he claimed \"to hurl small stones like a storm with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion.\" He also designed an [[Leonardo's crossbow|enormous crossbow]]. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the [[British Army]], but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three racks of barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The \"fan type\" gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.\n\nLeonardo was the first to sketch the [[wheel-lock]] [[musket]] c. 1500&nbsp;AD (the precedent of the [[flintlock]] musket which first appeared in Europe by 1547), although as early as the 14th century the [[History of China|Chinese]] had used a flintlock 'steel wheel' in order to detonate [[land mine]]s.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 199\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.</ref>\n\nWhile Leonardo was working in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early [[diving suit]], to be used in the destruction of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzglSdu120c&feature=BF&list=PLC219B9E53A3E82D5&index=8| title=Youtube Video of the BBC documentary}}</ref>\nHis inventions were very futuristic which meant they were very expensive and proved not to be useful.\n\n===Flight===\n{{see also|Great Kite}}\n[[File:Leonardo flight of bird.JPG|thumb|upright|The flight of a bird]]\nIn Leonardo's infancy a hawk had once hovered over his cradle. Recalling this incident, Leonardo saw it as prophetic:\n\n<blockquote>An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|left|Design for a flying machine with wings based closely upon the structure of a bat's wings.]]\nThe desire to fly is expressed in the many studies and drawings. His later journals contain a detailed study of the flight of birds and several different designs for wings based in structure upon those of bats which he described as being less heavy because of the impenetrable nature of the membrane. There is a legend that Leonardo tested the flying machine on [[Monte Ceceri]] with one of his apprentices, and that the apprentice fell and broke his leg.<ref>Liana Bortolon, ''Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, (1967)</ref> Experts Martin Kemp and Liana Bortolon agree that there is no evidence of such a test, which is not mentioned in his journals.\n\nOne design that he produced shows a flying machine to be lifted by a man-powered [[helicopter rotor|rotor]].<ref name=\"leonardodavincisinventions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardodavincisinventions.com/inventions-for-flight/leonardo-da-vinci-helicopter/ |title=The Helicopter &#187; Leonardo Da Vinci&#039;s Inventions |publisher=leonardodavincisinventions.com|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref> It would not have worked since the body of the craft itself would have rotated in the opposite direction to the rotor.<ref>see [[Helicopter]] for detailed description of solutions and types of functional helicopter.</ref>\n\nWhile he designed a number of man powered flying machines with mechanical wings that flapped, he also designed a [[parachute]] and a light [[hang glider]] which could have flown.<ref>U.S. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), ''Leonardo's Dream Machine'', October 2005</ref>\n\n===Musical instrument===\n{{Main|Viola organista|Harpsichord-viola}}\n[[File:Viola organista.jpg|thumb|Viola organista (''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', 1488\u20131489)]]\nThe viola organista was an [[experimental musical instrument]] invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It was the first bowed [[keyboard instrument]] (of which any record has survived) ever to be devised.\n\nLeonardo's original idea, as preserved in his notebooks of 1488\u20131489 and in the drawings in the [[Codex Atlanticus]], was to use one or more wheels, continuously rotating, each of which pulled a looping bow, rather like a fanbelt in an automobile engine, and perpendicular to the instrument's strings.\n\n==Leonardo's inventions made reality==\n[[File:20110726 Museo Milan 6187.jpg|thumb|Model of wing by Leonardo da Vinci, in the [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci|National Museum of Science and Technology]], Milan]]\n\nIn the late 20th century, interest in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There have been many projects which have sought to turn diagrams on paper into working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for [[Early flying machines|flying machines]].\n\nA difficulty encountered in the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential in order to make a machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus, many models that are created, such as some of those on display at [[Clos Luc\u00e9]], Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.\n\n===Exhibitions===\n* Leonardo da Vinci Gallery at [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] in Milan; permanent exhibition, the biggest collection of Leonardo's projects and inventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/leonardo/leonardo.asp|title=Leonardo|website=Museoscienzaorg|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n* Models of Leonardo's designs are on permanent display at Clos Luc\u00e9.\n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, held an exhibition called \"Leonardo da Vinci: Experience, Experiment, and Design\" in 2006\n* Logitech Museum\n* \"The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition\" was held in a pavilion in the Cultural Forecourt, at South Bank, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2009.

Whether you are a heathen or a Christian, one who does not believe in [[Christ]] or a backslider, you will see yourself as [[God]] sees you. \u201cMan looks at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7). God sees us as we really are.\n\n[[Satan]] is the father of all lies. He is the prince of darkness and god of this world, who disguises himself as an angel of light to lead men and women the wrong way. In these days, as in times past, there are many false [[apostles]] who disguise themselves, pretending to be apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed (disguised) into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:13,14). Satan, the god of this world, keeps people in the dark so that they cannot see that God loves them or that Jesus died to save them (2 Cor. 4:4). All sinners and those who do not believe are spiritually dead and blind concerning God. They are ruled by the evil of this world (Eph. 2:1-2). Unless their eyes are opened in some way to their lost condition, they are heading for eternal destruction. The person who says, \u201cI have never sinned\u201d is deceiving himself. For \u201cThe Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the devil had done.\u201d (1 John 3:8). \u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come near to God, and He will come near to you.\u201d (James 4:7,8)\n\nAs you read this book and study its pictures, you will be able to see your own heart. Allow God\u2019s searchlight to show you the condition of your heart. Acknowledge your sins and do not deny their existence, for God\u2019s Word tells us that \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. But if we confess our sins to God, He will keep His promise and do what is right: He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.\u201d (1 John 1:1-10). \u201cThe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin\u201d.\n\nYou are ruled either by Satan or by God; you are a slave to sin or a servant of God. If sin controls your life, do not deny it, but cry out to God. He will set you free through Jesus Christ who came to this world to save sinners, to break the power of Satan and sin over us. He is our Saviour. You are in the presence of a holy God who knows all the secrets, the hidden thoughts and actions of your life. It is impossible to hide yourself and actions from God, for \u201cGod made our ears \u2013 can\u2019t He hear? He made our eyes \u2013 can\u2019t He see?\u201d (Ps. 94:9).\n\nThe Lord keeps close watch over the whole world to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to Him.\u201d (2 Chron.16:9).\n\nHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God.\u201d (Job 34:21,22).\n\nBut [[Jesus]] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all.\u201d (John 2:24).\n\nTherefore \u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit.\u201d (Ps. 32:1-2).\n\n== THE SINNERS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners heart P1.jpg|alt=This picture shows the heart of a wordly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.|thumb|The Sinners Heart]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a worldly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.'''\nBelow the head in this picture, the heart of man can be seen occupied by various animals which speak of the many different sins in the human heart, as the heart is the centre and breeding place of our sins. God tells us by the mouth of His prophet Jeremiah, that \u201cNobody can understand the human heart. There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed.\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nJesus Himself confirms this by saying, \u201cFor from the inside, from a person\u2019s heart, come the evil ideas which lead him to do immoral things; to rob, kill, commit adultery, be greedy, and do all sorts of evil things; deceit, indecency, jealousy, slander, pride, and folly \u2013 all these evil things come from inside a person and make him unclean\u201d (Mark 7:21-23)\n\nThe bleary, red eyes speak of drunkenness.  \u201cDon\u2019t let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, though it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. The next morning you will feel as if you have been bitten by a poisonous snake.\u201d (Proverbs 23:31-32)\n\nDifferent animals and signs used in the pictures reminds us of the following sins:\n\n=== The [[Peacock]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nWhile the beauty of the peacock is admired by everybody, here in the heart of man, it speaks of the sin of pride.\n\n=== The [[goat]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe goat represents bodily desires, immorality, adultery.\n\n=== The [[pig]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe pig speaks of the sins of drunkenness and gluttony. It is a dirty animal eagerly swallowing up everything in its way, clean or dirty, and in the same way a sinful heart devours every immoral suggestion, expression, picture, literature, etc.\n\n=== The [[tortoise]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe tortoise speaks of laziness, sluggishness to obey and witchcraft. \u201cA lazy man who refuses to work is only killing himself, all he does is think about what he would like to have.\u201d  (Prov. 21:25,26).\n\n=== The [[leopard]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe leopard is a very savage and cruel beast. Hatred, anger and a bad temper often rule the heart of man and many times lead to murder. \u201cKeep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbour a grudge.\u201d (Eccl. 7:9)\n\n=== The [[snake]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe snake represents the devil who is very deceitful, clever and misleading, and does everything possible to destroy our relationship with God.\n\n=== The [[frog]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe frog speaks here of the sins of greediness and the love of money which is the source of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Certain frogs in the Congo have been seen eating ants by the hundreds until they burst and died.\n\n=== [[Satan]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nSatan is the father of all lies, and is the one who persuades us to sin, and then he rules our hearts.\n\n=== The [[star]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe star speaks of the conscience in the heart of every man. Even in the bad heart the conscience is still there, but is being ignored, and cannot therefore help this person.\n\n=== The eye of [[God]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe eye of God sees everything that goes on in the heart. Nothing can be hidden from His flaming eye, and therefore He knows and sees all the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart. Whether you do your evil deeds in the darkest night, in the thickest forest, in the deepest ditch or wherever it may be, God sees it.\n\n=== The little tongues of fire[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe little tongues of fire round about the heart show the love of God surrounding the sinful heart. While God hates sin He loves man and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he should turn away from his sins and live. Jesus came to save sinners. There is great joy in heaven over one sinner that repents (Luke 15:7). The little tongues also speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d (John 1:29).\n\n=== The [[angel]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe angel represents the Word of God. God wants to speak to those who have been deceived and are carrying heavy loads of sin, so that they may turn from their sinful ways and let the light and love of God come into their hearts.\n\n=== The [[dove]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe dove is a sign of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who reveals the truth about God, about sin and what is right, and about God\u2019s judgement (John 15:26).\n\n== THE HEART CONVINCED OF SIN[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The heart convinced of sin P2.jpg|alt=The Heart convinced of sin|center|thumb|The Heart convinced of sin]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a man who is sorry for his sins and is beginning to look for God.'''\n\nHere we see the sinner beginning to take notice of the message of God and to open his heart to the love of God. The Holy Spirit begins to shine into the dark and sinful heart. The light of God comes into his heart to drive all darkness away. When God\u2019s light comes in, darkness has to go. Sin, described here by all the various animals, has to go. Therefore, dear reader, allow Jesus, the Light of the world, to come into your heart, and darkness and the evil actions of darkness must leave the heart, as shown in this picture.\n\nJesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.\u201d (John 8:12).\n\nYour heart is intended to be God\u2019s house, God\u2019s temple. He wants to live in it, make it beautiful, fill it with light, love and joy. Jesus not only came to forgive us our sins, but He came to deliver us and set us free from the power and domination of sin.\n\n\u201cIf the Son ([[Jesus]]) sets you free, then you will be really free.\u201d (John 8:36).\n\n== THE REPENTING HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The repenting heart P3.jpg|alt=The repenting heart|center|thumb|The repenting heart]]\n'''This picture shows us the heart of someone who is really serious about finding the right relationship with God.'''\n\nAs he sees the cross which the angel, the Word of God, shows to him, it breaks his now sorry heart, and he is moved with deep, heartfelt regret and sorrow over his many sins. As he sees the great love of God expressed in Christ Jesus, this love melts his heart, especially as he begins to realise that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to take away his many sins, as He was willing to die in his place on the cross.\n\nThe love and peace of God enter his heart as he begins to realise that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin.\u201d (1 John 1:7).\n\n\u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10).\n\nAgain God\u2019s Word says, \u201cI am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.\u201d (Isa. 66:2).\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes the words of Jesus clear to him, \u201cCourage, my son (daughter)! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d (Matt. 9:2).\n\n== DYING WITH CHRIST[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:Dying with Christ P4.jpg|alt=Dying with Christ|center|thumb|Dying with Christ]]\n'''This picture speaks of a Christian who has found perfect peace and eternal salvation through the death of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.'''\n\nThis person boasts in nothing else except \u201conly about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of His cross the world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world.\u201d (Gal. 6:14). Jesus died on the cross so that we too, might \u201cdie to sin and live for righteousness\u201d (1 Peter 2:24); a Christian dead to the world. We are commanded to \u201clet the Spirit direct our lives, and we will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.\u201d (Gal. 5:16,25).\n\nDo you declare openly that you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, by what you say and do? Or are you ashamed to let others know? Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone declares publicly that he belongs to me, I will do the same for him before my Father in heaven. But if anyone rejects me publicly, I will reject him before my Father in heaven.\u201d(Matt. 10:32,33). Jesus also said, \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow in my steps is not fit to be my disciple.\u201d (Matt. 10:38). Happy are those who find protection in the Rock, Jesus Christ!\n\n== THE TEMPLE OF GOD[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The Temple of God P5.jpg|alt=The temple of God|center|thumb|The temple of God]]\n'''This picture shows the clean and purified heart of the sinner who has been saved by God\u2019s grace and mercy.'''\n\nThe heart has now become a true temple of God. Sin has been driven out. Instead of the various animals controlled by Satan, the father of lies, we see the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, living in the heart. Instead of being the breeding place of sin, the heart has become a beautiful, fruit-bearing tree or garden, bearing the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, humility, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self control and others which are acceptable and pleasing to God and man (Gal. 5:22-23). He has now become a fruit- bearing branch of the real vine \u2013 our Lord Jesus Christ. The secret of this fruit-bearing is that he remains united with Christ, and Christ and His words remain in him (John 15:1-10).\n\n\u201cHappy are the pure in heart; they will see God!\u201d (Matt.5:8). King David knew that the greatest battle was taking place in his own heart and recognizing his deep spiritual need, prayed, \u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10). Nobody is able to purify his own heart, or to create a clean heart, unless through truly repenting he comes to God as David did, asking God to create a pure heart in him.\n\n== THE TEMPTED AND DEVIDED HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The tempted and devided heart P6.jpg|alt=The tempted and divided heart|center|thumb|The tempted and divided heart]]\n'''This is the sad picture of one who has fallen back into his old ways. One eye is starting to close, showing that he is beginning to grow cold and sleepy in his relationship with God.'''\n\nThe light inside has grown dim, and the pictures in his heart, showing his readiness to suffer with Christ, have fallen and are no longer upright. He is surrounded by temptations to which he is slowly giving in instead of resisting them. Instead of listening to God\u2019s voice he now begins to listen to the devil\u2019s cunning suggestions and false promises. Although he may still be a church-goer, hiding his desires for the things of the world under a form of religion, the love for God has grown cold in his heart. Obey the warnings of our Lord Jesus when He says, \u201cKeep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d (Matt. 26:41). \u201cWhoever thinks he is standing firm had better be careful that he does not fall.\u201d (1Cor.10:12). We must put on all the armour that God gives us, so that we will be able to stand up against the devil\u2019s evil tricks. (Eph. 6:11-18).\n\n== THE FALLEN OR STUBBORN HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The fallen or stubborn heart P7.jpg|alt=The fallen or stubborn heart|center|thumb|The fallen or stubborn heart]]\n'''This picture reveals the condition of the person who has fallen completely into his old ways again, in spite of what God did for him.'''\n\nAfter this person was once in God\u2019s light and had tasted heaven\u2019s gift and received his share of the Holy Spirit, he has abandoned his faith. (Heb. 6:4). Jesus Himself described the backsliders\u2019 condition when He said, \u201cWhen an evil spirit goes out of a person, it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest. If it can\u2019t find one, it says to itself, \u2018I will go back to my house.\u2019 So it goes back and finds the house clean and tidy. Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself, and they come and live there. So when it is all over, that person is in a worse state than he was at the beginning.\u201d (Luke 11:24-26).\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them shows that the proverbs are true; \u2018A dog goes back to what it has vomited\u2019 and \u2018A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud.\u2019 \u201d (2 Peter 2:22). If you continue to be stubborn, and love darkness rather than light, there is no hope, no help, because you are choosing death instead of life \u2013 \u201csin pays its wage - death.\u201d (Rom. 6:23).\n\n== THE SINNERS JUDGEMENT[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners judgement P8.jpg|alt=The sinners judgement|center|thumb|The sinners judgement]]\n'''Here we find the stubborn sinner who did not want to open his heart to God again.'''\n\nThe false pleasures of sin have disappeared, and the awful reality of the high and dreadful cost of sin now has to be faced. The agonies of hell are becoming real to him. Although he now longs to pray, he finds he cannot communicate with God whose love he has rejected for so long. His friends are afraid to stand at his bedside, and their empty words of comfort cannot help him now. His riches can neither lengthen his life, nor save his soul, nor reduce the agony of his soul.\n\nHe begins to realise that \u201cit is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\u201d (Heb. 10:31). He had hoped to give his life to God when it suited him. This dying sinner who rejected the forgiveness and love of God during his lifetime now has to hear the voice of his Judge, the Saviour whom he rejected saying: \u201cAway from me, you that are under God\u2019s curse! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels!\u201d (Matt. 25:41).\n\n\u201cEveryone must die once, and after that be judged by God.\u201d (Heb. 9:27).\n\n== THE VICTORIOUS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The victorious heart P9.jpg|alt=The victorious heart|center|thumb|The victorious heart]]\n'''This picture shows a Christian who remains faithful and wins the victory over painful tests and temptations.'''\n\nWhile he is tempted on all sides, he remains firm and holds out to the end, being victorious through Jesus Christ. He has not only entered the Christian race, but he is continuing in it, running with determination, \u201ckeeping his eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end.\u201d (Heb. 12:1,2). He remembers the words of Jesus. \u201cHappy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:11,12).\n\nThis person is ready to meet God, and is like a tree that grows beside a stream; that bears fruit at the right time (Ps. 1:3); like a branch of the real vine, bearing much fruit. He does not know the fear of death, for the perfect love of God, which he has received through the Holy Spirit, has filled his heart.\n\n== THE GLORIOUS HOMEGOING[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The glorious homegoing P10.jpg|alt=The glorious homegoing|center|thumb|The glorious homegoing]]\n'''Jesus said, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.

He will not be judged, but has already passed from death to life.\u201d (John 5:24). Death holds neither fear nor punishment for the Christian. \u201cDeath is destroyed; victory is complete! Where death is your victory? Where death is your power to hurt?\u2026 Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\u201d(1 Cor. 15:54-57)\n\nA person who has lived and walked with God is not afraid of death. When the time comes for him to die, he will go gladly, as the Apostle Paul puts it, \u201cI want very much to leave this life and to be with Christ, which is a far better thing.\u201d (Phil. 1:23)\n\n\u201cThen I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u2018Write this: Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!\u2019 \u2018Yes indeed!\u2019 answers the Spirit. \u2018They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them.\u201d (Rev. 14:13).\n\n== Prayer[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n''\u201cHe watches every step men take.

Whether you are a heathen or a Christian, one who does not believe in [[Christ]] or a backslider, you will see yourself as [[God]] sees you. \u201cMan looks at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7). God sees us as we really are.\n\n[[Satan]] is the father of all lies. He is the prince of darkness and god of this world, who disguises himself as an angel of light to lead men and women the wrong way. In these days, as in times past, there are many false [[apostles]] who disguise themselves, pretending to be apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed (disguised) into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:13,14). Satan, the god of this world, keeps people in the dark so that they cannot see that God loves them or that Jesus died to save them (2 Cor. 4:4). All sinners and those who do not believe are spiritually dead and blind concerning God. They are ruled by the evil of this world (Eph. 2:1-2). Unless their eyes are opened in some way to their lost condition, they are heading for eternal destruction. The person who says, \u201cI have never sinned\u201d is deceiving himself. For \u201cThe Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the devil had done.\u201d (1 John 3:8). \u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come near to God, and He will come near to you.\u201d (James 4:7,8)\n\nAs you read this book and study its pictures, you will be able to see your own heart. Allow God\u2019s searchlight to show you the condition of your heart. Acknowledge your sins and do not deny their existence, for God\u2019s Word tells us that \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. But if we confess our sins to God, He will keep His promise and do what is right: He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.\u201d (1 John 1:1-10). \u201cThe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin\u201d.\n\nYou are ruled either by Satan or by God; you are a slave to sin or a servant of God. If sin controls your life, do not deny it, but cry out to God. He will set you free through Jesus Christ who came to this world to save sinners, to break the power of Satan and sin over us. He is our Saviour. You are in the presence of a holy God who knows all the secrets, the hidden thoughts and actions of your life. It is impossible to hide yourself and actions from God, for \u201cGod made our ears \u2013 can\u2019t He hear? He made our eyes \u2013 can\u2019t He see?\u201d (Ps. 94:9).\n\nThe Lord keeps close watch over the whole world to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to Him.\u201d (2 Chron.16:9).\n\nHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God.\u201d (Job 34:21,22).\n\nBut [[Jesus]] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all.\u201d (John 2:24).\n\nTherefore \u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit.\u201d (Ps. 32:1-2).\n\n== THE SINNERS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners heart P1.jpg|alt=This picture shows the heart of a wordly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.|thumb|The Sinners Heart]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a worldly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.'''\nBelow the head in this picture, the heart of man can be seen occupied by various animals which speak of the many different sins in the human heart, as the heart is the centre and breeding place of our sins. God tells us by the mouth of His prophet Jeremiah, that \u201cNobody can understand the human heart. There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed.\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nJesus Himself confirms this by saying, \u201cFor from the inside, from a person\u2019s heart, come the evil ideas which lead him to do immoral things; to rob, kill, commit adultery, be greedy, and do all sorts of evil things; deceit, indecency, jealousy, slander, pride, and folly \u2013 all these evil things come from inside a person and make him unclean\u201d (Mark 7:21-23)\n\nThe bleary, red eyes speak of drunkenness.  \u201cDon\u2019t let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, though it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. The next morning you will feel as if you have been bitten by a poisonous snake.\u201d (Proverbs 23:31-32)\n\nDifferent animals and signs used in the pictures reminds us of the following sins:\n\n=== The [[Peacock]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nWhile the beauty of the peacock is admired by everybody, here in the heart of man, it speaks of the sin of pride.\n\n=== The [[goat]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe goat represents bodily desires, immorality, adultery.\n\n=== The [[pig]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe pig speaks of the sins of drunkenness and gluttony. It is a dirty animal eagerly swallowing up everything in its way, clean or dirty, and in the same way a sinful heart devours every immoral suggestion, expression, picture, literature, etc.\n\n=== The [[tortoise]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe tortoise speaks of laziness, sluggishness to obey and witchcraft. \u201cA lazy man who refuses to work is only killing himself, all he does is think about what he would like to have.\u201d  (Prov. 21:25,26).\n\n=== The [[leopard]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe leopard is a very savage and cruel beast. Hatred, anger and a bad temper often rule the heart of man and many times lead to murder. \u201cKeep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbour a grudge.\u201d (Eccl. 7:9)\n\n=== The [[snake]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe snake represents the devil who is very deceitful, clever and misleading, and does everything possible to destroy our relationship with God.\n\n=== The [[frog]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe frog speaks here of the sins of greediness and the love of money which is the source of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Certain frogs in the Congo have been seen eating ants by the hundreds until they burst and died.\n\n=== [[Satan]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nSatan is the father of all lies, and is the one who persuades us to sin, and then he rules our hearts.\n\n=== The [[star]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe star speaks of the conscience in the heart of every man. Even in the bad heart the conscience is still there, but is being ignored, and cannot therefore help this person.\n\n=== The eye of [[God]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe eye of God sees everything that goes on in the heart. Nothing can be hidden from His flaming eye, and therefore He knows and sees all the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart. Whether you do your evil deeds in the darkest night, in the thickest forest, in the deepest ditch or wherever it may be, God sees it.\n\n=== The little tongues of fire[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe little tongues of fire round about the heart show the love of God surrounding the sinful heart. While God hates sin He loves man and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he should turn away from his sins and live. Jesus came to save sinners. There is great joy in heaven over one sinner that repents (Luke 15:7). The little tongues also speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d (John 1:29).\n\n=== The [[angel]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe angel represents the Word of God. God wants to speak to those who have been deceived and are carrying heavy loads of sin, so that they may turn from their sinful ways and let the light and love of God come into their hearts.\n\n=== The [[dove]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe dove is a sign of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who reveals the truth about God, about sin and what is right, and about God\u2019s judgement (John 15:26).\n\n== THE HEART CONVINCED OF SIN[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The heart convinced of sin P2.jpg|alt=The Heart convinced of sin|center|thumb|The Heart convinced of sin]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a man who is sorry for his sins and is beginning to look for God.'''\n\nHere we see the sinner beginning to take notice of the message of God and to open his heart to the love of God. The Holy Spirit begins to shine into the dark and sinful heart. The light of God comes into his heart to drive all darkness away. When God\u2019s light comes in, darkness has to go. Sin, described here by all the various animals, has to go. Therefore, dear reader, allow Jesus, the Light of the world, to come into your heart, and darkness and the evil actions of darkness must leave the heart, as shown in this picture.\n\nJesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.\u201d (John 8:12).\n\nYour heart is intended to be God\u2019s house, God\u2019s temple. He wants to live in it, make it beautiful, fill it with light, love and joy. Jesus not only came to forgive us our sins, but He came to deliver us and set us free from the power and domination of sin.\n\n\u201cIf the Son ([[Jesus]]) sets you free, then you will be really free.\u201d (John 8:36).\n\n== THE REPENTING HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The repenting heart P3.jpg|alt=The repenting heart|center|thumb|The repenting heart]]\n'''This picture shows us the heart of someone who is really serious about finding the right relationship with God.'''\n\nAs he sees the cross which the angel, the Word of God, shows to him, it breaks his now sorry heart, and he is moved with deep, heartfelt regret and sorrow over his many sins. As he sees the great love of God expressed in Christ Jesus, this love melts his heart, especially as he begins to realise that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to take away his many sins, as He was willing to die in his place on the cross.\n\nThe love and peace of God enter his heart as he begins to realise that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin.\u201d (1 John 1:7).\n\n\u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10).\n\nAgain God\u2019s Word says, \u201cI am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.\u201d (Isa. 66:2).\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes the words of Jesus clear to him, \u201cCourage, my son (daughter)! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d (Matt. 9:2).\n\n== DYING WITH CHRIST[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:Dying with Christ P4.jpg|alt=Dying with Christ|center|thumb|Dying with Christ]]\n'''This picture speaks of a Christian who has found perfect peace and eternal salvation through the death of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.'''\n\nThis person boasts in nothing else except \u201conly about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of His cross the world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world.\u201d (Gal. 6:14). Jesus died on the cross so that we too, might \u201cdie to sin and live for righteousness\u201d (1 Peter 2:24); a Christian dead to the world. We are commanded to \u201clet the Spirit direct our lives, and we will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.\u201d (Gal. 5:16,25).\n\nDo you declare openly that you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, by what you say and do? Or are you ashamed to let others know? Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone declares publicly that he belongs to me, I will do the same for him before my Father in heaven. But if anyone rejects me publicly, I will reject him before my Father in heaven.\u201d(Matt. 10:32,33). Jesus also said, \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow in my steps is not fit to be my disciple.\u201d (Matt. 10:38). Happy are those who find protection in the Rock, Jesus Christ!\n\n== THE TEMPLE OF GOD[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The Temple of God P5.jpg|alt=The temple of God|center|thumb|The temple of God]]\n'''This picture shows the clean and purified heart of the sinner who has been saved by God\u2019s grace and mercy.'''\n\nThe heart has now become a true temple of God. Sin has been driven out. Instead of the various animals controlled by Satan, the father of lies, we see the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, living in the heart. Instead of being the breeding place of sin, the heart has become a beautiful, fruit-bearing tree or garden, bearing the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, humility, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self control and others which are acceptable and pleasing to God and man (Gal. 5:22-23). He has now become a fruit- bearing branch of the real vine \u2013 our Lord Jesus Christ. The secret of this fruit-bearing is that he remains united with Christ, and Christ and His words remain in him (John 15:1-10).\n\n\u201cHappy are the pure in heart; they will see God!\u201d (Matt.5:8). King David knew that the greatest battle was taking place in his own heart and recognizing his deep spiritual need, prayed, \u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10). Nobody is able to purify his own heart, or to create a clean heart, unless through truly repenting he comes to God as David did, asking God to create a pure heart in him.\n\n== THE TEMPTED AND DEVIDED HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The tempted and devided heart P6.jpg|alt=The tempted and divided heart|center|thumb|The tempted and divided heart]]\n'''This is the sad picture of one who has fallen back into his old ways. One eye is starting to close, showing that he is beginning to grow cold and sleepy in his relationship with God.'''\n\nThe light inside has grown dim, and the pictures in his heart, showing his readiness to suffer with Christ, have fallen and are no longer upright. He is surrounded by temptations to which he is slowly giving in instead of resisting them. Instead of listening to God\u2019s voice he now begins to listen to the devil\u2019s cunning suggestions and false promises. Although he may still be a church-goer, hiding his desires for the things of the world under a form of religion, the love for God has grown cold in his heart. Obey the warnings of our Lord Jesus when He says, \u201cKeep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d (Matt. 26:41). \u201cWhoever thinks he is standing firm had better be careful that he does not fall.\u201d (1Cor.10:12). We must put on all the armour that God gives us, so that we will be able to stand up against the devil\u2019s evil tricks. (Eph. 6:11-18).\n\n== THE FALLEN OR STUBBORN HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The fallen or stubborn heart P7.jpg|alt=The fallen or stubborn heart|center|thumb|The fallen or stubborn heart]]\n'''This picture reveals the condition of the person who has fallen completely into his old ways again, in spite of what God did for him.'''\n\nAfter this person was once in God\u2019s light and had tasted heaven\u2019s gift and received his share of the Holy Spirit, he has abandoned his faith. (Heb. 6:4). Jesus Himself described the backsliders\u2019 condition when He said, \u201cWhen an evil spirit goes out of a person, it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest. If it can\u2019t find one, it says to itself, \u2018I will go back to my house.\u2019 So it goes back and finds the house clean and tidy. Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself, and they come and live there. So when it is all over, that person is in a worse state than he was at the beginning.\u201d (Luke 11:24-26).\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them shows that the proverbs are true; \u2018A dog goes back to what it has vomited\u2019 and \u2018A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud.\u2019 \u201d (2 Peter 2:22). If you continue to be stubborn, and love darkness rather than light, there is no hope, no help, because you are choosing death instead of life \u2013 \u201csin pays its wage - death.\u201d (Rom. 6:23).\n\n== THE SINNERS JUDGEMENT[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners judgement P8.jpg|alt=The sinners judgement|center|thumb|The sinners judgement]]\n'''Here we find the stubborn sinner who did not want to open his heart to God again.'''\n\nThe false pleasures of sin have disappeared, and the awful reality of the high and dreadful cost of sin now has to be faced. The agonies of hell are becoming real to him. Although he now longs to pray, he finds he cannot communicate with God whose love he has rejected for so long. His friends are afraid to stand at his bedside, and their empty words of comfort cannot help him now. His riches can neither lengthen his life, nor save his soul, nor reduce the agony of his soul.\n\nHe begins to realise that \u201cit is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\u201d (Heb. 10:31). He had hoped to give his life to God when it suited him. This dying sinner who rejected the forgiveness and love of God during his lifetime now has to hear the voice of his Judge, the Saviour whom he rejected saying: \u201cAway from me, you that are under God\u2019s curse! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels!\u201d (Matt. 25:41).\n\n\u201cEveryone must die once, and after that be judged by God.\u201d (Heb. 9:27).\n\n== THE VICTORIOUS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The victorious heart P9.jpg|alt=The victorious heart|center|thumb|The victorious heart]]\n'''This picture shows a Christian who remains faithful and wins the victory over painful tests and temptations.'''\n\nWhile he is tempted on all sides, he remains firm and holds out to the end, being victorious through Jesus Christ. He has not only entered the Christian race, but he is continuing in it, running with determination, \u201ckeeping his eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end.\u201d (Heb. 12:1,2). He remembers the words of Jesus. \u201cHappy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:11,12).\n\nThis person is ready to meet God, and is like a tree that grows beside a stream; that bears fruit at the right time (Ps. 1:3); like a branch of the real vine, bearing much fruit. He does not know the fear of death, for the perfect love of God, which he has received through the Holy Spirit, has filled his heart.\n\n== THE GLORIOUS HOMEGOING[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The glorious homegoing P10.jpg|alt=The glorious homegoing|center|thumb|The glorious homegoing]]\n'''Jesus said, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.

He will not be judged, but has already passed from death to life.\u201d (John 5:24). Death holds neither fear nor punishment for the Christian. \u201cDeath is destroyed; victory is complete! Where death is your victory? Where death is your power to hurt?\u2026 Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\u201d(1 Cor. 15:54-57)\n\nA person who has lived and walked with God is not afraid of death. When the time comes for him to die, he will go gladly, as the Apostle Paul puts it, \u201cI want very much to leave this life and to be with Christ, which is a far better thing.\u201d (Phil. 1:23)\n\n\u201cThen I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u2018Write this: Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!\u2019 \u2018Yes indeed!\u2019 answers the Spirit. \u2018They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them.\u201d (Rev. 14:13).\n\n== Prayer[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n''\u201cHe watches every step men take.

The Latin word was adopted in [[Old English]] as ''[[:wikt:m\u00e6sse#Old English|m\u00e6sse]]'' (via a [[Vulgar Latin]] form ''*messa''), and was sometimes glossed as ''sendnes'' (i.e. 'a sending, dismission').<ref>Bosworth-Toller, s.v. ''sendness'' (citing Wright, ''Vocabularies'' vol. 2, 1873), \"m\u00e6sse\" (citing [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham]]).</ref> \nThe Latin term ''missa'' itself was in use by the 6th century.<ref>\nIt is used by [[Caesarius of Arles]] (e.g.'' Regula ad monachos'', PL 67, 1102B ''Omni dominica sex missas facite'').\nBefore this, it occurs singularly in a letter attributed to [[Saint Ambrose]] (d. 397),  ''Ego mansi in munere, missam facere coepi'' (''ep.'' 20.3,  PL 16, 0995A ). F. Probst, ''Liturgie der drei ersten christlichen Jahrhunderte'', 1870, 5f.). \"the fragment in Pseudo-Ambrose, 'De sacramentis' (about 400. Cf. P.L., XVI, 443), and the letter of Pope Innocent I (401-17) to Decentius of Eugubium (P.L., XX, 553). In these documents we see that the Roman Liturgy is said in Latin and has already become in essence the rite we still use.\" (Fortescue 1910).</ref>\nIt is most likely derived from the concluding formula ''[[Ite, missa est]]'' (\"Go;  the dismissal is made\"); ''missa'' here is a [[Late Latin]] substantive corresponding to classical ''missio''.\n\nHistorically, however, there have been other explanations of the noun ''missa'', i.e. as not derived from the formula ''ite, missa est''. Fortescue (1910) cites older, \"fanciful\" etymological explanations, notably a latinization of Hebrew ''[[Matzo|matz\u00e2h]]'' (\u05de\u05b7\u05e6\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4) \"unleavened bread; oblation\", a derivation favoured in the 16th century by [[Reuchlin]] and [[Martin Luther|Luther]], or Greek {{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03cd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} \"initiation\", or even Germanic ''[[:wikt:mese#Etymology 1|mese]]'' \"assembly\".<ref>The Germanic word is likely itself an early loan of Latin ''mensa'' \"table\". \"The origin and first meaning of the word, once much discussed, is not really doubtful.

Nor is it the participle feminine of ''mittere'', with a noun understood (\"oblatio missa ad Deum\", \"congregatio missa\", i.e., ''dimissa'' \u2014 so Diez, \"Etymol. W\u00f6rterbuch der roman.

On other days there are only two. If there are three readings, the first is from the [[Old Testament]] (a term wider than \"[[Hebrew Scriptures]]\", since it includes the [[Deuterocanonical Books]]), or the [[Acts of the Apostles]] during [[Eastertide]]. The first reading is followed by a psalm, recited or sung responsorially.  The second reading is from the [[New Testament]], typically from one of the [[Pauline epistles]]. A Gospel acclamation is then sung as the Book of the Gospels is processed, sometimes with incense and candles, to the ambo. The final reading and high point of the Liturgy of the Word is the proclamation of the [[Gospel]] by the deacon or priest.  On all Sundays and [[Holy Days of Obligation]], and preferably at all Masses, a [[homily]], a [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]] that draws upon some aspect of the readings or the liturgy itself, is then given.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 66</ref> Finally, the [[Nicene Creed]] or, especially from [[Easter]] to [[Pentecost]], the [[Apostles' Creed]] is professed on Sundays and solemnities,<ref>GIRM, paragraph 68</ref> and it is desirable that the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful should usually follow.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 69</ref> The designation \"of the faithful\" comes from when [[catechumens]] did not remain for this prayer or for what follows.\n\n===Liturgy of the Eucharist===\n[[File:Elevation of the Host.jpg|thumb|The [[Elevation (liturgy)|Elevation of the host]] began in the 14th century to show people the consecrated host.|alt=]]\n\nThe Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the preparation of the altar and gifts,<ref>GIRM, paragraph 73</ref> while the collection may be taken.

A variable prayer of thanksgiving follows, concluding with the [[Sanctus]] acclamation. The [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]], or more properly \"Eucharistic Prayer\", follows, The oldest of the anaphoras of the Roman Rite, fixed since the [[Council of Trent]], is called the [[Roman Canon]], with central elements dating to the fourth century. With the liturgical renewal following the [[Second Vatican Council]], numerous other Eucharistic prayers have been composed, including four for children's Masses. Central to the Eucharist is the [[Words of Institution|Institution Narrative]], recalling the words and actions of Jesus at his [[Last Supper]], which he told his disciples to do in remembrance of him.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|22:19}}; {{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:24-25}}</ref> Then the congregation [[Memorial Acclamation|acclaims]] its belief in Christ's conquest over death, and their hope of eternal life.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 151</ref> Since the early church an essential part of the Eucharistic prayer has been the [[epiclesis|epiclesis]], the calling down of the [[Holy Spirit]] to sanctify our offering.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 79c</ref> The priest concludes with a [[doxology]] in praise of God's work, at which the people give their [[Amen]] to the whole Eucharistic prayer.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.ccwatershed.org/media/pdfs/14/01/25/13-21-48_0.pdf|title=Mass of the Roman Rite|last=Jungmann, SJ|first=Josef|publisher=|year=1948|isbn=|location=|pages=101-259}}</ref>\n\n===Communion rite===<!-- There are links to this heading -->\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B10582.jpg|thumb|left|A priest administers Communion during Mass in a Dutch field in the front line, October 1944]]\n\nAll together recite or sing the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\" (\"Pater Noster\" or \"Our Father\").

The [[sign of peace]] is exchanged and then the \"[[Lamb of God (liturgy)|Lamb of God]]\" (\"Agnus Dei\" in Latin) litany is sung or recited, while the priest breaks the host and places a piece in the main chalice; this is known as the rite of fraction and commingling.\n\n[[File:Joan Ferrer i Mir\u00f3- Sortida de missa- 169.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|''Out of Mass'' (1893), oil on canvas by Joan Ferrer Mir\u00f3]]\n\nThe priest then displays the consecrated elements to the congregation, saying: \"Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.

More frequently, the term used is either ''Holy Communion'', ''Holy Eucharist'', or the ''Lord's Supper''.

And Blessed be his kingdom, now and forever. Amen\").<ref>Book of Common Prayer p. 355 Holy Eucharist Rite II</ref> Then the Kyrie and a general confession and absolution follow. On Sundays outside Advent and Lent and on major festivals, the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] is sung or said. The entrance rite then concludes with the [[collect]] of the day.\n* '''Proclaiming and Hearing the Word''': Usually two to three readings of Scripture, one of which is always from the [[Gospel]]s, plus a [[psalm]] (or portion thereof) or [[canticle]] between the lessons. This is followed by a [[sermon]] or [[homily]]; the recitation of one of the Creeds, viz., the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] or [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]], is done on Sundays and feasts.\n* '''The Prayers of the People''': Quite varied in their form.\n* '''The Peace''': The people stand and greet one another and exchange signs of God's peace in the name of the Lord. It functions as a bridge between the prayers, lessons, sermon and creeds to the Communion part of the Eucharist.\n*'''The Celebration of the Eucharist''': The gifts of bread and wine are brought up, along with other gifts (such as money or food for a food bank, etc.), and an [[offertory]] prayer is recited. Following this, a [[Eucharistic Prayer]] (called \"The Great Thanksgiving\") is offered. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the [[Sursum Corda]]), a preface, the [[sanctus]] and [[Sanctus Benedictus|benedictus]], the Words of Institution, the Anamnesis, an [[Epiclesis]], a petition for salvation, and a Doxology. The Lord's Prayer precedes the [[Fraction (religion)|fraction]] (the breaking of the bread), followed by the [[Prayer of Humble Access]] or the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]] and the distribution of the sacred elements (the bread and wine).\n*'''Dismissal''': There is a post-Communion prayer, which is a general prayer of thanksgiving. The service concludes with a Trinitarian blessing and the dismissal.\n\nThe liturgy is divided into two main parts: The Liturgy of the Word (Gathering, Proclaiming and Hearing the Word, Prayers of the People) and the Liturgy of the Eucharist (together with the Dismissal), but the entire liturgy itself is also properly referred to as the Holy Eucharist. The sequence of the liturgy is almost identical to the [[Roman Rite]], except the Confession of Sin ends the Liturgy of the Word in the Anglican rites in North America, while in the Roman Rite (when used) and in Anglican rites in many jurisdictions the Confession is near the beginning of the service.\n\n===Special Masses===\nThe Anglican tradition includes separate rites for Nuptial Masses, Funeral Masses, and votive Masses. The Eucharist is an integral part of many other sacramental services, including [[ordination]] and [[Confirmation]].\n\n===Ceremonial===\n{{See also|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}\n\nSome [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] parishes use Anglican versions of the Tridentine Missal, such as the ''[[English Missal]]'', ''[[The Anglican Missal]]'', or the ''[[Anglican Missal#The American Missal|American Missal]]'', for the celebration of Mass, all of which are intended primarily for the celebration of the Eucharist, or use the order for the Eucharist in ''[[Common Worship]]'' arranged according to the traditional structure and often with interpolations from the Roman Rite. In the [[Episcopal Church USA]], a traditional-language, Anglo-Catholic adaptation of the 1979 ''Book of Common Prayer'' has been published (''An Anglican Service Book'').\n\nAll of these books contain such features as meditations for the presiding celebrant(s) during the liturgy, and other material such as the rite for the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, [[Proper (liturgy)|proper]]s for special feast days, and instructions for proper ceremonial order. These books are used as a more expansively [[Catholicism|Catholic]] context in which to celebrate the liturgical use found in the Book of Common Prayer and related liturgical books. In England supplementary liturgical texts for the proper celebration of Festivals, Feast days and the seasons is provided in ''[[Common Worship; Times and Seasons]]'' (2013), ''[[ Festivals (Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England)]]'' (2008) and ''[[Common Worship: Holy Week and Easter]]'' (2011).\n\n\nThese are often supplemented in Anglo-Catholic parishes by books specifying ceremonial actions, such as ''A Priest's Handbook'' by Dennis G. Michno, ''Ceremonies of the Eucharist'' by Howard E. Galley, ''[[s:Low Mass Ceremonial (Burnett)|Low Mass Ceremonial]]'' by C.P.A. Burnett, and ''Ritual Notes'' by E.C.R. Lamburn. Other guides to ceremonial include the [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]], ''Ceremonies of the Modern Roman Rite'' (Peter Elliott), ''Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described'' (Adrian Fortescue), and ''[[The Parson's Handbook]]'' ([[Percy Dearmer]]). In Evangelical Anglican parishes, the rubrics detailed in the ''Book of Common Prayer'' are sometimes considered normative.\n\n==Lutheranism==\n[[File:Elca eucharistic elevation.jpg|thumb|A Lutheran priest [[Elevation (liturgy)|elevates]] the [[Chalice#Christian|chalice]] in the celebration of the Holy Mass.]]\n{{Main|Divine Service (Lutheran)}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lutheran elevation.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A Lutheran priest elevating the host.]] -->\nIn the [[Book of Concord]], Article XXIV (\"Of the Mass\") of the [[Augsburg Confession]] (1530) begins thus: <blockquote>\"Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for the Mass is retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence.  We do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it... we keep the traditional liturgical form... In our churches Mass is celebrated every Sunday and on other holy days, when the sacrament is offered to those who wish for it after they have been examined and absolved (Article XXIV)\".</blockquote>\n\n[[Martin Luther]] rejected parts of the Roman Rite Catholic Mass, specifically the [[Canon of the Mass]], which, as he argued, did not conform with {{bibleverse||Hebrews|7:27}}. That verse contrasts the Old Testament priests, who needed to make a sacrifice for sins on a regular basis, with the single priest Christ, who offers his body only once as a sacrifice. The theme is carried out also in {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Heb|9:28}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Heb|10:10}}. Luther composed as a replacement a revised Latin-language rite, ''[[Formula missae]]'' in 1523 and the vernacular [[Deutsche Messe]] in 1526.\n\nAs such, historically, the Lutheran Church has stated that the Lutheran Mass is \"the only Mass founded in the Scriptures of God, in accordance with the plain and incontestable institution of the Saviour.\"<ref name=Lutheran/><ref>{{cite book|url= http://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&id=581|title= Denominational Differences \u2013Other Denominations|publisher= [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]|quote= Differences remain about both the number and the nature of the sacraments. Catholics speak of seven sacraments, while Lutherans tend to speak of only two (or three). More important than number is how the sacraments are understood. To take a single example, Lutherans believe that in the Sacrament of the Altar (Communion) Christ's body and blood are truly present in the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper, but they do not accept the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which teaches that the elements are permanently changed from the substances of bread and wine to the substances of body and blood. Transubstantiation is rejected for several reasons: It is a philosophical explanation for a work of Christ's almighty Word which we can only believe, not explain. In seeking to explain a mystery it changes the plain and simple meanings of God's Word (Scripture refers to the elements as both bread and wine and body and blood, 1 Cor 11:26-27).}}</ref>\n\n[[Scandinavia]]n, [[Finns|Finnish]], and some [[English speaking]] [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], use the term \"Mass\" for their Eucharistic service,<ref>{{cite book|last= Hope|first= Nicholas|title= German and Scandinavian Protestantism 1700 to 1918|year= 1995|publisher= Oxford University Press, Inc.|isbn= 0-19-826994-3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DFL2GNDHPdYC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate= November 19, 2011|page= 18}}; see also [[Deutsche Messe]]</ref> but in most German and English-speaking churches, the terms \"Divine Service\", \"Holy Communion, or \"the Holy Eucharist\" are used.\n\nThe celebration of the Mass in Lutheran churches follows a similar pattern to other traditions, starting with public confession ([[Confiteor]]) by all and a [[Declaration of Grace]] said by the priest or pastor.  There follow the ''[[Introit]]'', ''[[Kyrie]]'', ''[[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]'', [[collect]], the readings with an [[alleluia]] (alleluia is not said during [[Lent]]), [[homily]] (or sermon) and recitation of the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Service of the Eucharist includes the [[General intercessions]], [[Preface]], [[Sanctus]] and [[Eucharistic Prayer]], [[elevation]] of the host and chalice and invitation to the Eucharist. The [[Agnus Dei]] is chanted while the clergy and assistants first commune, followed by lay communicants. [[Postcommunion]] prayers and the final blessing by the priest ends the Mass. A Catholic or Anglican of the Anglo-Catholic party would find its elements familiar, in particular the use of the sign of the cross, kneeling for prayer and the Eucharistic Prayer, bowing to the processional crucifix, kissing the altar, incense (among some), chanting, and vestments.\n\nLutheran churches often celebrate the Eucharist each Sunday, if not at every worship service. This aligns with Luther's preference and the Lutheran confessions.<ref>{{cite web|last= Preus|first= Klemet|title= Communion Every Sunday: Why?|url= http://storage.cloversites.com/gloryofchrist/documents/COMMUNION%20EVERY%20SUNDAY.htm|accessdate= November 18, 2011}}</ref>  Also, eucharistic ministers take the sacramental elements to the sick in hospitals and nursing homes.

The Latin word was adopted in [[Old English]] as ''[[:wikt:m\u00e6sse#Old English|m\u00e6sse]]'' (via a [[Vulgar Latin]] form ''*messa''), and was sometimes glossed as ''sendnes'' (i.e. 'a sending, dismission').<ref>Bosworth-Toller, s.v. ''sendness'' (citing Wright, ''Vocabularies'' vol. 2, 1873), \"m\u00e6sse\" (citing [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham]]).</ref> \nThe Latin term ''missa'' itself was in use by the 6th century.<ref>\nIt is used by [[Caesarius of Arles]] (e.g.'' Regula ad monachos'', PL 67, 1102B ''Omni dominica sex missas facite'').\nBefore this, it occurs singularly in a letter attributed to [[Saint Ambrose]] (d. 397),  ''Ego mansi in munere, missam facere coepi'' (''ep.'' 20.3,  PL 16, 0995A ). F. Probst, ''Liturgie der drei ersten christlichen Jahrhunderte'', 1870, 5f.). \"the fragment in Pseudo-Ambrose, 'De sacramentis' (about 400. Cf. P.L., XVI, 443), and the letter of Pope Innocent I (401-17) to Decentius of Eugubium (P.L., XX, 553). In these documents we see that the Roman Liturgy is said in Latin and has already become in essence the rite we still use.\" (Fortescue 1910).</ref>\nIt is most likely derived from the concluding formula ''[[Ite, missa est]]'' (\"Go;  the dismissal is made\"); ''missa'' here is a [[Late Latin]] substantive corresponding to classical ''missio''.\n\nHistorically, however, there have been other explanations of the noun ''missa'', i.e. as not derived from the formula ''ite, missa est''. Fortescue (1910) cites older, \"fanciful\" etymological explanations, notably a latinization of Hebrew ''[[Matzo|matz\u00e2h]]'' (\u05de\u05b7\u05e6\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4) \"unleavened bread; oblation\", a derivation favoured in the 16th century by [[Reuchlin]] and [[Martin Luther|Luther]], or Greek {{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03cd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} \"initiation\", or even Germanic ''[[:wikt:mese#Etymology 1|mese]]'' \"assembly\".<ref>The Germanic word is likely itself an early loan of Latin ''mensa'' \"table\". \"The origin and first meaning of the word, once much discussed, is not really doubtful. We may dismiss at once such fanciful explanations as that ''missa'' is the Hebrew ''missah'' (\"oblation\" \u2014 so Reuchlin and Luther), or the Greek ''myesis'' (\"initiation\"), or the German ''Mess'' (\"assembly\", \"market\"). Nor is it the participle feminine of ''mittere'', with a noun understood (\"oblatio missa ad Deum\", \"congregatio missa\", i.e., ''dimissa'' \u2014 so Diez, \"Etymol. W\u00f6rterbuch der roman.

On other days there are only two. If there are three readings, the first is from the [[Old Testament]] (a term wider than \"[[Hebrew Scriptures]]\", since it includes the [[Deuterocanonical Books]]), or the [[Acts of the Apostles]] during [[Eastertide]]. The first reading is followed by a psalm, recited or sung responsorially.  The second reading is from the [[New Testament]], typically from one of the [[Pauline epistles]]. A Gospel acclamation is then sung as the Book of the Gospels is processed, sometimes with incense and candles, to the ambo. The final reading and high point of the Liturgy of the Word is the proclamation of the [[Gospel]] by the deacon or priest.  On all Sundays and [[Holy Days of Obligation]], and preferably at all Masses, a [[homily]], a [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]] that draws upon some aspect of the readings or the liturgy itself, is then given.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 66</ref> Finally, the [[Nicene Creed]] or, especially from [[Easter]] to [[Pentecost]], the [[Apostles' Creed]] is professed on Sundays and solemnities,<ref>GIRM, paragraph 68</ref> and it is desirable that the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful should usually follow.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 69</ref> The designation \"of the faithful\" comes from when [[catechumens]] did not remain for this prayer or for what follows.\n\n===Liturgy of the Eucharist===\n[[File:Elevation of the Host.jpg|thumb|The [[Elevation (liturgy)|Elevation of the host]] began in the 14th century to show people the consecrated host.|alt=]]\n\nThe Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the preparation of the altar and gifts,<ref>GIRM, paragraph 73</ref> while the collection may be taken. This concludes with the priest saying: \"Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\" The congregation stands and responds: \"May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and glory of His name, for our good, and the good of all His holy Church.\" The priest then pronounces the variable prayer over the gifts.\n\nThen in dialogue with the faithful the priest brings to mind the meaning of \"eucharist\", to give thanks to God. A variable prayer of thanksgiving follows, concluding with the [[Sanctus]] acclamation.

Most parishes use the \"Divine Liturgy of St. Tikhon\" which is a revision of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, or \"the Divine Liturgy of St. Gregory\" which is derived from the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine form of the Roman Rite Mass]]. These rubrics have been revised to reflect the doctrine and dogmas of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Therefore, the [[filioque]] clause has been removed, a fuller [[epiclesis]] has been added, and use of leavened bread has been introduced.<ref>[http://www.antiochian.org/western-rite/ordinary-canon-mass-rite-st-gregory Ordinary and Canon of the Mass According to the Rite of St. Gregory, Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America]</ref>\n\n===Divine Liturgy of St. Gregory===\n{{col-begin|width=96%}}{{col-break|width=32%}}    \t\n* The Preparation for Mass\n* Confiteor\n* Kyrie Eleison\n* Gloria in excelsis deo\n* Collect of the Day\n* Epistle\n* Gradual\n* Alleluia\n* Gospel\n {{col-break|width=32%}}   \n* Sermon\n* Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed\n* Offertory\n* Dialogue\n* Preface\n* Sanctus\n* Canon\n* Lord's Prayer\n {{col-break|width=32%}}   \n* Fraction\n* Agnus Dei\n* Prayers before Communion\n* Holy Communion\n* Prayer of Thanksgiving\n* Dismissal\n* Blessing of the Faithful\n* Last Gospel{{col-end}}\n\n==Anglicanism==\n[[File:WilliamWhiteCommunion.jpg|thumb|right|Bishop [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] celebrating Holy Communion in [[choir dress]] (19th century A.D.)]]\n{{Further|Anglican Eucharistic theology|Book of Common Prayer}}\n\nIn the Anglican tradition, ''Mass'' is one of many terms for the Eucharist. More frequently, the term used is either ''Holy Communion'', ''Holy Eucharist'', or the ''Lord's Supper''. Occasionally the term used in Eastern churches, the ''Divine Liturgy'', is also used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#The%20Holy%20Eucharist| title=The Catechism (1979 Book of Common Prayer): The Holy Eucharist|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref> In the English-speaking Anglican world, the term used often identifies the [[Eucharistic theology]] of the person using it. \"Mass\" is frequently used by [[Anglo-Catholic]]s.\n\n===Structure of the rite===\nThe various Eucharistic liturgies used by national churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] have continuously evolved from the 1549 and 1552 editions of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]],'' both of which owed their form and contents chiefly to the work of [[Thomas Cranmer]], who had rejected the medieval theology of the Mass in about 1547.<ref name=\"MacCulloch 1996 412\">{{cite book| last=MacCulloch| first=Diarmaid| title=Thomas Cranmer| url=https://archive.org/details/thomascranmerlif0000macc| url-access=registration| location=London| publisher=Yale UP|page=[https://archive.org/details/thomascranmerlif0000macc/page/412 412]| year=1996}}</ref> Although the 1549 rite retained the traditional sequence of the Mass, its underlying theology was Cranmer's and the four-day debate in the House of Lords during December 1548 makes it clear that this had already moved far beyond traditional Catholicism.<ref>{{cite book| last=MacCulloch| first=Diarmaid| title=Thomas Cranmer| url=https://archive.org/details/thomascranmerlif0000macc| url-access=registration| location=London| publisher=Yale UP|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thomascranmerlif0000macc/page/404 404]\u20138 & 629| year=1996}}</ref>  In the 1552 revision, this was made clear by the restructuring of the elements of the rite while retaining nearly all the language so that it became, in the words of an Anglo-Catholic liturgical historian (Arthur Couratin) \"a series of communion devotions; disembarrassed of the Mass with which they were temporarily associated in 1548 and 1549\".<ref name=\"MacCulloch 1996 412\"/> Some rites, such as the 1637 Scottish rite and the 1789 rite in the United States, went back to the 1549 model.<ref>{{cite book| last=Neill| first=Stephen| title=Anglicanism| publisher=Penguin| location=London| year=1960|page=152,3}}</ref>  From the time of the [[Elizabethan Settlement]] in 1559 the services allowed for a certain variety of theological interpretation.

And Blessed be his kingdom, now and forever. Amen\").<ref>Book of Common Prayer p. 355 Holy Eucharist Rite II</ref> Then the Kyrie and a general confession and absolution follow. On Sundays outside Advent and Lent and on major festivals, the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] is sung or said. The entrance rite then concludes with the [[collect]] of the day.\n* '''Proclaiming and Hearing the Word''': Usually two to three readings of Scripture, one of which is always from the [[Gospel]]s, plus a [[psalm]] (or portion thereof) or [[canticle]] between the lessons. This is followed by a [[sermon]] or [[homily]]; the recitation of one of the Creeds, viz., the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] or [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]], is done on Sundays and feasts.\n* '''The Prayers of the People''': Quite varied in their form.\n* '''The Peace''': The people stand and greet one another and exchange signs of God's peace in the name of the Lord. It functions as a bridge between the prayers, lessons, sermon and creeds to the Communion part of the Eucharist.\n*'''The Celebration of the Eucharist''': The gifts of bread and wine are brought up, along with other gifts (such as money or food for a food bank, etc.), and an [[offertory]] prayer is recited. Following this, a [[Eucharistic Prayer]] (called \"The Great Thanksgiving\") is offered. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the [[Sursum Corda]]), a preface, the [[sanctus]] and [[Sanctus Benedictus|benedictus]], the Words of Institution, the Anamnesis, an [[Epiclesis]], a petition for salvation, and a Doxology. The Lord's Prayer precedes the [[Fraction (religion)|fraction]] (the breaking of the bread), followed by the [[Prayer of Humble Access]] or the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]] and the distribution of the sacred elements (the bread and wine).\n*'''Dismissal''': There is a post-Communion prayer, which is a general prayer of thanksgiving. The service concludes with a Trinitarian blessing and the dismissal.\n\nThe liturgy is divided into two main parts: The Liturgy of the Word (Gathering, Proclaiming and Hearing the Word, Prayers of the People) and the Liturgy of the Eucharist (together with the Dismissal), but the entire liturgy itself is also properly referred to as the Holy Eucharist. The sequence of the liturgy is almost identical to the [[Roman Rite]], except the Confession of Sin ends the Liturgy of the Word in the Anglican rites in North America, while in the Roman Rite (when used) and in Anglican rites in many jurisdictions the Confession is near the beginning of the service.\n\n===Special Masses===\nThe Anglican tradition includes separate rites for Nuptial Masses, Funeral Masses, and votive Masses. The Eucharist is an integral part of many other sacramental services, including [[ordination]] and [[Confirmation]].\n\n===Ceremonial===\n{{See also|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}\n\nSome [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] parishes use Anglican versions of the Tridentine Missal, such as the ''[[English Missal]]'', ''[[The Anglican Missal]]'', or the ''[[Anglican Missal#The American Missal|American Missal]]'', for the celebration of Mass, all of which are intended primarily for the celebration of the Eucharist, or use the order for the Eucharist in ''[[Common Worship]]'' arranged according to the traditional structure and often with interpolations from the Roman Rite. In the [[Episcopal Church USA]], a traditional-language, Anglo-Catholic adaptation of the 1979 ''Book of Common Prayer'' has been published (''An Anglican Service Book'').\n\nAll of these books contain such features as meditations for the presiding celebrant(s) during the liturgy, and other material such as the rite for the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, [[Proper (liturgy)|proper]]s for special feast days, and instructions for proper ceremonial order. These books are used as a more expansively [[Catholicism|Catholic]] context in which to celebrate the liturgical use found in the Book of Common Prayer and related liturgical books. In England supplementary liturgical texts for the proper celebration of Festivals, Feast days and the seasons is provided in ''[[Common Worship; Times and Seasons]]'' (2013), ''[[ Festivals (Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England)]]'' (2008) and ''[[Common Worship: Holy Week and Easter]]'' (2011).\n\n\nThese are often supplemented in Anglo-Catholic parishes by books specifying ceremonial actions, such as ''A Priest's Handbook'' by Dennis G. Michno, ''Ceremonies of the Eucharist'' by Howard E. Galley, ''[[s:Low Mass Ceremonial (Burnett)|Low Mass Ceremonial]]'' by C.P.A. Burnett, and ''Ritual Notes'' by E.C.R. Lamburn. Other guides to ceremonial include the [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]], ''Ceremonies of the Modern Roman Rite'' (Peter Elliott), ''Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described'' (Adrian Fortescue), and ''[[The Parson's Handbook]]'' ([[Percy Dearmer]]). In Evangelical Anglican parishes, the rubrics detailed in the ''Book of Common Prayer'' are sometimes considered normative.\n\n==Lutheranism==\n[[File:Elca eucharistic elevation.jpg|thumb|A Lutheran priest [[Elevation (liturgy)|elevates]] the [[Chalice#Christian|chalice]] in the celebration of the Holy Mass.]]\n{{Main|Divine Service (Lutheran)}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lutheran elevation.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A Lutheran priest elevating the host.]] -->\nIn the [[Book of Concord]], Article XXIV (\"Of the Mass\") of the [[Augsburg Confession]] (1530) begins thus: <blockquote>\"Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for the Mass is retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence.  We do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it... we keep the traditional liturgical form... In our churches Mass is celebrated every Sunday and on other holy days, when the sacrament is offered to those who wish for it after they have been examined and absolved (Article XXIV)\".</blockquote>\n\n[[Martin Luther]] rejected parts of the Roman Rite Catholic Mass, specifically the [[Canon of the Mass]], which, as he argued, did not conform with {{bibleverse||Hebrews|7:27}}. That verse contrasts the Old Testament priests, who needed to make a sacrifice for sins on a regular basis, with the single priest Christ, who offers his body only once as a sacrifice. The theme is carried out also in {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Heb|9:28}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Heb|10:10}}. Luther composed as a replacement a revised Latin-language rite, ''[[Formula missae]]'' in 1523 and the vernacular [[Deutsche Messe]] in 1526.\n\nAs such, historically, the Lutheran Church has stated that the Lutheran Mass is \"the only Mass founded in the Scriptures of God, in accordance with the plain and incontestable institution of the Saviour.\"<ref name=Lutheran/><ref>{{cite book|url= http://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&id=581|title= Denominational Differences \u2013Other Denominations|publisher= [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]|quote= Differences remain about both the number and the nature of the sacraments. Catholics speak of seven sacraments, while Lutherans tend to speak of only two (or three). More important than number is how the sacraments are understood. To take a single example, Lutherans believe that in the Sacrament of the Altar (Communion) Christ's body and blood are truly present in the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper, but they do not accept the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which teaches that the elements are permanently changed from the substances of bread and wine to the substances of body and blood. Transubstantiation is rejected for several reasons: It is a philosophical explanation for a work of Christ's almighty Word which we can only believe, not explain. In seeking to explain a mystery it changes the plain and simple meanings of God's Word (Scripture refers to the elements as both bread and wine and body and blood, 1 Cor 11:26-27).}}</ref>\n\n[[Scandinavia]]n, [[Finns|Finnish]], and some [[English speaking]] [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], use the term \"Mass\" for their Eucharistic service,<ref>{{cite book|last= Hope|first= Nicholas|title= German and Scandinavian Protestantism 1700 to 1918|year= 1995|publisher= Oxford University Press, Inc.|isbn= 0-19-826994-3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DFL2GNDHPdYC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate= November 19, 2011|page= 18}}; see also [[Deutsche Messe]]</ref> but in most German and English-speaking churches, the terms \"Divine Service\", \"Holy Communion, or \"the Holy Eucharist\" are used.\n\nThe celebration of the Mass in Lutheran churches follows a similar pattern to other traditions, starting with public confession ([[Confiteor]]) by all and a [[Declaration of Grace]] said by the priest or pastor.  There follow the ''[[Introit]]'', ''[[Kyrie]]'', ''[[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]'', [[collect]], the readings with an [[alleluia]] (alleluia is not said during [[Lent]]), [[homily]] (or sermon) and recitation of the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Service of the Eucharist includes the [[General intercessions]], [[Preface]], [[Sanctus]] and [[Eucharistic Prayer]], [[elevation]] of the host and chalice and invitation to the Eucharist. The [[Agnus Dei]] is chanted while the clergy and assistants first commune, followed by lay communicants. [[Postcommunion]] prayers and the final blessing by the priest ends the Mass. A Catholic or Anglican of the Anglo-Catholic party would find its elements familiar, in particular the use of the sign of the cross, kneeling for prayer and the Eucharistic Prayer, bowing to the processional crucifix, kissing the altar, incense (among some), chanting, and vestments.\n\nLutheran churches often celebrate the Eucharist each Sunday, if not at every worship service. This aligns with Luther's preference and the Lutheran confessions.<ref>{{cite web|last= Preus|first= Klemet|title= Communion Every Sunday: Why?|url= http://storage.cloversites.com/gloryofchrist/documents/COMMUNION%20EVERY%20SUNDAY.htm|accessdate= November 18, 2011}}</ref>  Also, eucharistic ministers take the sacramental elements to the sick in hospitals and nursing homes. The practice of weekly Communion is increasingly the norm again in most Lutheran parishes throughout the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The bishops and pastors of the larger Lutheran bodies have strongly encouraged this restoration of the weekly Mass.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe celebration of the Eucharist may form a part of services for weddings, funerals, retreats, the dedication of a church building and annual synod conventions.

With one of his first paychecks, Smith bought a motorcycle. While riding, he lost control of the bike due to adverse weather conditions.

Because of the severe injuries, his legs were permanently disabled<ref name=\"courts\"/> and he suffered chronic leg pains for the rest of his life. To help control the pain, Smith consumed an excessive amount of aspirin.<ref name=\"Capote\"/><ref name=\"courts\"/>\n\n== The murders and life on death row ==\n\n{{See also|Clutter family murders}}\n\nPerry Smith and [[Richard Hickock]] first met in the [[Kansas State Penitentiary]] in [[Lansing, Kansas|Lansing]], [[Kansas]]. Smith was eventually [[parole]]d, and the pair later resumed their acquaintance upon Hickock's release in November 1959. Hickock allegedly wrote to Smith, imploring him to violate his parole by returning to Kansas to assist Hickock with a [[robbery]] he had been planning. Smith claimed that his return was initially motivated not by meeting with Hickock, but by the chance to reunite with another former inmate, Willie-Jay, with whom he had developed an especially close bond while in prison; Smith soon discovered, however, that he had arrived in the [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] area just a few hours after Willie-Jay had left for the east coast.\n\nSmith met with Hickock, and almost immediately the two set to work carrying out Hickock's plan. Driving west to [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]], they entered the Clutter home through an unlocked door late in the evening of November 14, 1959, whereupon they murdered the four family members present: Herbert Clutter and his wife Bonnie, and their younger children, Nancy and Kenyon. Hickock later testified that he had gotten the idea to rob the Clutters after being told by former cellmate Floyd Wells, who had worked as a farmhand for the Clutters, that there was a safe in the family's house containing $10,000. When they [[home invasion|invaded]] the house, however, they discovered that there was no such safe.<ref name=\"Capote\"/> After six weeks at large, mostly spent idly roaming the country, Smith and Hickock were captured in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], on December 30, 1959, following an extensive manhunt which extended into [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"nevada\"/>\n\nSmith admitted to cutting the throat of the father, Herbert Clutter, as well as shooting both Herbert and Kenyon Clutter in the head with a shotgun at close range. Records show a dispute as to which of the two shot the women, Bonnie and Nancy Clutter. Alvin Dewey, chief investigator of the Clutter family murders, testified at the trial that Hickock insisted in his confession that Smith performed all four killings; Smith, however, first confessed that Hickock killed the women, but refused to sign his confession, and later claimed to have shot them himself. Although Smith's revised confession coincided with Hickock's initial statement, both Smith and Hickock refused to testify in court, leading to a lack of an official record detailing who killed the women.\n\nWhile Smith had only a grade-school education, he maintained a strong interest in art, literature and music. His rough past regarding his family and abusive childhood led him to be somewhat distant from people. He read extensively, and during his time on [[death row]], wrote poems and painted pictures for other inmates from photos of their family members.<ref>Bruntz, Michael.

With one of his first paychecks, Smith bought a motorcycle. While riding, he lost control of the bike due to adverse weather conditions. Smith nearly died in the accident and spent six months in a [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]] hospital. Because of the severe injuries, his legs were permanently disabled<ref name=\"courts\"/> and he suffered chronic leg pains for the rest of his life. To help control the pain, Smith consumed an excessive amount of aspirin.<ref name=\"Capote\"/><ref name=\"courts\"/>\n\n== The murders and life on death row ==\n\n{{See also|Clutter family murders}}\n\nPerry Smith and [[Richard Hickock]] first met in the [[Kansas State Penitentiary]] in [[Lansing, Kansas|Lansing]], [[Kansas]]. Smith was eventually [[parole]]d, and the pair later resumed their acquaintance upon Hickock's release in November 1959. Hickock allegedly wrote to Smith, imploring him to violate his parole by returning to Kansas to assist Hickock with a [[robbery]] he had been planning. Smith claimed that his return was initially motivated not by meeting with Hickock, but by the chance to reunite with another former inmate, Willie-Jay, with whom he had developed an especially close bond while in prison; Smith soon discovered, however, that he had arrived in the [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] area just a few hours after Willie-Jay had left for the east coast.\n\nSmith met with Hickock, and almost immediately the two set to work carrying out Hickock's plan. Driving west to [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]], they entered the Clutter home through an unlocked door late in the evening of November 14, 1959, whereupon they murdered the four family members present: Herbert Clutter and his wife Bonnie, and their younger children, Nancy and Kenyon. Hickock later testified that he had gotten the idea to rob the Clutters after being told by former cellmate Floyd Wells, who had worked as a farmhand for the Clutters, that there was a safe in the family's house containing $10,000. When they [[home invasion|invaded]] the house, however, they discovered that there was no such safe.<ref name=\"Capote\"/> After six weeks at large, mostly spent idly roaming the country, Smith and Hickock were captured in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], on December 30, 1959, following an extensive manhunt which extended into [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"nevada\"/>\n\nSmith admitted to cutting the throat of the father, Herbert Clutter, as well as shooting both Herbert and Kenyon Clutter in the head with a shotgun at close range. Records show a dispute as to which of the two shot the women, Bonnie and Nancy Clutter. Alvin Dewey, chief investigator of the Clutter family murders, testified at the trial that Hickock insisted in his confession that Smith performed all four killings; Smith, however, first confessed that Hickock killed the women, but refused to sign his confession, and later claimed to have shot them himself. Although Smith's revised confession coincided with Hickock's initial statement, both Smith and Hickock refused to testify in court, leading to a lack of an official record detailing who killed the women.\n\nWhile Smith had only a grade-school education, he maintained a strong interest in art, literature and music. His rough past regarding his family and abusive childhood led him to be somewhat distant from people. He read extensively, and during his time on [[death row]], wrote poems and painted pictures for other inmates from photos of their family members.<ref>Bruntz, Michael.

Smith and Hickock had originally been questioned about the December 19, 1959, shooting murder in [[Osprey, Florida|Osprey]], [[Florida]] of [[Walker family murders|Cliff and Christine Walker and their two young children]], as evidence indicated they had spent time just a few miles from the crime scene while at large after the Clutter murders. A [[polygraph]] administered at the time of their arrest cleared them of the murders, but by modern polygraph standards, their test results are no longer considered valid.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Olson|first=Cora|title='In Cold Blood' Killers Suspected in Cold Case of Florida Family Massacre|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/blog/2012/12/04/in-cold-blood-killers-suspected-in-cold-case-of-a-florida-family-massacre/index.html?link=obnetwork|work=Crime Library|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> On December 19, 2012, officials in Kansas exhumed the bodies of Smith and Hickock and retrieved bone fragments to compare their DNA to [[semen]] found in the pants of Christine Walker.<ref>{{cite web|title='In Cold Blood' Killers Exhumed, Investigators Hope to Solve 53-Year-Old Cold Case|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/cold-blood-killers-exhumed-investigators-hope-solve-53/story?id=18007706#.UNEjc-RQWe0|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='In Cold Blood' killers' bodies exhumed in second murder investigation|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/19/16019409-in-cold-blood-killers-bodies-exhumed-in-second-murder-investigation?lite|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=NBC News|date=19 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sanderson|first=Bill|title='In Cold Blood' killers' bodies exhumed to check for link in 1959 Florida slaying|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/in_cold_blood_echo_687gdcvxGZMSTIzKuLtRAK|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=New York Post|date=December 20, 2012}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2013, the [[Sarasota County]] Sheriff's office announced they were unable to find a match between the DNA of Smith or Hickock and the samples in the Walker family murder.
