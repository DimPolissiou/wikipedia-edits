Before the election, the incumbent Premier [[David Bartlett]] stated that the party who won the most votes should form government.

The balance of power rested with the Tasmanian Greens, who won five seats. Before the election, the incumbent Premier [[David Bartlett]] stated that the party who won the most votes should form government. Since the Liberals won the popular vote by just over 6,700 votes, Bartlett and his caucus voted to give up power, and Bartlett advised the [[Governor of Tasmania]], [[Peter Underwood]], to invite Hodgman to form a government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/bartletts-labor-gives-up-power-in-tasmania-to-will-hodgmans-liberals/story-e6frgczf-1225848564334|title=Bartlett's Labor gives up power in Tasmania to Will Hodgman's Liberals|work=[[The Australian]]|date=1 April 2010|accessdate=10 April 2010|first=Matthew|last=Denholm}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Hodgman never approached the Greens before the writs were returned, and Bartlett did not promise a Hodgman minority government would have a minimum period of support.
