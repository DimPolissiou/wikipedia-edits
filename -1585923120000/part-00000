The series consists of three books: ''[[Fever Crumb]]'' (2009), ''[[A Web of Air]]'' (2010), and ''[[Scrivener's Moon]]'' (2011). The books follow a young woman known as Fever Crumb, and her adventures set around the time of the creation of the first traction cities that become so prevalent in the Mortal Engines series. Reeve stated in 2011 that he had always envisaged a quartet for the series, assuring readers of a fourth instalment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrivener's Moon and The Twilight of the Poo Goblins|url=http://philipreeve.blogspot.com/2011_05_01_archive.html|work=Philip Reeve|accessdate=20 June 2012|author=Philip Reeve|format=Blog|year=2011}}</ref> In March 2020, he said that \"too much time has passed\" making it difficult to revisit the series, and that he did not intend to finish and publish a fourth book, thereby canceling its plans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philip Reeve's tweet in response to @SevrinY|url=https://twitter.com/philipreeve1/status/1239683913427140608|work=Philip Reeve|accessdate=24 March 2020|author=Philip Reeve|author-link=Philip Reeve|format=Tweet|date=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe series is set in the distant future, thousands of years after the Earth was ravaged by a nuclear conflict called the ''[[Sixty Minute War]]'', which almost destroyed civilization, leaving only bare remnants. Unlike in ''Mortal Engines'', the effects of this war can still be felt, as several mutant species were created by the fallout, including a quasi-sentient race of seagulls, known as \"Angels\", and a new race of [[Woolly Mammoth]] creatures that are seemingly explained by a throwback caused by excessive radiation. The humanoid \"Scriven\" race, practically extinct in the later work, are at first thought to also be mutants. It is later discovered that their creation was deliberate, with the longer lifespans and more resilient systems included in the Scriven design intended for the preservation of the human race in the harsh postwar conditions. The world has become geologically unstable, with vast natural disasters.\n\nLarge land barges feature prominently as smaller predecessors to the subsequent vehicles. A war has been raging between the Nomads; this conflict is partially created by Land Admiral Nikola Quercus (later Nicholas Quirke), employing the theories of Auric Godshawk (a deceased Scriven scientist) to build a moving city.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nBefore the events of series, the post-apocalyptic city of London is ruled by an evolved species of human called the scriven. In the final years of the scriven rule, Dr. Gideon Crumb, a human engineer, falls in love with Wavey Godshawk, a scriven and the daughter of the London's ruler, Auric Godshawk. In a violent uprising known as the 'Skinner's riots', Auric and many other scriven are killed in an act of genocide by the human citizens of London. Wavey, who lacks most of the distinctive markings of the scriven, escapes with her newborn half-human baby, but then leaves her child with a friend who passes her onto Gideon along with a note saying 'Her name is Fever'. Wavey then flees across the country where she runs into a carnival run by a dwarf named Borglum. For several years she lives in peace with the carnival's staff, working on engines and building machines.\n\nWith Wavey gone into hiding, Gideon raises his Fever as an adopted child in the engineerium for many years, until the twists and turns of fate forced him to explain the truth to her.\n\nFever leaves London to join the Lyceum, a traveling theatre with children whom she took care of after their father was murdered, where she starts growing out her previously close-cropped hair and begins to loosen up. She meets Arlo Thursday, an orphan boy who becomes her first love. Arlo had fallen in love with a girl named Thirza Blaizey, but she rejects him to marry the rich and powerful Jago Belkin. Although Arlo is originally distrusting towards Fever, (pointing a gun at her,) they grow close enough for Arlo to unveil his plans of the world's first Aeroplane. Fever ends up fleeing along with Arlo after her life is threatened by unknown assailants. They retreat to Thursday Island and begin to construct Arlo's invention using wood and paper and an engine sent to him by another inventor, however this proves to be too heavy and so Fever puts her engineering talents to good use and improvises by cannibalizing a power supply and motor from a Stalker-Crab type creature which was built by Auric Godshawk and given to Arlo's family as a gift.\n\nAs the Aeroplane nears completion, Thursday Island is besieged by Jago Belkin, who has learned of Arlo's plan from Thirza, who enticed the information from Arlo's best friend and Angel, Weasel, before murdering him. Jago is accompanied by a legion of soldiers (The London engineer Dr Teal also shows up after the initial assault), who corner Arlo and Fever in a derelict tower where the Aeroplane is kept. Jago is killed in the final confrontation which leads to Fever successfully flying the world's first Aeroplane for several minutes before it plummets into the sea. Fever and Arlo are picked up by Wavey Godshawk and Dr. Crumb, Fever's parents, who persuade Fever to forget about the dreams of flight which she shared with Arlo and return to London, which is in the process of transforming into the first Traction City. Fever saves Arlo's life, but in doing so she is forced to betray him and his research. Breaking Fever's heart, Arlo sails away from Mayda and the Thursday Island, never to return.\n\nShe leaves the Traveling Circus to work with Nicola Quercus and the Nomads, returning to London where she reconciles with Wavey and Gideon as the new London was built. Gideon becomes an important part of the engineering team behind the first Traction City, and lives happily with his lover and his daughter for a while.\n\nBorglum and his circus return to London, where they tell Wavey and Fever of a great pyramid from the Ancient times that has recently broken open in an earthquake. Wavey, Fever, and Borglum set off to the North to investigate the pyramid properly. They are imprisoned by the Northern Nomad Rufus Raven. Wavey and Fever escape, but Wavey is brutally killed by a stalker (possibly ''[[Shrike (Philip Reeve)|Shrike]]''/ Grike) while making sure that Fever escapes unharmed. Her death has a profound effect on the other characters, triggering Gideon Crumb's transformation into an antagonist, influencing Fever's journey into emotional acceptance of herself and leading Borglum into a terroristic strike against Raven, which in turn radically influences the outcome of the battle between the Nomads and the first traction city.\n\nFever meets Cluny Morvish, a Nomadic girl who she falls in love with, making her the first confirmed [[bisexual]] character in either series (although Sathya is referred to as being in love with ''[[Anna Fang]]'' at one point, it is uncertain what exactly this means and could easily refer to platonic love.) She leaves London behind for good after seeing what Quercus and her father have turned it into, settling into a more peaceful life with her girlfriend Cluny.\n\nThe news of Wavey's death has a devastating impact on Dr Crumb \u2013 however, instead of grieving, he retreats into the protection of pure rationality while disposing of the potentially very painful emotions that humanised him. He becomes head engineer in Wavey's place, which leads him down a road of cold, emotionless insanity until he has become completely inhuman. He reaches a turning point when he is informed halfway through London's completion that the city must move within weeks to avoid the onrushing army of nomads. In response, he concocts a 'rational' plan which involves not building most of the housing that had been planned on this new city and only taking the most 'useful' people on board London, leaving the others to die.

He was an ambitious man driven by science, and his fascination with advanced pre-war technology led him to conceive the idea of traction cities. Even with his murder at the hands of the Skinners, his daughter, Wavey Godshawk, continued to develop the traction city concept with the aid of northern nomad, Nicola Quercus.

Before the genocide of the Scriven, Gideon worked as Auric Godshawk's apprentice.

Arlo remained on the island for several months with only the company of a local flock of mutated birds, known as Angels. He was eventually rescued and taken to the nearby harbour city of Mayda, built inside an old crater located off the coast of Portugal. From there he was apprenticed to a shipwright named Blaizey, who was also the business rival of Arlo's father, before the great wave.

Charley is introduced in [[Fever Crumb]].\n* ''Cluny Morvish'' \u2013 The daughter of a minor nobleman in the nomadic Arkangelsk Empire. She is constantly troubled by visions of London becoming an all-devouring mobile city. While her dreams are interpreted by technomancer Nintendo Tharp as a warning from \"the Ancestors\", it is later revealed that Cluny was a victim of the same experiments conducted by Auric Godshawk on Fever. Under Tharp's strict tutelage Cluny becomes a prophet, a role that soon promotes a campaign against London aided by the warring empires of the north. She develops an intimate and romantic relationship with Fever. Cluny is introduced in [[Scrivener's Moon]].\n* ''Nicola Quercus'' \u2013 A northerner and land admiral of a nomadic organization known as The Movement.

The series consists of three books: ''[[Fever Crumb]]'' (2009), ''[[A Web of Air]]'' (2010), and ''[[Scrivener's Moon]]'' (2011). The books follow a young woman known as Fever Crumb, and her adventures set around the time of the creation of the first traction cities that become so prevalent in the Mortal Engines series. Reeve stated in 2011 that he had always envisaged a quartet for the series, assuring readers of a fourth instalment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrivener's Moon and The Twilight of the Poo Goblins|url=http://philipreeve.blogspot.com/2011_05_01_archive.html|work=Philip Reeve|accessdate=20 June 2012|author=Philip Reeve|format=Blog|year=2011}}</ref> In March 2020, he said that \"too much time has passed\" making it difficult to revisit the series, and that he did not intend to finish and publish a fourth book.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philip Reeve's tweet in response to @SevrinY|url=https://twitter.com/philipreeve1/status/1239683913427140608|work=Philip Reeve|accessdate=24 March 2020|author=Philip Reeve|author-link=Philip Reeve|format=Tweet|date=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe series is set in the distant future, thousands of years after the Earth was ravaged by a nuclear conflict called the ''[[Sixty Minute War]]'', which almost destroyed civilization, leaving only bare remnants. Unlike in ''Mortal Engines'', the effects of this war can still be felt, as several mutant species were created by the fallout, including a quasi-sentient race of seagulls, known as \"Angels\", and a new race of [[Woolly Mammoth]] creatures that are seemingly explained by a throwback caused by excessive radiation. The humanoid \"Scriven\" race, practically extinct in the later work, are at first thought to also be mutants. It is later discovered that their creation was deliberate, with the longer lifespans and more resilient systems included in the Scriven design intended for the preservation of the human race in the harsh postwar conditions. The world has become geologically unstable, with vast natural disasters.\n\nLarge land barges feature prominently as smaller predecessors to the subsequent vehicles. A war has been raging between the Nomads; this conflict is partially created by Land Admiral Nikola Quercus (later Nicholas Quirke), employing the theories of Auric Godshawk (a deceased Scriven scientist) to build a moving city.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nBefore the events of series, the post-apocalyptic city of London is ruled by an evolved species of human called the scriven. In the final years of the scriven rule, Dr. Gideon Crumb, a human engineer, falls in love with Wavey Godshawk, a scriven and the daughter of the London's ruler, Auric Godshawk. In a violent uprising known as the 'Skinner's riots', Auric and many other scriven are killed in an act of genocide by the human citizens of London. Wavey, who lacks most of the distinctive markings of the scriven, escapes with her newborn half-human baby, but then leaves her child with a friend who passes her onto Gideon along with a note saying 'Her name is Fever'. Wavey then flees across the country where she runs into a carnival run by a dwarf named Borglum. For several years she lives in peace with the carnival's staff, working on engines and building machines.\n\nWith Wavey gone into hiding, Gideon raises his Fever as an adopted child in the engineerium for many years, until the twists and turns of fate forced him to explain the truth to her.\n\nFever leaves London to join the Lyceum, a traveling theatre with children whom she took care of after their father was murdered, where she starts growing out her previously close-cropped hair and begins to loosen up. She meets Arlo Thursday, an orphan boy who becomes her first love. Arlo had fallen in love with a girl named Thirza Blaizey, but she rejects him to marry the rich and powerful Jago Belkin. Although Arlo is originally distrusting towards Fever, (pointing a gun at her,) they grow close enough for Arlo to unveil his plans of the world's first Aeroplane. Fever ends up fleeing along with Arlo after her life is threatened by unknown assailants. They retreat to Thursday Island and begin to construct Arlo's invention using wood and paper and an engine sent to him by another inventor, however this proves to be too heavy and so Fever puts her engineering talents to good use and improvises by cannibalizing a power supply and motor from a Stalker-Crab type creature which was built by Auric Godshawk and given to Arlo's family as a gift.\n\nAs the Aeroplane nears completion, Thursday Island is besieged by Jago Belkin, who has learned of Arlo's plan from Thirza, who enticed the information from Arlo's best friend and Angel, Weasel, before murdering him. Jago is accompanied by a legion of soldiers (The London engineer Dr Teal also shows up after the initial assault), who corner Arlo and Fever in a derelict tower where the Aeroplane is kept. Jago is killed in the final confrontation which leads to Fever successfully flying the world's first Aeroplane for several minutes before it plummets into the sea. Fever and Arlo are picked up by Wavey Godshawk and Dr. Crumb, Fever's parents, who persuade Fever to forget about the dreams of flight which she shared with Arlo and return to London, which is in the process of transforming into the first Traction City. Fever saves Arlo's life, but in doing so she is forced to betray him and his research. Breaking Fever's heart, Arlo sails away from Mayda and the Thursday Island, never to return.\n\nShe leaves the Traveling Circus to work with Nicola Quercus and the Nomads, returning to London where she reconciles with Wavey and Gideon as the new London was built. Gideon becomes an important part of the engineering team behind the first Traction City, and lives happily with his lover and his daughter for a while.\n\nBorglum and his circus return to London, where they tell Wavey and Fever of a great pyramid from the Ancient times that has recently broken open in an earthquake. Wavey, Fever, and Borglum set off to the North to investigate the pyramid properly. They are imprisoned by the Northern Nomad Rufus Raven. Wavey and Fever escape, but Wavey is brutally killed by a stalker (possibly ''[[Shrike (Philip Reeve)|Shrike]]''/ Grike) while making sure that Fever escapes unharmed. Her death has a profound effect on the other characters, triggering Gideon Crumb's transformation into an antagonist, influencing Fever's journey into emotional acceptance of herself and leading Borglum into a terroristic strike against Raven, which in turn radically influences the outcome of the battle between the Nomads and the first traction city.\n\nFever meets Cluny Morvish, a Nomadic girl who she falls in love with, making her the first confirmed [[bisexual]] character in either series (although Sathya is referred to as being in love with ''[[Anna Fang]]'' at one point, it is uncertain what exactly this means and could easily refer to platonic love.) She leaves London behind for good after seeing what Quercus and her father have turned it into, settling into a more peaceful life with her girlfriend Cluny.\n\nThe news of Wavey's death has a devastating impact on Dr Crumb \u2013 however, instead of grieving, he retreats into the protection of pure rationality while disposing of the potentially very painful emotions that humanised him. He becomes head engineer in Wavey's place, which leads him down a road of cold, emotionless insanity until he has become completely inhuman. He reaches a turning point when he is informed halfway through London's completion that the city must move within weeks to avoid the onrushing army of nomads. In response, he concocts a 'rational' plan which involves not building most of the housing that had been planned on this new city and only taking the most 'useful' people on board London, leaving the others to die. Even when Fever returns relatively unharmed from the North, he has become so cold that he cannot love her and considers leaving her behind when he sees that she has abandoned rationality for love.\n\n==Characters==\nAs with the [[Mortal Engines Quartet]], a handful number of the people in the books are named after places in [[Devon]], where Reeve lives, including [[Chudleigh]], [[Tamerton Foliot]] and the [[River Plym]].

On the other hand, each participant in the PHF group was not given the puzzle but received a posthypnotic familiarity suggestion that they would feel familiar with this game during the hypnosis. After the hypnosis, all participants were asked to play the puzzle (the second time for PHA group) and reported the feelings of playing.\n\nIn the PHA condition, if a participant reported no memory of completing the puzzle game during hypnosis, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion. In the PHF condition, if participants reported that the puzzle game felt familiar, researchers would score the participant as passing the suggestion.

Furthermore, more participants in PHF group experienced a strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, for example, describing like \u201cI think I have done the exact puzzle before.\u201d Only 3 out of 6 participants in PHA group felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and none of them experienced a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. These figures are consistent with Banister and Zangwill\u2019s findings. Some participants in PHA group related the familiarity when completing the puzzle with an exact event that happened before, which is more likely to be a phenomenon of source amnesia. Other participants started to realize that they may have completed the puzzle game during hypnosis, which is more akin to the phenomenon of breaching. In contrast, participants in PHF group reported that they felt confused about the strong familiarity of this puzzle but the feeling of play it just sliding across their mind. Overall, the experiences of participants in PHF group is more likely to be the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in life, while the experiences of participants in PHA group is unlike to be the real d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \n\nA 2012 study in the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experience.<ref name=\"Cleary et al., 2012\"/><ref name=\"Cleary et al., 2012\">{{cite journal | author = Cleary |title = Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: A virtual reality investigation | journal = [[Consciousness and Cognition]] | year = 2012 | volume = 21 | pages = 969\u2013975 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.010 | pmid = 22322010 | last2 = Brown | first2 = AS | last3 = Sawyer | first3 = BD | last4 = Nomi | first4 = JS | last5 = Ajoku | first5 = AC | last6 = Ryals | first6 = AJ|display-authors=etal}}</ref> When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect\u2014that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.\n\n'''Cryptomnesia: Reconstruction of a memory'''\n\nAnother possible explanation for the phenomenon of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' is the occurrence of \"[[cryptomnesia]]\", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as \"''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu''\". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'') involves achieving a good \"match\" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we \"know\" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|encyclopedia=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M. Youngson|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Dual neurological processing'''\n\nIn 1964, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|issue=3|pages=403\u2013424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|doi=10.1093/brain/86.3.403}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Dream-based explanation===\nDreams can also be used to explain the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and they are related in three different aspects. Firstly, some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004). 20% of the respondents reported their d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported that from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown.  Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation. Thirdly, people may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu during a dream state, which links d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with dream frequency.\n\n==Related terms==\n\n===''Jamais vu''===\n{{Main|Jamais vu }}\n\n''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning \"never seen\") is any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.\n\nOften described as the opposite of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].\n\nTheoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.<ref name=\"moulin\"/> If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalization]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalization (or [[surreality]]) feelings.\n\nThe feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word.<ref name=\"moulin\">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .

The first input experience is brief, degraded, occluded, or distracted. Immediately followed by that, the second perception might be familiar because the person naturally related it to the first input. One possibility behind this mechanism is that the first input experience involves shallow processing, which means that only some superficial physical attributes are extracted from the stimulus.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The psychology of learning and motivation.

On the other hand, each participant in the PHF group was not given the puzzle but received a posthypnotic familiarity suggestion that they would feel familiar with this game during the hypnosis. After the hypnosis, all participants were asked to play the puzzle (the second time for PHA group) and reported the feelings of playing.\n\nIn the PHA condition, if a participant reported no memory of completing the puzzle game during hypnosis, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion. In the PHF condition, if participants reported that the puzzle game felt familiar, researchers would score the participant as passing the suggestion.

Furthermore, more participants in PHF group experienced a strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, for example, describing like \u201cI think I have done the exact puzzle before.\u201d Only 3 out of 6 participants in PHA group felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and none of them experienced a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. These figures are consistent with Banister and Zangwill\u2019s findings. Some participants in PHA group related the familiarity when completing the puzzle with an exact event that happened before, which is more likely to be a phenomenon of source amnesia. Other participants started to realize that they may have completed the puzzle game during hypnosis, which is more akin to the phenomenon of breaching. In contrast, participants in PHF group reported that they felt confused about the strong familiarity of this puzzle but the feeling of play it just sliding across their mind. Overall, the experiences of participants in PHF group is more likely to be the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in life, while the experiences of participants in PHA group is unlike to be the real d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \n\nA 2012 study in the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experience.<ref name=\"Cleary et al., 2012\"/><ref name=\"Cleary et al., 2012\">{{cite journal | author = Cleary |title = Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: A virtual reality investigation | journal = [[Consciousness and Cognition]] | year = 2012 | volume = 21 | pages = 969\u2013975 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.010 | pmid = 22322010 | last2 = Brown | first2 = AS | last3 = Sawyer | first3 = BD | last4 = Nomi | first4 = JS | last5 = Ajoku | first5 = AC | last6 = Ryals | first6 = AJ|display-authors=etal}}</ref> When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect\u2014that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.\n\n'''Cryptomnesia: Reconstruction of a memory'''\n\nAnother possible explanation for the phenomenon of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' is the occurrence of \"[[cryptomnesia]]\", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as \"''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu''\". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'') involves achieving a good \"match\" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we \"know\" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|encyclopedia=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M. Youngson|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Dual neurological processing'''\n\nIn 1964, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|issue=3|pages=403\u2013424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|doi=10.1093/brain/86.3.403}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Dream-based explanation===\nDreams can also be used to explain the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and they are related in three different aspects. Firstly, some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004). 20% of the respondents reported their d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported that from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown.  Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation. Thirdly, people may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu during a dream state, which links d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with dream frequency.\n\n==Related terms==\n\n===''Jamais vu''===\n{{Main|Jamais vu }}\n\n''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning \"never seen\") is any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.\n\nOften described as the opposite of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].\n\nTheoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.<ref name=\"moulin\"/> If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalization]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalization (or [[surreality]]) feelings.\n\nThe feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word.<ref name=\"moulin\">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .

She was known for appropriating classical and [[pop culture]] images of women and using them to create stylised representations of them, often sexually charged images but not pandering to the [[male gaze]] and thereby highlighting society\u2019s attitudes towards women. Her work won significant commercial and critical success.\n\nBezor had 30 solo exhibitions, with her works exhibited throughout Australia as well as in Europe, Hong Kong, and the USA. She was a finalist in multiple art prizes in Australia, including the [[Archibald Prize|Archibald]], [[Doug Moran Portrait Prize|Doug Moran]] and [[Sir John Sulman Prize|Sulman prizes]] as well as the [[Portia Geach Memorial Award]] in Sydney.\n\n==Early life==\nBezor was born on 5 April 1950 in Adelaide, [[South Australia]],<ref name=ngv>{{cite web | title=Annette Bezor | website=[[National Gallery of Victoria]]: Collection Online| url=https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/artist/1357/ | access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> into a [[working-class]] family, the second child of Alma (Billi) Smith and policeman Keith Bateman. After her parents divorced, she changed her surname to Bezor, which originated from her mother's family. She left school at 14 because of bullying, and worked in a hairdressing salon where a remark by the manager on her \"puppy fat\" let to her suffering from [[anorexia]] for four years. She married twice, briefly.<ref name=lawsonsmh>{{cite web | last=Lawson | first=Valerie | title=Painter probed the dark side of beauty and celebrity | website=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2 February 2020 | url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/painter-probed-the-dark-side-of-beauty-and-celebrity-20200202-p53wy0.html | access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=daao>{{cite web|url=https://www.daao.org.au/bio/annette-bezor/|title=Annette Bezor|website=Design & Art Australia Online| access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974 she enrolled in the [[South Australian School of Art]] in 1974 and graduating in 1977 with a degree in [[fine art]]. She afterwards said that she had felt \"stultified\" working in the male-dominated art school environment, and did her best work at home. In the mid-1970s the women's art movement in South Australia was strong, which Bezor found empowering.<ref name=lawsonsmh/>\n\n==Career==\nIn the early 1980s, Bezor's work ''The Snake is Dead'' won critical acclaim.<ref name=lawsonsmh/> Her work was exhibited in Adelaide, [[Sydney]], [[Hobart]] and Melbourne in the 1980s.<ref name=abbio>{{cite web | title=Annette Bezor | website=Annette Bezor | url=http://bezor.com.au/biography | access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> She was awarded the [[Australia Council]]'s studio residency at the [[Cit\u00e9 internationale des arts]] in [[Paris]], which she took up in 1987 and where she painted ''Romance is in the Air''. This was described by her agent Paul Greenaway as a \"turning point in her career\", where she worked on developing her signature style of appropriating images of women and subverting them in her paintings.<ref name=lawsonsmh/>\n\nShe continued her career after her return from Paris, achieving significant commercial and critical success.<ref name=daao/> In the 1990s, her work was exhibited in Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, and in the 2000s,  Hong Kong, Spain, [[Taipei]] and New York.<ref name=abbio/><ref name=lawsonsmh/> She was commissioned by the [[Parliament of Victoria]] to paint the official portrait of the former [[Victorian Premier]], [[Joan Kirner]] in 1994.<ref name=daao/>\n==Later years==\nBezor was diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]] in 2017. She continued to paint and at the same time caring for her mother until her death in 2019.

The following May, the band released their debut album, ''[[Holy Diver]]''.

Ronnie James Dio and [[Jimmy Bain]] played [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] in the studio, but recruited keyboardist [[Claude Schnell]] for live shows in 1983 prior to the Holy Diver tour.

During the tour, Ronnie James Dio had a chance meeting with former [[Black Sabbath]] bandmate [[Geezer Butler]] which led to that band's short-lived reunion, producing one album, ''[[Dehumanizer]]''. After this Ronnie James Dio reassembled Dio once again, retaining only Appice on the drums. By early 1993 guitarist [[Tracy G]], keyboardist [[Scott Warren]] of Warrant and bassist [[Jeff Pilson]] of Dokken had all joined. During this era, the band abandoned fantasy themed songs and focused on modern issues.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r241445|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Angry Machines'' review|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref> As a result, some fans regard the albums made during this period\u20141993's ''[[Strange Highways]]'', 1996's ''[[Angry Machines]]'' and the live album ''[[Inferno: Last in Live]]''\u2014as the worst in Dio's catalogue, while others view them positively as a step away from the outdated sound of the 1980s. With disappointing record sales for ''Angry Machines'' management wanted the band to go back to their earlier style prompting the departure of Tracy G<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracyg.com/interviews.html|title=Tracy G interview|website=Tracyg.com|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref> to be replaced by the returning Craig Goldy.

It featured not only the return of Goldy but also of Simon Wright and Jimmy Bain, although on the European leg of the tour [[Chuck Garric]] played bass. Scott Warren remained in the band and performed live, although Ronnie and Bain handled all of the keyboard and synth on ''Magica''. A concept album, ''[[Magica (album)|Magica]]'' featured a return to the band's older, more successful sound, while increased use of keyboards gave it a more modern feel.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r469538|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Magica'' review|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref> During the following tour, however, tensions rose between Goldy on the one hand and Bain and Ronnie James Dio on the other, as Goldy was dealing with family obligations. Goldy left the band in January 2002 and was replaced with [[Doug Aldrich]], who Bain had met while recording a tribute album for [[Metallica]]. Because of his late arrival, Aldrich did not contribute much to Dio's ninth work, ''[[Killing the Dragon]]'', which was written primarily by Ronnie James Dio and Bain. ''Killing The Dragon'' was released in 2002 through [[Spitfire Records]] and was well received in the metal community, making the [[Billboard 200|Billboard top 200]]. Aldrich would stay in the band until April of the following year, when he, like Campbell before him, joined [[Whitesnake]], prompting Goldy's return.

The following May, the band released their debut album, ''[[Holy Diver]]''.

Ronnie James Dio and [[Jimmy Bain]] played [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] in the studio, but recruited keyboardist [[Claude Schnell]] for live shows in 1983 prior to the Holy Diver tour.

The new band released the album ''[[Lock Up the Wolves]]'' in the spring of 1990. During the tour, Ronnie James Dio had a chance meeting with former [[Black Sabbath]] bandmate [[Geezer Butler]] which led to that band's short-lived reunion, producing one album, ''[[Dehumanizer]]''. After this Ronnie James Dio reassembled Dio once again, retaining only Appice on the drums. By early 1993 guitarist [[Tracy G]], keyboardist [[Scott Warren]] of Warrant and bassist [[Jeff Pilson]] of Dokken had all joined. During this era, the band abandoned fantasy themed songs and focused on modern issues.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r241445|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Angry Machines'' review|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref> As a result, some fans regard the albums made during this period\u20141993's ''[[Strange Highways]]'', 1996's ''[[Angry Machines]]'' and the live album ''[[Inferno: Last in Live]]''\u2014as the worst in Dio's catalogue, while others view them positively as a step away from the outdated sound of the 1980s. With disappointing record sales for ''Angry Machines'' management wanted the band to go back to their earlier style prompting the departure of Tracy G<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracyg.com/interviews.html|title=Tracy G interview|website=Tracyg.com|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref> to be replaced by the returning Craig Goldy.

It featured not only the return of Goldy but also of Simon Wright and Jimmy Bain, although on the European leg of the tour [[Chuck Garric]] played bass. Scott Warren remained in the band and performed live, although Ronnie and Bain handled all of the keyboard and synth on ''Magica''. A concept album, ''[[Magica (album)|Magica]]'' featured a return to the band's older, more successful sound, while increased use of keyboards gave it a more modern feel.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r469538|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Magica'' review|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref> During the following tour, however, tensions rose between Goldy on the one hand and Bain and Ronnie James Dio on the other, as Goldy was dealing with family obligations. Goldy left the band in January 2002 and was replaced with [[Doug Aldrich]], who Bain had met while recording a tribute album for [[Metallica]]. Because of his late arrival, Aldrich did not contribute much to Dio's ninth work, ''[[Killing the Dragon]]'', which was written primarily by Ronnie James Dio and Bain. ''Killing The Dragon'' was released in 2002 through [[Spitfire Records]] and was well received in the metal community, making the [[Billboard 200|Billboard top 200]]. Aldrich would stay in the band until April of the following year, when he, like Campbell before him, joined [[Whitesnake]], prompting Goldy's return.

From the Xhosa he received the name Jank' hanna (\u2018the bald man\u2019).<ref name=ODNB />  War between Cape Colony and the Xhosa soon drove him back and from 1801 onwards he worked exclusively within the colony, mainly with dispossessed [[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]. In 1803 he established a mission settlement for vagrant Hottentots at [[Bethelsdorp]] where local farmers accused him of harboring lawless elements. He countered with a list of alleged ill-treatment of the Hottentots by local farmers, but the evidence proved unsatisfactory and the farmers were acquitted.\n\nOn 7 April 1806 he married Sara Janse, a freed slave 45 years his junior, and had four children with her. This situation and his attitudes caused great opposition from within the colony, and he was for a time ordered by the government to leave Bethelsdorp.<ref name=ODNB />\n\nArmed with a background in European and classical philology, he pioneered in the study of Xhosa and [[Khoikhoi]] languages.<ref name=DAHB />\n\nHe was recalled to Cape Town by the [[Cape Colony#Governors of the Cape Colony .281652\u20131910.29|Governor]] in 1811 and died soon afterwards\n\n==In print==\n\n[[Sarah Millin]], one of the most popular English-language novelists in South Africa during her lifetime wrote ''The Burning Man'' about the life of van der Kemp. \nThe life of Johannes van der Kemp during his mission in Bethelsdorp is included in the novel ''Praying Mantis'' by [[Andr\u00e9 Brink]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kemp, Johannes Van Der}}\n[[Category:1747 births]]\n[[Category:1811 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Rotterdam]]\n[[Category:Dutch Protestant missionaries]]\n[[Category:Protestant missionaries in South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Huldixa", "label": "safe", "comment": "Further Reading - Article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_van_der_Kemp"}
