Her back would land across my knee: a backbreaker.}}</ref> The standard version of the move sees the wrestler scoop their opponent horizontally before dropping to one knee, slamming the opponent's back on their other knee.\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Backbreaker drop===\nA backbreaker move in which the wrestler lifts an opponent up into an [[#Argentine backbreaker rack|Argentine backbreaker]] or an [[#Canadian backbreaker rack|overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack]], so the opponent's back is resting on the wrestler's shoulder, with the opponent's head pointing in the direction that the wrestler is facing. The attacking wrestler then drops to a kneeling or sitting position while maintaining the hold, thus jarring the back of the opponent by driving the opponent's spine into the attacking wrestler's shoulder.\n\n===Belly-to-back backbreaker===\nThe wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under the arm of the opponent, as for a [[Suplex#Belly-to-back suplex|belly-to-back suplex]], but raises a knee, and brings the opponent back down, so that the opponent's back collides with the knee of the wrestler.\n\n[[File:Vanessa Kraven backbreaker.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Vanessa Kraven]] holds Xandra Bale in the air with a Canadian backbreaker rack.]]\n\n===Canadian backbreaker rack===\nAlso known technically as the overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack, this sees an attacking wrestler first lifts an opponent up so the opponent's back is resting on the wrestler's shoulder, with the opponent's head pointing in the direction that the wrestler is facing. While being held face up across the wrestler's shoulder, the wrestler then links his/her arms around the opponent's torso and presses down, squeezing the opponent's spine against the wrestler's shoulder. A common variant of this hold has the attacking wrestler also apply a [[Professional wrestling holds#Butterfly|double underhook]] before or after lifting the opponent, this was used by [[Colt Cabana]] as the ''Colt .45''. The double underhook variant is often seen when the hold is used to transition to another maneuver, such as a [[#Backbreaker drop|backbreaker drop]] or [[Powerbomb#Inverted powerbomb|inverted powerbomb]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] famously used this move on his opponents.\n\n===Catapult backbreaker===\nThe catapult throw typically starts with an opponent on his/her back, and the attacking wrestler standing and facing him/her. The wrestler hooks each of the opponent's legs in one of his/her arms then falls backwards to slingshot the opponent into a turnbuckles, ladders, ropes etc. At this point the attacking wrestler will remain on the ground and raise his knees while still holding the opponent's legs. The rebounding opponent will instantly trip falling backwards onto the raised knees of the wrestler. Another method is that the wrestler performs a catapult and raises the knees prematurely so that the wrestler is draped over the knees without an actual launch.\n\n===Chokeslam backbreaker===\nThe wrestler performing the move stands in front of and slightly to the left of the opponent receiving it. The wrestler then reaches out and grabs the opponent's throat and trunks, and lifts him or her in the air as though the wrestler is about to deliver a [[chokeslam]]. However, as the wrestler brings the opponent back down to the mat the wrestler kneels, slamming the other wrestler's back onto his extended knee. This move is popularly known as a chokebreaker, which is a [[portmanteau]] of this move's technical name.\n\n===Cobra clutch backbreaker===\nThis move involves an attacking wrestler first putting an opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Cobra clutch|cobra clutch]] hold before then lifting the opponent up while maintaining the hold (turning them in mid-air so they are horizontal) and bringing them down while the wrestler drops to a knee so that the opponent impacts back-first on the knee of the attacking wrestler. All while the wrestler continues to maintain the hold. The attacking wrestler can maintain the hold after impact for a cobra clutch submission attempt.\n\n===Double knee backbreaker===\nAlso known as a lung blower, [[Carly Col\u00f3n|backstabber or backcracker]], this technique involves an attacking wrestler going behind an opponent and putting both of their hands round an opponent's head for a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chinlock|rear chin lock]] or on both of the opponent's shoulders while jumping up to place both his/her knees against the opponent's back; both wrestlers then fall backward to the ground, forcing the wrestler's knees to push up into the back of the opponent. This move can be done from a variety of transition holds, including a [[Teddy Hart|powerbomb transition]] and a [[Roderick Strong|vertical suplex transition]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-14|title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-05-04|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n===Double underhook backbreaker===\nAn attacking wrestler stands facing a bent over opponent and [[Professional wrestling holds#Butterfly|hooks each of the opponent's arms behind the opponent's back]], he then lifts the opponent as if executing a [[Powerbomb#Double underhook powerbomb|Tiger Bomb]]. However, as the attacker drops the opponent back down, he raises a knee and brings the opponent back down horizontally so their back collides with the knee of the attacking wrestler. CM Punk used this move calling it the ''Welcome to Chicago Motherfucker''.\n\n===Fireman's carry backbreaker===\nThe attacker lifts the opponent on his shoulders in a fireman's carry then flips them over so their back lands on the top of the head, a variation to this move is performed similar to how an [[Neckbreaker#Fireman's carry neckbreaker|Ushigoroshi]] is performed instead a knee to the upper back.\n\n===Full nelson backbreaker===\nThe attacking wrestler stands behind the opponent and locks him/her in a [[Nelson hold#Full nelson|full nelson]] before then lifting the opponent, as if to perform a [[Professional wrestling throws#Full nelson slam|full nelson slam]], but as the wrestler drops down the opponent, he exposes a knee, slamming the opponent back-first against the exposed knee.\n\n===Half nelson backbreaker===\nThe attacking wrestler stands behind the opponent and locks in a [[Nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] before then lifting the opponent, as if to perform a [[Professional wrestling throws#Half nelson slam|half nelson slam]], but as the wrestler brings the opponent down to the mat he/she drops to one knee slamming the opponent's back across the extended knee.\n\n===Hair-pull backbreaker (Head-pull backbreaker)===\nThis move is performed behind the opponent, the wrestler grabs his/her opponent by the hair (or by the head in case if wrestler's bald or if performing wrestler is a clean performer) and pulls them back, so the opponent's back lands on the wrestler's knee. Another variation of this move is the wrestler faces the opponent, grabs them by the hair and twists round so the wrestler and opponent are back to back, and then the wrestler pulls the opponent's hair down, driving their back into the wrestler's knee. [[Katarina Waters|Katie Lea Burchill]] used both variations as her finisher. [[Michelle McCool]] used this move as a finisher called ''Final Exam''. [[Alexa Bliss]] also uses this move.\n\n===Inverted headlock backbreaker===\n[[File:Wrestling backbreaker.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Randy Orton]] performing an [[#Inverted headlock backbreaker|inverted headlock backbreaker]] on [[Sheamus]] at a [[WWE]] [[house show]].]]\nUsed by [[Randy Orton]]. This move sees the attacking wrestler stands behind the opponent and places one arm around the opponent's neck, the attacker then turns 180\u00b0 so they are back to back. The attacker then bends forward pulling the opponent across his own back, before dropping down to his knees and jarring the back of the opponent.\n\n===Inverted three-quarter facelock backbreaker===\nCan be also known as an inverted three-quarter facelock neckbreaker or more commonly known as neckbreaker (slam) backbreaker. The wrestler stands beside the opponent facing his either sides, catches the opponent's neck from behind with both his hands (as seen primarily before falling into a [[Neckbreaker#Neckbreaker slam|neckbreaker slam]]), and then forces the opponent's neck down and simultaneously extending a knee so he lands his opponent's back into the knee.\n\n===Mat backbreaker===\nThe attacking wrestler stands behind an opponent, grabbing them by their head or hair to seemingly perform a standard [[Professional wrestling throws#Mat slam|mat slam]]. However, as the wrestler pulls the opponent backwards down to the mat, the wrestler kneels down, driving the opponent's back into the wrestler's exposed knee. If the wrestler uses the opponent's hair to pull them back onto the wrestler's exposed knee it is known as a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Hair pull|hair pull]] backbreaker.\n\n===Pendulum backbreaker===\nThis basic backbreaker involves a wrestler standing side-to-side and slightly behind, with the opponent facing in the same direction, then reaching around the opponent's torso with one arm across the opponent's chest and under both arms and places the other arm under the opponent's legs, as if he was performing a [[Powerslam#Sidewalk slam|sidewalk slam]]. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, bringing his/her legs off the ground, and dropping him/her back-first against the wrestler's knee. The pendulum backbreaker can also be done by spinning around and then dropping the opponent onto the knee.\n\n====Backbreaker submission====\nThis basic backbreaker submission involves the wrestler to lay his opponent's back across one of his knees, then while placing one hand on his opponent's chin and the other on their knee the wrestler would push down to bend the opponent around his/her knee. This move is usually performed at the end of a [[#Pendulum backbreaker|pendulum backbreaker]], a move which sees a wrestler drop an opponent down on the wrestler's knee, thus weakening the back before the hold is applied, as well as setting the opponent in a proper position.\n\n===Russian legsweep backbreaker===\nThis backbreaker variation sees the wrestler standing beside the opponent and slightly behind him. Then, he wraps his arm around the opponent's back-neck, and then from the point he catches the opponent's neck, he forces the opponent down in a Russian legsweep style and simultaneously extends a knee. The maneuver results in the opponent's neck or back to be slammed against the wrestler's knee.\n\n===Side slam backbreaker===\nThe wrestler first stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the opposite direction before next reaching around the opponent's torso with one arm across the opponent's chest and under both arms, lifting him or her in the air as though the wrestler is about to deliver a [[Powerslam#Side slam|side slam]]. However, as the wrestler brings the opponent back down to the mat the attacking wrestler kneels, slamming the opponent's back across his/her extended knee. This type of variation is used by [[Sheamus]], dubbed the ''Irish Curse''.\n \nA [[Powerslam#Swinging side slam|swinging side slam]] variation sees the attacking wrestler first scoop the opponent horizontally across their chest before swinging them to their side and dropping the opponent back first on their knee.\n\n===STO backbreaker===\nThe attacking wrestler stands facing the opponent, then puts one of their arms across the opponents chest holding their shoulder, the attacking wrestler then sweeps the legs of the opponent in the fashion of an [[Professional wrestling throws#STO|STO]], but brings their knee forward so the opponent falls back first on to it. There is also an arm trap version that sees an attacking wrestler take hold of an arm of an opponent and then move to a slightly front to back position, so that the opponent's arm hooks across and round the opponent's own head. At this point, the attacking wrestler kneels forward to the ground, forcing the opponent's own arm to drag them to the attacker's exposed knee.\n\n[[File:Kings tilt-a-whirl backbreaker.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Joey Kings does a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker on Justin Sane.]]\n\n===Tilt-a-whirl backbreaker===\nThe attacking wrestler stands facing the opponent, who is often charging at the attacker, before bending the opponent down so they are bent in front of the attacking wrestler as he/she stands over them then the wrestler reaches around the opponent's body and lifts them up, [[Professional wrestling holds#Tilt-a-whirl|spinning]] the opponent in front of the wrestler's body. As the wrestler brings the opponent back down to the mat the wrestler kneels, slamming the opponent's back across the extended knee. In Lucha Libre, it is known as the ''Quebradora Con Giro.''\n\n==See also==\n*[[Professional wrestling holds]]\n*[[Professional wrestling throws]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Wrestling Moves}}\n\n[[Category:Professional wrestling moves]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the wrestling move|the video game|Backbreaker (video game)|the album by [[The Showdown (band)|The Showdown]]|Back Breaker}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n[[File:Lethal backbreaker.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Jay Lethal]] performs a standard backbreaker.]]\n\nA '''backbreaker''' refers to [[professional wrestling]] moves which see a wrestler dropping an opponent so that the opponent's back impacts or is bent backwards against a part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ellison, Lillian|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-001258-8|publisher=ReaganBooks|page=128|quote=But rather than just a run-of-the-mill body slam, I'd throw that girl down while I lowered myself and stuck out one knee.

Another version sees the wrestler hold their opponent in the Argentine backbreaker rack before dropping into a sitting or kneeling position while simultaneously throwing the opponent off their shoulders, causing the opponent to roll in midair and fall to the mat in a face-down position. [[Nikki Bella]] has used both variations as a finisher in [[WWE]].\n\nA variation of the Argentine backbreaker rack, known as La Reienera, sees the opponent held across the wrestler's back rather than his shoulders/neck. Often set up by a [[Professional wrestling holds#Tilt-a-whirl|tilt-a-whirl]], the opponent ends up suspended with one arm hooked behind him and both legs hooked by the wrestler's other arm.\n\nAnother variation, sometimes known as the \"Accordion Rack\" sees the opponent head behind the head of the wrestler and bending their opponent, sometimes to where their feet would touch their head, however this is mainly limited to opponents of great flexibility. This was utilized by wrestlers like [[Kia Stevens|Awesome Kong]].\n\n[[Roderick Strong]]'s variation is where he dropped his opponent with [[#Double knee backbreaker|both knees]] as the ''Strong Breaker II''.\n\n===Backbreaker drop===\nA backbreaker move in which the wrestler lifts an opponent up into an [[#Argentine backbreaker rack|Argentine backbreaker]] or an [[#Canadian backbreaker rack|overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack]], so the opponent's back is resting on the wrestler's shoulder, with the opponent's head pointing in the direction that the wrestler is facing. The attacking wrestler then drops to a kneeling or sitting position while maintaining the hold, thus jarring the back of the opponent by driving the opponent's spine into the attacking wrestler's shoulder.\n\n===Belly-to-back backbreaker===\nThe wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under the arm of the opponent, as for a [[Suplex#Belly-to-back suplex|belly-to-back suplex]], but raises a knee, and brings the opponent back down, so that the opponent's back collides with the knee of the wrestler.\n\n[[File:Vanessa Kraven backbreaker.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Vanessa Kraven]] holds Xandra Bale in the air with a Canadian backbreaker rack.]]\n\n===Canadian backbreaker rack===\nAlso known technically as the overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack, this sees an attacking wrestler first lifts an opponent up so the opponent's back is resting on the wrestler's shoulder, with the opponent's head pointing in the direction that the wrestler is facing.
