After Independence, the airstrip was used for domestic flights with the construction of a domestic terminal: T1.\n\nInternational operations were initiated by [[Air India]] to cities in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in the late 1970s using Boeing 707. By early 80s, the then Indian Airlines started service to Colombo, followed by service to Male.

{"title_page": "Cid Ricketts Sumner", "text_new": "'''Cid Ricketts Sumner''' (September 27, 1890 \u2013 October 15, 1970) was a novelist from the United States whose works inspired several Hollywood films. She also taught English at a [[Jackson, Mississippi]], [[high school]] and French at [[Millsaps College]].\n\n==Biography==\nSumner was born '''Bertha Louise Ricketts''' in [[Brookhaven, Mississippi]] on September 27, 1890. She was the daughter of Bertha Burnley and Robert Scott Ricketts. Her father was a professor at [[Millsaps College]], and her mother and grandmother provided a [[homeschooling in the United States|homeschooled]] education for her. She later on received the nickname \"Cid\" from her parents because of her placid nature. She received a BS from Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi in 1909 and an MA from [[Columbia University]] in 1910. She continued postgraduate work at Columbia from 1910 to 1914, then enrolled in medical school at [[Cornell University]]. She attended only one year of medical school before marrying one of her professors, [[James B. Sumner]], on July 10, 1915 and dropping out of school. They had four children and she focused on raising her children until they were old enough to go to school and handle themselves. It was at this point that she started writing her books. After her divorce with James, she taught English at a High School in Jackson, and taught French at Millsaps College, where her father taught and she also attended. \n\nHer first novel was ''Ann Singleton'', and it was published in 1938, but it was not very popular. Her career really took off when her second book. ''Quality'' was published in 1946 and it was a novel that opposed segregation. It was about a light-skinned black woman, who could pass as a white woman. She practiced being a nurse up North, and fell in love with a white man, and moved back South.  The theme was very controversial. The story was adapted into the 1949 film [[Pinky (film)|''Pinky'']], starring [[Jeanne Crain]]. The story caused so many disputes that some southern theaters refused to play it because of its progressive nature a decade before the Civil Rights Movement . The film is \u201coften referred to as one of  Hollywood\u2019s first interracial films,\u201d according to the [https://mississippiencyclopedia.org/entries/cid-ricketts-sumner/ Mississippi Encyclopedia]<ref>https://mississippiencyclopedia.org/entries/cid-ricketts-sumner/</ref>. Her third book is probably her most well known novel. ''Tammy out of Time'', was published in 1948. This novel was adapted to film in 1957 in ''[[Tammy and the Bachelor]]'', starring Debbie Reynolds. The book was so popular that Ricketts wrote two more novels based on this one (''Tammy Tell Me True'', in 1959 and ''Tammy in Rome'' in 1965) and three more films were also released (''[[Tammy Tell Me True]]'' in 1961 and ''[[Tammy and the Doctor]]'' in 1963, starring [[Sandra Dee]], and ''Tammy and the Millionaire'' in 1967 starring Debbie Watson). There was also a short-lived 1965 TV series, ''[[Tammy (TV series)|Tammy]]'', inspired by the films. Modak-Truran says that \u201cThe first thing that comes to mind when I think of movies adapted from novels by Cid Ricketts Sumner is a romantic comedy featuring a cuddly Mississippi-bred cutie-pie who is head over heels in love with the perfect bachelor\" <ref>https://jesseyancy.com/tag/cid-ricketts-sumner/</ref> Towards the end of her life, she wrote more non-fiction books that were centered around her experiences while traveling different parts of the world. Several of these movies were on top 50 lists along with the songs in them. <ref>https://jesseyancy.com/tag/cid-ricketts-sumner/</ref>\n\nSumner published eight other novels: ''But the Morning Will Come'' (1949), ''Sudden Glory'' (1951), ''The Hornbeam Tree'' (1953), ''Traveler in the Wilderness'' (1957), ''View from the Hill'' (1957), ''Christmas Gift'' (1959), ''Withdraw Thy Foot'' (1964), and ''Saddle Your Dreams'' (1964)\u2014as well as a number of short stories. <ref>https://mississippiencyclopedia.org/entries/cid-ricketts-sumner/</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Sumner joined the Eggert-Hatch river expedition, the purpose of which was to make the last films of the Green and [[Colorado River]] canyons before construction began on [[Flaming Gorge Dam|Flaming Gorge]] and [[Glen Canyon Dam|Glen Canyon]] dams. She was the only female member of the expedition.  She applied to be a member after reading an ad placed by Charles Eggert in the personals column of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]''<ref>Sumner, Cid R. ''Traveler in the Wilderness''. Harper and Brothers, 1957, p.1.</ref>, and was accepted after she proved to Charles Eggert that she could stand up to the rigors of the river expedition.  She was not allowed to float through [[Cataract Canyon]] on the Colorado, as Don Hatch, the head boatman, felt that it was too dangerous, but she rejoined the party at Hite, Utah, and floated all the way through to [[Lees Ferry]], [[Arizona]], where the first leg of the expedition ended.  When the journey resumed the next year for the section through the Grand Canyon, she did not return. Sumner wrote a book about her journey called ''Traveler in the Wilderness'', published by Harper in 1957.\n\nAfter her writing career, she moved up North, living the rest of her life mostly in New York or Massachusetts. Sumner died violently, being bludgeoned to death at the age of 80 in [[Duxbury, Massachusetts|Duxbury]], [[Massachusetts]] by her grandson, John R.

That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.

The Index was first launched in May 2009, with subsequent reports being released annually. In 2015 it ranked 165 countries, up from 121 in 2007. The study was conceived by Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York.\n\nThe 2019 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]] and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], [[South Sudan]], [[Yemen]], and [[Iraq]]  to be the least peaceful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2019-06-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 10 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== International panel ==\nThe international panel for the 2016 and 2017 GPI consisted of:\n\n* [[Kevin P. Clements|Professor Kevin P. Clements]], ''Foundation Chair of Peace and Conflict Studies and Director, National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Otago, New Zealand''\n* [[Sabina Alkire|Dr Sabina Alkire]], ''Director, Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford, United Kingdom''\n* Dr Ian Anthony, ''Research Coordinator and Director of the Programme on Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-proliferation, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Sweden''\n* Ms Isabelle Arrandon, ''Director of Research and Deputy Director of Communications & Outreach, International Crisis Group, Belgium''\n* Dr Manuela Mesa, ''Director, Centre for Education and Peace Research (CEIPAZ) and President, Spanish Association for Peace Research (AIPAZ), Madrid, Spain''\n* Mr Nick Grono, ''CEO, The Freedom Fund, United Kingdom''\n* Dr Ekaterina Stepanova, ''Head, Unit on Peace and Conflict Studies, Institute of the World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO), Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia''\n\n== Methodology ==\nIn assessing peacefulness, the GPI investigates the extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.\n\nIn 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1\u20135, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1\u20135, to the third decimal point.

The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. \u2018Negative Peace\u2019 which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or \"drivers\", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113\u2013136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.\n* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.\n* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. \n*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours\n* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.\n* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.\n\nStatistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations\u2019 development.\n\n== Global Peace Index rankings (2008\u20132019) ==\nNations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<!-- Note that if you want to update this

The Index was first launched in May 2009, with subsequent reports being released annually. In 2015 it ranked 165 countries, up from 121 in 2007. The study was conceived by Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York.\n\nThe 2019 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]] and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], [[South Sudan]], [[Yemen]], and [[Iraq]]  to be the least peaceful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2019-06-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 10 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== International panel ==\nThe international panel for the 2016 and 2017 GPI consisted of:\n\n* [[Kevin P.

It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.\n\nIn 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1\u20135, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1\u20135, to the third decimal point.

The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. \u2018Negative Peace\u2019 which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or \"drivers\", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113\u2013136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.\n* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.\n* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. \n*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours\n* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.\n* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.\n\nStatistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations\u2019 development.\n\n== Global Peace Index rankings (2008\u20132019) ==\nNations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<!-- Note that if you want to update this

Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University said: \"The GPI continues its pioneering work in drawing the world\u2019s attention to the massive resources we are squandering in violence and conflict. The lives and money wasted in wars, incarcerations, weapons systems, weapons trade, and more, could be directed to ending poverty, promoting education, and protecting the environment.

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and industry.\n\n==International==\nSeveral basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s.

Some examples are:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[EN 15038]], Annex D{{snd}}European Standard for Translation Services\n* [[ISO 8]]{{snd}}Presentation of [[scientific journal|periodical]]s\n* [[ISO 18]]{{snd}}Contents lists of periodicals\n* [[ISO 31]]{{snd}}[[physical quantities|Quantities]] & [[physical unit|unit]]s\n* [[ISO 214]]{{snd}}Abstracts for publication & documentation\n* [[ISO 215]]{{snd}}Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086|title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation -- Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials|website=Iso.org}}</ref>\n* [[ISO 690]]{{snd}}Bibliographic references{{snd}}Content, form & structure\n* [[ISO 832]]{{snd}}Bibliographic references{{snd}}Abbreviations of typical words\n{{col-break}}\n* [[ISO 999]]{{snd}}Index of a publication\n* [[ISO 1086]]{{snd}}Title leaves of a book\n* [[ISO 2145]]{{snd}}Numbering of divisions & subdivisions in written documents\n* [[ISO 5966]]{{snd}}Presentation of scientific & [[technical report]]s (withdrawn)\n* [[ISO 6357]]{{snd}}[[spine (book)|Spine]] titles on books & other publications\n* [[ISO 7144]]{{snd}}Presentation of [[thesis|theses]] & similar documents\n* [[ISO 9241]]{{snd}}[[Ergonomics]] of Human System Interaction\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Australia==\n* ''Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers'' Snooks & Co for the [[Department of Finance and Deregulation (Australia)|Department of Finance and Administration]]. 6th ed. {{ISBN|0-7016-3648-3}}.\n\n==Canada==\n* ''The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing'': by Dundurn Press in co-operation with Public Works and the Government Services Canada Translation Bureau. {{ISBN|1-55002-276-8}}.\n\n===Newspapers===\n* ''CP Stylebook'': Guide to newspaper style in Canada maintained by the [[Canadian Press]]. {{ISBN|0-920009-38-7}}.\n* ''The Globe and Mail Style Book'': Originally created to help writers and editors at the ''Globe and Mail'' present clear, accurate and concise stories. {{ISBN|0-7710-5685-0}}\n\n==European Union==\n* ''Interinstitutional Style Guide''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-000100.htm|title=Publications Office \u2014 Interinstitutional style guide \u2014 Home|website=Publications.europa.eu}}</ref>\n* ''English Style Guide'' (\"A handbook for authors and translators in the [[European Commission]]\" \u2013 executive branch of the [[European Union]].)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title=English resources: English Style Guide|website=European Commission}}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===General===\n* ''Copy-editing: The Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Authors and Publishers'' Judith Butcher. 3rd ed. 1992 Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]  {{ISBN|0-521-40074-0}}\n* ''[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]]''.

Their rendition features [[Brian Jones]]' distinctive [[slide guitar]] and [[Bill Wyman]]'s driving bass playing. It is one of the few Rolling Stones songs to feature only Brian Jones on backing vocals. In the US, the song was initially released as London 45-LON 9641 (with \"Stoned\" on the B side)* without any success and was soon after re-released on 6 March 1964 as the B-side to \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\".\n\n''*'' Title changed to \"Stones\" on some copies of U.K. release; also the title \"Stones\" appears on foreign E.P.s, for example French Decca 457.031.\n\nAccording to various accounts, either the Rolling Stones' manager/producer [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] or the Rolling Stones themselves ran into Lennon and McCartney on the street as the two were returning from an awards luncheon. Hearing that the band were in need of material for a single, Lennon and McCartney went to their session at [[De Lane Lea Studio]] and finished off the song \u2013 whose verse they had already been working on \u2013 in the corner of the room while the impressed Rolling Stones watched.\n\nMick Jagger recalled the song in 1968:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=413|title=I Wanna Be Your Man by The Rolling Stones Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=We knew [the Beatles] by then and we were rehearsing and Andrew brought Paul and John down to the rehearsal. They said they had this tune, they were really hustlers then. I mean the way they used to hustle tunes was great: 'Hey Mick, we've got this great song.' So they played it and we thought it sounded pretty commercial, which is what we were looking for, so we did it like [[Elmore James]] or something. I haven't heard it for ages but it must be pretty freaky 'cause nobody really produced it. It was completely crackers, but it was a hit and sounded great onstage.}}\n\nMcCartney stated in 2016:<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul McCartney Looks Back: The Rolling Stone Interview|work=Rolling Stone|location=USA|date=10 August 2016|accessdate=28 August 2016|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/paul-mccartney-looks-back-the-rolling-stone-interview-w433437}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=We were friends with them, and I just thought \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" would be good for them. I knew they did [[Bo Diddley]] stuff. And they made a good job of it.}}\n \nBill Wyman noted how the Rolling Stones adapted the song to their style:\n{{quote|text=We kind of learned it pretty quickly 'cause there wasn't that much to learn. Then Brian got his slide out, his steel (guitar) out and dadaw{{nbsp}}... dadaw{{nbsp}}... and we said, 'Yeah, that's better, dirty it up a bit and bash it out', and we kind of completely turned the song around and made it much more tough, Stones- and Elmore James-like.}}\n\nReleased only as a single, the Rolling Stones' rendition did not appear on a studio album. The song was reissued in the UK on the Decca compilation albums ''[[Milestones (The Rolling Stones album)|Milestones]]'' (1972) and ''[[Rolled Gold: The Very Best of the Rolling Stones]]'' (1975). In 1989, it was issued on the US compilation album ''[[Singles Collection: The London Years]]''.

Wynne]] and other investors. Construction of Six Flags Over Texas started in 1960 and the park opened the next year for a short (45-day) season. The park initially featured a Native American village, a [[Gondola lift|gondola]] ride, a railroad, some [[Wild West]] shows, a [[stagecoach]] ride and \"Skull Island\", a pirate-themed adventure attraction. There was also an excursion, inspired by the historical [[La Salle Expeditions]] in the late 1600s, called \"LaSalle's River Adventure\", aboard French riverboats through a wilderness full of animated puppets.<ref name=TIMELINE>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/shawg/articles/facilities/six_flags_timeline.html\n |title       = Six Flags Timeline The Lands of Screams and Dreams\n |last        = Shaw\n |first       = Gregory B.

(In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the [[New York Central Railroad]] to form [[Penn Central]] Corp.) With the new owners came a more abundant supply of capital for geographic expansion and park additions. Six Flags opened [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] in 1967 and [[Six Flags St. Louis|Six Flags Over Mid-America]] in 1971, which were the last two original parks constructed by the company.\n\nSix Flags continued to grow by acquiring independent parks. Six Flags purchased [[AstroWorld]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in 1975, [[Six Flags Great Adventure|Great Adventure]] in [[Jackson, New Jersey]] in 1977 and [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California]] in 1979. These purchases were followed by Penn Central selling assets to [[Bally Manufacturing]] in 1982.\n\nIn 1984, the [[Six Flags Great America|Great America]] theme park in [[Gurnee, Illinois]] was acquired from the [[Marriott Corp.|Marriott]] hotel chain.\n\nAlso in 1984, as a result of its acquisition of Great America, Six Flags acquired the rights to Time Warner/[[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' animated characters for use in Six Flags properties. Bally surrendered control of the chain to [[Wesray Capital Corporation]] in a 1987 leveraged buyout. [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] quickly began to gain more leverage in the company, gaining a 19.5% stake in Six Flags in 1990 and then 50% in 1991, with the remaining shares of the company being split by [[Blackstone Group]] and Wertheim Schroder & Company. Time Warner purchased the remaining stake in Six Flags in 1993, changing the company's name from ''Six Flags Corp''. to ''Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc''.\n\nIn 1996, Six Flags began to manage [[Six Flags Fiesta Texas|Fiesta Texas]] theme park in [[San Antonio]], Texas and purchased the park from [[USAA]] in 1998.\n\n=== History of Premier Parks ===\n\nPremier Parks originally operated as the Tierco Group, Inc., an Oklahoma-based [[real estate]] company. The company purchased the [[Frontier City]] theme park in Oklahoma City in 1982 for $1.2 million, although Tierco had no intention of entering the amusement park business. Company officials described Frontier City as \"beat up\" and \"run down\"; they planned to demolish it, subdivide the land and build a shopping center. However, given an [[1980s oil glut|oil bust]] in Oklahoma, developers lost interest in converting the park into a shopping center. In 1984, Tierco hired Gary Story as general manager of Frontier City and invested about $13 million into improving the park. As the new head of Frontier City, he quadrupled the park's attendance and revenues. Under his leadership, two rides, a ticket booth, sales office, and a petting zoo were added to the park. Food service improved.\n\nIn 1988, Tierco shifted its strategic direction to amusement parks. It sold much of its property in the late 1980s, generating capital to reinvest in Frontier City. As this reinvestment paid off, more capital became available, creating further growth. By 1991, Tierco opened White Water waterpark in [[Oklahoma City]] (the name later became [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|White Water Bay]]). The company realized the key to boosting a park's attendance was to add new and exciting rides, and make it [[Family-friendliness|family-friendly]].\n\nTierco acquired the financially troubled [[Six Flags America|Wild World]] in [[Largo, Maryland]], in 1992 and later changed that park's name to Adventure World. With a $500,000 investment, Tierco expanded Wild World's kiddie section and remodeled its buildings to give the park a [[Tropics|tropical]] look and feel. Story was promoted to [[vice president|executive vice president]] after the purchase of Wild World. In 1994, he was promoted again to president and [[chief operating officer]] (COO). More flat rides and two roller coasters were added to that park.\n\nSince Tierco was on its way to becoming a \"premier\" regional theme park operator, in 1994 it changed its name to Premier Parks, Inc. Kieran E. Burke, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), noted that the new name signified the beginning of a new era for the company.\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, Premier picked up speed. In 1995, the company acquired these [[Funtime, Inc.]] properties: [[Geauga Lake (amusement park)|Geauga Lake]] near [[Cleveland]], Ohio, [[Zoombezi Bay|Wyandot Lake]] in [[Powell, Ohio]] and [[Darien Lake]] near [[Buffalo, New York]]. In 1996, Premier added to its portfolio, buying Elitch Gardens in [[Denver]], Colorado, the [[Waterworld California|Waterworld USA]] waterparks in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Concord, California]], [[Six Flags New England|Riverside Park]] in [[Agawam, Massachusetts]], and [[Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom]] in [[Lake George (town), New York|Lake George, New York]].\n\nGeauga Lake, Wyandot Lake and Adventure World included water parks, while Frontier City was 14.8 miles away from White Water Bay that required separate admission. Riverside added one just before being sold. Premier Parks, in 1995 and 1996, added water parks to Darien Lake, Lake Compounce (immediately before the Kennywood sale), Elitch Gardens, and Great Escape.\n\nPremier went public in 1996 and raised nearly $70 million through an initial offering at $18 per share. The company planned to use the money to expand its ten parks and acquire others. In 1997, Premier purchased [[Kentucky Kingdom]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World]] near San Francisco. A second public offering, at $29 per share, raised an additional $2 million.\n\nNearly 8.8 million people visited Premier's parks in 1996.\n\nIn December 1997, Premier entered a definitive agreement to purchase a controlling 94 percent interest in Walibi Family Parks in Europe. The deal was finalized in March 1998 adding five [[Compagnie des Alpes|Walibi Parks]] and [[Bellewaerde]] to the chain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/80/Six-Flags-Inc.html|title=Six Flags, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Six Flags, Inc.|publisher=www.referenceforbusiness.com|accessdate=January 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPremier added amusement park rides and roller coasters to Marine World in 1999.\n\n=== Acquisition of Six Flags by Premier Parks ===\n\nSix Flags Theme Parks, Inc. was purchased in whole on April 1, 1998 from Time Warner by Premier Parks for $1.86 billion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Time Warner Completes Sale of Stake in Six Flags for $440 Million in Cash {{!}} Time Warner Inc.|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/1998/04/01/time-warner-completes-sale-of-stake-in-six-flags-for-440-million|work=Time Warner|language=en}}</ref> Premier began to apply the Six Flags name to several smaller parks that the company had already owned: [[Darien Lake]], [[Elitch Gardens Theme Park|Elitch Gardens]], [[Kentucky Kingdom]] and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World]].

Movie World Madrid]] from [[Warner Bros.]]. As part of the acquisition, Premier Parks had the opportunity to open more European theme parks with Warner Bros. Movie World branding. [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] on the [[Gold Coast, Australia]] was not part of the deal. The same transaction saw Premier Parks obtain exclusive rights for Warner Bros. licensing in Europe and Latin America, in addition to their existing rights for the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Premier Purchases WB's European Parks Division\">{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Tim|title=Premier Purchases WB's European Parks Division|journal=Amusement Business|date=October 18, 1999|volume=111|issue=42|pages=1, 32}}</ref> In March 1999, Premier Parks purchased [[Reino Aventura]] for an estimated $59 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Global Theme Park Industry|first=Salvador|last=Clav\u00e9|page=108|publisher=CABI|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Premier Parks assumed the ''Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc''. name and continued re-branding its parks, including [[Geauga Lake (amusement park)|Geauga Lake]] park into Six Flags Ohio and Riverside Park to [[Six Flags New England]]. The company also rebranded one of the recently acquired Walibi parks \u2014 [[Walibi Holland|Walibi Flevo]] as Six Flags Holland, and Mexico's Reino Aventura as [[Six Flags Mexico]].\n\nIn 2001, Six Flags acquired the former [[SeaWorld#SeaWorld Ohio sale, re-birth, and eventual transition|SeaWorld Ohio]] from [[Busch Entertainment Corporation#History|Anheuser-Busch]], merged it with the adjacent Six Flags Ohio and re-branded the combined park as ''[[Six Flags Worlds of Adventure]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Six Flags, Inc.

In May 2001, Six Flags negotiated with the city of Montreal to operate [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. Six Flags acquired the assets of the park and has a long-term contract to lease the land from the city. [[Walibi Belgium|Walibi Wavre]] was rebranded as Six Flags Belgium.\n\n=== Asset sales and shareholder revolt ===\n[[File:Katrina Killed the Clown.jpg|thumb|On August 29, 2005, [[Six Flags New Orleans]] was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]]]]\n\nIn 2004, Six Flags began to close and sell properties in an effort to help alleviate the company's growing debt. On March 10, Six Flags sold its European parks, with the exception of the Movie World park in [[Madrid]], Spain, to Star Parks, a division of Palamon Capital Partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palamon.com/investment-portfolio/detail/starparks|title=investment Detail StarParks|publisher=Palamon Capital Partners, LP|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}</ref> The Madrid park was sold back to Time Warner and renamed \"[[Parque Warner Madrid]]\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Meza|first1=Ed|title=Six Flags sells parks in Europe|url=https://variety.com/2004/biz/news/six-flags-sells-parks-in-europe-1117901725/|work=Variety|date=15 March 2004}}</ref> In April, Six Flags determined that the investment required to keep Worlds of Adventure competitive with Cedar Point would be too great, leading to that park being sold to [[Cedar Fair]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=L.P.|first1=Cedar Fair|title=Cedar Fair, L.P. to Acquire Six Flags Worlds of Adventure|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cedar-fair-lp-to-acquire-six-flags-worlds-of-adventure-72027297.html|work=www.prnewswire.com|language=en}}</ref> These sales raised $345&nbsp;million in an effort to relieve Six Flags' massive debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coastergallery.com/SFSale.html |title=Six Flags sells numerous parks |publisher=CoasterGallery.com |date=March 10, 2004 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064605/http://www.coastergallery.com/SFSale.html |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Six Flags endured even more turmoil. Some of the company's largest investors, notably [[Bill Gates]]'s [[Cascade Investments]] (which then owned about 11% of Six Flags) and [[Daniel Snyder]]'s Red Zone, LLC (which owned 12%), demanded change. On August 17, 2005, Red Zone began a [[Proxy fight|proxy battle]] to gain control of Six Flags' board of directors. On August 29, 2005, [[Six Flags New Orleans]] was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]], and has since sat abandoned.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn September 12, Six Flags Chief Executive Officer Kieran Burke announced that [[Six Flags AstroWorld]] would be closed and demolished at the end of the 2005 season. The company cited issues such as the park's performance, and parking issues involving the [[Houston Texans]] football team, [[Reliant Stadium]], and the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]], leveraged with the estimated value of the property which included the park. Company executives were expecting to receive upwards of $150 million for the real estate, but ended up receiving $77 million when the bare property (which cost $20 million to clear) was sold to a development corporation in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|author=Houston Business Journal \u2013 by Jennifer Dawson |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/05/08/daily27.html?from_rss=1 |title=Local developer to acquire former AstroWorld site \u2013 Houston Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= May 11, 2006|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn November 22, Red Zone announced it had gained control of the board. Kieran Burke was removed on December 14 and replaced by [[Mark Shapiro (media executive)|Mark Shapiro]], former executive vice president of programming at [[ESPN]]. Six Flags then named former [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jack Kemp]], entertainment mogul [[Harvey Weinstein]] and [[Michael Kassan]], the former president of the [[Interpublic Group of Companies Incorporated]], to their newly revamped board of directors.\n\nEven with the new management team, the sell-off would continue into 2006. On January 27, Six Flags announced the sale of Frontier City and White Water Bay after the 2006 operating season. At the same time, Six Flags announced it would close corporate offices in Oklahoma City, moving its headquarters to New York City. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said he expected the parks to continue operation after the sale, a lesson the company learned after its public relations debacle with the closure of AstroWorld. In June, Six Flags announced it was considering closing or selling up to six of its parks, including Elitch Gardens, Darien Lake, WaterWorld in ([[Concord, California]]), [[Wild Waves Theme Park|Wild Waves and Enchanted Village]] in [[Federal Way, Washington]], [[Six Flags Splashtown|Splashtown]] in [[Houston, Texas]] and, most notably, [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/money/9415831/detail.html?rss=den&psp=money |title=Six Flags Considers Selling Elitch Gardens \u2013 Money News Story \u2013 KMGH Denver |work=[[KMGH-TV]] |publisher=[[E.W.

The commercials introduced a new mascot: \"[[Mr. Six (mascot)|Mr. Six]]\", a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie. In many of the commercials, Mr. Six would slowly exit a multi-colored bus, only to start frenetically dancing to the [[Vengaboys]]' \"[[We Like to Party (Vengaboys song)|We Like to Party]]\". The commercials were an immediate hit and Mr. Six almost instantly became the de facto mascot and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired. These ads have become widely parodied on the Internet, with faces from other Internet memes being superimposed over Mr. Six's face.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, Six Flags' TV ads consisted of a \"Fun-O-Meter\" in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing and a man's face judges it \"One Flag!\" or sometimes \" Oh! Two Flags!\" Then roller coasters and attractions of Six Flags are shown and says \"Six Flags! More Flags, More Fun!\" for Six Flags parks. However, the thick accent of the Asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amny.com/business/am-sixflags0805,0,3827486.story |title='Six Flags' TV ads get thumbs down from some Asian Americans |publisher=[[AM New York]] |last=Stride |first=Megan |date=August 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2009, the Mr. Six character came back from retirement and replaced the Asian man in Six Flags' ads, still using the Fun-O-Meter. In 2011, Six Flags' TV ads got a brand-new slogan \"Go Big! Go Six Flags!\" for its theme parks.\n\n=== Licensing with other brands and companies ===\nSix Flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies, who have used these assets to create licensed products. One notable such example is the theme park simulation game [[Roller Coaster Tycoon 2]], which featured recreations of Six Flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the player's discretion.\n\nSix Flags has approximately 18 known partners.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} These partners include [[Dole Food Company|Dole]], [[Armitron]], [[Mike and Ike]], [[Barcel]], [[Good Humor]], [[Nathan's Famous]], [[Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Icee]], Ortega, [[Cold Stone Creamery]], [[J&J Snack Foods Corp|J&J Snack Foods]], [[Red Gold]], [[Coppertone (sunscreen)|Coppertone]], [[Johnny Rockets]], [[Samsung]], [[Dasani]], [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] and [[Tyson Foods]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} These businesses help the park generate more income. Most importantly it provides more jobs for prospective employees. For example, Barcel USA expanded its partnership in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sponsorship.com/IEGSR/2013/06/24/A-Sweet-Song--Barcel-USA-Expands-Six-Flags-Partner.aspx|title=A Sweet Song: Barcel USA Expands Six Flags Partnership|publisher=IEG|date=June 23, 2013|accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref> This helps to import food and beverages to increase sponsorships within the United States.\n\nIn 2008, Six Flags partnered with [[Brash Entertainment]] to create a video game based on the Six Flags parks named ''Six Flags Fun Park''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brash Entertainment and Six Flags Partner to Admit Gamers of All Ages to Six Flags Fun Park Videogame |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080605005326/en/Brash-Entertainment-Flags-Partner-Admit-Gamers-Ages |accessdate=25 November 2018 |language=en|date=2008-06-05 }}</ref> The game was first released on the [[Nintendo DS]] on October 28, 2008. The Wii version was delayed while the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions were cancelled after Brash Entertainment went out of business. On February 24, 2009, the rights to the Wii version were taken over by [[Ubisoft]], who released it on March 3, 2009.<ref>https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/24/ubisoft-partners-with-six-flags-to-publish-new-video-game</ref> The game allows players to explore the themed areas and mini-games representative of a visit to a Six Flags park. In the game, players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the park's universe. After creating a unique custom character, Six Flags Fun Park patrons can win prizes and compete with other players in 40 mini-games. Although the video game is called ''Six Flags Fun Park'', it lacks any major reference of Six Flags outside of the names of the different areas.

The park initially featured a Native American village, a [[Gondola lift|gondola]] ride, a railroad, some [[Wild West]] shows, a [[stagecoach]] ride and \"Skull Island\", a pirate-themed adventure attraction. There was also an excursion, inspired by the historical [[La Salle Expeditions]] in the late 1600s, called \"LaSalle's River Adventure\", aboard French riverboats through a wilderness full of animated puppets.<ref name=TIMELINE>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/shawg/articles/facilities/six_flags_timeline.html\n |title       = Six Flags Timeline The Lands of Screams and Dreams\n |last        = Shaw\n |first       = Gregory B.

(In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the [[New York Central Railroad]] to form [[Penn Central]] Corp.) With the new owners came a more abundant supply of capital for geographic expansion and park additions. Six Flags opened [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] in 1967 and [[Six Flags St. Louis|Six Flags Over Mid-America]] in 1971, which were the last two original parks constructed by the company.\n\nSix Flags continued to grow by acquiring independent parks. Six Flags purchased [[AstroWorld]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in 1975, [[Six Flags Great Adventure|Great Adventure]] in [[Jackson, New Jersey]] in 1977 and [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California]] in 1979. These purchases were followed by Penn Central selling assets to [[Bally Manufacturing]] in 1982.\n\nIn 1984, the [[Six Flags Great America|Great America]] theme park in [[Gurnee, Illinois]] was acquired from the [[Marriott Corp.|Marriott]] hotel chain.\n\nAlso in 1984, as a result of its acquisition of Great America, Six Flags acquired the rights to Time Warner/[[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' animated characters for use in Six Flags properties. Bally surrendered control of the chain to [[Wesray Capital Corporation]] in a 1987 leveraged buyout. [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] quickly began to gain more leverage in the company, gaining a 19.5% stake in Six Flags in 1990 and then 50% in 1991, with the remaining shares of the company being split by [[Blackstone Group]] and Wertheim Schroder & Company. Time Warner purchased the remaining stake in Six Flags in 1993, changing the company's name from ''Six Flags Corp''. to ''Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc''.\n\nIn 1996, Six Flags began to manage [[Six Flags Fiesta Texas|Fiesta Texas]] theme park in [[San Antonio]], Texas and purchased the park from [[USAA]] in 1998.\n\n=== History of Premier Parks ===\n\nPremier Parks originally operated as the Tierco Group, Inc., an Oklahoma-based [[real estate]] company. The company purchased the [[Frontier City]] theme park in Oklahoma City in 1982 for $1.2 million, although Tierco had no intention of entering the amusement park business. Company officials described Frontier City as \"beat up\" and \"run down\"; they planned to demolish it, subdivide the land and build a shopping center. However, given an [[1980s oil glut|oil bust]] in Oklahoma, developers lost interest in converting the park into a shopping center. In 1984, Tierco hired Gary Story as general manager of Frontier City and invested about $13 million into improving the park. As the new head of Frontier City, he quadrupled the park's attendance and revenues. Under his leadership, two rides, a ticket booth, sales office, and a petting zoo were added to the park. Food service improved.\n\nIn 1988, Tierco shifted its strategic direction to amusement parks. It sold much of its property in the late 1980s, generating capital to reinvest in Frontier City. As this reinvestment paid off, more capital became available, creating further growth. By 1991, Tierco opened White Water waterpark in [[Oklahoma City]] (the name later became [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|White Water Bay]]). The company realized the key to boosting a park's attendance was to add new and exciting rides, and make it [[Family-friendliness|family-friendly]].\n\nTierco acquired the financially troubled [[Six Flags America|Wild World]] in [[Largo, Maryland]], in 1992 and later changed that park's name to Adventure World. With a $500,000 investment, Tierco expanded Wild World's kiddie section and remodeled its buildings to give the park a [[Tropics|tropical]] look and feel. Story was promoted to [[vice president|executive vice president]] after the purchase of Wild World. In 1994, he was promoted again to president and [[chief operating officer]] (COO). More flat rides and two roller coasters were added to that park.\n\nSince Tierco was on its way to becoming a \"premier\" regional theme park operator, in 1994 it changed its name to Premier Parks, Inc. Kieran E. Burke, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), noted that the new name signified the beginning of a new era for the company.\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, Premier picked up speed. In 1995, the company acquired these [[Funtime, Inc.]] properties: [[Geauga Lake (amusement park)|Geauga Lake]] near [[Cleveland]], Ohio, [[Zoombezi Bay|Wyandot Lake]] in [[Powell, Ohio]] and [[Darien Lake]] near [[Buffalo, New York]]. In 1996, Premier added to its portfolio, buying Elitch Gardens in [[Denver]], Colorado, the [[Waterworld California|Waterworld USA]] waterparks in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Concord, California]], [[Six Flags New England|Riverside Park]] in [[Agawam, Massachusetts]], and [[Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom]] in [[Lake George (town), New York|Lake George, New York]].\n\nGeauga Lake, Wyandot Lake and Adventure World included water parks, while Frontier City was 14.8 miles away from White Water Bay that required separate admission. Riverside added one just before being sold. Premier Parks, in 1995 and 1996, added water parks to Darien Lake, Lake Compounce (immediately before the Kennywood sale), Elitch Gardens, and Great Escape.\n\nPremier went public in 1996 and raised nearly $70 million through an initial offering at $18 per share. The company planned to use the money to expand its ten parks and acquire others. In 1997, Premier purchased [[Kentucky Kingdom]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World]] near San Francisco. A second public offering, at $29 per share, raised an additional $2 million.\n\nNearly 8.8 million people visited Premier's parks in 1996.\n\nIn December 1997, Premier entered a definitive agreement to purchase a controlling 94 percent interest in Walibi Family Parks in Europe. The deal was finalized in March 1998 adding five [[Compagnie des Alpes|Walibi Parks]] and [[Bellewaerde]] to the chain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/80/Six-Flags-Inc.html|title=Six Flags, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Six Flags, Inc.|publisher=www.referenceforbusiness.com|accessdate=January 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPremier added amusement park rides and roller coasters to Marine World in 1999.\n\n=== Acquisition of Six Flags by Premier Parks ===\n\nSix Flags Theme Parks, Inc. was purchased in whole on April 1, 1998 from Time Warner by Premier Parks for $1.86 billion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Time Warner Completes Sale of Stake in Six Flags for $440 Million in Cash {{!}} Time Warner Inc.|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/1998/04/01/time-warner-completes-sale-of-stake-in-six-flags-for-440-million|work=Time Warner|language=en}}</ref> Premier began to apply the Six Flags name to several smaller parks that the company had already owned: [[Darien Lake]], [[Elitch Gardens Theme Park|Elitch Gardens]], [[Kentucky Kingdom]] and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World]].

Movie World Madrid]] from [[Warner Bros.]]. As part of the acquisition, Premier Parks had the opportunity to open more European theme parks with Warner Bros. Movie World branding. [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] on the [[Gold Coast, Australia]] was not part of the deal. The same transaction saw Premier Parks obtain exclusive rights for Warner Bros. licensing in Europe and Latin America, in addition to their existing rights for the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Premier Purchases WB's European Parks Division\">{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Tim|title=Premier Purchases WB's European Parks Division|journal=Amusement Business|date=October 18, 1999|volume=111|issue=42|pages=1, 32}}</ref> In March 1999, Premier Parks purchased [[Reino Aventura]] for an estimated $59 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Global Theme Park Industry|first=Salvador|last=Clav\u00e9|page=108|publisher=CABI|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Premier Parks assumed the ''Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc''. name and continued re-branding its parks, including [[Geauga Lake (amusement park)|Geauga Lake]] park into Six Flags Ohio and Riverside Park to [[Six Flags New England]]. The company also rebranded one of the recently acquired Walibi parks \u2014 [[Walibi Holland|Walibi Flevo]] as Six Flags Holland, and Mexico's Reino Aventura as [[Six Flags Mexico]].\n\nIn 2001, Six Flags acquired the former [[SeaWorld#SeaWorld Ohio sale, re-birth, and eventual transition|SeaWorld Ohio]] from [[Busch Entertainment Corporation#History|Anheuser-Busch]], merged it with the adjacent Six Flags Ohio and re-branded the combined park as ''[[Six Flags Worlds of Adventure]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Six Flags, Inc.

Some of the company's largest investors, notably [[Bill Gates]]'s [[Cascade Investments]] (which then owned about 11% of Six Flags) and [[Daniel Snyder]]'s Red Zone, LLC (which owned 12%), demanded change. On August 17, 2005, Red Zone began a [[Proxy fight|proxy battle]] to gain control of Six Flags' board of directors. On August 29, 2005, [[Six Flags New Orleans]] was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]], and has since sat abandoned.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn September 12, Six Flags Chief Executive Officer Kieran Burke announced that [[Six Flags AstroWorld]] would be closed and demolished at the end of the 2005 season. The company cited issues such as the park's performance, and parking issues involving the [[Houston Texans]] football team, [[Reliant Stadium]], and the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]], leveraged with the estimated value of the property which included the park. Company executives were expecting to receive upwards of $150 million for the real estate, but ended up receiving $77 million when the bare property (which cost $20 million to clear) was sold to a development corporation in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|author=Houston Business Journal \u2013 by Jennifer Dawson |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/05/08/daily27.html?from_rss=1 |title=Local developer to acquire former AstroWorld site \u2013 Houston Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= May 11, 2006|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn November 22, Red Zone announced it had gained control of the board.

Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said he expected the parks to continue operation after the sale, a lesson the company learned after its public relations debacle with the closure of AstroWorld. In June, Six Flags announced it was considering closing or selling up to six of its parks, including Elitch Gardens, Darien Lake, WaterWorld in ([[Concord, California]]), [[Wild Waves Theme Park|Wild Waves and Enchanted Village]] in [[Federal Way, Washington]], [[Six Flags Splashtown|Splashtown]] in [[Houston, Texas]] and, most notably, [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/money/9415831/detail.html?rss=den&psp=money |title=Six Flags Considers Selling Elitch Gardens \u2013 Money News Story \u2013 KMGH Denver |work=[[KMGH-TV]] |publisher=[[E.W.

The commercials introduced a new mascot: \"[[Mr. Six (mascot)|Mr. Six]]\", a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie. In many of the commercials, Mr. Six would slowly exit a multi-colored bus, only to start frenetically dancing to the [[Vengaboys]]' \"[[We Like to Party (Vengaboys song)|We Like to Party]]\". The commercials were an immediate hit and Mr. Six almost instantly became the de facto mascot and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired. These ads have become widely parodied on the Internet, with faces from other Internet memes being superimposed over Mr. Six's face.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, Six Flags' TV ads consisted of a \"Fun-O-Meter\" in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing and a man's face judges it \"One Flag!\" or sometimes \" Oh! Two Flags!\" Then roller coasters and attractions of Six Flags are shown and says \"Six Flags! More Flags, More Fun!\" for Six Flags parks. However, the thick accent of the Asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amny.com/business/am-sixflags0805,0,3827486.story |title='Six Flags' TV ads get thumbs down from some Asian Americans |publisher=[[AM New York]] |last=Stride |first=Megan |date=August 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2009, the Mr. Six character came back from retirement and replaced the Asian man in Six Flags' ads, still using the Fun-O-Meter. In 2011, Six Flags' TV ads got a brand-new slogan \"Go Big! Go Six Flags!\" for its theme parks.\n\n=== Licensing with other brands and companies ===\nSix Flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies, who have used these assets to create licensed products. One notable such example is the theme park simulation game [[Roller Coaster Tycoon 2]], which featured recreations of Six Flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the player's discretion.\n\nSix Flags has approximately 18 known partners.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} These partners include [[Dole Food Company|Dole]], [[Armitron]], [[Mike and Ike]], [[Barcel]], [[Good Humor]], [[Nathan's Famous]], [[Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Icee]], Ortega, [[Cold Stone Creamery]], [[J&J Snack Foods Corp|J&J Snack Foods]], [[Red Gold]], [[Coppertone (sunscreen)|Coppertone]], [[Johnny Rockets]], [[Samsung]], [[Dasani]], [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] and [[Tyson Foods]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} These businesses help the park generate more income.

The Wii version was delayed while the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions were cancelled after Brash Entertainment went out of business. On February 24, 2009, the rights to the Wii version were taken over by [[Ubisoft]], who released it on March 3, 2009.<ref>https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/24/ubisoft-partners-with-six-flags-to-publish-new-video-game</ref> The game allows players to explore the themed areas and mini-games representative of a visit to a Six Flags park. In the game, players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the park's universe. After creating a unique custom character, Six Flags Fun Park patrons can win prizes and compete with other players in 40 mini-games. Although the video game is called ''Six Flags Fun Park'', it lacks any major reference of Six Flags outside of the names of the different areas. This caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately, then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the game's development.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} When the game was released, it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board. [[IGN]] gave the Wii version a 4.5 out of 10, saying \"The quests are uninteresting and the game's '40 Thrilling Games' (as touted by the box) are far from entertaining.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ballard |first1=Adam |title=Six Flags Fun Park Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/15/six-flags-fun-park-review-2 |website=IGN |accessdate=25 November 2018 |date=14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing non-Warner Bros. licensed theming from attractions.
