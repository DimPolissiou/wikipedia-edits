It was founded in 1782 with the [[History of Bangkok#Rattanakosin|establishment of Rattanakosin]] as the capital city. This article covers the period until the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]].\n\nThe maximum zone of influence of Rattanakosin included the [[vassal state]]s of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Shan States]], and some [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] kingdoms. The kingdom was founded by [[Rama I]] of the [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakri]]. The first half of this period was characterized by the consolidation of the kingdom's power and was punctuated by periodic conflicts with [[Myanmar]], [[Vietnam]] and Laos. The second period was one of engagements with the [[colonialism|colonial]] powers of Britain and France in which Siam remained the only [[Southeast Asia]]n state to maintain its independence.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |title        = Rattanakosin Period (1782 -present)\n |publisher    = GlobalSecurity.org\n |accessdate   = 1 November 2015\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151107223323/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |archive-date = 7 November 2015\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nInternally the kingdom developed into a modern centralized [[nation state]] with borders defined by interactions with Western powers. Economic and social progress was made, marked by an increase in foreign trade, the abolition of [[slavery]] and the expansion of formal education to the emerging [[middle class]]. However, the failure to implement substantial political reforms culminated in the [[1932 revolution]] and the abandonment of absolute monarchy in favor of a constitutional monarchy.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chao Phraya Chakri, later Phutthayotfa Chulalok or [[Rama I]].]]\n[[File:Bangkok (early Rattanakosin) map.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of [[Bangkok]] in the early Rattanakosin period.]]\n[[File:Old Bangkok canals.gif|thumb|right|View of 19th-century Bangkok with the [[Wat Saket|Golden Mount]] in the background.|250px]]\n{{Main|History of Bangkok|Thonburi Kingdom}}\nIn 1767, after dominating Southeast Asia for almost four centuries, [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] was [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)|brought down]] by invading Myanmarese armies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|title=Historic City of Ayutthaya|publisher=\u00a9 UNESCO World Heritage Center|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023061657/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|archive-date=23 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDespite its complete defeat and subsequent occupation by the [[Konbaung dynasty]], Siam made a rapid recovery. The resistance to Myanmarese rule was led by a noble of [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]], [[Taksin]], a military leader. Initially based at [[Chanthaburi]] in the southeast, within a year, he had defeated the Myanmarese occupation army and reestablished a Siamese state with its capital at [[Thonburi]] on the west bank of the Chao Phraya, 20&nbsp;km from the sea. In 1768 he was crowned as Taksin. He re-united the [[central Thailand|central Thai]] heartlands under his rule, and in 1769 he also occupied western [[Cambodia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=The Thon Buri and Early Bangkok periods|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe then marched south and reestablished Siamese rule over the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far as [[Penang]] and [[Terengganu]]. Having secured his base in Siam, [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376)|Taksin attacked the Myanmarese in the north in 1774]] and captured [[Chiang Mai]] in 1776, permanently uniting Siam and [[Lannathai|Lanna]]. Taksin's leading general in this campaign was [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Thong Duang]], known by the title ''Chaophraya'' or Lord Chakri was himself a descendant of [[Mon people]]. In 1778 Chakri led a Siamese army which captured [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], also [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]], a northern Lao kingdom submitted, and eventually established Siamese domination over Laotian kingdoms.\n\nDespite these successes, by 1779 Taksin was in political trouble at home. He seems to have developed a religious mania, alienating the powerful Buddhist monk-hood by claiming to be a ''[[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|sotapanna]]'' or divine figure. He was also in troubles with the court officials, Chinese merchants, and missionaries. The foreign observers began to speculate that he would soon be overthrown. In 1782 Taksin sent his armies under Chakri, the future [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of Rattanakosin, to invade Cambodia, but while they were away a rebellion broke out in the area around the capital. The rebels, who had popular support, offered the throne to General Chakri, the 'supreme general'. Chakri who was on war duty marched back from Cambodia and deposed Taksin, who was purportedly 'secretly executed' shortly after.\n\nChakri ruled under the name Ramathibodi (he was posthumously given the name Phutthayotfa Chulalok), but is now generally known as [[Rama I]], first king of the later known [[Chakri dynasty]]. One of his first decisions was to move the capital across the river to the village of Bang Makok (meaning \"place of [[Spondias|olive plum]]s\").  The new capital was located on the [[Rattanakosin Island|island of Rattanakosin]], protected from attack by the river to the west and by a series of [[Khlong|canals]] to the north, east and south. Siam thus acquired both its current dynasty and its current capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=THE EARLY CHAKRI KINGS AND A RESURGENT SIAM|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Foundation (1782\u20131809) ===\n{{Main|Rama I}}\nRama I who was himself of [[Mon people|Mon]], Thai and [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_098_0i_VanRoy_ProminentMonLineages.pdf |title=Prominent Mon Lineages from Late Ayutthaya to Early Bangkok |publisher=Siamese-heritage.org |accessdate=27 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052427/http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_098_0i_VanRoy_ProminentMonLineages.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Dilokwanich/> restored most of the social and political system of the Ayutthaya kingdom, promulgating new law codes, reinstating court ceremonies<ref name = \"Wales\">{{cite book |last= Wales |first= H.

His government was carried out by six great ministries ([[Thai royal and noble titles#Krom|Krom]]) headed by royal princes. Four of these administered particular territories: the [[Kalahom]] the south; the [[Mahatthai]] the north and east; the [[Phrakhlang]] the area immediately south of the capital; and the Krom [[Mueang]], the area around Bangkok. The other two were the ministry of lands (Krom Na) and the ministry of the royal court (Krom Wang). The army was controlled by the King's deputy and brother, the [[Uparat]].\n\nThe Myanmarese, seeing the disorder accompanying the overthrow of Taksin, invaded Siam again in 1785. Rama allowed them to occupy both the north and the south, but the ''Uparat'', ''vice-king'', his brother, led the Siamese army into western Siam and crushed the Myanmarese forces in a battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. This was the last major Myanmarese invasion of Siam, although as late as 1802 Myanmarese forces had to be driven out of Lanna. In 1792 the Siamese occupied [[Luang Prabang]] and brought most of Laos under indirect Siamese rule. Cambodia was also effectively ruled by Siam. By the time of his death in 1809 Rama I had created a Siamese overlordship dominating an area considerably larger than modern Thailand.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMJ8KP8i3v0C&pg=PA1653&lpg=PA1653&dq=invaded+Siam+again+in+1785#v=onepage |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations: S-Z by Cathal J.

[[Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh]], the only member of the Nguy\u1ec5n family still alive, managed to escape across the river to Siam. While in exile Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh wished to retake Gia Dinh and push the Tay-Son rebels out.  He convinced the neutral King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] of [[Siam]] to provide him with support troops and a small invasion force.\n\nIn mid-1784 Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh, with 50,000 [[Siam]]ese troops and 300 ships, moved through Cambodia, then East of Tonl\u00e9 Sap and penetrated the recently annexed provinces of Annam. 20,000 Siamese troops reached Kien Giang and another 30,000 landed in Chap Lap, as the Siamese advanced towards [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]]. Later that year the Siamese captured the former Cambodian province of Gia Dinh where, it was claimed, they committed atrocities against the population of Viet settlers.\n\n[[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7]] anticipating a move from the Siamese, had secretly positioned his infantry along the [[Ti\u1ec1n river]] near present-day [[M\u1ef9 Tho]], and on some islands in the middle, facing other troops on the northern banks with naval reinforcements on both sides of the infantry positions.\n\nOn the morning of 19 January Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 sent a small naval force, under a banner of truce, to lure the Siamese into his trap. After so many victories, the Siamese army and naval forces were confident of a surrender.  So, they went to the parley, unaware of the trap. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops dashed into the Siamese formation, slaughtered the unarmed emissaries and turned on the unprepared troops. The battle ended with a near annihilation of the Siamese force.  All the ships of the Siamese navy were destroyed and only 1,000 of the original expedition survived to escape back across the river into Siam.\n\n====Wars with Myanmar====\n{{main|Nine Armies War}}\nSoon King [[Bodawpaya]] of Myanmar started to pursue his ambitious campaigns to expand his dominions over Siam. The [[Burmese-Siamese War (1785\u20131786)]], also known in Siam as the \"Nine Armies War\" because the Myanmarese came in nine armies, thus broke out. The Myanmarese soldiers poured into Lanna and Northern Siam. Siamese forces, commanded by [[Kawila]], Prince of [[Lampang]], put up a brave fight and delayed the Myanmarese advance, all the while waiting for reinforcements from Bangkok. When [[Phitsanulok]] was captured, [[Anurak Devesh]] the ''Rear Palace'', and Rama I himself led Siamese forces to the north. The Siamese relieved Lampang from the Myanmarese siege.\n\nIn the south, Bodawpaya was waiting at [[Three Pagodas Pass|Chedi Sam Ong]] ready to attack. The Front Palace was ordered to lead his troops to the south and counter-attack the Myanmarese coming to [[Ranong]] through [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. He brought the Myanmarese to battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. The Myanmarese also attacked Thalang ([[Phuket city|Phuket]]), where the governor had just died. His wife Chan, and her sister Mook, gathered the local people and successfully defended Thalang against the Myanmarese. Today, Chan and Mook are revered as heroines because of their opposition to the Myanmarese invasions. In their own lifetimes, Rama I bestowed on them the titles [[Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon]].\n\nThe Myanmarese proceeded to capture [[Songkhla]]. Upon hearing the news, the governors of [[Phatthalung]] fled. However, a monk named Phra Maha encouraged the citizens of the area to take up arms against the Myanmarese, his campaign was also successful. Phra Maha was later raised to the nobility by Rama I.\n\nAs his armies were destroyed, Bodawpaya retreated. The next year, he attacked again, this time constituting his troops as a single army. With this force Bodawpaya passed through the Three Pagoda Pass and settled in Ta Din Dang (Three Pagoda Pass.) The Front Palace marched the Siamese forces to face Bodawpaya. The fighting was very short and Bodawpaya was quickly defeated. This short war was called the \"[[Ta Din Dang campaign]]\".\n\n====Economics, culture and religion====\n[[File:Temple of the Emerald Buddha 2012.JPG|280px|thumb|right|[[Wat Phra Kaew]] seen from the Outer Court of [[Grand Palace]].]]\nChinese immigration increased during Rama I's reign, as he maintained Taksin's policy of allowing Chinese immigration to sustain the country's economy. The Chinese were found mainly in the trading and mercantile sector, and by the time his son and grandson came to the throne, European explorers noted that Bangkok was filled with Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] of all sizes.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Thailand|year=2005|author=[[Chris Baker (writer)|Chris Baker]], [[Pasuk Phongpaichit]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofthailan00bake/page/32 32\u201333]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81615-7|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthailan00bake/page/32}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PB Grand Palace Bangkok.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Temple of the Emerald Buddha]], one of the king's many construction projects.]]\nRama I moved the capital from Thonburi, which was founded by his predecessor Taksin, and built the new capital, [[Bangkok]]. During the first few years prior to the founding of the capital, he oversaw the construction of the palaces and the Chapel Royal. The Chapel Royal or [[Wat Phra Kaew]], where the [[Emerald Buddha]] is enshrined, is on the grounds of his [[Grand Palace]]. With the completion of the new capital, Rama I held a ceremony naming the new capital.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sculptures from Thailand: 16.10.82\u201312.12.82, Hong Kong Museum|author=Urban Council|pages=33|publisher=[[University of California]]|isbn=|author-link=Urban Council}}</ref>\n\nIn 1804, Rama I began the compilation of the [[Three Seals Law]], consisting of old Ayutthayan laws collected and organized.<ref name=\"JSS_043_1c\">{{cite journal|last1= Dhani Nivat|first1= Prince|year= 1955|title= The Reconstruction of Rama I of the Chakri Dynasty|journal= Journal of the Siam Society|volume= 43|issue= 1|publisher= Siam Society Heritage Trust|url= http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1951/JSS_043_1c_PrinceDhaniNivat_ReconstructionOfRamaI.pdf|accessdate= 17 January 2013|quote= First page of the Law Code of 1805|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161018212459/http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1951/JSS_043_1c_PrinceDhaniNivat_ReconstructionOfRamaI.pdf|archive-date= 18 October 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>{{rp|9, 30}}) He also initiated a reform of government and the style of kingship.\n\n[[File:WatPhraKeaw Ramayana Chariot.JPG|thumb|275px|[[Hanuman]] on his chariot, a [[mural]] scene from the [[Ramakien]] in Wat Phra Kaew.]]\nRama I was also noted for instituting major reforms in Buddhism as well as restoring moral discipline among the monks of the country, which had gradually eroded with the fall of Ayutthaya. Monks had already dabbled in superstitions when he first came to power, and Rama I implemented a law which required a monk who wished to travel to another principality for further education to present a certificate bearing his personal particulars, which would establish a monk ''[[wikt:bona fides|bona fides]]'' and that he had been properly ordained.

Missionaries who were expelled during Taksin's reign were invited back to Siam. Catholic missionary activities then continued in Siam. Reportedly the numbers of local Catholics increased steadily to thousands as their churches were protected, gaining freedom to propagate their beliefs again.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sspxasia.com/Newsletters/2002/Oct-Dec/Catholic_Church_in_Thailand.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506093556/http://www.sspxasia.com/Newsletters/2002/Oct-Dec/Catholic_Church_in_Thailand.htm |archive-date=6 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Peace (1809\u20131824) ===\n[[File:Buddha Loetla Nabhalai portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Rama II of Siam|Phra Phutthaloetla Naphalai]] (Rama II)]]\n\n{{Main|Rama II of Siam}}\n\nThe reign of Rama I's son Phutthaloetla Naphalai (now known as King [[Rama II of Siam|Rama II]]) was relatively uneventful. The Chakri family now controlled all branches of Siamese government \u2014 since Rama I had 42 children, his brother the Uparat had 43, and Rama II had 73, there was no shortage of royal princes to staff the bureaucracy, the army, the senior monk-hood, and the provincial governments. (Most of these were the children of concubines and thus not eligible to inherit the throne.) There was a confrontation with Vietnam, now becoming a major power in the region, over control of Cambodia in 1813, ending with the ''status quo ante'' restored. But during Rama II's reign Western influences again began to be felt in Siam.\n\nIn 1786 the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] occupied [[Penang]], and in 1819 they founded [[Singapore]]. Soon the British displaced the Dutch and Portuguese as the main Western economic and political influence in Siam. The British objected to the Siamese economic system, in which trading monopolies were held by royal princes and businesses were subject to arbitrary taxation. In 1821, the [[East India Company]]'s [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], then [[Governor-General of India]], sent company agent [[John Crawfurd#Siam mission|John Crawfurd on a mission]] to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam \u2014 the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|title=The Crawford Papers \u2014 A Collection of Official Records relating to the Mission of Dr. John Crawfurd sent to Siam by the Government of India in the year 1821|date=1971|page=285|publisher=Cambridge Journals Online|work=Cambridge.org|accessdate=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927143143/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|archive-date=27 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Art and literature====\n[[File:Sunrise on Hat Saikaew, Koh Samet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Phra Aphai Mani]] statue on [[Ko Samet]]]]\n{{see also|Sunthon Phu}}\n\nRama II was a lover of the arts and in particular the literary arts. He was an accomplished poet and anyone with the ability to write a refined piece of poetry would gain the favor of the king. This led to his being dubbed the \"poet king\". Due to his patronage, the poet Sunthon Phu was able to raise his [[Thai royal and noble titles|noble title]] from \"phrai\" to \"khun\" and later \"phra\". Sunthon \u2013 also known as the drunken writer \u2013 wrote numerous works, including the epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]''.\n\nRama II rewrote much of the great literature from the reign of Rama I in a modern style. He is credited with writing a popular version of the Thai folk tale [[Ramakien]] and wrote a number of dance dramas such as [[Sang Thong]]. The king was an accomplished musician, playing and composing for the fiddle and introducing new instrumental techniques. He was also a sculptor and is said to have sculpted the face of the Niramitr Buddha in [[Wat Arun]]. Because of his artistic achievements, Rama II's birthday is now celebrated as National Artists' Day (Wan Sinlapin Haeng Chat), held in honor of artists who have contributed to the cultural heritage of the kingdom.\n\n===Consolidation (1824\u20131851) ===\n[[File:Map of the Rattanakosin Kingdom.svg|thumb|Zone of influence of the early Rattanakosin Kingdom (King Rama III)]]\n[[File:Rama III.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of King [[Nangklao]] (Rama III). The king fought massive wars against Cambodia and Vietnam.]]\n{{Main|Rama III}}\nRama II died in 1824 and was peacefully succeeded by his son Prince Jessadabondindra, who reigned as King Phra Nangklao, now known as [[Rama III]]. Rama II's younger son, [[Mongkut]], was \"encouraged\" to become a monk, removing him from politics.\n\nIn 1825 the British sent another mission to Bangkok led by [[East India Company]] emissary [[Henry Burney]]. They had by now annexed southern Myanmar and were thus Siam's neighbors to the west, and they were also extending their control over [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. The king was reluctant to give in to British demands,<!--What were the British demands?--> but his advisors warned him that Siam would meet the same fate as Myanmar unless the British were accommodated. In 1826, therefore, Siam concluded its first commercial treaty with a Western power, the [[Burney Treaty]]. Under the treaty, Siam agreed to establish a uniform taxation system, to reduce taxes on foreign trade, and to abolish some royal monopolies. As a result, Siam's trade increased rapidly, many more foreigners settled in Bangkok, and Western cultural influences began to spread. The kingdom became wealthier and its army better armed.\n\nA Lao rebellion led by [[Anouvong]] was defeated in 1827, following which Siam destroyed [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], carried out massive forced population transfers from Laos to the more securely held area of [[Isan]], and divided the Lao mueang into smaller units to prevent another uprising. In 1842\u20131845 Siam waged a successful war with Vietnam, which tightened Siamese rule over Cambodia. Rama III's most visible legacy in Bangkok is the [[Wat Pho]] temple complex, which he enlarged and endowed with new temples.\n\nRama III regarded his brother Mongkut, who was said to be very popular among the British, as his heir, although as a monk, Mongkut could not openly assume this role. He used his long sojourn as a monk to acquire a Western education from French and American missionaries and British merchants, one of the first Siamese to do so. He learned English and Latin, and studied science and mathematics. The missionaries no doubt hoped to convert him to Christianity, but he was a strict Buddhist and a Siamese nationalist. He intended using this Western knowledge to strengthen and modernize Siam when he came to the throne, which he did in 1851.\n\nBy the 1840s it was obvious that Siamese independence was in danger from the colonial powers: this was shown dramatically by the British [[First Opium War]] with China in 1839\u20131842. In 1850 the British and Americans sent missions to Bangkok demanding the end of all restrictions on trade, the establishment of a Western-style government and immunity for their citizens from Siamese law ([[extraterritoriality]]). Rama III's government refused these demands, leaving his successor with a dangerous situation. Rama III reportedly said on his deathbed: \"[T]here will be no more wars with Myanmar and Vietnam. We will have them only with the West.\"<ref>{{Cite book |author=David K.

Rattanakosin's rulers welcomed the Chinese economic stimulus. Some ethnic Chinese merchants became court officials. Chinese culture was accepted and promoted. Many Chinese works were translated by ethnic Chinese court dignitaries. Siam's relationship with the Chinese Empire was strong. Rama I claimed his blood-relation with Taksin, worrying that the Chinese court might reject his approval.<!--??--> The relationship was guaranteed by the tributary missions, continuing until the [[Rama IV]]'s reign.\n\n===Enlightenment (1851\u20131868) ===\n[[File:Thomson, King Mongkut of Siam.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Photograph of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) in western style uniform]]\n{{Main|Mongkut}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Siam (1855).svg|thumb|left|A white elephant, facing the hoist, centered on a red field. National ensign decreed by King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV)|186x186px]]\n\nMongkut came to the throne as [[Rama IV]] in 1851, determined to prevent Siam from falling under colonial domination by forcing modernization on his reluctant subjects. But although he was in theory an absolute monarch, his power was limited. Having been a monk for 27 years, he lacked a base among the powerful royal princes, and did not have a modern state apparatus to carry out his wishes. His first attempts at reform, to establish a modern system of administration and to improve the status of debt-slaves and women, were frustrated.\n\nRama IV came to welcome Western intrusion in Siam. The king himself and his entourages were actively pro-British. This became evident in 1855 when a mission led by the Governor of [[Hong Kong]], [[John Bowring|Sir John Bowring]], arrived in Bangkok with demands for immediate changes, backed by the threat of force. The king readily agreed to demands for a new treaty, called the [[Bowring Treaty]], which restricted import duties to three percent, abolished royal trade monopolies, and granted extraterritoriality to British subjects. Other Western powers soon demanded and got similar concessions.\n\nThe king came to believe that the real threat to Siam came from the French, not the British. The British were interested in commercial advantage, the French in building a colonial empire. They occupied [[Saigon]] in 1859, and 1867 established a [[protectorate]] over southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. Rama IV hoped that the British would defend Siam if he gave them the economic concessions they demanded. In the next reign this would prove to be an illusion, but it is true that the British saw Siam as a useful buffer state between British Burma and [[French Indochina]].\n\n====Dhammayuttika Nikaya====\n[[File:Old_dhammayut_seal.jpg|upright|thumb|Old Dhammayuttika seal]]\n[[File:Mongkut in the Sangha.jpeg|upright|thumb|Mongkut observing precepts]]\n{{Main|Dhammayuttika Nikaya}}\n\nThe instrument of Mongkut's religious reformation was a new Buddhist order, the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]].

Rama V was the first Siamese king to have a full Western education, having been taught by a British governess, [[Anna Leonowens]] \u2013 whose place in Siamese history has been fictionalized as ''[[The King and I]]''.  At first Rama V's reign was dominated by the conservative regent, Chaophraya [[Si Suriyawongse]], but when the king came of age in 1873 he soon took control. He created a Privy Council and a Council of State, a formal court system and budget office. He announced that slavery would be gradually abolished and debt-bondage restricted.\n\n{{listen\n|filename=\n|title=\"Sansoen Phra Barami\" (Glorify his prestige)\n|description= \"[[Sansoen Phra Barami]]\"  ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e35}}, lit: glorify his prestige) the [[Royal anthem]] of Siam, beginning in Rama V reign.\n}}\nAt first the princes and conservatives successfully resisted the king's reform agenda, but as the older generation was replaced by younger, Western-educated princes, resistance faded. He found powerful allies in his brothers Prince [[Chakkraphat]], whom he made finance minister, Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Damrong]], who organized interior government and education, and his brother-in-law Prince [[Devrawongse]], foreign minister for 38 years. In 1887 Devrawonge visited Europe to study governmental systems. On his recommendation the king established cabinet government, an audit office, and an education department. The semi-autonomous status of Chiang Mai was ended and the army was reorganized and modernized.\n\n[[File:Map of Siam (territorial cessions).svg|thumb|Territorial claims abandoned by Siam in the late-19th and early-20th centuries]]\n\nIn 1893 French authorities in Indochina used a minor border dispute to provoke a crisis. French gunboats appeared at Bangkok and demanded the cession of Lao territories east of the [[Mekong]]. The king appealed to the British, but the British minister told the king to settle on whatever terms he could get. The king had no choice but to comply. Britain's only gesture was an agreement with France guaranteeing the integrity of the rest of Siam. In exchange, Siam had to give up its claim to the Tai-speaking Shan region of northeastern Myanmar to the British.\n\nThe French, however, continued to pressure Siam, and in 1906\u20131907 they manufactured another crisis. This time Siam had to concede French control of territory on the west bank of the Mekong opposite Luang Prabang and around [[Champasak (town)|Champasak]] in southern Laos, as well as western Cambodia. The British interceded to prevent more French pressure on Siam, but their price, in 1909 was the acceptance of British sovereignty over of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Perlis]], and [[Terengganu]] under [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]].  All of these \"lost territories\" were on the fringes of the Siamese sphere of influence and had never been securely under their control, but being compelled to abandon all claim to them was a substantial humiliation to both king and country. Historian [[David K. Wyatt]] describes Chulalongkorn as \"broken in spirit and health\" following the 1893 crisis. It became the basis for the country's name change: with the loss of these territories ''Great Siam'' was no more, the king now ruled only the core \"Thai lands\".\n\nMeanwhile, reform continued unabated, transforming an absolute monarchy based on traditional relationships of power into a modern, centralized nation state. The process was increasingly under the control of Rama V's European-educated sons. Railways and telegraph lines united previously remote and semi-autonomous provinces. The currency was tied to the [[gold standard]] and a modern system of taxation replaced the arbitrary levies and corvee labor of the past. The biggest problem was the shortage of trained civil servants, and many foreigners had to be employed until new schools could be built and Siamese graduates produced. By 1910, when the king died, Siam had become a semi-modern country and continued to escape colonial rule.\n\n===From kingdom to modern nation (1910\u20131925) ===\n[[File:King Vajiravudh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI), supported nationalism and modernization]]\n{{Main|Vajiravudh}}\n\nOne of Rama V's reforms was to introduce a Western-style law of royal succession, so in 1910 he was peacefully succeeded by his son Vajiravudh, who reigned as [[Rama VI]]. He had been educated at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] military academy and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was an anglicized Edwardian gentleman. Indeed, one of Siam's problems was the widening gap between the Westernized royal family and upper aristocracy and the rest of the country. It took another 20 years for Western education to permeate the bureaucracy and the army.\n\nThere had been some political reform under Rama V, but the king was still an absolute monarch, who acted as the head of the cabinet and staffed all the agencies of the state with his own relatives. The new king [[Vajiravudh]], the son of Rama V, with his British education, knew that the rest of the \"new\" nation could not be excluded from government forever, but he had no faith in Western-style democracy. He applied his observations of the success of the British monarchy ruling India, appearing more in public and instituting more royal ceremonies. However Rama VI also carried on his father's modernization plan.\n\nBangkok became more and more the capital of the new nation of Siam. Rama VI's government began several nationwide development projects, despite financial hardship. New roads, bridges, [[State Railway of Thailand|railways]], [[Royal Thai Army#Army Medical Department|hospitals]] and schools mushroomed throughout the country with funds from Bangkok. Newly created \"viceroys\" were appointed to the newly restructured \"Region\", or ''[[Monthon]]'' (Circle), as king's agents supervising administrative affairs in the provinces.\n\nThe king established the ''Wild Tiger Corps'', or ''Kong Suea Pa'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32}}), a [[paramilitary]] organization of Siamese of \"good character\" united to further the nation's cause. He also created a junior branch which continues today as the [[National Scout Organization of Thailand]]. The king spent much time on the development of the movements as he saw it as an opportunity to create a bond between himself and loyal citizens. It was also a way to single out and honor his favorites. At first the Wild Tigers were drawn from the king's personal entourage (it is likely that many joined to gain favor with Vajiravudh), but an enthusiasm among the population arose later.\n\nOf the adult movement, a German observer wrote in September 1911: \"This is a troop of volunteers in black uniform, drilled in a more or less military fashion, but without weapons. The British [[Scouting|Scouts]] are apparently the paradigm for the Tiger Corps. In the whole country, at the most far-away places, units of this corps are being set up. One would hardly recognize the quiet and phlegmatic Siamese.\"\n\nThe paramilitary movement largely disappeared by 1927, but was revived and evolved into the [[Village Scouts|Volunteer Defense Corps]], also called the Village Scouts. ({{lang|th|\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|title=Southern Thailand: The Problem with Paramilitaries|publisher=Asia Report|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=27 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229092046/http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]] in Bangkok]]\n\nVajiravudh's style of government differed from that of his father. In the beginning of the sixth reign, the king continued to use his father's team and there was no sudden break in the daily routine of government. Much of the running of daily affairs was therefore in the hands of experienced and competent men. To them and their staff Siam owed many progressive steps, such as the development of a national plan for the education of the whole populace, the setting up of clinics where free vaccination was given against smallpox, and the continuing expansion of railways.\n\nHowever, senior posts were gradually filled with members of the king's coterie when a vacancy occurred through death, retirement, or resignation. By 1915, half the cabinet consisted of new faces. Most notable was Chao Phraya Yomarat's presence and Prince Damrong's absence. He resigned from his post as Minister of the Interior officially because of ill health, but in actuality because of friction between himself and the king.\n\n====Educational reform====\nRama VI was the first king of Siam to set up a model of the constitution at Dusit Palace.  He wanted first to see how things could be managed under this Western system. He saw advantages in the system, and thought that Siam could move slowly towards it, but could not be adopted right away as the majority of the Siamese people did not have enough education to understand such a change just yet. In 1916 [[higher education]] came to Siam. Rama VI set up [[Vajiravudh College]], modeled after the British [[Eton College]], as well as the first Thai university, [[Chulalongkorn University]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Bing Soravij BhiromBhakdi|url=http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|title=Rama VI of the Chakri Dynasty|publisher=The Siamese Collection|accessdate=18 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027093258/http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> modeled after [[Oxbridge]].\n\n<gallery class=\"central\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Vajiravudh College, Thailand, main school building.jpg|Vajiramonkut Building, [[Vajiravudh College]].\nFile:\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e14\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e15 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 (4).JPG|Vajiravudh College.\nFile:Maha Chulalongkorn B.jpg|Maha Chulalongkorn Building, [[Chulalongkorn University]].\n</gallery>\n\n====World War I====\n\n{{Main|Siam during World War I}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:170px; border:solid #ccc 1px; margin:5px;\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:State Flag of Thailand (1916).svg|170px]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Flag of Thailand.svg|170px]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 5px 0 5px; font-size:85%; line-height:14px;\"|King Rama VI by royal command changed the national flag of Siam in 1917 from the white elephant on a red background to a design with colors inspired by those of the Allies.<br>\n|}\n[[File:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|The Siamese Expeditionary Force during [[World War I]] in Paris, 1919.]]\n\nIn 1917 Siam declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], mainly to curry favor with the British and the French. Siam's token participation in World War I secured it a seat at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and Foreign Minister [[Devawongse]] used this opportunity to argue for the repeal of  19th century treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919. There was also concern that the king had no son. He obviously preferred the company of men to women (which did not offend Siamese sensibilities so much as undermine the stability of the monarchy due to the absence of heirs){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}.\n\nThus when Rama VI died suddenly in 1925, aged only 44, the monarchy was in a weakened state. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Prajadhipok]].\n\n===The end of absolute rule (1925\u20131932) ===\n[[File:King Prajadhipok portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII), unexpectedly came to the throne in 1925.]]\n{{Main|Prajadhipok}}\n\nUnprepared for his new responsibilities, all Prajadhipok had in his favor was a lively intelligence, a charming diplomacy in his dealings with others, modesty and industrious willingness to learn, and the somewhat tarnished, but still potent, allure of the crown.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, the king diligently read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens. Within half a year, only three of Vajiravhud's twelve ministers stayed put, the rest having been replaced by members of the royal family. On the one hand, these appointments brought back men of talent and experience; on the other, it signaled a return to royal oligarchy. The king obviously wanted to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and the choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.\n\nThe legacy that Prajadhipok received from his elder brother were problems of the sort that had become chronic in the Sixth Reign. The most urgent of these was the economy: the finances of the state were in chaos, the budget heavily in deficit, and the royal accounts a nightmare of debts and questionable transactions. That the rest of the world was deep in the [[Great Depression]] following World War I did not help the situation either.\n\nVirtually the first act of Prajadipok as king entailed an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, the creation of the [[Supreme Council of State of Siam|Supreme Council of the State]]. This privy council was made up of a number of experienced and extremely competent members of the royal family, including the longtime Minister of the Interior (and  Chulalongkorn's right-hand man) Prince Damrong. Gradually these princes arrogated increasing power by monopolizing all the main ministerial positions. Many of them felt it their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but it was not generally appreciated.\n\nWith the help of this council, the king managed to restore stability to the economy, although at a price of making a significant number of the civil servants redundant and cutting the salary of those that remained. This was obviously unpopular among the officials, and was one of the trigger events for the coup of 1932.\n\nPrajadhipok then turned his attention to the question of future politics in Siam. Inspired by the British example, the king wanted to allow the common people to have a say in the country's affair by the creation of a parliament. A proposed constitution was ordered to be drafted, but the king's wishes were rejected by his advisers, who felt that the population was not yet ready for democracy.\n\n====Revolution====\n[[File:Soldiers Siam 1932.gif|thumb|left|Group of soldiers standing on [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] waiting for orders during the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|Revolution, 24 June 1932]]]]\n{{Main|Siamese revolution of 1932}}\n\nIn 1932, with the country deep in depression, the Supreme Council opted to introduce cuts in spending, including the military budget. The king foresaw that these policies might create discontent, especially in the army, and he therefore convened a special meeting of officials to explain why the cuts were necessary. In his address he stated the following, \"I myself know nothing at all about finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best... If I have made a mistake, I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\"\n\nNo previous monarch of Siam had ever spoken in such terms. Many interpreted the speech not as Prajadhipok apparently intended, namely as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation. They saw it as a sign of his weakness and evidence that a system which perpetuated the rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished. Serious political disturbances were threatened in the capital, and in April the king agreed to introduce a constitution under which he would share power with a prime minister. This was not enough for the radical elements in the army, however. On 24 June 1932, while the king was at the seaside, the Bangkok garrison mutinied and seized power, led by a group of 49 officers known as \"[[Khana Ratsadon]]\". Thus ended 800 years of [[Monarchy of Thailand#Origin|absolute monarchy]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|History of Thai clothing#Rattanakosin}}\n[[File:King Chulalongkorn wearing raj pattern.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of King Chulalongkorn wearing the ''raj pattern'' costume]]\n\n====Old Rattanakosin====\nAs same as Ayutthaya period, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called ''[[Chang kben|chong kraben]]''.

The second period was one of engagements with the [[colonialism|colonial]] powers of Britain and France in which Siam remained the only [[Southeast Asia]]n state to maintain its independence.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |title        = Rattanakosin Period (1782 -present)\n |publisher    = GlobalSecurity.org\n |accessdate   = 1 November 2015\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151107223323/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |archive-date = 7 November 2015\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nInternally the kingdom developed into a modern centralized [[nation state]] with borders defined by interactions with Western powers. Economic and social progress was made, marked by an increase in foreign trade, the abolition of [[slavery]] and the expansion of formal education to the emerging [[middle class]]. However, the failure to implement substantial political reforms culminated in the [[1932 revolution]] and the abandonment of absolute monarchy in favor of a constitutional monarchy.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chao Phraya Chakri, later Phutthayotfa Chulalok or [[Rama I]].]]\n[[File:Bangkok (early Rattanakosin) map.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of [[Bangkok]] in the early Rattanakosin period.]]\n[[File:Old Bangkok canals.gif|thumb|right|View of 19th-century Bangkok with the [[Wat Saket|Golden Mount]] in the background.|250px]]\n{{Main|History of Bangkok|Thonburi Kingdom}}\nIn 1767, after dominating Southeast Asia for almost four centuries, [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] was [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)|brought down]] by invading Myanmarese armies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|title=Historic City of Ayutthaya|publisher=\u00a9 UNESCO World Heritage Center|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023061657/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|archive-date=23 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDespite its complete defeat and subsequent occupation by the [[Konbaung dynasty]], Siam made a rapid recovery. The resistance to Myanmarese rule was led by a noble of [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]], [[Taksin]], a military leader. Initially based at [[Chanthaburi]] in the southeast, within a year, he had defeated the Myanmarese occupation army and reestablished a Siamese state with its capital at [[Thonburi]] on the west bank of the Chao Phraya, 20&nbsp;km from the sea. In 1768 he was crowned as Taksin. He re-united the [[central Thailand|central Thai]] heartlands under his rule, and in 1769 he also occupied western [[Cambodia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=The Thon Buri and Early Bangkok periods|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe then marched south and reestablished Siamese rule over the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far as [[Penang]] and [[Terengganu]]. Having secured his base in Siam, [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376)|Taksin attacked the Myanmarese in the north in 1774]] and captured [[Chiang Mai]] in 1776, permanently uniting Siam and [[Lannathai|Lanna]]. Taksin's leading general in this campaign was [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Thong Duang]], known by the title ''Chaophraya'' or Lord Chakri was himself a descendant of [[Mon people]]. In 1778 Chakri led a Siamese army which captured [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], also [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]], a northern Lao kingdom submitted, and eventually established Siamese domination over Laotian kingdoms.\n\nDespite these successes, by 1779 Taksin was in political trouble at home. He seems to have developed a religious mania, alienating the powerful Buddhist monk-hood by claiming to be a ''[[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|sotapanna]]'' or divine figure. He was also in troubles with the court officials, Chinese merchants, and missionaries. The foreign observers began to speculate that he would soon be overthrown. In 1782 Taksin sent his armies under Chakri, the future [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of Rattanakosin, to invade Cambodia, but while they were away a rebellion broke out in the area around the capital. The rebels, who had popular support, offered the throne to General Chakri, the 'supreme general'. Chakri who was on war duty marched back from Cambodia and deposed Taksin, who was purportedly 'secretly executed' shortly after.\n\nChakri ruled under the name Ramathibodi (he was posthumously given the name Phutthayotfa Chulalok), but is now generally known as [[Rama I]], first king of the later known [[Chakri dynasty]]. One of his first decisions was to move the capital across the river to the village of Bang Makok (meaning \"place of [[Spondias|olive plum]]s\").  The new capital was located on the [[Rattanakosin Island|island of Rattanakosin]], protected from attack by the river to the west and by a series of [[Khlong|canals]] to the north, east and south. Siam thus acquired both its current dynasty and its current capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=THE EARLY CHAKRI KINGS AND A RESURGENT SIAM|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Foundation (1782\u20131809) ===\n{{Main|Rama I}}\nRama I who was himself of [[Mon people|Mon]], Thai and [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_098_0i_VanRoy_ProminentMonLineages.pdf |title=Prominent Mon Lineages from Late Ayutthaya to Early Bangkok |publisher=Siamese-heritage.org |accessdate=27 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052427/http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_098_0i_VanRoy_ProminentMonLineages.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Dilokwanich/> restored most of the social and political system of the Ayutthaya kingdom, promulgating new law codes, reinstating court ceremonies<ref name = \"Wales\">{{cite book |last= Wales |first= H.

His government was carried out by six great ministries ([[Thai royal and noble titles#Krom|Krom]]) headed by royal princes. Four of these administered particular territories: the [[Kalahom]] the south; the [[Mahatthai]] the north and east; the [[Phrakhlang]] the area immediately south of the capital; and the Krom [[Mueang]], the area around Bangkok. The other two were the ministry of lands (Krom Na) and the ministry of the royal court (Krom Wang). The army was controlled by the King's deputy and brother, the [[Uparat]].\n\nThe Myanmarese, seeing the disorder accompanying the overthrow of Taksin, invaded Siam again in 1785. Rama allowed them to occupy both the north and the south, but the ''Uparat'', ''vice-king'', his brother, led the Siamese army into western Siam and crushed the Myanmarese forces in a battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. This was the last major Myanmarese invasion of Siam, although as late as 1802 Myanmarese forces had to be driven out of Lanna. In 1792 the Siamese occupied [[Luang Prabang]] and brought most of Laos under indirect Siamese rule. Cambodia was also effectively ruled by Siam. By the time of his death in 1809 Rama I had created a Siamese overlordship dominating an area considerably larger than modern Thailand.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMJ8KP8i3v0C&pg=PA1653&lpg=PA1653&dq=invaded+Siam+again+in+1785#v=onepage |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations: S-Z by Cathal J.

[[Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh]], the only member of the Nguy\u1ec5n family still alive, managed to escape across the river to Siam. While in exile Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh wished to retake Gia Dinh and push the Tay-Son rebels out.  He convinced the neutral King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] of [[Siam]] to provide him with support troops and a small invasion force.\n\nIn mid-1784 Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh, with 50,000 [[Siam]]ese troops and 300 ships, moved through Cambodia, then East of Tonl\u00e9 Sap and penetrated the recently annexed provinces of Annam. 20,000 Siamese troops reached Kien Giang and another 30,000 landed in Chap Lap, as the Siamese advanced towards [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]]. Later that year the Siamese captured the former Cambodian province of Gia Dinh where, it was claimed, they committed atrocities against the population of Viet settlers.\n\n[[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7]] anticipating a move from the Siamese, had secretly positioned his infantry along the [[Ti\u1ec1n river]] near present-day [[M\u1ef9 Tho]], and on some islands in the middle, facing other troops on the northern banks with naval reinforcements on both sides of the infantry positions.\n\nOn the morning of 19 January Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 sent a small naval force, under a banner of truce, to lure the Siamese into his trap. After so many victories, the Siamese army and naval forces were confident of a surrender.  So, they went to the parley, unaware of the trap. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops dashed into the Siamese formation, slaughtered the unarmed emissaries and turned on the unprepared troops. The battle ended with a near annihilation of the Siamese force.  All the ships of the Siamese navy were destroyed and only 1,000 of the original expedition survived to escape back across the river into Siam.\n\n====Wars with Myanmar====\n{{main|Nine Armies War}}\nSoon King [[Bodawpaya]] of Myanmar started to pursue his ambitious campaigns to expand his dominions over Siam. The [[Burmese-Siamese War (1785\u20131786)]], also known in Siam as the \"Nine Armies War\" because the Myanmarese came in nine armies, thus broke out. The Myanmarese soldiers poured into Lanna and Northern Siam. Siamese forces, commanded by [[Kawila]], Prince of [[Lampang]], put up a brave fight and delayed the Myanmarese advance, all the while waiting for reinforcements from Bangkok. When [[Phitsanulok]] was captured, [[Anurak Devesh]] the ''Rear Palace'', and Rama I himself led Siamese forces to the north. The Siamese relieved Lampang from the Myanmarese siege.\n\nIn the south, Bodawpaya was waiting at [[Three Pagodas Pass|Chedi Sam Ong]] ready to attack. The Front Palace was ordered to lead his troops to the south and counter-attack the Myanmarese coming to [[Ranong]] through [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. He brought the Myanmarese to battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. The Myanmarese also attacked Thalang ([[Phuket city|Phuket]]), where the governor had just died. His wife Chan, and her sister Mook, gathered the local people and successfully defended Thalang against the Myanmarese. Today, Chan and Mook are revered as heroines because of their opposition to the Myanmarese invasions. In their own lifetimes, Rama I bestowed on them the titles [[Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon]].\n\nThe Myanmarese proceeded to capture [[Songkhla]]. Upon hearing the news, the governors of [[Phatthalung]] fled. However, a monk named Phra Maha encouraged the citizens of the area to take up arms against the Myanmarese, his campaign was also successful. Phra Maha was later raised to the nobility by Rama I.\n\nAs his armies were destroyed, Bodawpaya retreated. The next year, he attacked again, this time constituting his troops as a single army. With this force Bodawpaya passed through the Three Pagoda Pass and settled in Ta Din Dang (Three Pagoda Pass.) The Front Palace marched the Siamese forces to face Bodawpaya. The fighting was very short and Bodawpaya was quickly defeated. This short war was called the \"[[Ta Din Dang campaign]]\".\n\n====Economics, culture and religion====\n[[File:Temple of the Emerald Buddha 2012.JPG|280px|thumb|right|[[Wat Phra Kaew]] seen from the Outer Court of [[Grand Palace]].]]\nChinese immigration increased during Rama I's reign, as he maintained Taksin's policy of allowing Chinese immigration to sustain the country's economy. The Chinese were found mainly in the trading and mercantile sector, and by the time his son and grandson came to the throne, European explorers noted that Bangkok was filled with Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] of all sizes.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Thailand|year=2005|author=[[Chris Baker (writer)|Chris Baker]], [[Pasuk Phongpaichit]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofthailan00bake/page/32 32\u201333]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81615-7|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthailan00bake/page/32}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PB Grand Palace Bangkok.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Temple of the Emerald Buddha]], one of the king's many construction projects.]]\nRama I moved the capital from Thonburi, which was founded by his predecessor Taksin, and built the new capital, [[Bangkok]]. During the first few years prior to the founding of the capital, he oversaw the construction of the palaces and the Chapel Royal.

Monks had already dabbled in superstitions when he first came to power, and Rama I implemented a law which required a monk who wished to travel to another principality for further education to present a certificate bearing his personal particulars, which would establish a monk ''[[wikt:bona fides|bona fides]]'' and that he had been properly ordained.

The Chakri family now controlled all branches of Siamese government \u2014 since Rama I had 42 children, his brother the Uparat had 43, and Rama II had 73, there was no shortage of royal princes to staff the bureaucracy, the army, the senior monk-hood, and the provincial governments. (Most of these were the children of concubines and thus not eligible to inherit the throne.) There was a confrontation with Vietnam, now becoming a major power in the region, over control of Cambodia in 1813, ending with the ''status quo ante'' restored. But during Rama II's reign Western influences again began to be felt in Siam.\n\nIn 1786 the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] occupied [[Penang]], and in 1819 they founded [[Singapore]]. Soon the British displaced the Dutch and Portuguese as the main Western economic and political influence in Siam. The British objected to the Siamese economic system, in which trading monopolies were held by royal princes and businesses were subject to arbitrary taxation. In 1821, the [[East India Company]]'s [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], then [[Governor-General of India]], sent company agent [[John Crawfurd#Siam mission|John Crawfurd on a mission]] to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam \u2014 the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|title=The Crawford Papers \u2014 A Collection of Official Records relating to the Mission of Dr. John Crawfurd sent to Siam by the Government of India in the year 1821|date=1971|page=285|publisher=Cambridge Journals Online|work=Cambridge.org|accessdate=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927143143/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|archive-date=27 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Art and literature====\n[[File:Sunrise on Hat Saikaew, Koh Samet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Phra Aphai Mani]] statue on [[Ko Samet]]]]\n{{see also|Sunthon Phu}}\n\nRama II was a lover of the arts and in particular the literary arts. He was an accomplished poet and anyone with the ability to write a refined piece of poetry would gain the favor of the king. This led to his being dubbed the \"poet king\". Due to his patronage, the poet Sunthon Phu was able to raise his [[Thai royal and noble titles|noble title]] from \"phrai\" to \"khun\" and later \"phra\". Sunthon \u2013 also known as the drunken writer \u2013 wrote numerous works, including the epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]''.\n\nRama II rewrote much of the great literature from the reign of Rama I in a modern style. He is credited with writing a popular version of the Thai folk tale [[Ramakien]] and wrote a number of dance dramas such as [[Sang Thong]]. The king was an accomplished musician, playing and composing for the fiddle and introducing new instrumental techniques. He was also a sculptor and is said to have sculpted the face of the Niramitr Buddha in [[Wat Arun]]. Because of his artistic achievements, Rama II's birthday is now celebrated as National Artists' Day (Wan Sinlapin Haeng Chat), held in honor of artists who have contributed to the cultural heritage of the kingdom.\n\n===Consolidation (1824\u20131851) ===\n[[File:Map of the Rattanakosin Kingdom.svg|thumb|Zone of influence of the early Rattanakosin Kingdom (King Rama III)]]\n[[File:Rama III.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of King [[Nangklao]] (Rama III). The king fought massive wars against Cambodia and Vietnam.]]\n{{Main|Rama III}}\nRama II died in 1824 and was peacefully succeeded by his son Prince Jessadabondindra, who reigned as King Phra Nangklao, now known as [[Rama III]]. Rama II's younger son, [[Mongkut]], was \"encouraged\" to become a monk, removing him from politics.\n\nIn 1825 the British sent another mission to Bangkok led by [[East India Company]] emissary [[Henry Burney]]. They had by now annexed southern Myanmar and were thus Siam's neighbors to the west, and they were also extending their control over [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. The king was reluctant to give in to British demands,<!--What were the British demands?--> but his advisors warned him that Siam would meet the same fate as Myanmar unless the British were accommodated. In 1826, therefore, Siam concluded its first commercial treaty with a Western power, the [[Burney Treaty]]. Under the treaty, Siam agreed to establish a uniform taxation system, to reduce taxes on foreign trade, and to abolish some royal monopolies. As a result, Siam's trade increased rapidly, many more foreigners settled in Bangkok, and Western cultural influences began to spread. The kingdom became wealthier and its army better armed.\n\nA Lao rebellion led by [[Anouvong]] was defeated in 1827, following which Siam destroyed [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], carried out massive forced population transfers from Laos to the more securely held area of [[Isan]], and divided the Lao mueang into smaller units to prevent another uprising. In 1842\u20131845 Siam waged a successful war with Vietnam, which tightened Siamese rule over Cambodia. Rama III's most visible legacy in Bangkok is the [[Wat Pho]] temple complex, which he enlarged and endowed with new temples.\n\nRama III regarded his brother Mongkut, who was said to be very popular among the British, as his heir, although as a monk, Mongkut could not openly assume this role. He used his long sojourn as a monk to acquire a Western education from French and American missionaries and British merchants, one of the first Siamese to do so. He learned English and Latin, and studied science and mathematics. The missionaries no doubt hoped to convert him to Christianity, but he was a strict Buddhist and a Siamese nationalist. He intended using this Western knowledge to strengthen and modernize Siam when he came to the throne, which he did in 1851.\n\nBy the 1840s it was obvious that Siamese independence was in danger from the colonial powers: this was shown dramatically by the British [[First Opium War]] with China in 1839\u20131842. In 1850 the British and Americans sent missions to Bangkok demanding the end of all restrictions on trade, the establishment of a Western-style government and immunity for their citizens from Siamese law ([[extraterritoriality]]). Rama III's government refused these demands, leaving his successor with a dangerous situation. Rama III reportedly said on his deathbed: \"[T]here will be no more wars with Myanmar and Vietnam. We will have them only with the West.\"<ref>{{Cite book |author=David K.

Rattanakosin's rulers welcomed the Chinese economic stimulus. Some ethnic Chinese merchants became court officials. Chinese culture was accepted and promoted. Many Chinese works were translated by ethnic Chinese court dignitaries. Siam's relationship with the Chinese Empire was strong. Rama I claimed his blood-relation with Taksin, worrying that the Chinese court might reject his approval.<!--??--> The relationship was guaranteed by the tributary missions, continuing until the [[Rama IV]]'s reign.\n\n===Enlightenment (1851\u20131868) ===\n[[File:Thomson, King Mongkut of Siam.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Photograph of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) in western style uniform]]\n{{Main|Mongkut}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Siam (1855).svg|thumb|left|A white elephant, facing the hoist, centered on a red field. National ensign decreed by King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV)|186x186px]]\n\nMongkut came to the throne as [[Rama IV]] in 1851, determined to prevent Siam from falling under colonial domination by forcing modernization on his reluctant subjects. But although he was in theory an absolute monarch, his power was limited. Having been a monk for 27 years, he lacked a base among the powerful royal princes, and did not have a modern state apparatus to carry out his wishes. His first attempts at reform, to establish a modern system of administration and to improve the status of debt-slaves and women, were frustrated.\n\nRama IV came to welcome Western intrusion in Siam. The king himself and his entourages were actively pro-British. This became evident in 1855 when a mission led by the Governor of [[Hong Kong]], [[John Bowring|Sir John Bowring]], arrived in Bangkok with demands for immediate changes, backed by the threat of force. The king readily agreed to demands for a new treaty, called the [[Bowring Treaty]], which restricted import duties to three percent, abolished royal trade monopolies, and granted extraterritoriality to British subjects. Other Western powers soon demanded and got similar concessions.\n\nThe king came to believe that the real threat to Siam came from the French, not the British. The British were interested in commercial advantage, the French in building a colonial empire. They occupied [[Saigon]] in 1859, and 1867 established a [[protectorate]] over southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. Rama IV hoped that the British would defend Siam if he gave them the economic concessions they demanded. In the next reign this would prove to be an illusion, but it is true that the British saw Siam as a useful buffer state between British Burma and [[French Indochina]].\n\n====Dhammayuttika Nikaya====\n[[File:Old_dhammayut_seal.jpg|upright|thumb|Old Dhammayuttika seal]]\n[[File:Mongkut in the Sangha.jpeg|upright|thumb|Mongkut observing precepts]]\n{{Main|Dhammayuttika Nikaya}}\n\nThe instrument of Mongkut's religious reformation was a new Buddhist order, the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]].

Rama V was the first Siamese king to have a full Western education, having been taught by a British governess, [[Anna Leonowens]] \u2013 whose place in Siamese history has been fictionalized as ''[[The King and I]]''.  At first Rama V's reign was dominated by the conservative regent, Chaophraya [[Si Suriyawongse]], but when the king came of age in 1873 he soon took control. He created a Privy Council and a Council of State, a formal court system and budget office. He announced that slavery would be gradually abolished and debt-bondage restricted.\n\n{{listen\n|filename=\n|title=\"Sansoen Phra Barami\" (Glorify his prestige)\n|description= \"[[Sansoen Phra Barami]]\"  ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e35}}, lit: glorify his prestige) the [[Royal anthem]] of Siam, beginning in Rama V reign.\n}}\nAt first the princes and conservatives successfully resisted the king's reform agenda, but as the older generation was replaced by younger, Western-educated princes, resistance faded. He found powerful allies in his brothers Prince [[Chakkraphat]], whom he made finance minister, Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Damrong]], who organized interior government and education, and his brother-in-law Prince [[Devrawongse]], foreign minister for 38 years. In 1887 Devrawonge visited Europe to study governmental systems. On his recommendation the king established cabinet government, an audit office, and an education department. The semi-autonomous status of Chiang Mai was ended and the army was reorganized and modernized.\n\n[[File:Map of Siam (territorial cessions).svg|thumb|Territorial claims abandoned by Siam in the late-19th and early-20th centuries]]\n\nIn 1893 French authorities in Indochina used a minor border dispute to provoke a crisis. French gunboats appeared at Bangkok and demanded the cession of Lao territories east of the [[Mekong]]. The king appealed to the British, but the British minister told the king to settle on whatever terms he could get. The king had no choice but to comply. Britain's only gesture was an agreement with France guaranteeing the integrity of the rest of Siam. In exchange, Siam had to give up its claim to the Tai-speaking Shan region of northeastern Myanmar to the British.\n\nThe French, however, continued to pressure Siam, and in 1906\u20131907 they manufactured another crisis. This time Siam had to concede French control of territory on the west bank of the Mekong opposite Luang Prabang and around [[Champasak (town)|Champasak]] in southern Laos, as well as western Cambodia. The British interceded to prevent more French pressure on Siam, but their price, in 1909 was the acceptance of British sovereignty over of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Perlis]], and [[Terengganu]] under [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]].  All of these \"lost territories\" were on the fringes of the Siamese sphere of influence and had never been securely under their control, but being compelled to abandon all claim to them was a substantial humiliation to both king and country. Historian [[David K. Wyatt]] describes Chulalongkorn as \"broken in spirit and health\" following the 1893 crisis. It became the basis for the country's name change: with the loss of these territories ''Great Siam'' was no more, the king now ruled only the core \"Thai lands\".\n\nMeanwhile, reform continued unabated, transforming an absolute monarchy based on traditional relationships of power into a modern, centralized nation state. The process was increasingly under the control of Rama V's European-educated sons. Railways and telegraph lines united previously remote and semi-autonomous provinces. The currency was tied to the [[gold standard]] and a modern system of taxation replaced the arbitrary levies and corvee labor of the past. The biggest problem was the shortage of trained civil servants, and many foreigners had to be employed until new schools could be built and Siamese graduates produced. By 1910, when the king died, Siam had become a semi-modern country and continued to escape colonial rule.\n\n===From kingdom to modern nation (1910\u20131925) ===\n[[File:King Vajiravudh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI), supported nationalism and modernization]]\n{{Main|Vajiravudh}}\n\nOne of Rama V's reforms was to introduce a Western-style law of royal succession, so in 1910 he was peacefully succeeded by his son Vajiravudh, who reigned as [[Rama VI]]. He had been educated at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] military academy and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was an anglicized Edwardian gentleman. Indeed, one of Siam's problems was the widening gap between the Westernized royal family and upper aristocracy and the rest of the country. It took another 20 years for Western education to permeate the bureaucracy and the army.\n\nThere had been some political reform under Rama V, but the king was still an absolute monarch, who acted as the head of the cabinet and staffed all the agencies of the state with his own relatives. The new king [[Vajiravudh]], the son of Rama V, with his British education, knew that the rest of the \"new\" nation could not be excluded from government forever, but he had no faith in Western-style democracy. He applied his observations of the success of the British monarchy ruling India, appearing more in public and instituting more royal ceremonies. However Rama VI also carried on his father's modernization plan.\n\nBangkok became more and more the capital of the new nation of Siam. Rama VI's government began several nationwide development projects, despite financial hardship. New roads, bridges, [[State Railway of Thailand|railways]], [[Royal Thai Army#Army Medical Department|hospitals]] and schools mushroomed throughout the country with funds from Bangkok. Newly created \"viceroys\" were appointed to the newly restructured \"Region\", or ''[[Monthon]]'' (Circle), as king's agents supervising administrative affairs in the provinces.\n\nThe king established the ''Wild Tiger Corps'', or ''Kong Suea Pa'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32}}), a [[paramilitary]] organization of Siamese of \"good character\" united to further the nation's cause. He also created a junior branch which continues today as the [[National Scout Organization of Thailand]]. The king spent much time on the development of the movements as he saw it as an opportunity to create a bond between himself and loyal citizens. It was also a way to single out and honor his favorites. At first the Wild Tigers were drawn from the king's personal entourage (it is likely that many joined to gain favor with Vajiravudh), but an enthusiasm among the population arose later.\n\nOf the adult movement, a German observer wrote in September 1911: \"This is a troop of volunteers in black uniform, drilled in a more or less military fashion, but without weapons. The British [[Scouting|Scouts]] are apparently the paradigm for the Tiger Corps. In the whole country, at the most far-away places, units of this corps are being set up. One would hardly recognize the quiet and phlegmatic Siamese.\"\n\nThe paramilitary movement largely disappeared by 1927, but was revived and evolved into the [[Village Scouts|Volunteer Defense Corps]], also called the Village Scouts. ({{lang|th|\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|title=Southern Thailand: The Problem with Paramilitaries|publisher=Asia Report|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=27 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229092046/http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]] in Bangkok]]\n\nVajiravudh's style of government differed from that of his father. In the beginning of the sixth reign, the king continued to use his father's team and there was no sudden break in the daily routine of government. Much of the running of daily affairs was therefore in the hands of experienced and competent men. To them and their staff Siam owed many progressive steps, such as the development of a national plan for the education of the whole populace, the setting up of clinics where free vaccination was given against smallpox, and the continuing expansion of railways.\n\nHowever, senior posts were gradually filled with members of the king's coterie when a vacancy occurred through death, retirement, or resignation. By 1915, half the cabinet consisted of new faces. Most notable was Chao Phraya Yomarat's presence and Prince Damrong's absence. He resigned from his post as Minister of the Interior officially because of ill health, but in actuality because of friction between himself and the king.\n\n====Educational reform====\nRama VI was the first king of Siam to set up a model of the constitution at Dusit Palace.  He wanted first to see how things could be managed under this Western system. He saw advantages in the system, and thought that Siam could move slowly towards it, but could not be adopted right away as the majority of the Siamese people did not have enough education to understand such a change just yet. In 1916 [[higher education]] came to Siam. Rama VI set up [[Vajiravudh College]], modeled after the British [[Eton College]], as well as the first Thai university, [[Chulalongkorn University]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Bing Soravij BhiromBhakdi|url=http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|title=Rama VI of the Chakri Dynasty|publisher=The Siamese Collection|accessdate=18 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027093258/http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> modeled after [[Oxbridge]].\n\n<gallery class=\"central\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Vajiravudh College, Thailand, main school building.jpg|Vajiramonkut Building, [[Vajiravudh College]].\nFile:\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e14\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e15 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 (4).JPG|Vajiravudh College.\nFile:Maha Chulalongkorn B.jpg|Maha Chulalongkorn Building, [[Chulalongkorn University]].\n</gallery>\n\n====World War I====\n\n{{Main|Siam during World War I}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:170px; border:solid #ccc 1px; margin:5px;\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:State Flag of Thailand (1916).svg|170px]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Flag of Thailand.svg|170px]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 5px 0 5px; font-size:85%; line-height:14px;\"|King Rama VI by royal command changed the national flag of Siam in 1917 from the white elephant on a red background to a design with colors inspired by those of the Allies.<br>\n|}\n[[File:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|The Siamese Expeditionary Force during [[World War I]] in Paris, 1919.]]\n\nIn 1917 Siam declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], mainly to curry favor with the British and the French. Siam's token participation in World War I secured it a seat at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and Foreign Minister [[Devawongse]] used this opportunity to argue for the repeal of  19th century treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919. There was also concern that the king had no son. He obviously preferred the company of men to women (which did not offend Siamese sensibilities so much as undermine the stability of the monarchy due to the absence of heirs){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}.\n\nThus when Rama VI died suddenly in 1925, aged only 44, the monarchy was in a weakened state. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Prajadhipok]].\n\n===The end of absolute rule (1925\u20131932) ===\n[[File:King Prajadhipok portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII), unexpectedly came to the throne in 1925.]]\n{{Main|Prajadhipok}}\n\nUnprepared for his new responsibilities, all Prajadhipok had in his favor was a lively intelligence, a charming diplomacy in his dealings with others, modesty and industrious willingness to learn, and the somewhat tarnished, but still potent, allure of the crown.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, the king diligently read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens. Within half a year, only three of Vajiravhud's twelve ministers stayed put, the rest having been replaced by members of the royal family. On the one hand, these appointments brought back men of talent and experience; on the other, it signaled a return to royal oligarchy. The king obviously wanted to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and the choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.\n\nThe legacy that Prajadhipok received from his elder brother were problems of the sort that had become chronic in the Sixth Reign. The most urgent of these was the economy: the finances of the state were in chaos, the budget heavily in deficit, and the royal accounts a nightmare of debts and questionable transactions. That the rest of the world was deep in the [[Great Depression]] following World War I did not help the situation either.\n\nVirtually the first act of Prajadipok as king entailed an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, the creation of the [[Supreme Council of State of Siam|Supreme Council of the State]]. This privy council was made up of a number of experienced and extremely competent members of the royal family, including the longtime Minister of the Interior (and  Chulalongkorn's right-hand man) Prince Damrong. Gradually these princes arrogated increasing power by monopolizing all the main ministerial positions. Many of them felt it their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but it was not generally appreciated.\n\nWith the help of this council, the king managed to restore stability to the economy, although at a price of making a significant number of the civil servants redundant and cutting the salary of those that remained. This was obviously unpopular among the officials, and was one of the trigger events for the coup of 1932.\n\nPrajadhipok then turned his attention to the question of future politics in Siam. Inspired by the British example, the king wanted to allow the common people to have a say in the country's affair by the creation of a parliament. A proposed constitution was ordered to be drafted, but the king's wishes were rejected by his advisers, who felt that the population was not yet ready for democracy.\n\n====Revolution====\n[[File:Soldiers Siam 1932.gif|thumb|left|Group of soldiers standing on [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] waiting for orders during the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|Revolution, 24 June 1932]]]]\n{{Main|Siamese revolution of 1932}}\n\nIn 1932, with the country deep in depression, the Supreme Council opted to introduce cuts in spending, including the military budget. The king foresaw that these policies might create discontent, especially in the army, and he therefore convened a special meeting of officials to explain why the cuts were necessary. In his address he stated the following, \"I myself know nothing at all about finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best... If I have made a mistake, I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\"\n\nNo previous monarch of Siam had ever spoken in such terms. Many interpreted the speech not as Prajadhipok apparently intended, namely as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation. They saw it as a sign of his weakness and evidence that a system which perpetuated the rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished. Serious political disturbances were threatened in the capital, and in April the king agreed to introduce a constitution under which he would share power with a prime minister. This was not enough for the radical elements in the army, however. On 24 June 1932, while the king was at the seaside, the Bangkok garrison mutinied and seized power, led by a group of 49 officers known as \"[[Khana Ratsadon]]\". Thus ended 800 years of [[Monarchy of Thailand#Origin|absolute monarchy]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|History of Thai clothing#Rattanakosin}}\n[[File:King Chulalongkorn wearing raj pattern.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of King Chulalongkorn wearing the ''raj pattern'' costume]]\n\n====Old Rattanakosin====\nAs same as Ayutthaya period, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called ''[[Chang kben|chong kraben]]''.

Decades of dumping toxic chemicals harmed the health of hundreds of residents;<ref name=\":0\" /> the area was cleaned up over the course of 21 years in [[Superfund]] operation.\n\nIn 1890, Love Canal was created as a model [[planned community]], but was only partially developed. In the 1920s, the canal became a dump site for municipal refuse for the city of Niagara Falls. During the 1940s, the canal was purchased by [[Hooker Chemical Company]], now [[Occidental Chemical Corporation]], which used the site to dump 21,800 short tons of chemical byproducts from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.\n\nLove Canal was sold to the [[Niagara Falls City School District|local school district]] in 1953, after the threat of [[eminent domain]]. Over the next three decades, it attracted national attention for the public health problem originating from the former dumping of toxic waste on the grounds. This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with longstanding health issues and symptoms of high [[white blood cell]] counts and [[leukemia]]. Subsequently, the federal government passed the [[Superfund]] law. The resulting Superfund cleanup operation demolished the neighborhood, ending during 2004.\n\nIn 1988, [[New York State Department of Health]] Commissioner [[David Axelrod (physician)|David Axelrod]] called the Love Canal incident a \"national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations\".<ref>{{cite web | first =  Sam How | last = Verhovek | title = After 10 Years, the Trauma of Love Canal Continues | work = The New York Times | date = August 5, 1988 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D9143CF936A3575BC0A96E948260 | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>  The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants \"overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFhfAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Road to Love Canal: Managing Industrial Waste before EPA|last=Colten|first=Craig E.|last2=Skinner|first2=Peter N.|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0292711839|location=Texas|page=153|access-date=2017-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402091909/https://books.google.com/books?id=OFhfAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2017-04-02|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[University of Buffalo]] Archives house a number of primary documents, photographs, and news clippings pertaining to the Love Canal environmental disaster; many items have been digitized and are viewable online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/|title=Love Canal Collections - University Archives - University at Buffalo Libraries|website=library.buffalo.edu|access-date=2018-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206190152/https://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/|archive-date=2018-02-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nLove Canal is a neighborhood located in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] in the northwestern region of [[New York (state)|New York state]].

Love, an ambitious entrepreneur from the [[Western Railways and Light Company|Western Railroad Corporation,]] envisioned a perfect urban area called \"[[Model City, New York|Model City]]\". He prepared plans to construct a community of parks and residences on the banks of [[Lake Ontario]], believing it would serve the area's burgeoning industries with much-needed hydroelectricity.<ref>Parry, David W., Dept. of Architecture, SUNY at Buffalo. \"William T.

Love quickly arranged backing from financial banks in [[New York City]], Chicago, and England. During October 1893, the first factory opened for business. In May 1894, work on the canal had begun.

The deathblow came with the development of the transmission of electrical power over great distances by means of an alternating current. No longer was it necessary for the industry to locate near the source of electrical power.\n\nLove's financial backers deserted him, and the last piece of the properties owned by his corporation was subjected to mortgage foreclosure and sold at public auction in 1910.\n\nWith the project abandoned, the canal gradually filled with water.<ref name=\"Berton\" /> The local children swam there during summers and skated during the winters. In the 1920s, the canal became a [[dump site]] for the City of Niagara Falls, with the city regularly unloading its municipal refuse into the landfill.\n\nIndustry and tourism increased steadily throughout the first half of the 20th century due to a great demand for industrial products and the increased mobility of people to travel. Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals, carbon insulators, and abrasives composed the city's major industries. This prosperity would end by the late 1960s as aging industrial plants were relocated to less expensive locations.\n\n==Love Canal disaster==\n=== Pre-disaster state of town ===\nAt the time of the dump's closure in 1952, Niagara Falls was experiencing prosperity, and the population had been expanding dramatically, growing by 31% in twenty years (1940-1960) from 78,020 to 102,394.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=us+census,+niagara+falls&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ5P7ArMjUAhXH5oMKHbwtBNAQvwUIJSgA&biw=1366&bih=638|title=us census, niagara falls - Google Search|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Hooker Chemical Company ===\nBy the end of the 1940s, [[Hooker Chemical Company]] was searching for a place to dispose its large quantity of [[chemical waste]].

With a growing population, the [[Niagara Falls City School District]] needed land to build new schools and attempted to purchase the property from Hooker Chemical.

Murray, suggesting that the sale could alleviate them from future liabilities for the buried chemicals:\n\n{{quote|The more we thought about it, the more interested Wilcox and I became in the proposition, and finally came to the conclusion that the Love Canal property is rapidly becoming a liability because of housing projects in the near vicinity of our property.

Colton and Peter N. Skinner, \"Hooker assigned the board with a continuing duty to protect property buyers from chemicals when the company itself accepted no such 'moral obligation'.\"{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=159}} The transfer effectively ended what provision of security and maintenance for the hazardous waste had existed before and placed all responsibility in clearly unqualified hands. It was this attempt to evade their responsibility, Colten and Skinner contend, that would \"ultimately come back to haunt not only Hooker but all other chemical producers in the United States through the strict liability provisions of Superfund legislation.\"{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=157, 159, 161}} However, Eric Zeusse writes that Hooker's decision to sell the property rather than allowing the school board to condemn it stemmed from a desire to document its warnings. \"Had the land been condemned and seized, says Hooker, the company would have been unable to air its concerns to all future owners of the property. It is difficult to see any other reason for what it did.\"<ref name = \"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/>\n\nNot long after having taken control of the land, the Niagara Falls School Board proceeded to develop the land, including construction activity that substantially breached containment structures in a number of ways, allowing previously trapped chemicals to seep out.\n\nThe resulting breaches combined with particularly heavy rainstorms released and spread the chemical waste, resulting in a [[public health]] emergency and an [[urban planning]] scandal. In what became a test case for liability clauses, Hooker Chemical was found to be \"negligent\" in their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land. The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978.\n\n[[File:Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.pdf|thumb|Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.]]\n\n===Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street School===\nDespite the disclaimer, the School Board began construction of the \"99th Street School\" in its originally intended location. In January 1954, the school's architect wrote to the education committee informing them that during excavation, workers discovered two dump sites filled with {{convert|55|USgal||adj=on}} drums containing chemical wastes. The architect also noted it would be \"poor policy\" to build in that area since it was not known what wastes were present in the ground, and the concrete [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] might be damaged.<ref>Levine, p.12</ref> The school board then relocated the school site {{convert|80 to 85|ft||spell=in}} further north.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=153}} The kindergarten playground also had to be relocated because it was directly on top of a chemical dump.\n\nUpon completion in 1955, 400 children attended the school, and it opened along with several other schools that had been built to accommodate students. That same year, a twenty-five-foot area crumbled exposing toxic chemical drums, which then filled with water during rainstorms. This created large puddles that children enjoyed playing in.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=153}} In 1955, a second school, the 93rd Street School, was opened six blocks away.\n\n===Usage by the schools===\nDuring 1957, the City of Niagara Falls constructed sewers for a mixture of low-income and single family residences to be built on lands adjacent to the landfill site. The school district had sold the remaining land, resulting in homes constructed by private developers, as well as the Niagara Falls Housing Authority.

protest by Love Canal residents, ca. 1978.]]\nIn 1976, two reporters for the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', David Pollak and David Russell, tested several [[sump pump]]s near Love Canal and found toxic chemicals in them. The ''Gazette'' published reports, once in October 1976 and once in November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/about/chronology.php|title=Love Canal Chronologies - Love Canal Collections - University Archives - University at Buffalo Libraries|website=library.buffalo.edu|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222185203/http://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/about/chronology.php|archive-date=2017-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> The matter became quiet for more than a year and was then revived by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by performing an informal door-to-door survey during early 1978, writing a hundred news items on toxic wastes in the area and finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was organized by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department investigated and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages. Brown discovered the size of the canal, the presence of dioxin, the expanding contamination, and the involvement, to an extent, of the U.S. Army. Hooker threatened to sue him and he fought the firm tooth and nail for years, including on the Today Show. His book on toxic wastes, Laying Waste: The Poisoning of America By Toxic Chemicals (Pantheon), was the first written on the subject of toxic wastes and created a national firestorm, as did articles of his in The New York Times Magazine and The Atlantic Monthly. He also discovered a massive dump called the Hyde Park landfill (or Bloody Run) and the \"S-Area,\" which was leaking into the water supply for Niagara Falls. His work inspired many activists. He spoke for ten years on the college lecture circuit.\n\nBy 1978, Love Canal had become a national media event with articles referring to the neighborhood as \"a public health time bomb\", and \"one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history\".<ref name=\"epa1\" />  Brown, working for the local newspaper, the ''Niagara Gazette'', is credited with not only revealing the case, but establishing toxic chemical wastes as a nationwide issue as well.  Brown's book, ''Laying Waste'', examined the Love Canal disaster and many other toxic waste catastrophes nationwide.<ref>Brown, Michael, ''Laying Waste:  The Poisoning of America by Toxic Chemicals.''  New York:  Washington Square Press, 1981, ii.</ref>\n\nThe dumpsite was declared an unprecedented state emergency on August 2, 1978. Brown, who wrote more than a hundred articles concerning the dump, tested the groundwater and later found the dump was three times larger than originally thought, with possible ramifications beyond the original evacuation zone. He was also to discover that toxic [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] were there.\n\n=====Activism tactics=====\nActivism at Love Canal was initially organized by community residents Tom Heiser and [[Lois Gibbs]], with Lois Gibbs often serving as spokesperson.  Gibbs' strategies emphasized concerns for children and families of the affected area, with women taking the most prominent public and active roles{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.  Many men also helped women in these efforts, though not always publicly{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}. Men who were hesitant to oppose Hooker Chemical openly for example, were able to contribute to the movement through increased contributions to family labor in the absence of their activist wives.<ref>''E. Blum, Love Canal Revisited: Race, Class, and Gender in Environmental Activism (2008)''</ref>\n\nIn addition to community organizing and pressuring authorities for appropriate responses, direct-action forms of activism were employed.  Tactics included protests and rallies, which were intentionally timed and planned in an effort to maximize media attention.  Such events included \"controversial\" methods such as mothers protesting while pushing strollers, marching by pregnant women, and children holding protest signs.  Notably, two EPA employees were also held hostage by activists for approximately five hours at the LCHA office, in order to bring their demands to the attention of the federal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicintegrity.org/environment/from-homemaker-to-hell-raiser-in-love-canal/|title=From homemaker to hell-raiser in Love Canal|website=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2019-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224231550/https://publicintegrity.org/environment/from-homemaker-to-hell-raiser-in-love-canal/|archive-date=2019-02-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Role of community organizations=====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\nNumerous organizations were formed in response to the crisis at Love Canal, with members' activism emphasizing variously overlapping interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html|title=Love Canal Revisited|website=kansaspress.ku.edu|access-date=2018-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511081736/https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html|archive-date=2018-05-11|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to the Love Canal Homeowners Association ([[Love Canal#Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association|LCHA]]), other major organizations are the Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). These organizations are often overlooked in the story of Love Canal, according to research by Elizabeth Blum in '[https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html 'Love Canal Revisited']'.\n\nThe Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF) was a religious organization composed of volunteers from the surrounding area. In conjunction with other citizens' groups such as LCHA and LCARA, the ETF used their resources to promote environmental health and gender, class, and racial equality. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[NAACP]] became involved with the Love Canal issue after William Abrams Sr., president of the Niagara Falls chapter drew concerns to his wife's fatal liver failure. Abrams involvement drew attention to racial inequality present in the community and concerns about how this could affect comprehensive relocation efforts. Abrams contacted the regional NAACP director who announced that discrimination against minorities at Love Canal would be met with legal action. This involvement inspired additional support and activism, particularly on behalf of members of the renting community, many of whom were also members of the African-American and immigrant communities at the site. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAnother subgroup of local residents formed the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). This group's action sought to address the needs of the (largely, but not exclusively, African-American) renter community, whose interests were at times perceived to be in conflict with those of some members of the (predominantly white) property owners represented by the LCHA. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1980 [[Lois Gibbs]] established the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice as a continuation of her activism at Love Canal. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==== Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ====\nOn August 2, 1978, [[Lois Gibbs]], a local mother who called an election to head the Love Canal Homeowners' Association, began to rally homeowners. Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in September 1977. He developed [[epilepsy]] in December, suffered from [[asthma]] and a [[urinary tract infection]], and had a low [[white blood cell]] count,<ref name=\"gibbsheroproj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html|title=Heroism Project - 1970s - Lois Gibbs|author=|date=|website=www.heroism.org|access-date=2007-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006195542/http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=26}} all associated with his exposure to the leaking chemical waste. Gibbs had learned from Brown that her neighborhood sat atop the buried chemical waste.<ref name=\"goldman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103|title=Goldman Environmental Prize - Lois Gibbs|author=|date=|website=goldmanprize.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023204/http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103|archivedate=2007-10-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the following years, Gibbs organized an effort to investigate community concerns about the health of its residents. She and other residents made repeated complaints of strange odors and \"substances\" that surfaced in their yards. In Gibbs' neighborhood, there was a high rate of unexplained illnesses, miscarriages, and intellectual disability.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=21}} Basements were often covered with a thick, black substance, and vegetation was dying.  In many yards, the only vegetation that grew were shrubby grasses.<ref>Levine, p.14</ref> Although city officials were asked to investigate the area, they did not act to solve the problem. Niagara Falls mayor Michael O'Laughlin infamously stated that there was \"nothing wrong\" in Love Canal.\n\nWith further investigation, Gibbs discovered the chemical danger of the adjacent canal. This began her organization's two-year effort to demonstrate that the waste buried by Hooker Chemical was responsible for the health problems of local residents. Throughout the ordeal, homeowners' concerns were ignored not only by Hooker Chemical (now a subsidiary of [[Occidental Petroleum]]), but also by members of government. These parties argued that the area's endemic health problems were unrelated to the toxic chemicals buried in the Canal. Since the residents could not prove the chemicals on their property had come from Hooker's disposal site, they could not prove [[legal liability|liability]]. Throughout the legal battle, residents were unable to sell their properties and relocate.\n\n==== Federal response ====\nOn August 7, 1978, United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced a federal health emergency, called for the allocation of federal funds, and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} This was the first time in American history that emergency funds were used for a situation other than a natural disaster.<ref name=\"epa.gov\">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Eckardt C.|title=The Love Canal Tragedy|work=EPA Journal|date=January 1979|url=http://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|accessdate=February 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408141141/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|archive-date=April 8, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>  Carter had trenches built that would transport the wastes to sewers and had home [[sump pump]]s sealed off.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}}\n\n[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), better known as the [[Superfund]] Act. Love Canal became the first entry on the list.<ref name=\"Depalma\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/18/nyregion/love-canal-declared-clean-ending-toxic-horror.html|title=Love Canal Declared Clean, Ending Toxic Horror|last=Depalma|first=Anthony|date=2004-03-18|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-16|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217204323/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/18/nyregion/love-canal-declared-clean-ending-toxic-horror.html|archive-date=2017-02-17|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Superfund|CERCLA]] created a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and provided broad Federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment. CERCLA also created a [[National Priorities List]], a shortened list of the sites that has priority in cleanup. Love Canal was the first Superfund site on that list. Eventually, the site was cleaned and deleted off the list in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290|title=EPA Superfund Program: LOVE CANAL, NIAGARA FALLS, NY|last=|first=|date=|website=CERCLA|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]]|access-date=18 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201085600/http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Because the Superfund Act contained a \"retroactive liability\" provision, Occidental was held liable for cleanup of the waste even though it had followed all applicable U.S. laws when disposing of it.\n\n==== Health effects ====\nAt first, scientific studies did not conclusively prove the chemicals were responsible for the residents' illnesses yet scientists were divided on the issue, even though eleven known or suspected [[carcinogens]] had been identified, one of the most prevalent being [[benzene]]. Also present was dioxin ([[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]]) in the water, a very hazardous substance. Dioxin pollution is usually measured in [[parts per trillion]]; at Love Canal, water samples showed dioxin levels of 53 [[parts per billion]] (53,000 parts per trillion).{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} [[Geologist]]s were recruited to determine whether underground [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]] were responsible for carrying the chemicals to the surrounding residential areas. Once there, chemicals could [[soil contamination|leach]] into [[basement]]s and evaporate into [[Indoor air quality|household air]].\n\nIn 1979, the EPA announced the result of [[blood test]]s which showed high [[white blood cell]] counts, a precursor to [[leukemia]],<ref name=\"epa1\" /> and [[chromosome]] damage in Love Canal residents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} Other studies were unable to find harm.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid =  7233229 | volume=212 | title=Cancer incidence in the Love Canal area | year=1981 | journal=Science | pages=1404\u20137  | last1 = Janerich | first1 = DT | last2 = Burnett | first2 = WS | last3 = Feck | first3 = G | last4 = Hoff | first4 = M | last5 = Nasca | first5 = P | last6 = Polednak | first6 = AP | last7 = Greenwald | first7 = P | last8 = Vianna | first8 = N}} \"Data from the New York Cancer Registry show no evidence for higher cancer rates associated with residence near the Love Canal toxic waste burial site in comparison with the entire state outside of New York City.\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cen-v058n032.p022 | volume=58 | title=Uncertain science pushes Love Canal solutions to political, legal arenas | year=1980 | journal=Chemical & Engineering News | pages=22\u201329 | last1 = Ember | first1 = Lois R.}}  Relates the chronology of Hooker Chemical Company and the discovery of toxic chemicals at Love Canal and describes the medical research on the former residents to determine the health effects.</ref><ref>Maugh, Thomas H., 11.

Love Canal can now be added to a growing list of environmental disasters involving toxics, ranging from industrial workers stricken by [[anxiety disorder|nervous disorders]] and [[cancer]]s to the discovery of toxic materials in the milk of nursing mothers.\" In one case, two out of four children in a single Love Canal family had [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]]; one girl was born [[hearing impairment|deaf]] with a [[cleft palate]], an extra row of teeth, and slight [[mental retardation|retardation]], and a boy was born with an eye defect.<ref name=epa1>{{cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/love-canal-tragedy.html|title=The Love Canal Tragedy|first=US|last=EPA, OA, OEAEE, OWC|date=|website=archive.epa.gov|access-date=2017-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610141257/https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/love-canal-tragedy.html|archive-date=2017-06-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n[[File:Love Canal (5621742089).jpg|thumb|Love Canal residents discuss revitalizing their contaminated neighborhood with EPA Administrator [[Lee M. Thomas]] in 1985.]]\nWhen Eckhardt C. Beck (EPA Administrator for Region 2, 1977 \u2013 1979) visited Love Canal during the late 1970s, he discerned the presence of toxic substances in the community:\n\n{{quote|I visited the canal area at that time. Corroding waste-disposal drums could be seen breaking up through the grounds of backyards. Trees and gardens were turning black and dying. One entire swimming pool had been popped up from its foundation, afloat now on a small sea of chemicals. Puddles of noxious substances were pointed out to me by the residents. Some of these puddles were in their yards, some were in their basements, others yet were on the school grounds. Everywhere the air had a faint, choking smell. Children returned from play with burns on their hands and faces.<ref name=epa1 />}}\n\nRobert Whalen, then-New York's Health Commissioner, also visited Love Canal and believed that the Canal constituted an emergency, stating: \"Love Canal Chemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious threat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living near it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other things, of chemical wastes lying exposed on the surface in numerous places pervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both the ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such sites.\"{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=27}} Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements as well as to avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens.  People became very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for several years.<ref>Levine, p.29</ref> Whalen urged that all pregnant women and children under the age of two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible.\n\nThe 99th Street School, on the other hand, was located within the former boundary of the Hooker Chemical landfill site. The school was closed and demolished, but both the school board and the chemical company refused to accept liability. The 93rd Street School was closed some two years later because of concerns about seeping toxic waste.\n\n==== Evacuation ====\nThe lack of public interest in Love Canal made matters worse for the homeowners' association, which was opposed by two organizations that sought to disprove negligence. Initially, members of the association had been frustrated by the lack of a public entity that could advise and defend them. Gibbs met with public resistance from a number of residents within the community. Eventually, the federal government relocated more than 800 families and reimbursed them for the loss of their homes.

In the 1920s, the canal became a dump site for municipal refuse for the city of Niagara Falls. During the 1940s, the canal was purchased by [[Hooker Chemical Company]], now [[Occidental Chemical Corporation]], which used the site to dump 21,800 short tons of chemical byproducts from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.\n\nLove Canal was sold to the [[Niagara Falls City School District|local school district]] in 1953, after the threat of [[eminent domain]]. Over the next three decades, it attracted national attention for the public health problem originating from the former dumping of toxic waste on the grounds. This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with longstanding health issues and symptoms of high [[white blood cell]] counts and [[leukemia]]. Subsequently, the federal government passed the [[Superfund]] law.

The deathblow came with the development of the transmission of electrical power over great distances by means of an alternating current. No longer was it necessary for the industry to locate near the source of electrical power.\n\nLove's financial backers deserted him, and the last piece of the properties owned by his corporation was subjected to mortgage foreclosure and sold at public auction in 1910.\n\nWith the project abandoned, the canal gradually filled with water.<ref name=\"Berton\" /> The local children swam there during summers and skated during the winters. In the 1920s, the canal became a [[dump site]] for the City of Niagara Falls, with the city regularly unloading its municipal refuse into the landfill.\n\nIndustry and tourism increased steadily throughout the first half of the 20th century due to a great demand for industrial products and the increased mobility of people to travel. Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals, carbon insulators, and abrasives composed the city's major industries.

With a growing population, the [[Niagara Falls City School District]] needed land to build new schools and attempted to purchase the property from Hooker Chemical. The population reached more than 98,000 by the 1950 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1950/population-volume-1/vol-01-35.pdf|title=Number of Inhabitants of New York|last=|first=|date=|website=Bureau of Census|access-date=March 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824122002/https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1950/population-volume-1/vol-01-35.pdf|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Sale of the site ===\nDuring March 1951, the school board prepared a plan showing a school being built over the canal and listing condemnation values for each property that would need to be acquired.<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\">{{cite web | first = Eric | last = Zuesse | title = Love Canal: The Truth Seeps Out | publisher = Reason Magazine | date = February 1981 | URL = https://reason.com/archives/1981/02/01/love-canal/print | accessdate = 2017-10-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170127105829/http://reason.com/archives/1981/02/01/love-canal/print | archive-date = 2017-01-27 | url-status = live }}</ref> During March 1952, the superintendent of [[Niagara Falls City School District|Niagara Falls School Board]] inquired of Hooker with regard to purchasing the Love Canal property for the purpose of constructing a new school.

Murray, suggesting that the sale could alleviate them from future liabilities for the buried chemicals:\n\n{{quote|The more we thought about it, the more interested Wilcox and I became in the proposition, and finally came to the conclusion that the Love Canal property is rapidly becoming a liability because of housing projects in the near vicinity of our property. A school, however, could be built in the center unfilled section (with chemicals underground).

Hooker's letter to the board agreeing to enter into negotiations noted that \"in view of the nature of the property and the purposes for which it has been used, it will be necessary for us to have special provisions incorporated into the deed with respect to the use of the property and other pertinent matters.\" The board rejected the company's proposal that the deed require the land to be used for park purposes only, with the school itself to be built nearby.<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/>\n\nAs \"a means of avoiding liability by relinquishing control of the site\", Hooker [[deed]]ed the site to the school board in 1953 for $1 with a liability limitation clause.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=161}} The sale document signed on April 28, 1953, included a seventeen-line [[Caveat emptor|caveat]] purporting to release the company from all legal obligations should lawsuits occur during the future.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=158}}{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=22}}<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Michael H.|title=Love Canal and the Poisoning of America|journal=The Atlantic|date=December 1979|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/12/love-canal-and-the-poisoning-of-america/376297/|access-date=2017-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715030152/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/12/love-canal-and-the-poisoning-of-america/376297/|archive-date=2016-07-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Prior to the delivery of this instrument of conveyance, the grantee herein has been advised by the grantor that the premises above described have been filled, in whole or in part, to the present grade level thereof with waste products resulting from the manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its plant in the City of Niagara Falls, New York, and the grantee assumes all risk and liability incident to the use thereof.

Colton and Peter N. Skinner, \"Hooker assigned the board with a continuing duty to protect property buyers from chemicals when the company itself accepted no such 'moral obligation'.\"{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=159}} The transfer effectively ended what provision of security and maintenance for the hazardous waste had existed before and placed all responsibility in clearly unqualified hands. It was this attempt to evade their responsibility, Colten and Skinner contend, that would \"ultimately come back to haunt not only Hooker but all other chemical producers in the United States through the strict liability provisions of Superfund legislation.\"{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=157, 159, 161}} However, Eric Zeusse writes that Hooker's decision to sell the property rather than allowing the school board to condemn it stemmed from a desire to document its warnings. \"Had the land been condemned and seized, says Hooker, the company would have been unable to air its concerns to all future owners of the property. It is difficult to see any other reason for what it did.\"<ref name = \"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/>\n\nNot long after having taken control of the land, the Niagara Falls School Board proceeded to develop the land, including construction activity that substantially breached containment structures in a number of ways, allowing previously trapped chemicals to seep out.\n\nThe resulting breaches combined with particularly heavy rainstorms released and spread the chemical waste, resulting in a [[public health]] emergency and an [[urban planning]] scandal. In what became a test case for liability clauses, Hooker Chemical was found to be \"negligent\" in their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land. The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978.\n\n[[File:Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.pdf|thumb|Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.]]\n\n===Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street School===\nDespite the disclaimer, the School Board began construction of the \"99th Street School\" in its originally intended location. In January 1954, the school's architect wrote to the education committee informing them that during excavation, workers discovered two dump sites filled with {{convert|55|USgal||adj=on}} drums containing chemical wastes. The architect also noted it would be \"poor policy\" to build in that area since it was not known what wastes were present in the ground, and the concrete [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] might be damaged.<ref>Levine, p.12</ref> The school board then relocated the school site {{convert|80 to 85|ft||spell=in}} further north.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=153}} The kindergarten playground also had to be relocated because it was directly on top of a chemical dump.\n\nUpon completion in 1955, 400 children attended the school, and it opened along with several other schools that had been built to accommodate students. That same year, a twenty-five-foot area crumbled exposing toxic chemical drums, which then filled with water during rainstorms. This created large puddles that children enjoyed playing in.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=153}} In 1955, a second school, the 93rd Street School, was opened six blocks away.\n\n===Usage by the schools===\nDuring 1957, the City of Niagara Falls constructed sewers for a mixture of low-income and single family residences to be built on lands adjacent to the landfill site. The school district had sold the remaining land, resulting in homes constructed by private developers, as well as the Niagara Falls Housing Authority.

protest by Love Canal residents, ca. 1978.]]\nIn 1976, two reporters for the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', David Pollak and David Russell, tested several [[sump pump]]s near Love Canal and found toxic chemicals in them. The ''Gazette'' published reports, once in October 1976 and once in November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/about/chronology.php|title=Love Canal Chronologies - Love Canal Collections - University Archives - University at Buffalo Libraries|website=library.buffalo.edu|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222185203/http://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/about/chronology.php|archive-date=2017-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> The matter became quiet for more than a year and was then revived by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by performing an informal door-to-door survey during early 1978, writing a hundred news items on toxic wastes in the area and finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was organized by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department investigated and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages. Brown discovered the size of the canal, the presence of dioxin, the expanding contamination, and the involvement, to an extent, of the U.S. Army. Hooker threatened to sue him and he fought the firm tooth and nail for years, including on the Today Show. His book on toxic wastes, Laying Waste: The Poisoning of America By Toxic Chemicals (Pantheon), was the first written on the subject of toxic wastes and created a national firestorm, as did articles of his in The New York Times Magazine and The Atlantic Monthly. He also discovered a massive dump called the Hyde Park landfill (or Bloody Run) and the \"S-Area,\" which was leaking into the water supply for Niagara Falls. His work inspired many activists. He spoke for ten years on the college lecture circuit.\n\nBy 1978, Love Canal had become a national media event with articles referring to the neighborhood as \"a public health time bomb\", and \"one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history\".<ref name=\"epa1\" />  Brown, working for the local newspaper, the ''Niagara Gazette'', is credited with not only revealing the case, but establishing toxic chemical wastes as a nationwide issue as well.  Brown's book, ''Laying Waste'', examined the Love Canal disaster and many other toxic waste catastrophes nationwide.<ref>Brown, Michael, ''Laying Waste:  The Poisoning of America by Toxic Chemicals.''  New York:  Washington Square Press, 1981, ii.</ref>\n\nThe dumpsite was declared an unprecedented state emergency on August 2, 1978. Brown, who wrote more than a hundred articles concerning the dump, tested the groundwater and later found the dump was three times larger than originally thought, with possible ramifications beyond the original evacuation zone. He was also to discover that toxic [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] were there.\n\n=====Activism tactics=====\nActivism at Love Canal was initially organized by community residents Tom Heiser and [[Lois Gibbs]], with Lois Gibbs often serving as spokesperson.  Gibbs' strategies emphasized concerns for children and families of the affected area, with women taking the most prominent public and active roles{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.  Many men also helped women in these efforts, though not always publicly{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}. Men who were hesitant to oppose Hooker Chemical openly for example, were able to contribute to the movement through increased contributions to family labor in the absence of their activist wives.<ref>''E. Blum, Love Canal Revisited: Race, Class, and Gender in Environmental Activism (2008)''</ref>\n\nIn addition to community organizing and pressuring authorities for appropriate responses, direct-action forms of activism were employed.  Tactics included protests and rallies, which were intentionally timed and planned in an effort to maximize media attention.  Such events included \"controversial\" methods such as mothers protesting while pushing strollers, marching by pregnant women, and children holding protest signs.  Notably, two EPA employees were also held hostage by activists for approximately five hours at the LCHA office, in order to bring their demands to the attention of the federal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicintegrity.org/environment/from-homemaker-to-hell-raiser-in-love-canal/|title=From homemaker to hell-raiser in Love Canal|website=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2019-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224231550/https://publicintegrity.org/environment/from-homemaker-to-hell-raiser-in-love-canal/|archive-date=2019-02-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Role of community organizations=====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\nNumerous organizations were formed in response to the crisis at Love Canal, with members' activism emphasizing variously overlapping interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html|title=Love Canal Revisited|website=kansaspress.ku.edu|access-date=2018-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511081736/https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html|archive-date=2018-05-11|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to the Love Canal Homeowners Association ([[Love Canal#Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association|LCHA]]), other major organizations are the Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). These organizations are often overlooked in the story of Love Canal, according to research by Elizabeth Blum in '[https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html 'Love Canal Revisited']'.\n\nThe Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF) was a religious organization composed of volunteers from the surrounding area. In conjunction with other citizens' groups such as LCHA and LCARA, the ETF used their resources to promote environmental health and gender, class, and racial equality. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[NAACP]] became involved with the Love Canal issue after William Abrams Sr., president of the Niagara Falls chapter drew concerns to his wife's fatal liver failure. Abrams involvement drew attention to racial inequality present in the community and concerns about how this could affect comprehensive relocation efforts. Abrams contacted the regional NAACP director who announced that discrimination against minorities at Love Canal would be met with legal action. This involvement inspired additional support and activism, particularly on behalf of members of the renting community, many of whom were also members of the African-American and immigrant communities at the site. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAnother subgroup of local residents formed the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). This group's action sought to address the needs of the (largely, but not exclusively, African-American) renter community, whose interests were at times perceived to be in conflict with those of some members of the (predominantly white) property owners represented by the LCHA. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1980 [[Lois Gibbs]] established the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice as a continuation of her activism at Love Canal. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==== Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ====\nOn August 2, 1978, [[Lois Gibbs]], a local mother who called an election to head the Love Canal Homeowners' Association, began to rally homeowners. Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in September 1977. He developed [[epilepsy]] in December, suffered from [[asthma]] and a [[urinary tract infection]], and had a low [[white blood cell]] count,<ref name=\"gibbsheroproj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html|title=Heroism Project - 1970s - Lois Gibbs|author=|date=|website=www.heroism.org|access-date=2007-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006195542/http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=26}} all associated with his exposure to the leaking chemical waste. Gibbs had learned from Brown that her neighborhood sat atop the buried chemical waste.<ref name=\"goldman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103|title=Goldman Environmental Prize - Lois Gibbs|author=|date=|website=goldmanprize.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023204/http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103|archivedate=2007-10-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the following years, Gibbs organized an effort to investigate community concerns about the health of its residents. She and other residents made repeated complaints of strange odors and \"substances\" that surfaced in their yards. In Gibbs' neighborhood, there was a high rate of unexplained illnesses, miscarriages, and intellectual disability.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=21}} Basements were often covered with a thick, black substance, and vegetation was dying.  In many yards, the only vegetation that grew were shrubby grasses.<ref>Levine, p.14</ref> Although city officials were asked to investigate the area, they did not act to solve the problem. Niagara Falls mayor Michael O'Laughlin infamously stated that there was \"nothing wrong\" in Love Canal.\n\nWith further investigation, Gibbs discovered the chemical danger of the adjacent canal. This began her organization's two-year effort to demonstrate that the waste buried by Hooker Chemical was responsible for the health problems of local residents. Throughout the ordeal, homeowners' concerns were ignored not only by Hooker Chemical (now a subsidiary of [[Occidental Petroleum]]), but also by members of government. These parties argued that the area's endemic health problems were unrelated to the toxic chemicals buried in the Canal. Since the residents could not prove the chemicals on their property had come from Hooker's disposal site, they could not prove [[legal liability|liability]]. Throughout the legal battle, residents were unable to sell their properties and relocate.\n\n==== Federal response ====\nOn August 7, 1978, United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced a federal health emergency, called for the allocation of federal funds, and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} This was the first time in American history that emergency funds were used for a situation other than a natural disaster.<ref name=\"epa.gov\">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Eckardt C.|title=The Love Canal Tragedy|work=EPA Journal|date=January 1979|url=http://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|accessdate=February 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408141141/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|archive-date=April 8, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>  Carter had trenches built that would transport the wastes to sewers and had home [[sump pump]]s sealed off.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}}\n\n[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), better known as the [[Superfund]] Act.

CERCLA also created a [[National Priorities List]], a shortened list of the sites that has priority in cleanup. Love Canal was the first Superfund site on that list. Eventually, the site was cleaned and deleted off the list in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290|title=EPA Superfund Program: LOVE CANAL, NIAGARA FALLS, NY|last=|first=|date=|website=CERCLA|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]]|access-date=18 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201085600/http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Because the Superfund Act contained a \"retroactive liability\" provision, Occidental was held liable for cleanup of the waste even though it had followed all applicable U.S. laws when disposing of it.\n\n==== Health effects ====\nAt first, scientific studies did not conclusively prove the chemicals were responsible for the residents' illnesses yet scientists were divided on the issue, even though eleven known or suspected [[carcinogens]] had been identified, one of the most prevalent being [[benzene]]. Also present was dioxin ([[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]]) in the water, a very hazardous substance. Dioxin pollution is usually measured in [[parts per trillion]]; at Love Canal, water samples showed dioxin levels of 53 [[parts per billion]] (53,000 parts per trillion).{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} [[Geologist]]s were recruited to determine whether underground [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]] were responsible for carrying the chemicals to the surrounding residential areas. Once there, chemicals could [[soil contamination|leach]] into [[basement]]s and evaporate into [[Indoor air quality|household air]].\n\nIn 1979, the EPA announced the result of [[blood test]]s which showed high [[white blood cell]] counts, a precursor to [[leukemia]],<ref name=\"epa1\" /> and [[chromosome]] damage in Love Canal residents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} Other studies were unable to find harm.<ref>''Cancer incidence in the Love Canal area.''

Thomas]] in 1985.]]\nWhen Eckhardt C. Beck (EPA Administrator for Region 2, 1977 \u2013 1979) visited Love Canal during the late 1970s, he discerned the presence of toxic substances in the community:\n\n{{quote|I visited the canal area at that time. Corroding waste-disposal drums could be seen breaking up through the grounds of backyards. Trees and gardens were turning black and dying. One entire swimming pool had been popped up from its foundation, afloat now on a small sea of chemicals. Puddles of noxious substances were pointed out to me by the residents. Some of these puddles were in their yards, some were in their basements, others yet were on the school grounds. Everywhere the air had a faint, choking smell. Children returned from play with burns on their hands and faces.<ref name=epa1 />}}\n\nRobert Whalen, then-New York's Health Commissioner, also visited Love Canal and believed that the Canal constituted an emergency, stating: \"Love Canal Chemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious threat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living near it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other things, of chemical wastes lying exposed on the surface in numerous places pervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both the ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such sites.\"{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=27}} Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements as well as to avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens.  People became very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for several years.<ref>Levine, p.29</ref> Whalen urged that all pregnant women and children under the age of two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible.\n\nThe 99th Street School, on the other hand, was located within the former boundary of the Hooker Chemical landfill site. The school was closed and demolished, but both the school board and the chemical company refused to accept liability. The 93rd Street School was closed some two years later because of concerns about seeping toxic waste.\n\n==== Evacuation ====\nThe lack of public interest in Love Canal made matters worse for the homeowners' association, which was opposed by two organizations that sought to disprove negligence. Initially, members of the association had been frustrated by the lack of a public entity that could advise and defend them. Gibbs met with public resistance from a number of residents within the community. Eventually, the federal government relocated more than 800 families and reimbursed them for the loss of their homes. The state government and federal government used $15 million to purchase 400 homes closest to Love Canal and demolished several rings of houses. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==== Litigation and compensation ====\nIn 1994, Federal District Judge [[John Thomas Curtin|John Curtin]] ruled that Hooker/Occidental had been [[Negligence|negligent]], but not reckless, in its handling of the waste and sale of the land to the [[Niagara Falls School Board]].<ref>U.S. v.

{"title_page": "Feudal earldom", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2019}}\nA '''feudal earldom''' is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] feudal title that is held ''en baroneum'', which means that its holder, who is called a feudal earl, is also always a [[Scottish feudal barony|feudal baron]].  A feudal earldom is an ancient title of [[nobility]] in Scotland. The holder may or may not be a [[Lord of Regality]], which meant that the holder was appointed by [[the Crown]] and had the power of \"pit and gallows\", meaning the power to authorise the death sentence. A feudal earl ranks above a feudal lord and a feudal baron (being a feudal baron of a higher degree), but below an earldom which is a title in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. Feudal earldoms are very rare.<ref>http://www.baronage.co.uk/2003a/fbandml.pdf</ref> As well, due to rights granted from ancient Scots law, in a very few instances, the holder of a feudal earldom may be different than the holder of a peerage title of the same name.  A peer is invariably addressed as 'Lord Placename' or 'Lord Such-and-so', whilst those holding a feudal earldom are addressed 'Earl of Placename'. Scottish titles, in order of precedence, are as follows: Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, Lord, Baronet, Knight, feudal Baron, Clan Chief, Esquire/Gentleman. Wallace states that \"Lordships, [[Feudal Earldom|Earldoms]], Marquisates and Dukedoms differ only in name from Baronies\" but continues \"one whose property was erected into a Lordship ranked before a simple Baron\" and \"A person to whom an Earldom belonged, would be superior to a person who had no more than a lordship ... One, whose lands were incorporated into a Marquisate, was superior to both ... A man, who owned a fief elevated into a Dukedom, was exulted above all three.\" <ref>Ancient Peerages, 2nd Edition, Edinburgh, 1785, pp 127-130</ref> However, [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|Lord Stair]] states that Lordships or Earldoms are \"but more noble titles of a Barony\".<ref>Institutes, II.3.45</ref>\n\n==Modern status==\nIn 2014 the Lord Lyon King of Arms issued the \"Note on the Petition of George Menking\", under which he determined to accept petitions for the grant arms for feudal dignities including Earldoms since such dignities have historically always been of the genus of a barony and as such represent a higher form of barony and fall within the jurisdiction of the King of Arms.\n\nThe Menking Note is considered an important change (and return to similar status of an earlier Lord Lyon) from an interim ruling on the petition in 2010 by a Swiss national Willi Ernst Sturzenegger, who had purchased the feudal Earldom of Arran, and wished to be titled as \" 'Sturzenegger of Arran, holder of the territorial Earldom of Arran\", or  'Sturzenegger of Arran, holder of the feudal Earldom of Arran'. In 2006, an earlier Lord Lyon had recognised three petitioners as \"Feudal Countess of Crawfurd-Lindsay\", \"Feudal Earl of Breadalbane\" and \"Feudal Earl of Rothes\". In the ruling in 2010, the Lord Lyon stated that as a general rule previous decisions should be followed, but he could not agree with them as the arguments in the previous cases did not appear to have been tested and no reasoning had been given by the prior Lord Lyon for his decisions. The title \"feudal Earl\", \"territorial Earl\", or simply \"Earl\", being used or recognised in respect of an assemblage of lands into an earldom had never existed until recently. He stated that while the ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure Act of 2000'' divorced feudal baronies from land title, it preserved the title of baron. This was not the case he found with \"territorial\" or \"feudal earldoms\": \"On the contrary there is a clear break between the type of territorial earldoms which existed before the evolution of a personal peerage, and the later erection of lands into what has been termed a \u201cterritorial earldom\u201d. I therefore do not accept that it follows from the recognition of a feudal baron, or one possessed of the dignity of a former feudal barony, as \u201cBaron of X\u201d, that the person in possession of a \u201cterritorial earldom\u201d stemming from the erection by the Crown of lands into a free earldom, should be recognised as an \u201cEarl\u201d or \u201cCountess\u201d, \u201cfeudal\u201d or otherwise.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/WES%20Note.pdf|title = Lyon Court Note|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181027/http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/WES%20Note.pdf|archive-date = 3 March 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nUnder the 2014 Menking Note, the Lord Lyon effectively revoked the 2010 restrictions on recognition of such dignities and customary title as long provided to those properly holding them. \n\n==See also==\nSee also [[Peerage of Scotland]] and [[List of feudal baronies]].\n\n==List of Feudal Earldoms (created before 1707)==\nBelow is an incomplete list of Scottish feudal earldoms created in Scotland before 1707.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Feudal earldom!!County!!Date created<sup>a</sup>!!Claimant/Holder!!Date succeeded!!Arms\n|-\n|[[Earl of Arran (Scotland)|Arran]]||[[Ayrshire]]|| ||Claimant: Herr Willi Ernst Sturzenegger; \"Petition of date 10th February 2006 brought by Willi Ernst Sturzenegger of Arran, designing himself as \"Feudal Earl of Arran\", in which he seeks official recognition \"in the name, style and dignity of Willi Ernst Sturzenegger of Arran, Feudal Earl of Arran\" with appropriate heraldic additaments\" refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms 8 October 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/WES%20Note.pdf |title=Decision of  Lord Lyon King of Arms \"Skye, 8 October 2009\" |access-date=10 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181027/http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/WES%20Note.pdf |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>In 2010 the Lord Lyon [[King of Arms]] issued an interlocutor holding that the title \"feudal earl\" cannot be recognised, and has no basis in either law or history</ref>||In 1995 he received (from the Duke of Hamilton, by way of sale) \"conveyance to him of All and Whole the Earldom of Arran including the caput thereof which grant can be traced back to an erection by the Crown of lands in unum comitatum\"<ref>Decision of  Lord Lyon King of Arms \"Skye, 8 October 2009\"</ref>||[[File:Arran arms.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of feudal Earls of Arran: ''Argent, a [[lymphad]] with the sails furled proper flagged gules''.

One, whose lands were incorporated into a Marquisate, was superior to both ... A man, who owned a fief elevated into a Dukedom, was exulted above all three.\" <ref>Ancient Peerages, 2nd Edition, Edinburgh, 1785, pp 127-130</ref> However, [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|Lord Stair]] states that Lordships or Earldoms are \"but more noble titles of a Barony\".<ref>Institutes, II.3.45</ref>\n\n==Modern status==\nIn 2014 the Lord Lyon King of Arms issued the \"Note on the Petition of George Menking\", under which he determined to accept petitions for the grant arms for feudal dignities including Earldoms since such dignities have historically always been of the genus of a barony and as such represent a higher form of barony and fall within the jurisdiction of the King of Arms.\n\nThe Menking Note is considered an important change (and return to similar status of an earlier Lord Lyon) from an interim ruling on the petition in 2010 by a Swiss national Willi Ernst Sturzenegger, who had purchased the feudal Earldom of Arran, and wished to be titled as \" 'Sturzenegger of Arran, holder of the territorial Earldom of Arran\", or  'Sturzenegger of Arran, holder of the feudal Earldom of Arran'. In 2006, an earlier Lord Lyon had recognised three petitioners as \"Feudal Countess of Crawfurd-Lindsay\", \"Feudal Earl of Breadalbane\" and \"Feudal Earl of Rothes\". In the ruling in 2010, the Lord Lyon stated that as a general rule previous decisions should be followed, but he could not agree with them as the arguments in the previous cases did not appear to have been tested and no reasoning had been given by the prior Lord Lyon for his decisions. The title \"feudal Earl\", \"territorial Earl\", or simply \"Earl\", being used or recognised in respect of an assemblage of lands into an earldom had never existed until recently. He stated that while the ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure Act of 2000'' divorced feudal baronies from land title, it preserved the title of baron. This was not the case he found with \"territorial\" or \"feudal earldoms\": \"On the contrary there is a clear break between the type of territorial earldoms which existed before the evolution of a personal peerage, and the later erection of lands into what has been termed a \u201cterritorial earldom\u201d. I therefore do not accept that it follows from the recognition of a feudal baron, or one possessed of the dignity of a former feudal barony, as \u201cBaron of X\u201d, that the person in possession of a \u201cterritorial earldom\u201d stemming from the erection by the Crown of lands into a free earldom, should be recognised as an \u201cEarl\u201d or \u201cCountess\u201d, \u201cfeudal\u201d or otherwise.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/WES%20Note.pdf|title = Lyon Court Note|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181027/http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/WES%20Note.pdf|archive-date = 3 March 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nUnder the 2014 Menking Note, the Lord Lyon effectively revoked the 2010 restrictions on recognition of such dignities and customary title as long provided to those properly holding them. \n\n==See also==\nSee also [[Peerage of Scotland]] and [[List of feudal baronies]].\n\n==List of Feudal Earldoms (created before 1707)==\nBelow is an incomplete list of Scottish feudal earldoms created in Scotland before 1707.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Feudal earldom!!County!!Date created<sup>a</sup>!!Claimant/Holder!!Date succeeded!!Arms\n|-\n|[[Earl of Arran (Scotland)|Arran]]||[[Ayrshire]]|| ||Claimant: Herr Willi Ernst Sturzenegger; \"Petition of date 10th February 2006 brought by Willi Ernst Sturzenegger of Arran, designing himself as \"Feudal Earl of Arran\", in which he seeks official recognition \"in the name, style and dignity of Willi Ernst Sturzenegger of Arran, Feudal Earl of Arran\" with appropriate heraldic additaments\" refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms 8 October 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/WES%20Note.pdf |title=Decision of  Lord Lyon King of Arms \"Skye, 8 October 2009\" |access-date=10 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181027/http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/WES%20Note.pdf |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>In 2010 the Lord Lyon [[King of Arms]] issued an interlocutor holding that the title \"feudal earl\" cannot be recognised, and has no basis in either law or history</ref>||In 1995 he received (from the Duke of Hamilton, by way of sale) \"conveyance to him of All and Whole the Earldom of Arran including the caput thereof which grant can be traced back to an erection by the Crown of lands in unum comitatum\"<ref>Decision of  Lord Lyon King of Arms \"Skye, 8 October 2009\"</ref>||[[File:Arran arms.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of feudal Earls of Arran: ''Argent, a [[lymphad]] with the sails furled proper flagged gules''.

He undertook to create a new prison officer handbook and a new course at the training college for prison officers.

Florida Atlantic University was built on [[Boca Raton Army Airfield]], a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]]' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing [[Boca Raton Airport]] and on 5,860&nbsp;acres (23.7&nbsp;km\u00b2) of adjacent land.<ref name=\"Morikami\">{{cite web | title = The Yamato Colony: Japanese Pioneers in Florida | publisher = The [[Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens]] | url = http://www.morikami.org/index.php?src=gendocs&link=YamatoColony | accessdate =November 4, 2006}}</ref> A majority of the land was acquired from [[Japanese-American]] farmers from the failing [[Yamato Colony, Florida|Yamato Colony]]. The land was seized through [[eminent domain]], leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II.<ref name=\"Morikami\"/>\n\n[[File:LBJ FAU Dedication.gif|left|thumb|President Johnson at the University's dedication]]\nThe airbase was used for radar training, anti-submarine patrols along the coast, and as a stop-over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America. The airfield was composed of four runways, still visible on the Boca Campus today and mainly used for parking.\n\nBy early 1947, the military decided to transfer future radar training operations to [[Keesler Air Force Base]] in [[Mississippi]]. The departure of the air force in 1947 would leave Boca Raton Army Airfield essentially abandoned.\n\n===Expansion and growth===\nFlorida Atlantic University opened on September 14, 1964, with an initial student body of 867&nbsp;students in five colleges. The first degree awarded was an honorary doctorate given to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on October 25, 1964, at the dedication and opening of the university.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fau.edu/explore/history.php| title = Explore FAU History | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | accessdate = September 20, 2007}}</ref> At the time of its opening, there were 350&nbsp;employees, of which 120 were faculty .

The university originally served only upper-division and graduate level students, because Florida intended the institution \"to complement the state's community college system, accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions.\"<ref name=\"Legacy History\"/>\n\nFlorida Atlantic began its expansion beyond a one-campus university in 1971, when it opened its Commercial Boulevard campus in [[Fort Lauderdale]]. Due to a rapidly expanding population in South Florida, in 1984 Florida Atlantic opened its doors to lower-division undergraduate students. The following year, the university added its third campus, in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Las Olas Boulevard.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:FAU Social Science Building.jpg|right|thumb|Florida Atlantic University's Social Science Building, [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] campus]]\nIn 1989, the [[Florida Legislature]] recognized demands for higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in [[Dania Beach]] in 1997 and another campus in the City of [[Davie, Florida|Davie]] in western [[Broward County]] in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (20 ha) of land in [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] in 1994 to establish a campus on the [[Treasure Coast]]. This would be the institution's fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] Campus, named for the late [[John D. MacArthur]]. This campus houses the university's honors college.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University and the [[University of Miami]]'s [[Miller School of Medicine]] established a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical training]] program within the [[Charles E. Schmidt College of Biomedical Science]] in 2004. Plans originally called for the construction of a new [[teaching hospital]] in coordination with [[Boca Raton Community Hospital]] on the main campus. Following successive budgets deficits in 2007, the hospital delayed its participation indefinitely. However, Florida Atlantic later established its own College of Medicine in 2010.<ref name=\"Medical School\">{{cite web|title=UMSM@FAU |publisher=The University of Miami |url=http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/0,1770,2600-1;31823-3,00.html |accessdate=May 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422135806/http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/0%2C1770%2C2600-1%3B31823-3%2C00.html |archivedate=April 22, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name=\"Medical School Questions\">{{cite web | title = UMMSM at FAU Questions | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | url =http://med.fau.edu/biomedical/ummsm_rmc/prospective_students.html#FrequentlyAskedQuestions | accessdate =May 26, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217074138/http://med.fau.edu/biomedical/ummsm_rmc/prospective_students.html|archivedate=February 17, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Establishment of Hospital\">{{cite press release|title=Boca Raton Community Hospital Receives $75 Million |publisher=PNN Online |date=January 30, 2006 |url=http://pnnonline.org/article.php?sid=7242 |accessdate=October 12, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014170105/http://pnnonline.org/article.php?sid=7242 |archivedate=October 14, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name=\"Deficit\">{{cite news | last =Pensa | first = Patty | title =Boca Raton Community Hospital loses $28&nbsp;million, replaces CEO: Plan to build teaching facility set back |newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel  | date =January 5, 2008}}</ref> The [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] (HBOI) also joined the university in 2007, creating Florida Atlantic's seventh campus.<ref name=\"Merged\">{{cite news | title =Editorial: Harbor Branch swimming downstream with FAU | publisher =Scripps Interactive Newspapers Group | date =December 2, 2007 | url =http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2007/dec/02/editorial-harbor-branch-swimming-downstream-fau/ |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref> To bring HBOI into the university family the Florida Legislature allocated $44&nbsp;million to Florida Atlantic to acquire the institution.<ref name=\"Merger 1\">{{cite news |last =Travis | first =Scott | title =Universities fight to save funding for big projects |newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel  | date =September 23, 2007 <!--|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/palmbeach/sfl-flpbudgetcuts0923nbsep23,0,3269119.story (Dead) |accessdate=October 14, 2007 -->}}</ref>\n\nFlorida Atlantic has changed dramatically since its opening in 1964. {{as of|2013}}, there were more than 30,000 students attending classes on seven campuses spread across 120&nbsp;miles (193&nbsp;km).

Florida Atlantic University was built on [[Boca Raton Army Airfield]], a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]]' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing [[Boca Raton Airport]] and on 5,860&nbsp;acres (23.7&nbsp;km\u00b2) of adjacent land.<ref name=\"Morikami\">{{cite web | title = The Yamato Colony: Japanese Pioneers in Florida | publisher = The [[Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens]] | url = http://www.morikami.org/index.php?src=gendocs&link=YamatoColony | accessdate =November 4, 2006}}</ref> A majority of the land was acquired from [[Japanese-American]] farmers from the failing [[Yamato Colony, Florida|Yamato Colony]]. The land was seized through [[eminent domain]], leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II.<ref name=\"Morikami\"/>\n\n[[File:LBJ FAU Dedication.gif|left|thumb|President Johnson at the University's dedication]]\nThe airbase was used for radar training, anti-submarine patrols along the coast, and as a stop-over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America. The airfield was composed of four runways, still visible on the Boca Campus today and mainly used for parking.\n\nBy early 1947, the military decided to transfer future radar training operations to [[Keesler Air Force Base]] in [[Mississippi]]. The departure of the air force in 1947 would leave Boca Raton Army Airfield essentially abandoned.\n\n===Expansion and growth===\nFlorida Atlantic University opened on September 14, 1964, with an initial student body of 867&nbsp;students in five colleges. The first degree awarded was an honorary doctorate given to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on October 25, 1964, at the dedication and opening of the university.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fau.edu/explore/history.php| title = Explore FAU History | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | accessdate = September 20, 2007}}</ref> At the time of its opening, there were 350&nbsp;employees, of which 120 were faculty .

The university originally served only upper-division and graduate level students, because Florida intended the institution \"to complement the state's community college system, accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions.\"<ref name=\"Legacy History\"/>\n\nFlorida Atlantic began its expansion beyond a one-campus university in 1971, when it opened its Commercial Boulevard campus in [[Fort Lauderdale]]. Due to a rapidly expanding population in South Florida, in 1984 Florida Atlantic opened its doors to lower-division undergraduate students. The following year, the university added its third campus, in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Las Olas Boulevard.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:FAU Social Science Building.jpg|right|thumb|Florida Atlantic University's Social Science Building, [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] campus]]\nIn 1989, the [[Florida Legislature]] recognized demands for higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in [[Dania Beach]] in 1997 and another campus in the City of [[Davie, Florida|Davie]] in western [[Broward County]] in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (20 ha) of land in [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] in 1994 to establish a campus on the [[Treasure Coast]]. This would be the institution's fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] Campus, named for the late [[John D. MacArthur]]. This campus houses the university's honors college.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University and the [[University of Miami]]'s [[Miller School of Medicine]] established a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical training]] program within the [[Charles E. Schmidt College of Biomedical Science]] in 2004. Plans originally called for the construction of a new [[teaching hospital]] in coordination with [[Boca Raton Community Hospital]] on the main campus. Following successive budgets deficits in 2007, the hospital delayed its participation indefinitely. However, Florida Atlantic later established its own College of Medicine in 2010.<ref name=\"Medical School\">{{cite web|title=UMSM@FAU |publisher=The University of Miami |url=http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/0,1770,2600-1;31823-3,00.html |accessdate=May 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422135806/http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/0%2C1770%2C2600-1%3B31823-3%2C00.html |archivedate=April 22, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name=\"Medical School Questions\">{{cite web | title = UMMSM at FAU Questions | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | url =http://med.fau.edu/biomedical/ummsm_rmc/prospective_students.html#FrequentlyAskedQuestions | accessdate =May 26, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217074138/http://med.fau.edu/biomedical/ummsm_rmc/prospective_students.html|archivedate=February 17, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Establishment of Hospital\">{{cite press release|title=Boca Raton Community Hospital Receives $75 Million |publisher=PNN Online |date=January 30, 2006 |url=http://pnnonline.org/article.php?sid=7242 |accessdate=October 12, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014170105/http://pnnonline.org/article.php?sid=7242 |archivedate=October 14, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name=\"Deficit\">{{cite news | last =Pensa | first = Patty | title =Boca Raton Community Hospital loses $28&nbsp;million, replaces CEO: Plan to build teaching facility set back |newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel  | date =January 5, 2008}}</ref> The [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] (HBOI) also joined the university in 2007, creating Florida Atlantic's seventh campus.<ref name=\"Merged\">{{cite news | title =Editorial: Harbor Branch swimming downstream with FAU | publisher =Scripps Interactive Newspapers Group | date =December 2, 2007 | url =http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2007/dec/02/editorial-harbor-branch-swimming-downstream-fau/ |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref> To bring HBOI into the university family the Florida Legislature allocated $44&nbsp;million to Florida Atlantic to acquire the institution.<ref name=\"Merger 1\">{{cite news |last =Travis | first =Scott | title =Universities fight to save funding for big projects |newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel  | date =September 23, 2007 <!--|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/palmbeach/sfl-flpbudgetcuts0923nbsep23,0,3269119.story (Dead) |accessdate=October 14, 2007 -->}}</ref>\n\nFlorida Atlantic has changed dramatically since its opening in 1964. {{as of|2013}}, there were more than 30,000 students attending classes on seven campuses spread across 120&nbsp;miles (193&nbsp;km).

The lion was chosen as the club's mascot for two general reasons attributed to history of [[Floriana]].\n\nFirst attribution is to the [[coat-of-arms]] of the Grandmaster of [[Order of St. John]], [[Manoel de Vilhena]], which has the lion on it.<ref name=\"emblem\"/> Vilhena was the mastermind behind the construction of a fortification suburg of Floriana (originally known as Borgo Vilhena) to defend the capital city of Valletta from land attacks.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> He even ordered the construction of a lion statue fountain, with his Grandmaster code of arms being held by the lions hand, in the centre of Floriana's main square, St. Anne Square, which is still there today.<ref name=\"emblem\"/>\n\nSecond attribution to the lion is the statue of St. Publius who is the patron saint of Floriana. The St. Publius' statue has a lion with it which shows how Publius was killed for his Christian preachings.\n\nThe first game won by the team was confirmed on the feast of the patron's village St. Publius, on 13 April 1910, which is to some considered as a divine confirmation.<ref name=\"emblem\"/>\n\n===Domestic successes===\nSince the foundation of the Malta Football Association, in 1909,<ref name=\"association\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|pages=13|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref> (fiv)and local competitions the club won a total of 107 honours, which includes 25 league titles and 25 Cup knock out competitions.

The following are some of the major honours won by FFCN:\n\n06 / 07 UNDER 14 Knock out competition\n*U/14 League Champions&nbsp;\u2013 twice\n*U/16 League Champions&nbsp;\u2013 six times, four of which in a row, 1993 to 1997\n*U/18 League Champions&nbsp;\u2013 six times, four of which in a row, 1996 to 2000\n\nToday all the major six Premiership clubs in Malta have at least two players forming part of their squad, which have been raised by the Floriana Youth Nursery.\n\n===Rivalries===\n\nDuring their history Floriana had two main rivals [[Sliema Wanderers F.C.|Sliema Wanderers]] and neighbors [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]].<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The rivalry against Sliema is very old but today has lost much of its legacy.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The rivalry was at its peak from 1910 and till the late 1970s when the two sides dominated the [[Maltese football]] scene.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> [[Football hooliganism]] between supporters and direct conflicts were something usual.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\nToday the rivalry has declined. Recently Floriana won the 20th FA Trophy against Sliema. This triggered again the rivalry between both clubs as Floriana won 9 finals in this Cup Competition against The Blues. \n<ref name=\"mitchell\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|pages=48\u201350|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry against Valletta City is still alive.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/> The fact that the two cities are near each other's the rivalry continues to persist and it is one of the most classic [[derby (football)|derbies]] in Maltese football.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/> The matches between the two sides always attract big crowds to the stadium and the fans treat these clashes as cup finals.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/>\n\n===Colours===\n\nFloriana' s official colors at the beginning of the century were [[green]] and [[red]] quartered shirts with [[black]] shorts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Later on these were replaced with Green and white striped shirts and white shorts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> These colors were adopted after a game played at the Floriana Parade Ground against the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> This regiment of the British army was stationed at Floriana.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The two sides played three times against each other in 1904\u201305.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The Fusiliers won the first two games while the third one ended all square.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\nA fourth game was organized between the two sides and this time Floriana won 2\u20131.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> As a symbol of friendship, the players swapped their shirts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> From that moment onwards, Floriana Football Club adopted the colors of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, which are the green and white stripes and white shorts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The Florianites are still called 'Ta' l-Irish' meaning 'The Irish'.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> In the early 1920s which went something like this:<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> {{cquote|Tal-Irish minn dejjem hadid,<br/>Jag\u0127mel li jrid, deni jew gid.}} In plain English, this translates as 'The Irish are always as strong as metal; they decide if to inflict harm or not'.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\n== Honours ==\n\nFrom 1900 to date, Floriana FC won 96 honours (official honours). 30 of them were won before the second war, that is, between 1900 and 1940. The other 66 honours were won from 1940 to date.Floriana FC holds the following records:*'''Won four consecutive championships&nbsp;\u2013 1949\u201350, 1950\u201351, 1951\u201352 and 1952\u201353.'''*In 1961\u201362, Floriana FC won the league without losing a single point. Played and won 14 games, scored 43 goals and conceded 10 goals.*Made the League and Cup double for 7 times (Only arch rivals Valletta and Sliema Wanderers are better with 8 doubles) in seasons 1921\u201322, 1930\u201331, 1949\u201350, 1952\u201353, 1954\u201355, 1957\u201358 and 1992\u201393.*Between 15 February 1976 and 22 May 1977, Floriana played '''37 consecutive games''' without losing a game. During this period, the Greens scored 99 goals and won seven major honours, which are the League, Trophy, Independence Cup, twice the Sons of Malta Cup and twice the Testaferrata Cup.During '''Season 1952\u201353''' Floriana FC was the first Local Club to obtain '''SIX HONOURS''' in one season,'''League Champions-FA Trophy-Cassar Charity Cup-Infantile Paralyses Cup-Schembri Shield''' and '''Poppy Day Fund Cup''' (During this season another Cup was played the '''Coronation Cup''' but was won by Floriana FC arch rivals Valletta FC and 3 of these honours were friendly

In all, Floriana F.C. has won 25 national leagues  and 20 FA Trophies. It is also the only team from Malta to have qualified from the qualifying rounds to the first round proper of the UEFA Champions League, in the 1993\u201394 season.\n\n==History==\nFloriana Football Club was founded in 1894 with the inauguration of the football ground officiated by [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]].<ref name=\"alexandra\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=zliK30npLlsC&pg=PA44&dq=false#v=snippet&q=1894&f=false|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|pages=23, 29, 68|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref> The site was a cricket ground from 1890 till its conversion project.<ref name=\"alexandra\"/> Together with [[St. George's FC]], is one of the two oldest clubs in Malta.<ref name=\"armstrong\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=zliK30npLlsC&pg=PA44&dq=false#v=onepage&q=false&f=false|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|pages=43\u201346|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref> During that period, football in Malta was introduced by the British Servicemen who were stationed on the island, which was then a colony of the [[British Empire]].<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\nThe club is affiliated to the [[Malta Football Association]] which in turn is a member of both [[UEFA]] and [[FIFA]].<ref name=\"mfa\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=zliK30npLlsC&pg=PA31&false#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|page=31|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref> The teams colours were green and red but after a friendly match against the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] which plays in green and white, Floriana FC changed its colours to green and white. The teams nicknames are: Tal-Irish and Greens.\n\nFloriana Football Club has won the major Maltese League championship 25 times and the FA Trophy 20 times.\n\n===Formation===\nFootball was introduced in Malta at the end of the 19th Century by the British troops stationed on the island.<ref name=\"alexandra\"/> At that time Malta formed part of the British Empire and, the Island was the base of British forces in the heart of the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The forces' barracks, which were strategically located around the [[Malta (island)|island of Malta]], enjoyed large areas that were used as parade grounds, training areas and for sporting activities.<ref name=\"alexandra\"/>\n\nThe sports practised by the soldiers were mainly cricket, hockey and football.<ref name=\"alexandra\"/> The British forces in Malta were mainly stationed in Floriana, Cospicua, Mtarfa, Marsa and Sliema.<ref name=\"alexandra\"/> The locals who were influenced by the soldiers stationed in the area were introduced to these sporting activities.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The most popular sport amongst the residents of Floriana was football,<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> however some also practised cricket and hockey.<ref name=\"alexandra\"/> Floriana still has its hockey club, carrying the name Floriana Young Stars Hockey Club.\n\n===Club colours and mascot===\nBetween 1894 and 1905 the club's colours were green/red quartered shirts, black shorts with green and red socks.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The official colours of the club as we know them today, green and white vertical striped shirts, white shorts and green/white horizontal striped socks, were introduced in 1905.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> At that time the Royal Dublin Fusiliers were stationed in Floriana.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> During that year, three friendly matches were held between this regiment and FFC.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> At the end of the final match both teams exchanged their shirts and later the FFC changed their official colours to their green and white shirts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The regiment left the Island for [[India]] in that same year.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The ties between Floriana and the Royal Dublin Fusiliers were so strong that the people hailing from Floriana were nicknamed after the Irish, \"Tal-Irish\".<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\nThe club's mascot is the lion, which features prominently on the club's badge since 1936 together with the Latin motto \"Ex Ludis Virtus\", meaning \"virtue out of the game\".<ref name=\"emblem\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=zliK30npLlsC&pg=PA44&dq=false#v=snippet&q=1894&f=false|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|pages=44, 47, 50|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref> In this regard the club's badge represents the fierceness of the lion together with the virtues of sportsmanship. The lion was chosen as the club's mascot for two general reasons attributed to history of [[Floriana]].\n\nFirst attribution is to the [[coat-of-arms]] of the Grandmaster of [[Order of St. John]], [[Manoel de Vilhena]], which has the lion on it.<ref name=\"emblem\"/> Vilhena was the mastermind behind the construction of a fortification suburg of Floriana (originally known as Borgo Vilhena) to defend the capital city of Valletta from land attacks.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> He even ordered the construction of a lion statue fountain, with his Grandmaster code of arms being held by the lions hand, in the centre of Floriana's main square, St. Anne Square, which is still there today.<ref name=\"emblem\"/>\n\nSecond attribution to the lion is the statue of St. Publius who is the patron saint of Floriana. The St. Publius' statue has a lion with it which shows how Publius was killed for his Christian preachings.\n\nThe first game won by the team was confirmed on the feast of the patron's village St. Publius, on 13 April 1910, which is to some considered as a divine confirmation.<ref name=\"emblem\"/>\n\n===Domestic successes===\nSince the foundation of the Malta Football Association, in 1909,<ref name=\"association\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|pages=13|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref> (fiv)and local competitions the club won a total of 107 honours, which includes 25 league titles and 25 Cup knock out competitions. The club has also achieved a number of impressive feats, such as four consecutive league championships, ten doubles (League plus Cup) and a League title with maximum points.\n\n===UEFA competitions===\nOver the years FFC participated in the various competitions organised by the European football body, UEFA, such as the:\n\n*UEFA Champions League\n*UEFA Cup Winners' Cup\n*Fairs Cities' Cup\n*UEFA Europa League\n*Intertoto Cup\n\nIn 1962, the club was the first to represent Malta in UEFA competitions in its Cup Winners' Cup against the Hungarian side [[\u00dajpest FC|Ujpest Dozsa]]. Over the years, FFC had the opportunity to meet some renowned European football clubs, including the likes of:\n\n*{{flagicon|England}} [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]\n*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Inter Milan]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Sparta Rotterdam]]\n*{{flagicon|Greece}} [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]]\n*{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Ferencv\u00e1ros]]\n*{{flagicon|Scotland}} [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]\n*{{flagicon|Portugal}} [[F.C. Porto|FC Porto]]\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Borussia Dortmund]]\n*{{flagicon|Yugoslavia}} [[Hajduk Split]]\n*{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Red Star Belgrade]]\n\nOn two occasions FFC made it to the next round, 1993\u201394 Champions Cup and Intertoto Cup 1999\u201300.\n\n===Youth sector===\nIn 1987 the club founded its youth sector, Floriana FC Nursery (FFCN), which is affiliated to the Malta Youth Football Association.<ref name=\"nursery\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=zliK30npLlsC&pg=PA81&dq=floriana+football+club.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijhrz08rbQAhXKChoKHd7-AAUQ6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&q=floriana%20football%20club.&f=false|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|page=81|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref> The club's youth sector may also be considered as one of the most successful organisations of its type on the Island; not only has it produced a number of some of the finest footballers, but it has also won a number of league titles organised by the Association.  The following are some of the major honours won by FFCN:\n\n06 / 07 UNDER 14 Knock out competition\n*U/14 League Champions&nbsp;\u2013 twice\n*U/16 League Champions&nbsp;\u2013 six times, four of which in a row, 1993 to 1997\n*U/18 League Champions&nbsp;\u2013 six times, four of which in a row, 1996 to 2000\n\nToday all the major six Premiership clubs in Malta have at least two players forming part of their squad, which have been raised by the Floriana Youth Nursery.\n\n===Rivalries===\n\nDuring their history Floriana had two main rivals [[Sliema Wanderers F.C.|Sliema Wanderers]] and neighbors [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]].<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The rivalry against Sliema is very old but today has lost much of its legacy.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The rivalry was at its peak from 1910 and till the late 1970s when the two sides dominated the [[Maltese football]] scene.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> [[Football hooliganism]] between supporters and direct conflicts were something usual.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\nToday the rivalry has declined. Recently Floriana won the 20th FA Trophy against Sliema. This triggered again the rivalry between both clubs as Floriana won 9 finals in this Cup Competition against The Blues. \n<ref name=\"mitchell\">{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gary|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jon P.|title=Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|pages=48\u201350|isbn=9781134269198}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry against Valletta City is still alive.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/> The fact that the two cities are near each other's the rivalry continues to persist and it is one of the most classic [[derby (football)|derbies]] in Maltese football.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/> The matches between the two sides always attract big crowds to the stadium and the fans treat these clashes as cup finals.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/>\n\n===Colours===\n\nFloriana' s official colors at the beginning of the century were [[green]] and [[red]] quartered shirts with [[black]] shorts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Later on these were replaced with Green and white striped shirts and white shorts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> These colors were adopted after a game played at the Floriana Parade Ground against the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> This regiment of the British army was stationed at Floriana.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The two sides played three times against each other in 1904\u201305.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The Fusiliers won the first two games while the third one ended all square.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\nA fourth game was organized between the two sides and this time Floriana won 2\u20131.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> As a symbol of friendship, the players swapped their shirts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> From that moment onwards, Floriana Football Club adopted the colors of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, which are the green and white stripes and white shorts.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> The Florianites are still called 'Ta' l-Irish' meaning 'The Irish'.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> In the early 1920s which went something like this:<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> {{cquote|Tal-Irish minn dejjem hadid,<br/>Jag\u0127mel li jrid, deni jew gid.}} In plain English, this translates as 'The Irish are always as strong as metal; they decide if to inflict harm or not'.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\n== Honours ==\n\nFrom 1900 to date, Floriana FC won 96 honours (official honours). 30 of them were won before the second war, that is, between 1900 and 1940. The other 66 honours were won from 1940 to date.Floriana FC holds the following records:*'''Won four consecutive championships&nbsp;\u2013 1949\u201350, 1950\u201351, 1951\u201352 and 1952\u201353.'''*In 1961\u201362, Floriana FC won the league without losing a single point.

During this period, the Greens scored 99 goals and won seven major honours, which are the League, Trophy, Independence Cup, twice the Sons of Malta Cup and twice the Testaferrata Cup.During '''Season

Day Fund Cup''' (During this season another Cup was played the '''Coronation Cup''' but was won by Floriana FC arch rivals Valletta FC and 3 of these honours were friendly
