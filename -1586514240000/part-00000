People are empowered when they are able to access the opportunities available to them without limitations and restrictions such as in education, profession and lifestyle.

Empowerment includes the action of raising the status of women through education, raising awareness, literacy, and training.

Empowerment stems from self respect.\nFurthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them.

Without the equal inclusion of women in development, women would not be able to benefit or contribute to the development of the country.\n\n== Methods ==\nScholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.<ref name=\":7\">Kabeer, Naila. \"Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme.\" (2011).</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413044318/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|archive-date=2018-04-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic empowerment ===\nEconomic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.<ref name=\":7\" /> One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.<ref name=\":82\">{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051\u20131079|doi=10.1257/jel.50.4.1051|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/82663/2/Duflo_Women%20Empowerment.pd|hdl=1721.1/82663}}</ref>\n\nStrengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped countries are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.<ref name=\":82\" /> Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.\n\nRace has a huge impact on women's empowerment in areas such as employment. Employment can help create empowerment for women. Many scholars suggest that when we discuss women's empowerment, discussing the different barriers that underprivileged women face, which makes it more difficult for them to obtain empowerment in society, is important when examining the impact of race in connection to employment. Significantly examining how opportunities are structured by gender, race, and class can transpire social change. Work opportunities and the work environment can create empowerment for women. Empowerment in the workplace can positively affect job satisfaction and performance, having equality in the work place can greatly increase the sense of empowerment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Gloria |title=Empowerment: A Framework to Develop Advocacy in African American Grandmothers Providing Care for Their Grandchildren |journal=ISRN Nursing |date=February 2011 |volume=2011 |pages=531717 |pmc=3169837 |pmid=21994894 |doi=10.5402/2011/531717 }}</ref> However, women of color do not have the same accessibility and privileges in work settings.

Patricia Parker argues that African American women's empowerment is their resistance to control, standing up for themselves and not conforming to societal norms and expectations. In connection to power, feminist perspectives look at empowerment as a form of resistance within systems of unequal power relations. Within the societal setting of race, gender, and class politics, African American women's empowerment in work environment \u201ccan be seen as resistance to attempts to fix meanings of appropriate identity and behavior, where such meanings are interpreted as controlling, exploitative, and other- wise oppressive to African American women.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Patricia |title=Control, Resistance, and Empowerment in Raced, Gendered, and Classed Work Contexts: The Case of African American Women |journal=Annals of the International Communication Association |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=257\u2013291 |doi=10.1080/23808985.2003.11679028 }}</ref> When talking about women's empowerment, many scholars suggest examining the social injustices on women in everyday organizational life that are influenced by race, class, and gender.\n\nAnother popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].<ref name=\"autogenerated22\">{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009|access-date=2017-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829064329/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.<ref name=\":9\">Geleta, Esayas Bekele. \"Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective.\" ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.</ref> More specifically, they(microfinance institutions) aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.<ref name=\":9\" /> The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461\u201376|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}</ref> Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way the loan is used.

Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).<ref name=\":82\" /> However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself. Some theorists believe that bargaining power and agency in the household must  be achieved before one can move onto broader political participation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities to Approach|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9781139459358|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1\u201333|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>\n\n==== Digital skills enhance political empowerment ====\n{{Main|Gender digital divide}}\n\nDigital skills can facilitate women\u2019s engagement with local [[government]] and increase their decision-making power in their communities.

GEM is calculated by tracking \"the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence\".<ref name=\"Deneulin, S\u00e9verine 2009\" /> It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] or the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).<ref name=\"Deneulin, S\u00e9verine 2009\" />\n\nSome critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.<ref name=\":02\">Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. \"Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure.\" ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.</ref> Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197\u2013203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}</ref>\n\nThe Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nA more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.<ref name=\":62\"/> Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\n== Barriers ==\n\nMany of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms.

People are empowered when they are able to access the opportunities available to them without limitations and restrictions such as in education, profession and lifestyle. Feeling entitled to make your own decisions creates a sense of empowerment. Empowerment includes the action of raising the status of women through education, raising awareness, literacy, and training. Women's empowerment is all about equipping and allowing women to make life-determining decisions through the different problems in society.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Bayeh|first1=Endalcachew|date=January 2016|title=The role of empowering women and achieving gender equality to the sustainable development of Ethiopia|journal=Pacific Science Review B: Humanities and Social Sciences|volume=2|issue=1|pages=38|doi=10.1016/j.psrb.2016.09.013}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.<ref name=\":5\" /> There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. \nFor example: A stripper no longer has to take off her clothes to get money and now is a receptionist for a respectable company. Empowerment stems from self respect.\nFurthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\nWomen empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[economics]].

It is widely believed that, the full participation of both men and women is critical for development. Only acknowledging men's participation will not be beneficial to sustainable development. In the context of women and development, empowerment must include more choices for women to make on their own.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mehra|first1=Rekha|date=November 1997|title=Women, Empowerment, and Economic Development|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=554|issue=1|pages=136\u2013149|doi=10.1177/0002716297554001009}}</ref> Without gender equality and empowerment, the country could not be just, and social change wouldn't occur. Therefore, scholars agree that women's empowerment plays a huge role in development and is one of the significant contributions of development. Without the equal inclusion of women in development, women would not be able to benefit or contribute to the development of the country.\n\n== Methods ==\nScholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.<ref name=\":7\">Kabeer, Naila. \"Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme.\" (2011).</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413044318/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|archive-date=2018-04-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic empowerment ===\nEconomic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.<ref name=\":7\" /> One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.<ref name=\":82\">{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051\u20131079|doi=10.1257/jel.50.4.1051|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/82663/2/Duflo_Women%20Empowerment.pd|hdl=1721.1/82663}}</ref>\n\nStrengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped countries are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.<ref name=\":82\" /> Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.\n\nRace has a huge impact on women's empowerment in areas such as employment. Employment can help create empowerment for women. Many scholars suggest that when we discuss women's empowerment, discussing the different barriers that underprivileged women face, which makes it more difficult for them to obtain empowerment in society, is important when examining the impact of race in connection to employment. Significantly examining how opportunities are structured by gender, race, and class can transpire social change. Work opportunities and the work environment can create empowerment for women. Empowerment in the workplace can positively affect job satisfaction and performance, having equality in the work place can greatly increase the sense of empowerment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Gloria |title=Empowerment: A Framework to Develop Advocacy in African American Grandmothers Providing Care for Their Grandchildren |journal=ISRN Nursing |date=February 2011 |volume=2011 |pages=531717 |pmc=3169837 |pmid=21994894 |doi=10.5402/2011/531717 }}</ref> However, women of color do not have the same accessibility and privileges in work settings. They(Women of color) are faced with more disadvantages in the work place. Patricia Parker argues that African American women's empowerment is their resistance to control, standing up for themselves and not conforming to societal norms and expectations. In connection to power, feminist perspectives look at empowerment as a form of resistance within systems of unequal power relations. Within the societal setting of race, gender, and class politics, African American women's empowerment in work environment \u201ccan be seen as resistance to attempts to fix meanings of appropriate identity and behavior, where such meanings are interpreted as controlling, exploitative, and other- wise oppressive to African American women.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Patricia |title=Control, Resistance, and Empowerment in Raced, Gendered, and Classed Work Contexts: The Case of African American Women |journal=Annals of the International Communication Association |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=257\u2013291 |doi=10.1080/23808985.2003.11679028 }}</ref> When talking about women's empowerment, many scholars suggest examining the social injustices on women in everyday organizational life that are influenced by race, class, and gender.\n\nAnother popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].<ref name=\"autogenerated22\">{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009|access-date=2017-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829064329/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.<ref name=\":9\">Geleta, Esayas Bekele. \"Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective.\" ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.</ref> More specifically, they(microfinance institutions) aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.<ref name=\":9\" /> The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461\u201376|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}</ref> Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way the loan is used. Microfinance institutions don't address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband.

Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).<ref name=\":82\" /> However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself.

GEM is calculated by tracking \"the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence\".<ref name=\"Deneulin, S\u00e9verine 2009\" /> It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] or the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).<ref name=\"Deneulin, S\u00e9verine 2009\" />\n\nSome critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.<ref name=\":02\">Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. \"Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure.\" ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.</ref> Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197\u2013203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}</ref>\n\nThe Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nA more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.<ref name=\":62\"/> Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\n== Barriers ==\n\nMany of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms.

This test is specific and is designed to only detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture.

As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1885\u20131918''':\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Municipal Borough of Cheltenham, and the Urban District of Charlton Kings.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': As before but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Cheltenham, and the Borough of Tewkesbury wards of Leckhampton with Up Hatherley, Prestbury St Mary's, and Prestbury St Nicolas. Leckhampton, Up Hatherley, and Prestbury were added to the seat from the Cirencester and Tewkesbury constituency; they had previously been in the abolished Cheltenham Rural District.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Cheltenham wards of All Saints, Charlton Kings, College, Hatherley and The Reddings, Hesters Way, Lansdown, Park, Pittville, St Mark's, St Paul's, and St Peter's. Leckhampton, Up Hatherley, and Prestbury were transferred to the new Tewkesbury constituency; they had been incorporated into the redrawn Borough of Cheltenham in 1991.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Borough of Cheltenham wards of All Saints, Battledown, Benhall and The Reddings, Charlton Kings, Charlton Park, College, Hesters Way, Lansdown, Leckhampton, Oakley, Park, Pittville, St Mark's, St Paul's, St Peter's, Springbank, Up Hatherley, and Warden Hill. Leckhampton and Up Hatherley were transferred back to this seat from the Tewkesbury seat.\n\nThe seat covers the town of [[Cheltenham]] in Gloucestershire but covers a different, slightly smaller, area from [[Cheltenham (borough)|the borough of the same name]]. It is bordered by the [[Tewkesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Tewkesbury]] and [[The Cotswolds (UK Parliament constituency)|Cotswolds]] seats.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nFamous for its racecourse which hosts the annual [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] in March, with a long-established [[Cheltenham Ladies' College|girls' school]] and right at the edge of the [[Cotswold Hills]], Cheltenham has a large tourism sector. [[GE Aviation]] is a large employer and [[GCHQ]], the government communications centre, is here, so numbers of highly skilled workers and professionals (47.5% in the year ended September 2014<ref name=\"nomis\">{{cite web|title=Constituency Profile|url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/wpca/1929379941/report.aspx|website = nomis Constituency Profile for Cheltenham|publisher=Source: Office for National Statistics|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>) are well above the national average (44.6%<ref name=\"nomis\"/>). One of the West of England's most upmarket towns, the few neighbourhoods of medium levels in the Index of Multiple Deprivation are almost wholly in Hester's Way ward which has the most [[social housing]]. About 10% {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} of the electorate are students at the [[University of Gloucestershire]] just outside the compact town centre. A Liberal Democrat served the seat from 1992 when their candidate [[Nigel Jones, Baron Jones of Cheltenham|Nigel Jones]] overturned four decades of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs to 2015 when the Tories regained the seat.\n\n==History==\nCheltenham borough constituency was created in the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 and has returned nine Liberals (or Liberal Democrats) and nine Conservatives to Parliament since that time, along with one independent.\n\nA [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] served the constituency from 1950 until 1992.  The Conservatives' campaign in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] following the [[Poll Tax riots]] saw a local party member make racist remarks about their own candidate, [[John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Warwick|John Taylor]], who was of [[Afro-Caribbean]] descent. Taylor lost the election to [[Nigel Jones, Baron Jones of Cheltenham|Nigel Jones]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].\n\nIn 2000, Jones was nearly murdered in a horrific incident at one of his MP's surgeries; a man attacked him and an assistant with a samurai sword. His colleague, [[Andrew Pennington]], was killed in the attack. Jones was made a [[life peer]] in 2005. The Liberal Democrats held Cheltenham in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]] when [[Martin Horwood]] won the election, and again in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], but lost when the Conservatives retook the seat in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Cheltenham 1832\u2013|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/constituencies/cheltenham|website=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|c|3|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party!!Notes\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Whigs (British political party)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832]]\n| [[Craven Berkeley|Hon.

constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}}\nrepresented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1885\u20131918''':\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Municipal Borough of Cheltenham, and the Urban District of Charlton Kings.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': As before but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Cheltenham, and the Borough of Tewkesbury wards of Leckhampton with Up Hatherley, Prestbury St Mary's, and Prestbury St Nicolas. Leckhampton, Up Hatherley, and Prestbury were added to the seat from the Cirencester and Tewkesbury constituency; they had previously been in the abolished Cheltenham Rural District.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Cheltenham wards of All Saints, Charlton Kings, College, Hatherley and The Reddings, Hesters Way, Lansdown, Park, Pittville, St Mark's, St Paul's, and St Peter's. Leckhampton, Up Hatherley, and Prestbury were transferred to the new Tewkesbury constituency; they had been incorporated into the redrawn Borough of Cheltenham in 1991.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Borough of Cheltenham wards of All Saints, Battledown, Benhall and The Reddings, Charlton Kings, Charlton Park, College, Hesters Way, Lansdown, Leckhampton, Oakley, Park, Pittville, St Mark's, St Paul's, St Peter's, Springbank, Up Hatherley, and Warden Hill. Leckhampton and Up Hatherley were transferred back to this seat from the Tewkesbury seat.\n\nThe seat covers the town of [[Cheltenham]] in Gloucestershire but covers a different, slightly smaller, area from [[Cheltenham (borough)|the borough of the same name]]. It is bordered by the [[Tewkesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Tewkesbury]] and [[The Cotswolds (UK Parliament constituency)|Cotswolds]] seats.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nFamous for its racecourse which hosts the annual [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] in March, with a long-established [[Cheltenham Ladies' College|girls' school]] and right at the edge of the [[Cotswold Hills]], Cheltenham has a large tourism sector. [[GE Aviation]] is a large employer and [[GCHQ]], the government communications centre, is here, so numbers of highly skilled workers and professionals (47.5% in the year ended September 2014<ref name=\"nomis\">{{cite web|title=Constituency Profile|url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/wpca/1929379941/report.aspx|website = nomis Constituency Profile for Cheltenham|publisher=Source: Office for National Statistics|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>) are well above the national average (44.6%<ref name=\"nomis\"/>). One of the West of England's most upmarket towns, the few neighbourhoods of medium levels in the Index of Multiple Deprivation are almost wholly in Hester's Way ward which has the most [[social housing]]. About 10% {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} of the electorate are students at the [[University of Gloucestershire]] just outside the compact town centre. A Liberal Democrat served the seat from 1992 when their candidate [[Nigel Jones, Baron Jones of Cheltenham|Nigel Jones]] overturned four decades of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs to 2015 when the Tories regained the seat.\n\n==History==\nCheltenham borough constituency was created in the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 and has returned nine Liberals (or Liberal Democrats) and nine Conservatives to Parliament since that time, along with one independent.\n\nA [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] served the constituency from 1950 until 1992.  The Conservatives' campaign in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] following the [[Poll Tax riots]] saw a local party member make racist remarks about their own candidate, [[John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Warwick|John Taylor]], who was of [[Afro-Caribbean]] descent. Taylor lost the election to [[Nigel Jones, Baron Jones of Cheltenham|Nigel Jones]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].\n\nIn 2000, Jones was nearly murdered in a horrific incident at one of his MP's surgeries; a man attacked him and an assistant with a samurai sword. His colleague, [[Andrew Pennington]], was killed in the attack. Jones was made a [[life peer]] in 2005. The Liberal Democrats held Cheltenham in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]] when [[Martin Horwood]] won the election, and again in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], but lost when the Conservatives retook the seat in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Cheltenham 1832\u2013|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/constituencies/cheltenham|website=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|c|3|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party!!Notes\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Whigs (British political party)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832]]\n| [[Craven Berkeley|Hon.
