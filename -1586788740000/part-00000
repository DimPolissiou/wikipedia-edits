(See [[Children of the plantation]].) By the [[1860 Census]], mixed-race slaves constituted about 10% of the 4 million slaves enumerated; they were more numerous in the Upper South. Slavery had existed for a longer time there, and in the generally smaller holdings, slaves had lived more closely with white workers and masters, leading to more contact with whites.

Supporters of the war believed that this was needed after [[New York City draft riots|the draft riots]] in [[New York City]] that year. Predominantly ethnic Irish mobs had protested the draft law, as wealthier men could buy substitutes rather than serve in the war.\n\nCarol Goodman, in \"Visualizing the Color Line,\" has argued that the photos alluded to physical and sexual abuse of the children's mothers. When publishing the photo of the eight former slaves, the editor of ''Harper's Weekly'' wrote that slavery permits slave-holding \"'gentlemen' [to] seduce [the] most friendless and defenseless of women.\" The specter of \"white\" girls being sold as \"fancy girls\" or [[concubines]] in Southern slave markets may have caused Northern families to fear for the safely of their own daughters. Similarly, the idea that white slave-master fathers would sell their own children in slave markets raised Northerners' concerns.\n\n[[Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw]], in \"Portraits of a People,\" has argued that the usage of props, such as the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] and books, helped to provide context for Northern viewers, and also to emphasize that the purpose of the photos was to raise money for education of former slaves by funding schools in [[Louisiana]]. She also noted that the use of \"white\" children to illustrate the damage caused by institutional slavery, whose victims were overwhelmingly visibly people of color, demonstrated the contemporary racism of both Southern and Northern societies.<ref name=CaustEllenbogen />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Julia Chinn]]\n*[[Louisa Picquet]]\n*[[Mary Mildred Williams]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*{{cite book|last1=Tenzer|first1=Lawrence Raymond|title=The Forgotten Cause of the Civil War: A New Look at the Slavery Issue|date=1997|publisher=Scholars' Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGkOAQAAMAAJ}} See especially [http://multiracial.com/site/index.php/2001/10/01/white-slaves/ Ch.III]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5U-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA32-IA29&lpg=PA32-IA29#v=onepage&q&f=false Fremont Campaign Literature, 1856]\n*[[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], [http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2013/02/how_mixed_are_african_americans/ Exactly How \u2018Black\u2019 Is Black America?]\n*{{cite book|last1=Janken|first1=Kenneth Robert|title=Walter White: Mr. NAACP|date=2006|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807857809|pages=3\u20135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTVZ6N9vHxsC}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|White slave propaganda}}\n{{Wikisource-inline|The Barbarism of Slavery}}\n*[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/white-slave-children-new-orleans-1860s-propaganda-campaign-gallery-1.1164989?pmSlide=0 Image gallery]\n\n[[Category:Abolitionism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Colorism]]\n[[Category:Propaganda in the United States]]\n[[Category:Skin pigmentation]]\n[[Category:Slavery in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:White slavery woodcut.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A woodcut (based on a photograph) that was published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' on 30 January 1864 with the caption, \"EMANCIPATED SLAVES, WHITE AND COLORED.\"]]\n'''White slave propaganda''' is the term given to publicity, especially photograph and woodcuts, and also novels, articles, and popular lectures, about mixed-race, white-looking slaves, which was used during and prior to the [[American Civil War]] to further the [[abolitionist]] cause and to raise money for the education of former slaves.

A woodcut, based on a photograph of the former slaves, appeared in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in January 1864 with the caption \"EMANCIPATED SLAVES, WHITE AND COLORED.\"<ref name=CaustEllenbogen>{{cite web|last=Caust-Ellenbogen|first=Celia|title=White Slaves|url=http://trilogy.brynmawr.edu/speccoll/quakersandslavery/commentary/themes/white_slaves.php|publisher=[[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Swarthmore College]] |accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Goodman\" /> Four of the children were predominantly white in appearance, although born into slavery. \n\nThe former slaves traveled from [[New Orleans]] to the North. Of these, four children appeared to be white or [[octoroon]]. According to the ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' article, they were, {{\" '}}perfectly white;' 'very fair;' 'of unmixed white race.' Their light complexions contrasted sharply with those of the three adults, Wilson, Mary, and Robert; and that of the fifth child, Isaac\u2014'a black boy of eight years; but nonetheless [more] intelligent than his whiter companions.{{' \"}}<ref name=CaustEllenbogen /><ref name=NYDN>{{cite news|title='White' slave children of New Orleans|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/white-slave-children-new-orleans-1860s-propaganda-campaign-gallery-1.1164989|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=21 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe group was accompanied by Colonel Hanks from the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]]. They posed for photos in [[New York City]] and in [[Philadelphia]]. The resulting images were produced in the [[carte de visite]] format and were sold for twenty-five cents each, with the profits of the sale being directed to [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] back in [[Louisiana]] to support education of freedmen. Each of the photos noted that sale proceeds would be \"devoted to the education of colored people\".<ref name=CaustEllenbogen /><ref name=NYDN />\n\nOf the many prints that were commissioned, at least twenty-two remain in existence today. Most of these were produced by Charles Paxson and Myron Kimball, who took the group photo that later appeared as a woodcut in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''. A portrait of Rebecca was taken by James E. McClees of Philadelphia.<ref name=CaustEllenbogen />\n\n==Modern analysis==\n[[File:Freedoms Banner Charley a slave boy from New Orelans 1864.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charley Taylor holding an American flag.  Charley was the son of [[Alexander Withers]] and one of Withers's slaves.  Withers sold Charley to a slave dealer and he was sold again in New Orleans.]]\n\nModern scholars have examined the white slave campaign's motives and success. Mary Niall Mitchell, in \"Rosebloom and Pure White, Or So It Seemed,\"<ref name=\"mnm\">{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Mary Niall|title='Rosebloom and Pure White,' Or So It Seemed|url=http://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=hist_facpubs|website=ScholarWorks@UNO|publisher=University of New Orleans|accessdate=June 29, 2016}} also published in  American Quarterly 54:3 (September 2002): 369-410</ref> argues that because the slaves were depicted as being white, through both their skin color and style of dress, abolitionists could argue that the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was independent of class status. Supporters of the war believed that this was needed after [[New York City draft riots|the draft riots]] in [[New York City]] that year. Predominantly ethnic Irish mobs had protested the draft law, as wealthier men could buy substitutes rather than serve in the war.\n\nCarol Goodman, in \"Visualizing the Color Line,\" has argued that the photos alluded to physical and sexual abuse of the children's mothers. When publishing the photo of the eight former slaves, the editor of ''Harper's Weekly'' wrote that slavery permits slave-holding \"'gentlemen' [to] seduce [the] most friendless and defenseless of women.\" The specter of \"white\" girls being sold as \"fancy girls\" or [[concubines]] in Southern slave markets may have caused Northern families to fear for the safely of their own daughters. Similarly, the idea that white slave-master fathers would sell their own children in slave markets raised Northerners' concerns.\n\n[[Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw]], in \"Portraits of a People,\" has argued that the usage of props, such as the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] and books, helped to provide context for Northern viewers, and also to emphasize that the purpose of the photos was to raise money for education of former slaves by funding schools in [[Louisiana]]. She also noted that the use of \"white\" children to illustrate the damage caused by institutional slavery, whose victims were overwhelmingly visibly people of color, demonstrated the contemporary racism of both Southern and Northern societies.<ref name=CaustEllenbogen />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Julia Chinn]]\n*[[Louisa Picquet]]\n*[[Mary Mildred Williams]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*{{cite book|last1=Tenzer|first1=Lawrence Raymond|title=The Forgotten Cause of the Civil War: A New Look at the Slavery Issue|date=1997|publisher=Scholars' Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGkOAQAAMAAJ}} See especially [http://multiracial.com/site/index.php/2001/10/01/white-slaves/ Ch.III]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5U-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA32-IA29&lpg=PA32-IA29#v=onepage&q&f=false Fremont Campaign Literature, 1856]\n*[[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], [http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2013/02/how_mixed_are_african_americans/ Exactly How \u2018Black\u2019 Is Black America?]\n*{{cite book|last1=Janken|first1=Kenneth Robert|title=Walter White: Mr. NAACP|date=2006|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807857809|pages=3\u20135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTVZ6N9vHxsC}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|White slave propaganda}}\n{{Wikisource-inline|The Barbarism of Slavery}}\n*[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/white-slave-children-new-orleans-1860s-propaganda-campaign-gallery-1.1164989?pmSlide=0 Image gallery]\n\n[[Category:Abolitionism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Colorism]]\n[[Category:Propaganda in the United States]]\n[[Category:Skin pigmentation]]\n[[Category:Slavery in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Rsk6400", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFiction:Corrected italics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_slave_propaganda"}

Intragroup balances and transactions must be eliminated.<ref name=frs10 />\n\n==Acquisition accounting and goodwill==\nAll [[consolidation (business)|business combinations]] are accounted for by applying the purchase method, requiring that one entity is identified as acquirer (IFRS3.6).\n\nThe acquiring entity assesses the [[fair value]] of the separate assets, [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]] and [[contingent liabilities]] in the business it has acquired. This can include identification of [[intangible assets]], for example customer relationships, which are not commonly recognised except on acquisitions (IFRS3.10)\n\nThe difference between the price paid (consideration) for the business combination and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired represents [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] (IFRS3.41). Goodwill is not subject to [[amortization]], but is assessed for [[Revaluation of fixed assets|impairment]] at least annually (IAS36.10). Impairment loss, if any, is charged to the income statement (IAS36.60). Such losses are not subsequently reversed (IAS36.124).\n\n==Property, plant and equipment==\n[[Property, plant and equipment]] (PPE) is measured initially at cost (IAS16.15). Costs include [[interest|borrowing costs]] directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production (IAS23.8).\n\nProperty, plant and equipment may be revalued to [[fair value]] if the entire class of assets to which it belongs is so treated (for example, the revaluation of all freehold properties) (IAS16.31 and 36). Surpluses on [[revaluation of fixed assets#Upward Revaluation of Fixed Assets|revaluation]] are recognised directly to [[Equity (finance)|equity]], not in the income statement; deficits on revaluation are recognised as expenses in the income statement (IAS16.39 and 40).\n\n[[Depreciation]] is charged to write off the cost or valuation of the asset over its estimated useful life down to the recoverable amount (IAS16.50). The cost of depreciation is recognised as an expense in the [[income statement]], unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset (IAS16.48); for example depreciation of PPE used for development activities may be included in the cost of an [[intangible asset]] (IAS16.49). The depreciation method and recoverable amount is reviewed at least annually (IAS16.61). In most cases the method is \"straight line,\" with the same depreciation charge from the date when an asset is brought into use until it is expected to be sold or no further economic benefits obtained from it, but other patterns of depreciation are used if assets are used proportionately more in some periods than others (IAS16.56).\n\n==Joint ventures, associates and other investments==\n[[Joint ventures]] are [[investments]] other than [[subsidiaries]] where the investor has a contractual arrangement with one or more other parties to undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control (IAS31.3).\n\nJoint ventures may be accounted for using either:\n* proportionate consolidation, accounting for the investor's share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint venture (IAS31.30).\n* equity method. The investment is stated initially at cost and adjusted thereafter for the investor's share of post-acquisition changes in net assets. The income statement includes the investor's share of profit or loss of the investment (IAS31.38).\n\nAssociates are investments, other than joint ventures and subsidiaries, in which the investor has a significant influence (the power to participate in financial and operating policy decisions) (IAS28.2). It is presumed that this will be the case if the investment is greater than 20% of the investee unless it can be clearly demonstrated not to be the case (IAS28. 6). Associates are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nInvestments other than [[subsidiaries]], joint ventures and associates are accounted for at their fair values (IAS39.9 and 46) unless:\n* they have fixed or determinable maturity periods and are expected to be held to maturity, in which case they are stated at amortised cost, providing a constant rate of return until maturity;\n* there is no reliable market value, in which case they are measured at cost.\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2013 (2014 in the EU), the requirements of IAS 31 were replaced by IFRS 11. IFRS 11 makes two main changes to IAS 31. Firstly, it allows investors in joint arrangements that are structured through an entity to look through that entity in certain circumstances and treat the joint arrangement as if no entity exists. Secondly, it removes the option to apply proportionate consolidation for joint ventures.\n\n==Inventory (stock)==\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value (IAS2.9). This is similar in principle to [[lower of cost or market]] (LOCOM) in [[US GAAP]].\n\n'Cost' comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing items to their present location and condition (IAS2.10). Where individual items are not identifiable, the [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|\"first in first out\" (FIFO)]] or [[Average Cost|weighted average]] cost formula is used. \"Last in first out\" (LIFO) is not acceptable (IAS2.25).\n\n'Net realisable value' is the estimated selling price less the costs to complete and costs to sell.\n\n==Receivables (debtors) and payables (creditors)==\nReceivables and payables are recorded initially at [[fair value]] (IAS39.43). Subsequent measurement is stated at amortised cost (IAS39.46 and 47). In most cases, [[trade receivable]]s and [[trade payable]]s can be stated at the amount expected to be received or paid; however, it is necessary to discount a receivable or payable with a substantial credit period (see for example IAS18.11 for accounting for revenue).\n\nIf a receivable has been impaired its carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, being the higher of value in use and its [[fair value]] (less costs to sell). 'Value in use' is the [[present value]] of cash flows expected to be derived from the receivable (IAS36.9 and 59).\n\n==Borrowing==\nBorrowing is stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This requires that the costs of arranging the borrowing are deducted from the principal value of debt and are amortised over the period of the debt (IAS39.46).\n\n==Provisions==\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount (IAS37.10). Provisions are recognised when an entity has, at the balance sheet date, a present obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources (for example a future cash payment) and when a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation (IAS37.14). Restructuring provisions are recognised when an entity has a detailed plan for the restructuring and has raised an expectation amongst those affected that it will carry out the restructuring (IAS37.72).\n\n==Revenue==\nRevenue is measured at [[fair value]] of consideration received or receivable (IAS18.9).\n\nRevenue for sale of goods cannot be recognised until the entity has transferred significant risks and rewards of ownership of goods to the buyer (IAS18.14).\n\nRevenue for rendering of services is accounted for to the extent that the stage of completion of the transaction can be measured reliably (IAS18.20).\n\n==Employee costs==\nEmployee costs are recognised when an employee has rendered service during an accounting period (IAS19.10). This requires accruals for short-term compensated absences such as vacation (holiday) pay (IAS19.11). Profit sharing and bonus plans require accrual when an entity has an obligation to make such payments at the reporting date (IAS19.17\n\n==Share-based payment==\nWhere an entity receives goods or services in return for the issue of its own shares or equity instruments it accounts for the fair value of those goods or services as an expense or as an asset (IFRS2.7). Where it offers options and other share based incentives to its employees it is required to assess the market value of the instruments when they are first granted and then to charge the cost over the period in which the benefit vests (IFRS2.10).\n\n==Income taxes==\nTaxes payable in respect of current and prior periods are recognised as a liability to the extent they are unpaid at the balance sheet date (IAS 12.12).\n\n[[Deferred tax]] liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences at the balance sheet date which will result in tax payable in future periods (for example, where tax deductions 'capital allowances' have been claimed for capital items before the equivalent depreciation expense has been charged to the income statement) (IAS 12.15). Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences at the balance sheet date (for example, tax losses which can be used in future periods) if it is probable that there will be future taxable profits against which they can be offset (IAS 12.24, IAS 12.34).\n\nThere are exceptions to the recognition of deferred taxes in relation to goodwill (for deferred tax liabilities), the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in some cases and in relation to investments and interests in subsidiaries, branches, jointly controlled entities and associates providing certain criteria are met (IAS 12.15, IAS 12.24, IAS 12.39, IAS 12.44).\n\n==Cash flow statements==\nIFRS cash flow statements show movements in cash and cash equivalents. This includes cash on hand and demand deposits, short term liquid investments readily convertible to cash and overdrawn bank balances where these readily fluctuate from positive to negative (IAS7.6 to 9). IFRS cashflow statements do not need to show movements in borrowings or net debt.\n\nCash flow statements may be presented using either a direct method, in which major classes of cash receipts and cash payments are disclosed, or using the indirect method, whereby the profit or loss is adjusted for the effect of non-cash adjustments (IAS7.18).\n\nItems on the cash flow statement are classified as operating activities, investing activities and financing (IAS7.10).\n\n==Leasing (accounting by lessees)==\nLeases are classified in IFRS:\n* [[finance lease]], meaning a lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownerships to the lessee. Finance leases are recognized on the balance sheet as an asset (the asset being leased) and as a liability by the lessee and as a receivable by the lessor(IAS17.4, 20, 36).\n* [[operating lease]], meaning a lease other than a finance lease. An expense is recognised in the income statement over the time period that the asset is used (IAS17.4 and 33).\nThe IASB released [[IFRS 16]], which replaces IAS 17 on accounting for leases, in January 2016.\n\n==Fair value==\n[[Fair value]] is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction (IFRS1 App A).\n\n==Amortised cost==\nMeasurement at amortised cost uses the effective interest method to provide a constant [[rate of return]] on an asset or liability until maturity (IAS39.9).\n{{International Financial Reporting Standards}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Category:International Financial Reporting Standards]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n {{technical|date=September 2009}}\n {{cleanup|date=September 2009}}\n {{primary sources|date=February 2014}}\n {{Lead rewrite|date=February 2014}}\n {{format footnotes|date=February 2014}}\n}}\n{{Accounting}}\nThis article lists some of the important requirements of [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS).\n\nReferences to IFRS standards are given in the standard convention, for example (IAS1.10) refers to paragraph 10 of IAS1, Presentation of Financial Statements..\n\n==Presentation of financial statements==\nA complete set of IFRS financial statements is required to include: <ref>International Accounting Standards Board, International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standard 1, \"Presentation of Financial Statements\", paragraph 10</ref><ref name=IAS1>http://www.iasplus.com/en-gb/standards/ias/ias1 Deloitte UK Accounting Plus IAS1</ref><ref name=IAS201>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ifrs.org/IFRSs/IFRS-technical-summaries/Documents/English%20Web%20Summaries%202013/IAS%201.pdf |title=IASB technical summary of IAS1 |access-date=16 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113954/http://www.ifrs.org/IFRSs/IFRS-technical-summaries/Documents/English%20Web%20Summaries%202013/IAS%201.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* a statement of financial position ([[balance sheet]]) as at the end of the period;\n* a [[Income statement#Requirements of IFRS|statement of comprehensive income]] for the period.

An expense is recognised in the income statement over the time period that the asset is used (IAS17.4 and 33).\nThe IASB released [[IFRS 16]], which replaces IAS 17 on accounting for leases, in January 2016.\n\n==Fair value==\n[[Fair value]] is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction (IFRS1 App A).\n\n==Amortised cost==\nMeasurement at amortised cost uses the effective interest method to provide a constant [[rate of return]] on an asset or liability until maturity (IAS39.9).\n{{International Financial Reporting Standards}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Category:International Financial Reporting Standards]]\n", "name_user": "Rich Farmbrough", "label": "safe", "comment": "Update date format tag and add authority control template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Financial_Reporting_Standards_requirements"}
