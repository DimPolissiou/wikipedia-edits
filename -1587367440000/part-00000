He was born to William and Catherine (FitzSimon) Flood, the Master and Matron of the [[List of Irish Poor Law Unions#Waterford|Lismore Union Workhouse]]. He had one older sister (Maria), and five brothers (Francis (his twin brother), Patrick, Frederick, George and James (who died in infancy). Flood received his elementary education at his grandfather's (Andrew FitzSimon) boys academy in Lismore, and was given music lessons by his aunt, Elizabeth FitzSimon. He quickly became an accomplished pianist and, at the age of nine, was invited to give a recital for the [[Duke of Devonshire]] at [[Lismore Castle]]. He entered [[Mount Melleray Abbey|Mount Melleray]] in 1872 and graduated in 1876. During this time, he received private tuition in music from Sir [[Robert Prescott Stewart]] (1825\u20131894) and developed proficiency on other musical instruments. He was organist of [[St Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St. Peter's Pro-Cathedral]] in [[Belfast]] (1878\u201382), the [[Cathedral of the Assumption, Thurles|Cathedral of the Assumption]] in [[Thurles|Thurles, Co.

During his long residency at Enniscorthy (1895\u20131928) Flood authored the majority of his musical compositions and historical publications. Flood was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music (DMus) from the Royal University of Ireland in 1907.<ref>Boydell (2013), p. 395.</ref>\n\nWhile he was organist and musical director at [[St. Aidan's Cathedral]] in Enniscorthy.
