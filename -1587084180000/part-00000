The track is currently owned and operated by [[Speedway Motorsports|Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]]. Before 2008 Jerry Carroll, along with four other investors, were the majority owners of Kentucky Speedway. Depending on layout and configuration the track facility has a grandstand capacity ranging between 69,000 and 107,000.\n\nConstruction of the speedway began in 1998 and was completed in mid-2000. The speedway has hosted the [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]], [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]], [[IndyCar Series]], and the [[Firestone Indy Lights Series]] and most recently, the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] beginning in 2011.\n\n==Track history==\n\n===Early history and construction===\n[[File:Kentucky Speedway.jpg|thumb|left|View of the track from outside turn 3]]\nOn January 8, 1998, Jerry Carroll announced that he and four other investors were going to build a [[$]]153 million racing facility in [[Sparta, Kentucky]].<ref name=cincinnatikentucky>{{cite web|title=Recapping a track's birth |url=http://cincinnati.com/kyspeedway/recapping_a_tracks_birth.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816160239/http://cincinnati.com/kyspeedway/recapping_a_tracks_birth.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 16, 2000 |publisher=Cincinnati.com |accessdate=July 5, 2011 }}</ref> Five months later, groundbreaking ceremonies were held on July 18, 1998. While construction continued, it was announced that the speedway would open with an [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] race in 2000. Afterward, it was announced that the [[Indy Racing League]] [[IndyCar Series]] would promote a race following the ARCA race. Testing at the track began with [[Bill Baird (racing driver)|Bill Baird]], who participated in ARCA. In November 1999, it was announced that it would also hold a [[NASCAR]] Craftsman Truck Series race in 2000. The speedway continued to announce races for the 2000 racing season, one of which was a second ARCA race.<ref name=cincinnatikentucky />\n\nSeveral months later, the speedway decided to resurface the track because of bumps in the surface from winter. On June 16, 2000, the speedway opened with a [[Slim Jim All Pro Series]] event. One day later, the speedway held its first major series, the Craftsman Truck Series, which was won by [[Greg Biffle]].<ref name=cincinnatikentucky /><ref name=keymoments>{{cite web|title=Key moments in Kentucky Speedway history|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2010/08/11/1384833/key-moments-in-kentucky-speedway.html|work=11 August 2010|publisher=Kentucky.com|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref> In August of the same year, [[Buddy Lazier]] won the inaugural IndyCar Series race. On August 29, 2000, NASCAR announced that Kentucky Speedway would also sanction a Busch Series (now [[Xfinity Series]]) race in 2001. One year after the speedway opened, it held its first Busch Series event, with [[Kevin Harvick]] emerging as the winner.<ref name=keymoments />\n\n===2002\u20132011===\nDuring the 2002 Infiniti Pro Series (now [[Indy Lights]]) race at the track, [[Jason Priestley]] suffered a concussion and fractures to his thoracic spine and feet, becoming the first major injury to occur at the speedway. Three years later, Carroll began his efforts to receive a Nextel Cup Series event at the track. While trying to do so, Kentucky Speedway filed an anti-trust lawsuit against NASCAR and the [[International Speedway Corporation]] (ISC).<ref name=keymoments /> The reason for the lawsuit was the claim that both companies violated federal antitrust laws because of restricting the awarding of Nextel Cup Series events.<ref name=kentuckyhistorynascaar>{{cite web|title=Kentucky |url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/kentucky/index.html |publisher=NASCAR |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711190324/http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/kentucky/index.html |archivedate=July 11, 2011 }}</ref> The lawsuit continued for three years before concluding in January 2008 with Judge William O. Bertelsman dismissing the trial with ISC and NASCAR winning the lawsuit. Following the dismissal, Judge Bertelsman commented, \"After careful consideration and a thorough review of the record, and granting Kentucky Speedway the benefit of the doubt on all reasonable inferences therefrom, the court concludes that Speedway has failed to make out its case.\"<ref name=scenedailycase>{{cite news|last=Pockrass|first=Bob|title=NASCAR, ISC win antitrust lawsuit against Kentucky Speedway|url=http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/print/NASCAR_ISC_win_antitrust_lawsuit_against_Kentucky_Speedway.html|accessdate=July 5, 2011|newspaper=SceneDaily|date=January 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nDuring May 2008, the speedway announced that [[Speedway Motorsports|Speedway Motorsports Inc.]] bought the speedway from Jerry Carroll. [[Bruton Smith]] invested $50 million in the speedway, and planned to move a NASCAR Cup Series event to the track by 2009. However, the speedway did not receive a NASCAR Cup Series event in the 2009 season.<ref name=brutonbuyspeedway>{{cite web|title=Bruton Smith to buy Kentucky Speedway-UPDATE|url=http://autoracingsport.com/report-bruton-smith-to-buy-all-or-part-of-kentucky-speedway/|work=22 May 2008|publisher=AutoRacingSport.com|accessdate=July 5, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103003748/http://autoracingsport.com/report-bruton-smith-to-buy-all-or-part-of-kentucky-speedway/|archivedate=January 3, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Also in 2009, the lawsuit against NASCAR and ISC was dropped by Carroll, but other former owners of the speedway sued Carroll, therefore extending the lawsuit even further.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|title=Former track owners move on from case|url=http://espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=4755641|accessdate=July 5, 2011|work=ESPN News Services|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=December 18, 2009|location=[[Sparta, Kentucky]]}}</ref>\n\nThe speedway continued playing host to Camping World Truck Series, Nationwide Series, IndyCar, and Firestone Indy Lights Series events through 2010 and further.

However, the race was overshadowed by numerous logistical problems. A massive traffic jam on [[Interstate 71]] resulted in as many as 20,000 people being unable to get to the race. The traffic situation was so severe that at least one driver ([[Denny Hamlin]]) nearly missed the pre-race drivers' meeting. Many fans still en route by the halfway point of the race were asked to turn back in order to make it easier on those leaving the race. Speedway Motorsports admitted that it had not anticipated the sheer number of fans attending the event (the increased capacity notwithstanding) and had not made any significant upgrades to the infrastructure in and around the facility. Speedway officials apologized for the snafu and allowed those who didn't get in to redeem their tickets at Speedway Motorsports' other tracks for the rest of the season, or the [[2012 Quaker State 400]]. In late 2011, the speedway purchased a 170-acre farm adjacent to its original property which was converted to parking. The purchase was a portion of more than 300 acres of land the speedway converted to parking. Additionally, speedway management began to work with the state government and police to improve event ingress and egress in time for the 2012 race.<ref>Jensen, Tom.

[[Brad Keselowski]] went on to win the second NASCAR Cup Series race ever held. Also in 2012 the Camping World Truck Series lost one of its two dates, focusing solely as part of the triple-header that headlines the Cup race. For 2013, the Cup race was postponed from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon due to rain and [[Matt Kenseth]] went on to win the third ever Cup race, the only time the race has been held in daylight. In addition the speedway also gained a second NASCAR Xfinity Series race that was also 300 miles but would be run in September. [[Ryan Blaney]], the son of NASCAR driver [[Dave Blaney]] pulled off an upset by winning that event. By 2014, NASCAR had become a staple for the track with drivers praising the roughness and age of the track. Brad Keselowski won the Cup race in 2014 from the pole and leading an unheard of 199 of the 267 laps, becoming the first driver to win two Cup races there, and Kyle Busch the inaugural winner would become the second driver to do so in 2015 that started a three-consecutive win streak. The 2015 running marked the first race using NASCAR's low downforce package and the last race for [[Jeff Gordon]] there since he was retiring. Gordon was looking to scratch Kentucky off the list, but he failed to do so with a seventh-place finish, leaving the track as the only facility he failed to win in his illustrious career, but Busch went on to win the NASCAR Cup Series Championship.\n\nIn December 2015 it was announced that in 2016 the speedway would be repaved and partially reconfigured. This was necessary to fix drainage issues after a rain-plagued 2015 weekend, when \"weepers\" from water being pushed up interfered with track drying efforts. In addition, turns 1 and 2 were changed, with the width of the track narrowed from 72 to 56 feet to give cars coming out of the pits a wider apron, and the banking increased from 14 to 17 degrees. Turns 3 and 4 remained 14 degrees. A curing process was used to make the new paving 5 years \"seasoned\" to give the surface character. Finally, SAFER Barriers were added to every single foot of the outside wall all the way around. The completed project was first used in the July 2016 NASCAR weekend, in which Brad Keselowski scored his third win by stretching his last tank of gas to barely beat [[Carl Edwards]]. The win gave Keselowski an average of .500 by winning 3 of the 6 races held, and is the only driver that has won at the speedway in even numbered years since the Cup Series arrived (2012, 2014, and 2016). In 2017, [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] became just the fourth driver to win the race, and he would go on to win the NASCAR Cup Series Championship.\n\nIn 2018, Kentucky lost its standalone [[Xfinity Series]] date to the [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] so Las Vegas could have a second triple header weekend in the fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/34707716/kentucky-motor-speedway-losing-fall-nascar-race|title=Kentucky Motor Speedway losing fall NASCAR race|author=|date=|website=wdrb.com|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> The 2018 tripleheader race weekend kicked of with the Thursday night NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (NCWTS) race. The race, which was won by Louisville native [[Ben Rhodes (racing driver)|Ben Rhodes]], marked the first Truck Series win by a driver from Kentucky since [[Michael Waltrip]]'s [[2011 NextEra Energy Resources 250|2011 Daytona Truck win]]. The other two races that weekend were both won by [[Toyota in motorsport|Toyota]] drivers. [[Christopher Bell (racing driver)|Christopher Bell]] won the Xfinity Series race after spinning in qualifying and Martin Truex Jr. won the [[2018 Quaker State 400]] for back-to-back Cup Series wins at Kentucky. Truex's win also marked the last win for [[Furniture Row Racing]] before the team closed shop at the end of 2018 after facing financial and sponsorship related issues.\n\nIn the [[2019 Quaker State 400]], [[Kurt Busch]] became the first and currently only Chevrolet driver to win at Kentucky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/07/13/kurt-busch-beats-kyle-overtime-kentucky|title=Kurt Busch beats younger brother Kyle in overtime at Kentucky|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Turn 1 at Kentucky.jpg|thumb|right|This is the early morning hours of race day at Kentucky Speedway.]]\n[[File:Trouble in turn 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brad Keselowski]] goes for a spin that takes out multiple cars at Kentucky Speedway in the 2013 Quaker State 400]]\n\n===Track length of paved oval===\nThe track length is disputed by the two major series that run at Kentucky Speedway.

{{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} tri-oval [[oval track racing|speedway]] in [[Sparta, Kentucky]], which has hosted [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]], [[NASCAR]] and [[Indy Racing League]] racing annually since it opened in 2000. The track is currently owned and operated by [[Speedway Motorsports|Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]]. Before 2008 Jerry Carroll, along with four other investors, were the majority owners of Kentucky Speedway. Depending on layout and configuration the track facility has a grandstand capacity ranging between 69,000 and 107,000.\n\nConstruction of the speedway began in 1998 and was completed in mid-2000. The speedway has hosted the [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]], [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]], [[IndyCar Series]], and the [[Firestone Indy Lights Series]] and most recently, the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] beginning in 2011.\n\n==Track history==\n\n===Early history and construction===\n[[File:Kentucky Speedway.jpg|thumb|left|View of the track from outside turn 3]]\nOn January 8, 1998, Jerry Carroll announced that he and four other investors were going to build a [[$]]153 million racing facility in [[Sparta, Kentucky]].<ref name=cincinnatikentucky>{{cite web|title=Recapping a track's birth |url=http://cincinnati.com/kyspeedway/recapping_a_tracks_birth.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816160239/http://cincinnati.com/kyspeedway/recapping_a_tracks_birth.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 16, 2000 |publisher=Cincinnati.com |accessdate=July 5, 2011 }}</ref> Five months later, groundbreaking ceremonies were held on July 18, 1998. While construction continued, it was announced that the speedway would open with an [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] race in 2000. Afterward, it was announced that the [[Indy Racing League]] [[IndyCar Series]] would promote a race following the ARCA race. Testing at the track began with [[Bill Baird (racing driver)|Bill Baird]], who participated in ARCA. In November 1999, it was announced that it would also hold a [[NASCAR]] Craftsman Truck Series race in 2000. The speedway continued to announce races for the 2000 racing season, one of which was a second ARCA race.<ref name=cincinnatikentucky />\n\nSeveral months later, the speedway decided to resurface the track because of bumps in the surface from winter. On June 16, 2000, the speedway opened with a [[Slim Jim All Pro Series]] event. One day later, the speedway held its first major series, the Craftsman Truck Series, which was won by [[Greg Biffle]].<ref name=cincinnatikentucky /><ref name=keymoments>{{cite web|title=Key moments in Kentucky Speedway history|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2010/08/11/1384833/key-moments-in-kentucky-speedway.html|work=11 August 2010|publisher=Kentucky.com|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref> In August of the same year, [[Buddy Lazier]] won the inaugural IndyCar Series race. On August 29, 2000, NASCAR announced that Kentucky Speedway would also sanction a Busch Series (now [[Xfinity Series]]) race in 2001. One year after the speedway opened, it held its first Busch Series event, with [[Kevin Harvick]] emerging as the winner.<ref name=keymoments />\n\n===2002\u20132011===\nDuring the 2002 Infiniti Pro Series (now [[Indy Lights]]) race at the track, [[Jason Priestley]] suffered a concussion and fractures to his thoracic spine and feet, becoming the first major injury to occur at the speedway. Three years later, Carroll began his efforts to receive a Nextel Cup Series event at the track. While trying to do so, Kentucky Speedway filed an anti-trust lawsuit against NASCAR and the [[International Speedway Corporation]] (ISC).<ref name=keymoments /> The reason for the lawsuit was the claim that both companies violated federal antitrust laws because of restricting the awarding of Nextel Cup Series events.<ref name=kentuckyhistorynascaar>{{cite web|title=Kentucky |url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/kentucky/index.html |publisher=NASCAR |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711190324/http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/kentucky/index.html |archivedate=July 11, 2011 }}</ref> The lawsuit continued for three years before concluding in January 2008 with Judge William O. Bertelsman dismissing the trial with ISC and NASCAR winning the lawsuit. Following the dismissal, Judge Bertelsman commented, \"After careful consideration and a thorough review of the record, and granting Kentucky Speedway the benefit of the doubt on all reasonable inferences therefrom, the court concludes that Speedway has failed to make out its case.\"<ref name=scenedailycase>{{cite news|last=Pockrass|first=Bob|title=NASCAR, ISC win antitrust lawsuit against Kentucky Speedway|url=http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/print/NASCAR_ISC_win_antitrust_lawsuit_against_Kentucky_Speedway.html|accessdate=July 5, 2011|newspaper=SceneDaily|date=January 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nDuring May 2008, the speedway announced that [[Speedway Motorsports|Speedway Motorsports Inc.]] bought the speedway from Jerry Carroll. [[Bruton Smith]] invested $50 million in the speedway, and planned to move a NASCAR Cup Series event to the track by 2009. However, the speedway did not receive a NASCAR Cup Series event in the 2009 season.<ref name=brutonbuyspeedway>{{cite web|title=Bruton Smith to buy Kentucky Speedway-UPDATE|url=http://autoracingsport.com/report-bruton-smith-to-buy-all-or-part-of-kentucky-speedway/|work=22 May 2008|publisher=AutoRacingSport.com|accessdate=July 5, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103003748/http://autoracingsport.com/report-bruton-smith-to-buy-all-or-part-of-kentucky-speedway/|archivedate=January 3, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Also in 2009, the lawsuit against NASCAR and ISC was dropped by Carroll, but other former owners of the speedway sued Carroll, therefore extending the lawsuit even further.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|title=Former track owners move on from case|url=http://espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=4755641|accessdate=July 5, 2011|work=ESPN News Services|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=December 18, 2009|location=[[Sparta, Kentucky]]}}</ref>\n\nThe speedway continued playing host to Camping World Truck Series, Nationwide Series, IndyCar, and Firestone Indy Lights Series events through 2010 and further.

However, the race was overshadowed by numerous logistical problems. A massive traffic jam on [[Interstate 71]] resulted in as many as 20,000 people being unable to get to the race. The traffic situation was so severe that at least one driver ([[Denny Hamlin]]) nearly missed the pre-race drivers' meeting. Many fans still en route by the halfway point of the race were asked to turn back in order to make it easier on those leaving the race. Speedway Motorsports admitted that it had not anticipated the sheer number of fans attending the event (the increased capacity notwithstanding) and had not made any significant upgrades to the infrastructure in and around the facility. Speedway officials apologized for the snafu and allowed those who didn't get in to redeem their tickets at Speedway Motorsports' other tracks for the rest of the season, or the [[2012 Quaker State 400]]. In late 2011, the speedway purchased a 170-acre farm adjacent to its original property which was converted to parking. The purchase was a portion of more than 300 acres of land the speedway converted to parking. Additionally, speedway management began to work with the state government and police to improve event ingress and egress in time for the 2012 race.<ref>Jensen, Tom.

[[Brad Keselowski]] went on to win the second NASCAR Cup Series race ever held. Also in 2012 the Camping World Truck Series lost one of its two dates, focusing solely as part of the triple-header that headlines the Cup race. For 2013, the Cup race was postponed from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon due to rain and [[Matt Kenseth]] went on to win the third ever Cup race, the only time the race has been held in daylight. In addition the speedway also gained a second NASCAR Xfinity Series race that was also 300 miles but would be run in September. [[Ryan Blaney]], the son of NASCAR driver [[Dave Blaney]] pulled off an upset by winning that event. By 2014, NASCAR had become a staple for the track with drivers praising the roughness and age of the track. Brad Keselowski won the Cup race in 2014 from the pole and leading an unheard of 199 of the 267 laps, becoming the first driver to win two Cup races there, and Kyle Busch the inaugural winner would become the second driver to do so in 2015 that started a three-consecutive win streak. The 2015 running marked the first race using NASCAR's low downforce package and the last race for [[Jeff Gordon]] there since he was retiring. Gordon was looking to scratch Kentucky off the list, but he failed to do so with a seventh-place finish, leaving the track as the only facility he failed to win in his illustrious career, but Busch went on to win the NASCAR Cup Series Championship.\n\nIn December 2015 it was announced that in 2016 the speedway would be repaved and partially reconfigured. This was necessary to fix drainage issues after a rain-plagued 2015 weekend, when \"weepers\" from water being pushed up interfered with track drying efforts. In addition, turns 1 and 2 were changed, with the width of the track narrowed from 72 to 56 feet to give cars coming out of the pits a wider apron, and the banking increased from 14 to 17 degrees. Turns 3 and 4 remained 14 degrees. A curing process was used to make the new paving 5 years \"seasoned\" to give the surface character. Finally, SAFER Barriers were added to every single foot of the outside wall all the way around. The completed project was first used in the July 2016 NASCAR weekend, in which Brad Keselowski scored his third win by stretching his last tank of gas to barely beat [[Carl Edwards]]. The win gave Keselowski an average of .500 by winning 3 of the 6 races held, and is the only driver that has won at the speedway in even numbered years since the Cup Series arrived (2012, 2014, and 2016). In 2017, [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] became just the fourth driver to win the race, and he would go on to win the NASCAR Cup Series Championship.\n\nIn 2018, Kentucky lost its standalone [[Xfinity Series]] date to the [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] so Las Vegas could have a second triple header weekend in the fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/34707716/kentucky-motor-speedway-losing-fall-nascar-race|title=Kentucky Motor Speedway losing fall NASCAR race|author=|date=|website=wdrb.com|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> The 2018 tripleheader race weekend kicked of with the Thursday night NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (NCWTS) race. The race, which was won by Louisville native [[Ben Rhodes (racing driver)|Ben Rhodes]], marked the first Truck Series win by a driver from Kentucky since [[Michael Waltrip]]'s [[2011 NextEra Energy Resources 250|2011 Daytona Truck win]]. The other two races that weekend were both won by [[Toyota in motorsport|Toyota]] drivers. [[Christopher Bell (racing driver)|Christopher Bell]] won the Xfinity Series race after spinning in qualifying and Martin Truex Jr. won the [[2018 Quaker State 400]] for back-to-back Cup Series wins at Kentucky. Truex's win also marked the last win for [[Furniture Row Racing]] before the team closed shop at the end of 2018 after facing financial and sponsorship related issues.\n\nIn the [[2019 Quaker State 400]], [[Kurt Busch]] became the first and currently only Chevrolet driver to win at Kentucky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/07/13/kurt-busch-beats-kyle-overtime-kentucky|title=Kurt Busch beats younger brother Kyle in overtime at Kentucky|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Turn 1 at Kentucky.jpg|thumb|right|This is the early morning hours of race day at Kentucky Speedway.]]\n[[File:Trouble in turn 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brad Keselowski]] goes for a spin that takes out multiple cars at Kentucky Speedway in the 2013 Quaker State 400]]\n\n===Track length of paved oval===\nThe track length is disputed by the two major series that run at Kentucky Speedway.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

The team that moved to become the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves since the [[American football|football]] and baseball teams played at [[Braves Field]]. After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a \"red\" identifier while retaining the Braves \"Indian Head\" logo. While defenders of the Redskins often cite coach [[William Henry Dietz]], who claimed Native American heritage, to justify the name; the use of Native American names and imagery by this [[National Football League|NFL]] team began in 1932 before hiring Dietz in 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|accessdate=2013-04-24| website=Sports Ecyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]]' name originated from a request by club owner [[Charles Somers]] to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the \"Naps\" following the departure of their star player [[Nap Lajoie]] after the 1914 season.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Baseball writers select \"Indians\" as the best name to apply to the former Naps |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 17, 1915 |access-date= |quote=With the going of Nap Lajoie to the Athletics, a new name had to be selected for the Cleveland American league club.

When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.)

The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the \"noble savage\" honors Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR).

The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol5Iss2/FanDevelopment.htm| title=The Social Psychology of the Creation of a Sports Fan Identity: A Theoretical Review of the Literature| author=Beth Jacobson |website=Athletic Insight - The Online Journal of Sports Psychology| date=2003| accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref> Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name.<ref>{{cite news| title=Letter from Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to fans| date= October 9, 2013| newspaper=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/letter-from-washington-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-to-fans/2013/10/09/e7670ba0-30fe-11e3-8627-c5d7de0a046b_story.html| accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref> When self-esteem becomes bound to the players and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-psychology-of-why-sports-fans-see-their-teams-as-extensions-of-themselves/2015/01/30/521e0464-a816-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html| title=The psychology of why sports fans see their teams as extensions of themselves| author=Eric Simons | date=January 30, 2015| newspaper=The Washington Post| accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots being clearly racist.<ref name=\"Banks.1993\"/>\n\nSome individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name \"symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership\", and that the \"Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people\".<ref name=\"bar\">{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (Newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)|  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-03| df=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: \"Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with [[Body painting|war paint]] on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050825&num=0|title=Mascots are a matter of respect|website=ESPN|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOthers claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. [[Chief Illiniwek]], the former athletic symbol for the [[University of Illinois]], became the subject of protest in 1988.<ref name=\"Spindel\"/> In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: \"His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.)

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the \"noble savage\" honors Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR).

Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name \"symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership\", and that the \"Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people\".<ref name=\"bar\">{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (Newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)|  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-03| df=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: \"Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game?
