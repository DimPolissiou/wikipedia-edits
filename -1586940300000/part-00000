It also is the headquarters of the [[East Sikkim]] district. Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as [[Bhutia]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] and [[Indian Gorkha]]s. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry.\n\nGangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe precise meaning of the name \"Gangtok\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \"hill cut\".<ref name=\"telegang\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Sikkim}}\nLike the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name=\"TT20031006\" /> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name=\"bernier1\" /> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time.\n\nIn 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"HISTORY OF SIKKIM\" /> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass|Jelepla passes]], offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]] near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.<ref name=\"nathuladown\" /> The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name=\"bbc-1\" /><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011).

The city is flanked on east and west by two streams, namely [[Roro Chu]] and [[Ranikhola]], respectively.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, the eastern and western parts. Both the streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the main Ranikhola before it joins the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] at [[Singtam]].<ref name=\"chap4\" /> Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them.<ref name=\"mapsindiagang\" />\n\n[[File:Ban Jhakri Falls - Gangtok.jpg|thumb|right|Banjhakri Falls - Gangtok]]\nMost of [[Sikkim]], including Gangtok, is underlain by [[Precambrian]] rocks which contains [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]] [[phyllite]]s and [[schists]]; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> Surface runoff of water by natural streams (''jhora'') and man-made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]] (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the [[convergent boundary]] of the [[India Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s and is subject to frequent earthquakes.

Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] (8,598&nbsp;m or 28,208&nbsp;ft)\u2014the world's third-highest peak\u2014is visible to the west of the city.

Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, [[temperate]] climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]]s, autumn, winter, and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of {{convert|22|C|F|lk=on|abbr=on|0}} in summer to an average minimum of {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} in winter.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> Summers (lasting from late April to June) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on|lk=on|0}}. The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-[[monsoon]] in May, and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of {{convert|649.6|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> In winter temperature averages between {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|7|C|F|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> [[Snowfall]] is rare, and in recent times, Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005<ref name=\"chap2\" /> and 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gangtok sees snowfall after 15 years \u00bb Northeast Today |url=https://www.northeasttoday.in/gangtok-sees-snowfall-after-15-years/ |accessdate=9 January 2020 |work=Northeast Today |date=7 January 2020}}</ref> Temperatures below [[freezing point|freezing]] are also rare.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> During this season the weather can be unstable, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours.

state of [[Sikkim]]. It also is the headquarters of the [[East Sikkim]] district. Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as [[Bhutia]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] and [[Indian Gorkha]]s. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry.\n\nGangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe precise meaning of the name \"Gangtok\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \"hill cut\".<ref name=\"telegang\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Sikkim}}\nLike the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name=\"TT20031006\" /> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name=\"bernier1\" /> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time.\n\nIn 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"HISTORY OF SIKKIM\" /> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass|Jelepla passes]], offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]] near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.<ref name=\"nathuladown\" /> The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name=\"bbc-1\" /><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). ''China's Ancient Tea Horse Road''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2</ref>\n\nIn 1975, after years of political uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum.<!---Nest&Wings pg-21-24|NaW---> Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.<ref name=\"chap4\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| align    = left\n| title = [[Kangchenjunga]]\n| image1 = Kangch-Goechala.jpg\n| image2 = Kangchenjunga East Face from Zemu Glacier.jpg\n| footer   = <center>[[Kangchenjunga]], visible from Gangtok, the third [[List of highest mountains|highest mountain in the world]], near the [[Zemu Glacier]].</center> \n}}\nGangtok is located at {{Coord|27.3325|N|88.6140|E|}} (coordinates of Gangtok head post office).<ref name=\"FallinGrain\" /> It is situated in the lower [[Himalaya]]s at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"metgang\" /> The town lies on one side of a hill, with \"The Ridge\",<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /><ref name=\"discoveringbook\" /> a promenade housing the [[Raj Bhavan (Sikkim)|Raj Bhawan]], the [[governor]]'s residence, at one end and the palace, situated at an altitude of about {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, at the other. The city is flanked on east and west by two streams, namely [[Roro Chu]] and [[Ranikhola]], respectively.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, the eastern and western parts. Both the streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the main Ranikhola before it joins the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] at [[Singtam]].<ref name=\"chap4\" /> Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them.<ref name=\"mapsindiagang\" />\n\n[[File:Ban Jhakri Falls - Gangtok.jpg|thumb|right|Banjhakri Falls - Gangtok]]\nMost of [[Sikkim]], including Gangtok, is underlain by [[Precambrian]] rocks which contains [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]] [[phyllite]]s and [[schists]]; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> Surface runoff of water by natural streams (''jhora'') and man-made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]] (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the [[convergent boundary]] of the [[India Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] (8,598&nbsp;m or 28,208&nbsp;ft)\u2014the world's third-highest peak\u2014is visible to the west of the city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.<ref name=\"chap4\" />\n\nThere are densely forested regions around Gangtok, consisting of temperate, [[deciduous]] forests of [[Populus|poplar]], [[birch]], [[oak]], and [[elm]], as well as [[evergreen]], [[coniferous]] trees of the [[alpine climate|wet alpine]] zone.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> [[Orchids]] are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. [[Bamboo]]s are also abundant.

Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, [[temperate]] climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]]s, autumn, winter, and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of {{convert|22|C|F|lk=on|abbr=on|0}} in summer to an average minimum of {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} in winter.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> Summers (lasting from late April to June) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on|lk=on|0}}. The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-[[monsoon]] in May, and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of {{convert|649.6|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> In winter temperature averages between {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|7|C|F|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> [[Snowfall]] is rare, and in recent times, Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005<ref name=\"chap2\" /> and 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gangtok sees snowfall after 15 years \u00bb Northeast Today |url=https://www.northeasttoday.in/gangtok-sees-snowfall-after-15-years/ |accessdate=9 January 2020 |work=Northeast Today |date=7 January 2020}}</ref> Temperatures below [[freezing point|freezing]] are also rare.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> During this season the weather can be unstable, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours.

Thus, two measures of {{music|time|4|4}} approximate a single measure of {{music|time|8|8}}, while a single measure of 4/4 emulates 2/2.

He was the founding and former senior [[pastor]] of [[Willow Creek Community Church]] in [[South Barrington, Illinois]], one of the most attended churches in North America, with an average attendance of nearly 24,000 as of late 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://religionnews.com/2018/12/19/as-christmas-nears-willow-creek-hopes-for-a-fresh-start/|title=As Christmas nears, Willow Creek hopes for a fresh start|date=2018-12-19|website=Religion News Service|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> He is the founder of the Willow Creek Association and creator of the Global Leadership Summit. Hybels is also an author of a number of [[Christianity|Christian]] books, especially on the subject of Christian leadership. Previously slated to step down in October 2018, Hybels retired early after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him, though he has denied all allegations. A six-month long independent review found the allegations to be credible.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHybels was born and raised in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]]. He is [[Dutch-American]] and was a regular participant in the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]] which holds to [[Calvinist]] Theology. Hybel's father was an entrepreneur in wholesale produce whose work ethic was the model for his son. In a 2006 interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', he pointed to an experience at a Wisconsin summer camp as a teenager that crystallized his understanding and personal embrace of Christian belief. Hybels holds a bachelor's degree in Biblical Studies from [[Trinity International University]], near [[Chicago]], and an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from TIU's [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]]. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-061121-hybelsprofile-story.html|title=REV.

Hybels was captivated with the vision and abandoned his business aspirations for ministry.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1971, Hybels\u2014then serving as youth pastor at South Park Church in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]]\u2014started a youth group with friend Dave Holmbo called 'Son City'.<ref>[http://www.ascg.org/journal/11Spg00/Reid.html Journal/ASCG Vol.11, Spg 2000 - Reid<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407215641/http://www.ascg.org/journal/11Spg00/Reid.html |date=April 7, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.willowcreek.org/news/retrospective/default.asp News at Willow Creek Community Church<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225617/http://www.willowcreek.org/news/retrospective/default.asp |date=September 26, 2007 }}</ref> Modern music, dramatic skits and multimedia were combined with Bible studies in relevant language, and the group grew from 25 to 1,200 in just three years.\n\nAfter 300 youth waited in line to be led to Christ in a service in May 1974, Hybels and other leaders began dreaming of forming a new church. They surveyed the community to find out why people weren't coming to church. Common answers included: \"church is boring\", \"they're always asking for money\", or \"I don't like being preached down to.\" These answers shaped the group's approach to the new church.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212082831/https://www.prairie.edu/servant/InnerviewBillHybels.pdf|archive-date=December 12, 2007|url=https://www.prairie.edu/servant/InnerviewBillHybels.pdf|title=Interview with Bill Hybels: May 2007|work=Servant|access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn October 12, 1975, the group held its first service at Willow Creek Theater in [[Palatine, Illinois]]. One hundred and twenty-five people attended the service. The rent and other costs were paid for with 1,200 baskets of tomatoes, sold door-to-door by 100 teenagers.

They were used on the Central line between 1962 and 1995.\n\n==Construction==\nThe 1962 Stock was built by [[Metro-Cammell]] and the BR Workshops in Derby for use on the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]. Each unit consisted of four vehicles; two outer driving motors (DM), an intermediate trailer (T), and an intermediate non-driving motor (NDM), formed DM + T + NDM + DM. A train usually consisted of two units working in multiple forming an eight coach train. Most 1962 stock were 4 cars long, although an extra three car unit was also ordered; this vehicle lacked a Non Driving Motor and was numbered 1751. This unit was ordered specifically for the Aldwych shuttle until it entered service on the Central Line.\n\nThe 1962 Stock was ordered as a matter of urgency to replace the [[London Underground Standard Stock|Standard Stock]] previously used on the Central line. Two fires on Standard Stock units (in 1958 and 1960) resulted in the hospitalisation of dozens of passengers. This experience, plus rapidly increasing numbers of breakdowns, hastened the need to replace these trains (which dated back to the 1920s).\n\nThe 1962 stock was ordered from [[Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|Birmingham RC&W]] (338 DM and 112 NDM) and from the [[British Railways]] workshops in Derby (169 T), a total of 619 cars. In 1961, BRCW asked to be relieved of their contract, as they were in financial difficulty, and the order was transferred to Metro-Cammell, and was delivered as a continuation of the 1959 stock.\n\nAs part of the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]] contract, [[Metro-Cammell]] were requested to construct an extra 57 NDM so that eight car trains of 1959 stock could be temporarily formed, such was the urgency to replace the trains on the Central line. The first 1962 stock train of eight cars commenced service on 12 April 1962, with all trains available for service by 17 May 1964.

The major improvement was the use of motor alternators for the auxiliary supplies using static rectification, instead of the motor generator sets. The drivers brake valve used the more reliable poppet valve instead of rotary type face valves, and the electro-pneumatic valves used plug in connectors, speeding up replacement and reducing faults due to bad electrical connections.\n\n==Replacement==\nBy the early 1990s, the 1962 Stock was due for replacement. This came in the form of the new [[London Underground 1992 Stock|1992 Stock]], which was developed from the prototype [[London Underground 1986 Stock|1986 Stock]].

They were intended for use on the [[Piccadilly line]], but also saw use on several other tube lines. It was the first production (not prototype) tube stock to have unpainted [[aluminium]] alloy bodywork.\n\n==Construction==\nThe 1959 Stock was built by [[Metro-Cammell]] in [[Birmingham]] and were closely based on the prototype aluminium alloy bodied [[London Underground 1956 Stock|1956 Stock]]. It operated at various times on the [[Northern line]], [[Bakerloo line]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] and Piccadilly line. The units had a long career, with some examples remaining in service until 2000, three years beyond their intended withdrawal date.\n\nThe 1959 Stock entered service on the Piccadilly line, but most units were drafted to the Central line because that line's [[London Underground Standard Stock|\"Standard stock\"]] was becoming very unreliable. The Central line's version of the 1959 stock, the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 stock]], later took over.\n\n==Transfer from the Piccadilly line==\nThe Piccadilly line extension to [[Heathrow]], which opened in the early 1970s, coincided with the introduction of new [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]]. Therefore, the 1959 Stock was transferred to the Northern line between 1975 and 1979, allowing the scrapping of the oldest 1938 Stock on that line. The 1959 Stock also saw service on the Bakerloo line in the 1980s, again to facilitate withdrawal of 1938 Stock.\n\nWhen new, the 1959 stock was seen as distinctive because of the clean 'silver' exterior. Over the years, however, the trains' unpainted exteriors became jaded and dirty. The blue and grey interiors dated quickly.

They were intended for use on the [[Piccadilly line]], but also saw use on several other tube lines. It was the first production (not prototype) tube stock to have unpainted [[aluminium]] alloy bodywork.\n\n==Construction==\nThe 1959 Stock was built by [[Metro-Cammell]] in [[Birmingham]] and were closely based on the prototype aluminium alloy bodied [[London Underground 1956 Stock|1956 Stock]]. It operated at various times on the [[Northern line]], [[Bakerloo line]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] and Piccadilly line. The units had a long career, with some examples remaining in service until 2000, three years beyond their intended withdrawal date.\n\nThe 1959 Stock entered service on the Piccadilly line, but most units were drafted to the Central line because that line's [[London Underground Standard Stock|\"Standard stock\"]] was becoming very unreliable. The Central line's version of the 1959 stock, the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 stock]], later took over.\n\n==Transfer from the Piccadilly line==\nThe Piccadilly line extension to [[Heathrow]], which opened in the early 1970s, coincided with the introduction of new [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]]. Therefore, the 1959 Stock was transferred to the Northern line between 1975 and 1979, allowing the scrapping of the oldest 1938 Stock on that line. The 1959 Stock also saw service on the Bakerloo line in the 1980s, again to facilitate withdrawal of 1938 Stock.\n\nWhen new, the 1959 stock was seen as distinctive because of the clean 'silver' exterior. Over the years, however, the trains' unpainted exteriors became jaded and dirty. The blue and grey interiors dated quickly. Stylistically the 1959 stock looked worn, but without the aesthetic red and green charm or old-fashioned thirties ambience of the more celebrated [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 stock]].\n\nBy the mid-1990s these units were getting old and were in need of works attention. By this time, all the remaining 1959 Stock was concentrated on the Northern line. Minor refurbishment of the stock took place, painting the blue/grey interiors white and replacing some of the seat moquettes. This was done in a haphazard manner, the white interiors becoming very dirty inside by 1998, and with a failure rate that had risen to 1 in {{convert|1864|mi|km|abbr=off}}, the 1959 Stock was in urgent need of replacement.\n\n==Replacement==\nNew trains in the form of [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995 Stock]] were built as replacements for both the 1959 stock and the 30 trains of [[London Underground 1972 Stock|1972 stock]] also operating on the Northern line. Originally it had been planned to keep the 1972 stock running with the new trains, with the same extensive refurbishment as done to the 1972 stock on the Bakerloo line, but after one trial refurbishment of a Northern line 1972 stock carriage it was decided that it would be more cost-effective in the long run to have the line operated by one type of train only.
