In the past few years he also competed at the international level on a limited basis, running a handful of races in the [[NASCAR Nextel Cup Series]], [[NASCAR Busch Series]], [[NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series]], [[Indy Lights]], [[Champ Car World Series]], [[A1 Grand Prix]], and [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]. He is known for winning the [[pole position]] for the inaugural Busch Series race in Mexico City.\n\n==Early career==\n\nGoeters had an early start in motorsports, beginning in motocross at age 8. He won several championships in Mexico, as well as international events in this discipline, before making the move to auto racing in 1993.\n\nIn 1996, he won his first national championship, in the Prototypes category. The next year he won the Mexican Trans-Am series, and in 1998 he went to compete in the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1998, he had a fairly successful debut season in the [[Indy Lights]] championship, in which he earned one Pole position, one track record, two top five, and two top ten finishes.\n\nBack in his homeland, he competed in the Mexican Formula 2 Championship in 2001, and the [[MasterCard Truck Series]] Championship in 2002.\n\nIn 2004 he took part in the inaugural season of the [[Desaf\u00edo Corona]] stock car series, and finished 4th in the championship.\n\n==Career in NASCAR and other international series==\n\nIn 2004, he tried to qualify for a [[NASCAR West Series]] event at [[Irwindale Event Center]] but failed to qualify. He returned for West Series in 2005, now at [[Auto Club Speedway]], Goeters made the race and finished 10th.\n\n2005 was a very eventful year for Goeters, as he won the championship in the [[Desaf\u00edo Corona]] series, and made his [[NASCAR]] and [[Grand-Am]] debut, as well as his lone start in the [[Champ Car World Series]].\n\nGoeters won a very popular pole position in his [[NASCAR Busch Series]] debut at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez]] in [[Mexico City]], driving the No. 66 Canel's/Scotiabank [[Ford Taurus]] for [[Brewco Motorsports]]. He led 24 laps, but later had to retire from the race with an engine failure. He ran two more Busch Series races in 2005, driving the No. 32 Chevy for [[Braun Racing]], with a best result of 9th at [[Watkins Glen International]].\n\nHe contested a [[2005 Tecate/Telmex Grand Prix of Monterrey|Champ Car race in Monterrey, Mexico]] for PKV Racing, but had to retire with mechanical problems on Lap 24.\n\nHe made his lone [[NASCAR Nextel Cup Series]] start at Watkins Glen, driving the No. 50 Dodge for [[Arnold Motorsports]]. He led some laps during the race, but eventually finished 35th as a result of small contact in the closing laps.\n\nIn 2005, he also competed in the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] event at Watkins Glen.\n\nAfter his success in the 2005 season, Goeters looked to continue his career in the United States, and in 2006 the announcement was made that he would drive for a new team in the Busch Series, [[Latin American Racing]]; however, the team never became a reality. Still, Goeters took part in a handful of races in the Busch Series. He returned to run the Mexico City race with Brewco, finishing 14th, and then joined [[Jay Robinson Racing]] to drive the No. 49 [[Ford]]. He finished 41st at Bristol and 24th at Nashville, but failed to qualify at Las Vegas, Atlanta, Texas, Phoenix and Richmond in the team's underpowered car. Goeters left the team, and then made another start in the season finale at Homestead, driving the No. 63 car for [[Spraker Racing Enterprises]], but retired with mechanical problems.\n\nAlso in 2006, he made a start in [[ARCA Re/Max Series]] at [[Chicagoland Speedway]] driving No. 24 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for [[Bob Schacht Motorsports]]. Goeters started 19th and finished 7th after led 4 laps.\n\nIn 2007, Goeters competed in the [[NASCAR Busch Series]] as a [[road course ringer]]. He ran at Mexico City, Watkins Glen, and Montreal, with strong qualifying performances in the three races. However, his only good finish came at home as he finished 7th at Mexico City. He also competed in the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] race at Mexico City, and in the opening event of the [[A1 Grand Prix]] series for Team Mexico. He also drove full-time in the [[NASCAR Corona Series]], in which he won a race at [[Guadalajara]] and finished 6th in the championship.\n\nIn 2008, he returned to run full-time in Mexico, and finished 6th in the [[NASCAR Corona Series]], driving the No. 4 car.\n\nDuring the 97th lap of a 100-lap Corona Series race at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Miguel E. Abed]] in [[Amozoc]], [[Puebla]], on June 14, 2009, Goeters made contact with [[Carlos Pardo]], which caused the latter to lose control of his car and impact against a barrier sideways at over 200&nbsp;km/h causing the disintegration of the car and Pardo's death. As the race was over the time limit, the standings of the previous lap were taken into account and Pardo was posthumously declared winner.<ref name=reuters>{{cite news|title=Driver dies in Nascar Mexico race|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/motorSportsNews/idUKN1415039120090615|date=2009-06-15|accessdate=2009-06-15|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 he was the champion of [[NASCAR Toyota Series]].\n\n==Personal life==\nGoeters is part of a racing family that also includes his brothers [[Patrick Goeters|Patrick]] and Eduardo, who have also competed successfully in several categories in Mexico, including the [[NASCAR Corona Series]].\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===Career summary===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Series\n!Team\n!Races\n!Wins\n!Poles\n!Fast laps\n!Points\n!Pos.\n|-\n![[1998 Indy Lights season|1998]]\n|[[Indy Lights]]\n|[[Quaker State Team Go]]\n|12\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|34\n|16th\n|-\n![[2005 Champ Car season|2005]]\n|[[Champ Car]]\n|[[KV Racing Technology|PKV Racing]]\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|29th\n|-\n![[2007-08 A1 Grand Prix season|2007-08]]\n|[[A1 Grand Prix]]\n|[[A1 Team Mexico]]\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|16th <small>(1)</small>\n|}\n*<small>(1) = Team standings.</small>\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

In the past few years he also competed at the international level on a limited basis, running a handful of races in the [[NASCAR Nextel Cup Series]], [[NASCAR Busch Series]], [[NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series]], [[Indy Lights]], [[Champ Car World Series]], [[A1 Grand Prix]], and [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]. He is known for winning the [[pole position]] for the inaugural Busch Series race in Mexico City.\n\n==Early career==\n\nGoeters had an early start in motorsports, beginning in motocross at age 8. He won several championships in Mexico, as well as international events in this discipline, before making the move to auto racing in 1993.\n\nIn 1996, he won his first national championship, in the Prototypes category. The next year he won the Mexican Trans-Am series, and in 1998 he went to compete in the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1998, he had a fairly successful debut season in the [[Indy Lights]] championship, in which he earned one Pole position, one track record, two top five, and two top ten finishes.\n\nBack in his homeland, he competed in the Mexican Formula 2 Championship in 2001, and the [[MasterCard Truck Series]] Championship in 2002.\n\nIn 2004 he took part in the inaugural season of the [[Desaf\u00edo Corona]] stock car series, and finished 4th in the championship.\n\n==Career in NASCAR and other international series==\n\nIn 2004, he tried to qualify for a [[NASCAR West Series]] event at [[Irwindale Event Center]] but failed to qualify. He returned for West Series in 2005, now at [[Auto Club Speedway]], Goeters made the race and finished 10th.\n\n2005 was a very eventful year for Goeters, as he won the championship in the [[Desaf\u00edo Corona]] series, and made his [[NASCAR]] and [[Grand-Am]] debut, as well as his lone start in the [[Champ Car World Series]].\n\nGoeters won a very popular pole position in his [[NASCAR Busch Series]] debut at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez]] in [[Mexico City]], driving the No. 66 Canel's/Scotiabank [[Ford Taurus]] for [[Brewco Motorsports]]. He led 24 laps, but later had to retire from the race with an engine failure. He ran two more Busch Series races in 2005, driving the No. 32 Chevy for [[Braun Racing]], with a best result of 9th at [[Watkins Glen International]].\n\nHe contested a [[2005 Tecate/Telmex Grand Prix of Monterrey|Champ Car race in Monterrey, Mexico]] for PKV Racing, but had to retire with mechanical problems on Lap 24.\n\nHe made his lone [[NASCAR Nextel Cup Series]] start at Watkins Glen, driving the No. 50 Dodge for [[Arnold Motorsports]]. He led some laps during the race, but eventually finished 35th as a result of small contact in the closing laps.\n\nIn 2005, he also competed in the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] event at Watkins Glen.\n\nAfter his success in the 2005 season, Goeters looked to continue his career in the United States, and in 2006 the announcement was made that he would drive for a new team in the Busch Series, [[Latin American Racing]]; however, the team never became a reality. Still, Goeters took part in a handful of races in the Busch Series. He returned to run the Mexico City race with Brewco, finishing 14th, and then joined [[Jay Robinson Racing]] to drive the No. 49 [[Ford]]. He finished 41st at Bristol and 24th at Nashville, but failed to qualify at Las Vegas, Atlanta, Texas, Phoenix and Richmond in the team's underpowered car. Goeters left the team, and then made another start in the season finale at Homestead, driving the No. 63 car for [[Spraker Racing Enterprises]], but retired with mechanical problems.\n\nAlso in 2006, he made a start in [[ARCA Re/Max Series]] at [[Chicagoland Speedway]] driving No. 24 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for [[Bob Schacht Motorsports]]. Goeters started 19th and finished 7th after led 4 laps.\n\nIn 2007, Goeters competed in the [[NASCAR Busch Series]] as a [[road course ringer]]. He ran at Mexico City, Watkins Glen, and Montreal, with strong qualifying performances in the three races. However, his only good finish came at home as he finished 7th at Mexico City. He also competed in the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] race at Mexico City, and in the opening event of the [[A1 Grand Prix]] series for Team Mexico. He also drove full-time in the [[NASCAR Corona Series]], in which he won a race at [[Guadalajara]] and finished 6th in the championship.\n\nIn 2008, he returned to run full-time in Mexico, and finished 6th in the [[NASCAR Corona Series]], driving the No. 4 car.\n\nDuring the 97th lap of a 100-lap Corona Series race at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Miguel E. Abed]] in [[Amozoc]], [[Puebla]], on June 14, 2009, Goeters made contact with [[Carlos Pardo]], which caused the latter to lose control of his car and impact against a barrier sideways at over 200&nbsp;km/h causing the disintegration of the car and Pardo's death. As the race was over the time limit, the standings of the previous lap were taken into account and Pardo was posthumously declared winner.<ref name=reuters>{{cite news|title=Driver dies in Nascar Mexico race|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/motorSportsNews/idUKN1415039120090615|date=2009-06-15|accessdate=2009-06-15|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 he was the champion of [[NASCAR Toyota Series]].\n\n==Personal life==\nGoeters is part of a racing family that also includes his brothers [[Patrick Goeters|Patrick]] and Eduardo, who have also competed successfully in several categories in Mexico, including the [[NASCAR Corona Series]].\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===Career summary===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Series\n!Team\n!Races\n!Wins\n!Poles\n!Fast laps\n!Points\n!Pos.\n|-\n![[1998 Indy Lights season|1998]]\n|[[Indy Lights]]\n|[[Quaker State Team Go]]\n|12\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|34\n|16th\n|-\n![[2005 Champ Car season|2005]]\n|[[Champ Car]]\n|[[KV Racing Technology|PKV Racing]]\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|29th\n|-\n![[2007-08 A1 Grand Prix season|2007-08]]\n|[[A1 Grand Prix]]\n|[[A1 Team Mexico]]\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|16th <small>(1)</small>\n|}\n*<small>(1) = Team standings.</small>\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Reporters avoid [[idiom]]s and use a core vocabulary of about [[:simple:Wikipedia:VOA Special English Word Book|1500 words]], plus any terms needed to explain a story.

Other programs explore American society, U.S. history, idiomatic expressions, science, and arts and entertainment.\n\nFor example, an 18 May 2010, script described [[rheumatoid arthritis]] this way:\n\n<blockquote>Rheumatoid arthritis is a painful disease that can destroy joints. Women are three times more likely to get it than men. Rheumatoid arthritis is considered an autoimmune disease, a disease where the body attacks healthy cells. The exact cause is unknown.

The Navy Cross is awarded primarily to a member of the [[United States Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] (when operating as a part of the Department of the Navy) for extraordinary heroism.<ref>SECNAVYINST 2006, 1650.1H, P. 2--22&23</ref> The medal is equivalent to the Army's [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the Air Force and Space Force's [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]], and the [[Coast Guard Cross]].\n\nThe Navy Cross is bestowed by the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] and may also be awarded to members of the other armed services, and to foreign military personnel while serving with the U.S. naval services. The Navy Cross was established by Act of Congress ([[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 40/65th Congress/3rd Session/Chapter 14|Public Law 65-253]]) and approved on February 4, 1919.\n\n==History==\nThe Navy Cross was instituted in part due to the entrance of the United States into [[World War I]]. Many European nations had the custom of decorating heroes from other nations, but the [[Medal of Honor]] was the sole U.S. award for valor at the time.<ref name=\"NHC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/browse-by-topic/heritage/awards/decorations/navy-cross.html|title=The Navy Cross|date=January 17, 2018|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> The Army instituted the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1918, while the Navy followed suit in 1919, retroactive to 6 April 1917. Originally, the Navy Cross was lower in precedence than the Medal of Honor and the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], because it was awarded for both combat heroism and for \"other distinguished service\".<ref name=\"NHC\"/> Congress revised this on 7 August 1942, making the Navy Cross a combat-only decoration that follows the Medal of Honor in order of precedence. Since the medal was established, it has been awarded more than 6,300 times.<ref name=\"NHC\"/> It was designed by [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]].<ref name=\"NHC\" /> Since the [[11 September attacks]] the Navy Cross has been awarded 47 times, with two of them having the name of the recipient held in secret.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brook |first=Tom Vanden |date=5 December 2016 |title=Navy secretary recommends two Medals of Honor |url=https://www.navytimes.com/articles/navy-secretary-recommends-two-medals-of-honor |newspaper=NavyTimes |access-date=30 December 2016 }}</ref> One of those secret awardings was due to actions during the [[2012 Benghazi attack]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Scarborough |first=Rowen |date=25 January 2014 |title=Delta Force commando who saved 'numerous lives' in Benghazi {{sic|sei|ge|hide=y}} honored |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/delta-force-commando-awarded-second-highest-milita/ |newspaper=Washington Times |access-date=1 January 2017 }}<br/>{{cite news |last=Brook |first=Tom Vanden |date=16 May 2016 |title=Navy SEALs' secret medals reveal heroism over last 15 years |url=https://www.navytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/05/16/navy-seals-medals-secret-awards/84433626/ |newspaper=NavyTimes |access-date=1 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Criteria==\n\nThe Navy Cross may be awarded to any member of the U.S. Armed Forces while serving with the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard (when a part of the Department of the Navy) who distinguishes himself or herself in action by extraordinary heroism not justifying an award of the [[Medal of Honor]]. The action must take place under one of three circumstances:\n# In combat action while engaged against an enemy of the United States; or,\n# In combat action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or, \n# In combat action while serving with friendly foreign forces, who are engaged in armed conflict in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\n\nThe act(s) to be commended must be performed in the presence of great danger, or at great personal risk, and must be performed in such a manner as to render the individual's action(s) highly conspicuous among others of equal grade, rate, experience, or position of responsibility. An accumulation of minor acts of heroism does not justify an award of the Navy Cross.  As originally authorized, the Navy Cross could be awarded for distinguished non-combat acts, but legislation of 7 August 1942 limited the award to acts of combat heroism.\n\n==Wear==\nThe Navy Cross originally was the Navy's third-highest decoration, after the [[Medal of Honor]] and the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]]. On 7 August 1942, Congress revised the order of precedence, placing the Navy Cross above the Distinguished Service Medal in precedence. Since that time, the Navy Cross has been worn after the Medal of Honor and before all other awards.\n\nAdditional awards of the Navy Cross are denoted by gold or silver [[5/16 inch star|{{frac|5|16}} inch stars]] affixed to the suspension and [[service ribbon]] of the medal. A gold star would be issued for each of the second through fifth awards, to be replaced by a silver star which would indicate a sixth award.  To date no one has received more than five awards.\n\n==Description and symbolism==\n[[File:\"A gun crew of six Negroes who were given the Navy Cross for standing by their gun when their ship was damaged by enemy - NARA - 520688.tif|thumb|Crew members of [[USS_Intrepid_(CV-11)|USS ''Intrepid'']]: AtM2/c Jonell Copeland; StM Que Gant; StM Harold Clark, Jr.; StM James Dockery; StM Alonzo Swann; and StM Eli Benjamin, were awarded the Navy Cross for being the only gun crew who would fire one of their [[aircraft carrier]]'s [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s into a [[kamikaze]] [[dive bomber]] as it was diving towards the carrier's flight deck and their battle station(s) during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in 1944]]\n\n; Medal\nThe earliest version of the Navy Cross (1919\u20131928) featured a more narrow strip of white, while the so-called \"Black Widow\" medals awarded from 1941 to 1942 were notable for the dark color due to over-[[Anodizing|anodized]] finish. The medal is similar in appearance to the British [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]].<ref name=\"NHC\"/>\n\nObverse:\nThe medal is a modified [[cross patt\u00e9e]] one and a half inches wide. The ends of its arms are rounded whereas a conventional cross pat\u00e9e has arms that are straight on the end. There are four laurel leaves with berries in each of the re-entrant arms of the cross. In the center of the cross a sailing vessel is depicted on waves, sailing to the viewer's left. The vessel is a symbolic [[caravel]] of the type used between 1480 and 1500. Fraser selected the caravel because it was a symbol often used by the Naval Academy and because it represented both naval service and the tradition of the sea. The laurel leaves with berries refer to achievement.\n\nReverse:\nIn the center of the medal, a bronze cross patt\u00e9e, one and a half inches wide, are crossed anchors from the pre-1850 period, with cables attached. The letters USN are evident amid the anchors.\n\n; Service Ribbon\nThe [[service ribbon]] is [[navy blue]] with a center stripe of [[white]] identical to the suspension ribbon of the medal. The blue alludes to naval service; the white represents the purity of selflessness.\n\n==Notable recipients== \n<!-- Please do not add additional people to this list unless there is already an article for them or a supporting reference.

The Navy Cross was established by Act of Congress ([[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 40/65th Congress/3rd Session/Chapter 14|Public Law 65-253]]) and approved on February 4, 1919.\n\n==History==\nThe Navy Cross was instituted in part due to the entrance of the United States into [[World War I]]. Many European nations had the custom of decorating heroes from other nations, but the [[Medal of Honor]] was the sole U.S. award for valor at the time.<ref name=\"NHC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/browse-by-topic/heritage/awards/decorations/navy-cross.html|title=The Navy Cross|date=January 17, 2018|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> The Army instituted the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1918, while the Navy followed suit in 1919, retroactive to 6 April 1917. Originally, the Navy Cross was lower in precedence than the Medal of Honor and the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], because it was awarded for both combat heroism and for \"other distinguished service\".<ref name=\"NHC\"/> Congress revised this on 7 August 1942, making the Navy Cross a combat-only decoration that follows the Medal of Honor in order of precedence. Since the medal was established, it has been awarded more than 6,300 times.<ref name=\"NHC\"/> It was designed by [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]].<ref name=\"NHC\" /> Since the [[11 September attacks]] the Navy Cross has been awarded 47 times, with two of them having the name of the recipient held in secret.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brook |first=Tom Vanden |date=5 December 2016 |title=Navy secretary recommends two Medals of Honor |url=https://www.navytimes.com/articles/navy-secretary-recommends-two-medals-of-honor |newspaper=NavyTimes |access-date=30 December 2016 }}</ref> One of those secret awardings was due to actions during the [[2012 Benghazi attack]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Scarborough |first=Rowen |date=25 January 2014 |title=Delta Force commando who saved 'numerous lives' in Benghazi {{sic|sei|ge|hide=y}} honored |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/delta-force-commando-awarded-second-highest-milita/ |newspaper=Washington Times |access-date=1 January 2017 }}<br/>{{cite news |last=Brook |first=Tom Vanden |date=16 May 2016 |title=Navy SEALs' secret medals reveal heroism over last 15 years |url=https://www.navytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/05/16/navy-seals-medals-secret-awards/84433626/ |newspaper=NavyTimes |access-date=1 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Criteria==\n\nThe Navy Cross may be awarded to any member of the U.S. Armed Forces while serving with the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard (when a part of the Department of the Navy) who distinguishes himself or herself in action by extraordinary heroism not justifying an award of the [[Medal of Honor]]. The action must take place under one of three circumstances:\n# In combat action while engaged against an enemy of the United States; or,\n# In combat action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or, \n# In combat action while serving with friendly foreign forces, who are engaged in armed conflict in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\n\nThe act(s) to be commended must be performed in the presence of great danger, or at great personal risk, and must be performed in such a manner as to render the individual's action(s) highly conspicuous among others of equal grade, rate, experience, or position of responsibility. An accumulation of minor acts of heroism does not justify an award of the Navy Cross.  As originally authorized, the Navy Cross could be awarded for distinguished non-combat acts, but legislation of 7 August 1942 limited the award to acts of combat heroism.\n\n==Wear==\nThe Navy Cross originally was the Navy's third-highest decoration, after the [[Medal of Honor]] and the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]]. On 7 August 1942, Congress revised the order of precedence, placing the Navy Cross above the Distinguished Service Medal in precedence. Since that time, the Navy Cross has been worn after the Medal of Honor and before all other awards.\n\nAdditional awards of the Navy Cross are denoted by gold or silver [[5/16 inch star|{{frac|5|16}} inch stars]] affixed to the suspension and [[service ribbon]] of the medal. A gold star would be issued for each of the second through fifth awards, to be replaced by a silver star which would indicate a sixth award.  To date no one has received more than five awards.\n\n==Description and symbolism==\n[[File:\"A gun crew of six Negroes who were given the Navy Cross for standing by their gun when their ship was damaged by enemy - NARA - 520688.tif|thumb|Crew members of [[USS_Intrepid_(CV-11)|USS ''Intrepid'']]: AtM2/c Jonell Copeland; StM Que Gant; StM Harold Clark, Jr.; StM James Dockery; StM Alonzo Swann; and StM Eli Benjamin, were awarded the Navy Cross for being the only gun crew who would fire one of their [[aircraft carrier]]'s [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s into a [[kamikaze]] [[dive bomber]] as it was diving towards the carrier's flight deck and their battle station(s) during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in 1944]]\n\n; Medal\nThe earliest version of the Navy Cross (1919\u20131928) featured a more narrow strip of white, while the so-called \"Black Widow\" medals awarded from 1941 to 1942 were notable for the dark color due to over-[[Anodizing|anodized]] finish. The medal is similar in appearance to the British [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]].<ref name=\"NHC\"/>\n\nObverse:\nThe medal is a modified [[cross patt\u00e9e]] one and a half inches wide. The ends of its arms are rounded whereas a conventional cross pat\u00e9e has arms that are straight on the end. There are four laurel leaves with berries in each of the re-entrant arms of the cross. In the center of the cross a sailing vessel is depicted on waves, sailing to the viewer's left. The vessel is a symbolic [[caravel]] of the type used between 1480 and 1500. Fraser selected the caravel because it was a symbol often used by the Naval Academy and because it represented both naval service and the tradition of the sea. The laurel leaves with berries refer to achievement.\n\nReverse:\nIn the center of the medal, a bronze cross patt\u00e9e, one and a half inches wide, are crossed anchors from the pre-1850 period, with cables attached. The letters USN are evident amid the anchors.\n\n; Service Ribbon\nThe [[service ribbon]] is [[navy blue]] with a center stripe of [[white]] identical to the suspension ribbon of the medal. The blue alludes to naval service; the white represents the purity of selflessness.\n\n==Notable recipients== \n<!-- Please do not add additional people to this list unless there is already an article for them or a supporting reference.
