The Italian inaion of [[British Somaliland]] was to be based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at th same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, an Italian {{lang|fr|coup de main}} was impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East African Empire), formed from Ethiopia and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895\u20131896), Italy had been thwarted in its colonial ambitions but in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936) the Italians again invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain, ([[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]). The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy [[Egypt]] in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine, of a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall its use by the Allies, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter British interference. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar by occupying British Somaliland and defeating the garrison.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, to cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary.

The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan position===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7 to 8 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Karrim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery, the advantage was of dubious advantage. The defenders were too few in number to cover the gap and the hills were far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackenzie|1y=1951|1p=22|2a1=Playfair|2y=1959|1pp=175\u2013176}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled for loading, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. Next day, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta,\n\n{{quote|Pour all available reserves into Somaliland to stimulate the operation. Order the entire Imperial air force to co-operate.|Mussolini{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}}}}\n\nA counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass, by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Air operations===\n[[File:3inch20cwtAAgunHayesCommonMay1940.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of a 3-inch 20 cwt Anti-Aircraft gun (UK, May1940}}]]\nThe British airfields at Berbera and [[Laferug]] had only small arms for defence, two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch anti-aircraft guns]] being reserved for the defence of the port.

Bombers were withdrawn to Aden, which meant a {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} round-trip without fighter escort. It was most difficult to influence the tactical situation but the bombers attacked troops and their transport, bases and Addis Ababa, to try to divert Italian fighters. Blenheim Mk Is of 8, 11 and 39 squadrons and 203 squadron with Blenheim IVF fighters and 223 Squadron from Sudan, which arrived at Aden on 14 August and a flight of 84 Squadron from Iraq with Blenheim Mk Is flew standing patrols over Berbera for thirteen days, which limited the ability of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} to interfere with the evacuation.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=178}} Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at {{nowrap|5:35 p.m.}} on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}}, one crew member surviving. While the Italian fighters were attacking the 11 Squadron aircraft, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from [[Perim Island]] to attack the airfield at [[Addis Ababa]] and destroyed Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\n===Retreat to Berbera===\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|thumb|{{centre|[[Kenya]]n troops from the 7th Battalion, [[King's African Rifles]] parading in Mogadishu, 1941}}]]\nAfter a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night of 15 August, the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked.

The Italian inaion of [[British Somaliland]] was to be based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at th same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, an Italian {{lang|fr|coup de main}} was impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East African Empire), formed from Ethiopia and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895\u20131896), Italy had been thwarted in its colonial ambitions but in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936) the Italians again invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain, ([[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]). The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy [[Egypt]] in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine, of a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall its use by the Allies, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter British interference. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar by occupying British Somaliland and defeating the garrison.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, to cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary.

Aosta urged haste but Nasi refused to rush because the road was deteriorating under the heavy traffic and rain.

The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan position===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7 to 8 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Karrim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery, the advantage was of dubious advantage. The defenders were too few in number to cover the gap and the hills were far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackenzie|1y=1951|1p=22|2a1=Playfair|2y=1959|1pp=175\u2013176}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled for loading, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. Next day, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta,\n\n{{quote|Pour all available reserves into Somaliland to stimulate the operation. Order the entire Imperial air force to co-operate.|Mussolini{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}}}}\n\nA counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass, by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Air operations===\n[[File:3inch20cwtAAgunHayesCommonMay1940.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of a 3-inch 20 cwt Anti-Aircraft gun (UK, May1940}}]]\nThe British airfields at Berbera and [[Laferug]] had only small arms for defence, two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch anti-aircraft guns]] being reserved for the defence of the port.

Bombers were withdrawn to Aden, which meant a {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} round-trip without fighter escort. It was most difficult to influence the tactical situation but the bombers attacked troops and their transport, bases and Addis Ababa, to try to divert Italian fighters. Blenheim Mk Is of 8, 11 and 39 squadrons and 203 squadron with Blenheim IVF fighters and 223 Squadron from Sudan, which arrived at Aden on 14 August and a flight of 84 Squadron from Iraq with Blenheim Mk Is flew standing patrols over Berbera for thirteen days, which limited the ability of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} to interfere with the evacuation.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=178}} Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at {{nowrap|5:35 p.m.}} on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}}, one crew member surviving. While the Italian fighters were attacking the 11 Squadron aircraft, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from [[Perim Island]] to attack the airfield at [[Addis Ababa]] and destroyed Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\n===Retreat to Berbera===\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|thumb|{{centre|[[Kenya]]n troops from the 7th Battalion, [[King's African Rifles]] parading in Mogadishu, 1941}}]]\nAfter a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night of 15 August, the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials and on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August. Before sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores.

The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to the defeated generals.

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. For more details, see [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]] in accordance with Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], and with more detail under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]. By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved, China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. For more details, see [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]] in accordance with Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], and with more detail under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]. By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved, China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

Other territorial disputes include islands in the [[East China Sea|East]] and [[South China Sea]]s, and undefined or disputed borders with [[India]], [[Bhutan]] and [[North Korea]].\n\n===Territorial disputes===\nThe following territories are claimed by both China and one or more other countries:\n*[[Socotra Rock]] (with [[South Korea]])\n*[[Diaoyu Islands]] (with [[Japan]])\n*[[Spratly Islands]] (with [[Vietnam]], [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]])\n*[[Paracel Islands]] (with [[Vietnam]])\n*[[Scarborough Shoal|Panatag Shoal]] (with the [[Philippines]])\n*[[South Tibet]] - parts of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (with [[India]])\n*[[Aksai Chin]] - (with [[India]]; however [[Pakistan]] has accepted an unmarked boundary and recognised China's governance of the area).\n\nIn addition, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China ([[Taiwan]]) share the [[1992 Consensus]] that there is only \"[[One-China policy|One China]]\"; thus, each claims sovereignty over the entire territory of the other.\n\n==International organization participation==\n{{Stub-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[African Development Bank|AfDB]], [[APEC]], [[AsDB]], [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Caribbean Development Bank|CDB]] (non-regional), [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|ESCAP]], [[FAO]], [[Group of 77|G-77]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization]], [[International Mobile Satellite Organization|Inmarsat]], [[Intelsat]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[International Trade Union Confederation|ITUC]], [[LAIA]] (observer), [[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|MINURSO]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]] (observer), [[OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]], [[United Nations]], [[UN Security Council]], [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[UNHCR]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[UNIKOM]], [[United Nations Institute for Training and Research|UNITAR]], [[UNTSO]], [[United Nations University|UNU]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Tourism Organization|WToO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTrO]], [[Zangger Committee]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Politics of Hong Kong]]\n*[[Politics of Macau]]\n*[[Chinese Socialist Democracy]]\n*[[People's organization]]\n*[[List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Sebastian Heilmann]] and Elizabeth J.

After the 2000 racing season, it was no longer used as a track for major motorsports racing series, but was used by many racing teams from IndyCar to NASCAR as a test venue due to the warmer climate than other tracks around the United States during the off season for racing. The track closed permanently on August 9, 2015.\n\n''[[AutoWeek]]'' magazine and the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' dubbed the track \"'''The Mickyard'''\" (a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of the Disney icon [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]'s nickname, the \"Brickyard\").\n\n==History==\n[[File:WaltDisneyWorldSpeedway RichardPettyDrivingExperience.jpg|thumb|left|A student practicing at Walt Disney World Speedway in 2010]]\nThe track was a three-turn [[tri-oval]], designed by Indianapolis Motor Speedway chief [[civil engineer|engineer]] Kevin Forbes, and the location was chosen in September 1994 by Greg Ruse of [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Buena Vista]] Construction. The track was situated on a triangular plot of land adjacent to the [[Magic Kingdom]]'s [[parking lot]] near [[Disney's Polynesian Resort]]. Plans for the track were first announced on January 23, 1995.  The track was designed to fit within the boundaries of the existing infrastructure, requiring minimal rerouting of existing roads.\n\nOn June 27, 1995, [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Chairman of the Board [[Mari Hulman George]] took part in a groundbreaking ceremony. She presented the track with one of the original paving bricks from the famous \"Brickyard.\" In a rather compact schedule, the one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) track was completed with ten miles (16&nbsp;km) of safety restraint cabling, {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of fencing, {{convert|1800|yd|m}} of concrete for outside walls, {{convert|2300|ft|m}} of concrete for pit walls and 5,200 tons of asphalt for the track surface. Despite 1995 having the wettest June\u2013July in Orlando on record (75&nbsp;inches of rain), including [[Hurricane Erin (1995)|Hurricane Erin]], the construction was completed on-time, with final paving completed October 18, 1995.\n\nThe track was dedicated on November 28, 1995. [[Indy Racing League]] drivers [[Arie Luyendyk]], [[Eddie Cheever]], [[Eliseo Salazar]], [[Lyn St. James]] and [[Davey Hamilton]] drove a five-car \"Flying V\" formation amongst fireworks. Initial testing at the facility for the Indy Racing League took place November 27\u2013December 9, 1995.\n\nThe race track hosting its first car race, a [[Formula Ford 2000]] support race on January 26, 1996 followed the next day with the [[Indy Racing League]]'s Indy 200 car race.<ref>[https://d23.com/a-to-z/walt-disney-world-speedway/ Walt Disney World Speedway].

Via [http://kpolsson.com/wdworld/wdw1995.htm Chronology of Walt Disney World 1995-2010].</ref>\n\n===Closure and demolition===\nOn March 27, 2015, it was announced that the speedway would close on August 9, 2015 and be razed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201502/4417/|title=Walt Disney World Speedway to Close in June|work=Theme Park Insider}}</ref> Demolition began late August to make way for \"transportation improvements\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/indycar/walt-disney-world-speedway-shutting-down-good|title=Walt Disney World Speedway shutting down for good|work=Autoweek}}</ref> namely expanding and reconfiguring the Magic Kingdom parking lot and parking entrance.\n\n==Design==\nWalt Disney World Speedway was constructed on a very limited budget. By design, permanent features of the facility were built at a minimum. The track plans called for only the track surface, retaining wall, and [[catch fence]] to be constructed. The remainder of the facility, such as seating areas, restrooms, and race support areas would be built on a temporary, as-needed basis. This strategy had never been used on an oval race track, but had been widely successful for years in temporary [[street circuit]]s (such as [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Long Beach]]). No permanent garages were built on the premises, but this was not entirely unusual. Race teams would simply work out of their transporters, a practice used frequently at street circuits and other tracks without garages.\n\nThe initial savings in construction costs was significant. Temporary bleachers and restroom facilities would be erected each year beginning in November, in preparations for the races in January. The lack of permanent grandstands also allowed track officials to adjust the configuration and capacity of seating annually reflecting ticket demand. This practice, however, would prove to be inconvenient and increasingly expensive in the long run since the grandstand area encompassed a portion of the [[Magic Kingdom]] parking lot. That area of the lot would be unusable for nearly three months, including during the busy [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]] holiday season at the theme park.\n\nThree linked ponds in the track\u2019s infield are formed in the shape of [[Mickey Mouse]]. The pond, dubbed \"Lake Mickey\", was built a year after the track opened due to drainage concerns.\n\n===Parking problems===\nInitially, the track location, which was adjacent to the Magic Kingdom parking lot, was seen to be convenient. However, after a couple of years, traffic control on race days became overwhelming. Because race spectators would arrive at the same time and place as regular Magic Kingdom theme park guests, overflow parking was required. In 1996\u20131997, Disney officials reacted by parking all race spectators in the Magic Kingdom parking lot, and diverting all Magic Kingdom guests to the [[Epcot]] parking lot. Race spectators would walk to the nearby Speedway, while all guests to the Magic Kingdom were required to take the [[Walt Disney World Monorail System|monorail]] or a [[Disney Transport|bus]] from Epcot to the Transportation and Ticket Center. There, they would transfer to a monorail on the Magic Kingdom loop, a somewhat circuitous trip which resulted in numerous guest complaints. In 1997, the IRL race was shortened by a sudden rainstorm, causing fans to hurry to their cars and resulting in severe traffic [[gridlock]] on [[Florida State Road 536|World Drive]] and surrounding roads which lasted for several hours.\n\nStarting in 1998, race spectators were diverted to park at Epcot, and were taken by shuttle bus to the Speedway while guests to the Magic Kingdom were directed to park, as usual, in the Magic Kingdom parking lot. While this eased many theme park guest complaints, it was now inconvenient for race spectators as it necessitated them to arrive earlier to account for the additional travel time. It additionally resulted in a significant cost increase in race operations, as the [[Disney Transport]] bus fleet was not big enough to accommodate the race shuttle operation. As a result, outside bus companies had to be hired to run the race shuttle service.\n\n==End of professional racing==\n[[File:Sam Schmidt - Carb Day 2015 - Sarah Stierch.jpg|thumbnail|Sam Schmidt was paralyzed after an accident at Walt Disney World Speedway in 2000]]\nIn its first few years of operation, the track was used frequently as a year-round test facility, due to the warm winter weather in Orlando. However, the track suffered three major accidents. During a week of preseason testing, on January 11, 1997, IRL driver Eliseo Salazar crashed in turn one. He suffered a fracture of his lower back, and missed two races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7412&FS=IRL|title=IRL: WDW test 97-1-11|work=Motorsport.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014527/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7412&FS=IRL|archivedate=2007-09-30}}</ref> Two weeks later, on January 23, 1997, IRL driver [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] broke his neck after a practice crash in turn three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7487&FS=IRL|title=IRL: WDW Thursday practice notes|work=Motorsport.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023740/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7487&FS=IRL|archivedate=2007-09-30}}</ref> On January 6, 2000, IRL driver [[Sam Schmidt]] was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] after a crash in preseason testing.<ref name=\"Sentinel01-07-2000pg19\">{{cite news|title=Crash at Disney paralyzes IRL driver|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22795022/sam_schmidt/|first=Juliet|last=Macur|newspaper=The Orlando Sentinel|page=19|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=January 19, 2000|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}{{Open access}}</ref> The track was built before the [[SAFER barrier]] was introduced, which many feel may have lessened the injuries in all three cases.\n\nAfter the [[2000 Indy Racing League|2000]] IRL season, series officials and Walt Disney World were not able to come to an agreement for a race date for [[2001 Indy Racing League|2001]]. IRL officials were unsatisfied with the January date, as it was seen to be too early for most teams to be prepared for the season. There was typically a six-week gap until the second race of the season. Disney officials also were concerned with the impending conflict with [[Super Bowl XXXV]], to be held in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] presumably the same weekend. Initial talks planned to move the race date to [[Labor Day]] weekend, and ultimately to a new facility to be built near [[U.S. Route 192|U.S. 192]]. The [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] had already declined to renew its contract with the Speedway for similar reasons after 1998. The talks quietly ceased between the IRL and Disney, and the race was not scheduled for 2001. It was ultimately removed from the IRL schedule permanently.\n\n===Richard Petty Driving Experience / Indy Racing Experience / Exotic Driving Experience===\nDuring the off-season in 1997, the track began hosting the Richard Petty Driving Experience, a stock car-based racing organization that allowed the general public to drive real [[NASCAR]] machines, or ride along with a professional driver and served as the track's primary function, year-round. It was the only track used by the ''RPDE'' that, weather permitting, operated roughly 365 days a year. To assist in the increased ingress and egress, a one-lane automobile [[tunnel]] was built for the 1997 season. In the summer of 1999, a new visitor's center and gift shop was built to permanently house operations for ''RPDE''. A new modest garage facility was built for them also. The operation had previously worked out of trailers and tents, without significant utilities.\n\nOn November 13, 2008, it was announced that the track would be shared with the Indy Racing Experience, a similar program to ''RPDE''. The [[open wheel car|IndyCar]] two-seater machine would be used for fan ride-alongs, and Indy cars would also be available to be driven by fans. After appearing at various tracks on a largely irregular schedule, the Indy Racing Experience made the track its permanent year-round home.\n\nOn January 16, 2012, a new driving experience started business at Walt Disney World Speedway geared towards high end \"supercars\" called the Exotic Driving Experience. Modifications were made to the speedway's infield to create an \"Exotics Course\" which was a one-mile layout that ran clockwise and combined part of the oval with a street-style course.\n\n===Other uses===\n*On February 19\u201320, 1999, the track hosted the 7th Annual SunDay Challenge Alternative Energy Vehicle Rally. The highlight of the meet featured the [[Formula Lightning]] teams of [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], [[Kettering University|Kettering]], and [[Florida A&M University|FAMU]]/[[Florida State University|FSU]]. The event was covered by [[Central Florida News 13]].\n*On April 9, 2002 the first test of the new [[Indy Pro Series|Infiniti Pro Series]] was conducted at the track, with [[Robby McGehee]] driving over {{convert|100|mi|km}}. The series debuted later that season.\n*The oval was part of the course of the [[Walt Disney World Marathon]] in some years.\n\n==Track records==\n[[File:Walt_Disney_World_Speedway_diagram.svg|200px]]\n===Indy Racing League===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Type'''\n!'''Distance'''\n!'''Date'''\n!'''Driver'''\n!'''Time'''\n!'''Average Speed<br>(mph)'''\n|-\n| Qualifying || 1 lap (1.0 miles) || January 25, 1996 || [[Buddy Lazier]] || 19.847 seconds || 181.388\n|-\n| Race       || {{convert|200|mi|km}} || January 27, 1996 || [[Buzz Calkins]] || 1:33:30.748 || 128.748\n|}\n\n*Unofficial all-time track record: Buddy Lazier, 19.450 seconds; 185.089&nbsp;mph (January 13, 1996)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brickyard.com/wdw/1996/wdws0113.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970216160931/http://brickyard.com/wdw/1996/wdws0113.htm|title=Lazier Cracks Unofficial Disney World Mark Again|publisher=Indy Racing League|archivedate=16 February 1997|work=brickyard.com}}</ref>\n\n==Past race results==\n\n===Indy Racing League===\nThe [[Indy Racing League]] [[IndyCar Series]] Indy 200 was the first event held at the track.

After the 2000 racing season, it was no longer used as a track for major motorsports racing series, but was used by many racing teams from IndyCar to NASCAR as a test venue due to the warmer climate than other tracks around the United States during the off season for racing. The track closed permanently on August 9, 2015.\n\n''[[AutoWeek]]'' magazine and the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' dubbed the track \"'''The Mickyard'''\" (a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of the Disney icon [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]'s nickname, the \"Brickyard\").\n\n==History==\n[[File:WaltDisneyWorldSpeedway RichardPettyDrivingExperience.jpg|thumb|left|A student practicing at Walt Disney World Speedway in 2010]]\nThe track was a three-turn [[tri-oval]], designed by Indianapolis Motor Speedway chief [[civil engineer|engineer]] Kevin Forbes, and the location was chosen in September 1994 by Greg Ruse of [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Buena Vista]] Construction. The track was situated on a triangular plot of land adjacent to the [[Magic Kingdom]]'s [[parking lot]] near [[Disney's Polynesian Resort]]. Plans for the track were first announced on January 23, 1995.  The track was designed to fit within the boundaries of the existing infrastructure, requiring minimal rerouting of existing roads.\n\nOn June 27, 1995, [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Chairman of the Board [[Mari Hulman George]] took part in a groundbreaking ceremony. She presented the track with one of the original paving bricks from the famous \"Brickyard.\" In a rather compact schedule, the one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) track was completed with ten miles (16&nbsp;km) of safety restraint cabling, {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of fencing, {{convert|1800|yd|m}} of concrete for outside walls, {{convert|2300|ft|m}} of concrete for pit walls and 5,200 tons of asphalt for the track surface. Despite 1995 having the wettest June\u2013July in Orlando on record (75&nbsp;inches of rain), including [[Hurricane Erin (1995)|Hurricane Erin]], the construction was completed on-time, with final paving completed October 18, 1995.\n\nThe track was dedicated on November 28, 1995. [[Indy Racing League]] drivers [[Arie Luyendyk]], [[Eddie Cheever]], [[Eliseo Salazar]], [[Lyn St. James]] and [[Davey Hamilton]] drove a five-car \"Flying V\" formation amongst fireworks. Initial testing at the facility for the Indy Racing League took place November 27\u2013December 9, 1995.\n\nThe race track hosting its first car race, a [[Formula Ford 2000]] support race on January 26, 1996 followed the next day with the [[Indy Racing League]]'s Indy 200 car race.<ref>[https://d23.com/a-to-z/walt-disney-world-speedway/ Walt Disney World Speedway].

By design, permanent features of the facility were built at a minimum. The track plans called for only the track surface, retaining wall, and [[catch fence]] to be constructed. The remainder of the facility, such as seating areas, restrooms, and race support areas would be built on a temporary, as-needed basis. This strategy had never been used on an oval race track, but had been widely successful for years in temporary [[street circuit]]s (such as [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Long Beach]]). No permanent garages were built on the premises, but this was not entirely unusual. Race teams would simply work out of their transporters, a practice used frequently at street circuits and other tracks without garages.\n\nThe initial savings in construction costs was significant. Temporary bleachers and restroom facilities would be erected each year beginning in November, in preparations for the races in January. The lack of permanent grandstands also allowed track officials to adjust the configuration and capacity of seating annually reflecting ticket demand. This practice, however, would prove to be inconvenient and increasingly expensive in the long run since the grandstand area encompassed a portion of the [[Magic Kingdom]] parking lot. That area of the lot would be unusable for nearly three months, including during the busy [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]] holiday season at the theme park.\n\nThree linked ponds in the track\u2019s infield are formed in the shape of [[Mickey Mouse]]. The pond, dubbed \"Lake Mickey\", was built a year after the track opened due to drainage concerns.\n\n===Parking problems===\nInitially, the track location, which was adjacent to the Magic Kingdom parking lot, was seen to be convenient. However, after a couple of years, traffic control on race days became overwhelming. Because race spectators would arrive at the same time and place as regular Magic Kingdom theme park guests, overflow parking was required. In 1996\u20131997, Disney officials reacted by parking all race spectators in the Magic Kingdom parking lot, and diverting all Magic Kingdom guests to the [[Epcot]] parking lot. Race spectators would walk to the nearby Speedway, while all guests to the Magic Kingdom were required to take the [[Walt Disney World Monorail System|monorail]] or a [[Disney Transport|bus]] from Epcot to the Transportation and Ticket Center. There, they would transfer to a monorail on the Magic Kingdom loop, a somewhat circuitous trip which resulted in numerous guest complaints. In 1997, the IRL race was shortened by a sudden rainstorm, causing fans to hurry to their cars and resulting in severe traffic [[gridlock]] on [[Florida State Road 536|World Drive]] and surrounding roads which lasted for several hours.\n\nStarting in 1998, race spectators were diverted to park at Epcot, and were taken by shuttle bus to the Speedway while guests to the Magic Kingdom were directed to park, as usual, in the Magic Kingdom parking lot. While this eased many theme park guest complaints, it was now inconvenient for race spectators as it necessitated them to arrive earlier to account for the additional travel time. It additionally resulted in a significant cost increase in race operations, as the [[Disney Transport]] bus fleet was not big enough to accommodate the race shuttle operation. As a result, outside bus companies had to be hired to run the race shuttle service.\n\n==End of professional racing==\n[[File:Sam Schmidt - Carb Day 2015 - Sarah Stierch.jpg|thumbnail|Sam Schmidt was paralyzed after an accident at Walt Disney World Speedway in 2000]]\nIn its first few years of operation, the track was used frequently as a year-round test facility, due to the warm winter weather in Orlando. However, the track suffered three major accidents. During a week of preseason testing, on January 11, 1997, IRL driver Eliseo Salazar crashed in turn one. He suffered a fracture of his lower back, and missed two races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7412&FS=IRL|title=IRL: WDW test 97-1-11|work=Motorsport.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014527/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7412&FS=IRL|archivedate=2007-09-30}}</ref> Two weeks later, on January 23, 1997, IRL driver [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] broke his neck after a practice crash in turn three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7487&FS=IRL|title=IRL: WDW Thursday practice notes|work=Motorsport.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023740/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7487&FS=IRL|archivedate=2007-09-30}}</ref> On January 6, 2000, IRL driver [[Sam Schmidt]] was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] after a crash in preseason testing.<ref name=\"Sentinel01-07-2000pg19\">{{cite news|title=Crash at Disney paralyzes IRL driver|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22795022/sam_schmidt/|first=Juliet|last=Macur|newspaper=The Orlando Sentinel|page=19|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=January 19, 2000|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}{{Open access}}</ref> The track was built before the [[SAFER barrier]] was introduced, which many feel may have lessened the injuries in all three cases.\n\nAfter the [[2000 Indy Racing League|2000]] IRL season, series officials and Walt Disney World were not able to come to an agreement for a race date for [[2001 Indy Racing League|2001]]. IRL officials were unsatisfied with the January date, as it was seen to be too early for most teams to be prepared for the season. There was typically a six-week gap until the second race of the season. Disney officials also were concerned with the impending conflict with [[Super Bowl XXXV]], to be held in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] presumably the same weekend. Initial talks planned to move the race date to [[Labor Day]] weekend, and ultimately to a new facility to be built near [[U.S. Route 192|U.S. 192]]. The [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] had already declined to renew its contract with the Speedway for similar reasons after 1998. The talks quietly ceased between the IRL and Disney, and the race was not scheduled for 2001. It was ultimately removed from the IRL schedule permanently.\n\n===Richard Petty Driving Experience / Indy Racing Experience / Exotic Driving Experience===\nDuring the off-season in 1997, the track began hosting the Richard Petty Driving Experience, a stock car-based racing organization that allowed the general public to drive real [[NASCAR]] machines, or ride along with a professional driver and served as the track's primary function, year-round. It was the only track used by the ''RPDE'' that, weather permitting, operated roughly 365 days a year. To assist in the increased ingress and egress, a one-lane automobile [[tunnel]] was built for the 1997 season. In the summer of 1999, a new visitor's center and gift shop was built to permanently house operations for ''RPDE''. A new modest garage facility was built for them also. The operation had previously worked out of trailers and tents, without significant utilities.\n\nOn November 13, 2008, it was announced that the track would be shared with the Indy Racing Experience, a similar program to ''RPDE''. The [[open wheel car|IndyCar]] two-seater machine would be used for fan ride-alongs, and Indy cars would also be available to be driven by fans. After appearing at various tracks on a largely irregular schedule, the Indy Racing Experience made the track its permanent year-round home.\n\nOn January 16, 2012, a new driving experience started business at Walt Disney World Speedway geared towards high end \"supercars\" called the Exotic Driving Experience. Modifications were made to the speedway's infield to create an \"Exotics Course\" which was a one-mile layout that ran clockwise and combined part of the oval with a street-style course.\n\n===Other uses===\n*On February 19\u201320, 1999, the track hosted the 7th Annual SunDay Challenge Alternative Energy Vehicle Rally. The highlight of the meet featured the [[Formula Lightning]] teams of [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], [[Kettering University|Kettering]], and [[Florida A&M University|FAMU]]/[[Florida State University|FSU]]. The event was covered by [[Central Florida News 13]].\n*On April 9, 2002 the first test of the new [[Indy Pro Series|Infiniti Pro Series]] was conducted at the track, with [[Robby McGehee]] driving over {{convert|100|mi|km}}. The series debuted later that season.\n*The oval was part of the course of the [[Walt Disney World Marathon]] in some years.\n\n==Track records==\n[[File:Walt_Disney_World_Speedway_diagram.svg|200px]]\n===Indy Racing League===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Type'''\n!'''Distance'''\n!'''Date'''\n!'''Driver'''\n!'''Time'''\n!'''Average Speed<br>(mph)'''\n|-\n| Qualifying || 1 lap (1.0 miles) || January 25, 1996 || [[Buddy Lazier]] || 19.847 seconds || 181.388\n|-\n| Race       || {{convert|200|mi|km}} || January 27, 1996 || [[Buzz Calkins]] || 1:33:30.748 || 128.748\n|}\n\n*Unofficial all-time track record: Buddy Lazier, 19.450 seconds; 185.089&nbsp;mph (January 13, 1996)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brickyard.com/wdw/1996/wdws0113.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970216160931/http://brickyard.com/wdw/1996/wdws0113.htm|title=Lazier Cracks Unofficial Disney World Mark Again|publisher=Indy Racing League|archivedate=16 February 1997|work=brickyard.com}}</ref>\n\n==Past race results==\n\n===Indy Racing League===\nThe [[Indy Racing League]] [[IndyCar Series]] Indy 200 was the first event held at the track.
