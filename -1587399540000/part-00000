Kootz|Samuel Kootz]]'s, a New York Gallery owner that helped determine what art was mainstream, pronouncement that there would be no women artists in his gallery.<ref name=\":0\" /> To this which Fine promptly said, \"I know I was as good as anybody else in there,\" <ref name=\":0\" /> However, Perle Fine was not the only female artist that was affected by this statement, artists such as [[Fannie Hillsmith]] and [[Lee Krasner]] were also deeply affected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crichton-Miller|first=Emma|year=2016|title=Collectors' Focus Women Abstract Expressionists|url=|journal=Apollo: The International Magazine for Collectors|volume=|pages=100\u2013101|via=}}</ref>\n\nDespite Kootz's statement, Fine had been in many solo and group shows during the late 1940s. Because of her success with these exhibitions, there was every implication that Fine was on the verge of success in the art world.<ref name=\":0\" /> \"As the 1950s dawned ... there was little competition among artists either male or female, it was only when the door began to crack open that the gender of the artist began to play a more prominent role.\" <ref name=\":0\" /> [[Deirdre Robson]] has said that \"The arts were gradually thought of less in terms of being part of the 'female' realm and more as an interest suitable for a hardheaded and successful businessman.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFines\u2019 issues as a painter was not seen as cultural criticisms that kept her on the brinks of Abstract Expressionism when it should\u2019ve have had a place in the conversation but, it was the physical paintings themselves. She said it was always the painting rather than her being a woman and because of that, it pushed her into the artist she became. She battled with the canvas and solved problems in every piece. \u201cArt Historian, Ann Eden Gibson says that by the early 1950s, Fine was right in the middle of Abstract Expressionism\u201d. \n\nWith a career in abstract painting lasting over 50 years, Fine developed and stuck to high ideals and expectations of never adopting a method from another artist that could potentially compromise when work when her works of art began to become something that was not of the ordinary. She fought through barriers and limitation that any female artist would experience during the \u201cmacho milieu\u201d of Abstract Expressionism. She kept the mindset that it was what was painted and not who painted it that mattered. With that being said, her pieces are just now being given the attention they deserved a long time ago such as an exhibition in 2016 in the Denver Art Museum, \u201cWomen of Abstract Expression\u201d and Women of Abstract Expressionism from the 9th Street Show at the Katonah Museum of Art and Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection. At the time, Fine was seen to be close with another Artist by the name of Mark Rothko. Her work also was seen to be similar to his but, Fine found her work not seeking his \u201csublime transcendence\u201d.<ref> Housley, Kathleen L.

Fine was able to evolve using color to express means of its own. Fine started playing with act of staining and contrasting levels of translucency along with the uses reduction and positive and negative space, some may say that her works were similar to [[Mark Rothko]]  and this might have been because they were close friends at the time.\n\n==Cool Series==\nHer Cool Series of 1961-1663 represented a break away from the Abstract Expressionist works of her earlier years. She Stated, that the paintings were a \u201cgrowth\u201d rather than a \u201cdeparture\u201d, developing from \u201ca need within the painting to express more.\u201d\n\nThe Cool Series was created while Fine was living in isolation in the Springs of East Hampton. It is said in \u201c The Cool Series\u201d that during this time, artists stepped away from the soul-baring of action painting to let their images speak for themselves.\nThe name \u201cCool Series\u201d came from her awareness that the word \u201ccool\u201d had come to mean a new type of art during the time. It was free from psychological self-examination that could involve just the viewer in a direct emotional and intellectual experience. It was simply about how the viewer interacted with the color and space. Through these aspects alone, this allowed viewers a \u201cvisceral, spiritual experience.\u201d\n\n==Accordment Series 1969-1980==\nThe Accordment Series was said to be a culmination of all the modes of paintings that came before from Fine. It was named Accordment which meant an agreement or acceptance and had a defined connection with Minimalism. Kathleen Housley states in Tranquil Power, \u201cClose in age and in temperament, Fine and [[Agnes Martin]] shared many similarities, one being that their art was routinely described by critics as \u201catmospheric and classic\u201d Both Martin and Fine were artist that appeared together in a group show at the Whitney Museum in 1962 in Geometric Abstraction in America. Perle\u2019s style is set apart by her minimalist tendencies, using colorful line work, planes of color and her distinct sweeping brushstrokes that are seen in her work.\n\n==Selected solo exhibitions==\n*1945: Marian [[Willard Gallery]], NY;\n*1946\u201347: Nierendorf Gallery, NYC;\n*1947: [[M.H. de Young Memorial Museum]], San Francisco, Ca;\n*1949, 1951\u201353: Betty Parsons Gallery, NY;\n*1955, 58: Tanager Gallery, NYC;\n*1961, 63, 64, 67: Graham Gallery, NY;\n*1972: Joan Washburn Gallery, NY;\n*1978: \"Major Works: 1954\u20131978: A Selection of Drawings, Paintings, and Collages,\" Guild Hall Museum, [[East Hampton, NY]].\n\n==Selected group exhibitions==\n*1945: [[The Art of This Century]], [[Solomon R.

Kootz|Samuel Kootz]]'s, a New York Gallery owner that helped determine what art was mainstream, pronouncement that there would be no women artists in his gallery.<ref name=\":0\" /> To this which Fine promptly said, \"I know I was as good as anybody else in there,\" <ref name=\":0\" /> However, Perle Fine was not the only female artist that was affected by this statement, artists such as [[Fannie Hillsmith]] and [[Lee Krasner]] were also deeply affected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crichton-Miller|first=Emma|year=2016|title=Collectors' Focus Women Abstract Expressionists|url=|journal=Apollo: The International Magazine for Collectors|volume=|pages=100\u2013101|via=}}</ref>\n\nDespite Kootz's statement, Fine had been in many solo and group shows during the late 1940s. Because of her success with these exhibitions, there was every implication that Fine was on the verge of success in the art world.<ref name=\":0\" /> \"As the 1950s dawned ... there was little competition among artists either male or female, it was only when the door began to crack open that the gender of the artist began to play a more prominent role.\" <ref name=\":0\" /> [[Deirdre Robson]] has said that \"The arts were gradually thought of less in terms of being part of the 'female' realm and more as an interest suitable for a hardheaded and successful businessman.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFines\u2019 issues as a painter was not seen as cultural criticisms that kept her on the brinks of Abstract Expressionism when it should\u2019ve have had a place in the conversation but, it was the physical paintings themselves. She said it was always the painting rather than her being a woman and because of that, it pushed her into the artist she became. She battled with the canvas and solved problems in every piece. \u201cArt Historian, Ann Eden Gibson says that by the early 1950s, Fine was right in the middle of Abstract Expressionism\u201d. \n\nWith a career in abstract painting lasting over 50 years, Fine developed and stuck to high ideals and expectations of never adopting a method from another artist that could potentially compromise when work when her works of art began to become something that was not of the ordinary. She fought through barriers and limitation that any female artist would experience during the \u201cmacho milieu\u201d of Abstract Expressionism. She kept the mindset that it was what was painted and not who painted it that mattered. With that being said, her pieces are just now being given the attention they deserved a long time ago such as an exhibition in 2016 in the Denver Art Museum, \u201cWomen of Abstract Expression\u201d and Women of Abstract Expressionism from the 9th Street Show at the Katonah Museum of Art and Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection. At the time, Fine was seen to be close with another Artist by the name of Mark Rothko. Her work also was seen to be similar to his but, Fine found her work not seeking his \u201csublime transcendence\u201d.<ref> Housley, Kathleen L.

Fine was able to evolve using color to express means of its own. Fine started playing with act of staining and contrasting levels of translucency along with the uses reduction and positive and negative space, some may say that her works were similar to [[Mark Rothko]]  and this might have been because they were close friends at the time.\n\n==Cool Series==\nHer Cool Series of 1961-1663 represented a break away from the Abstract Expressionist works of her earlier years. She Stated, that the paintings were a \u201cgrowth\u201d rather than a \u201cdeparture\u201d, developing from \u201ca need within the painting to express more.\u201d\n\nThe Cool Series was created while Fine was living in isolation in the Springs of East Hampton. It is said in \u201c The Cool Series\u201d that during this time, artists stepped away from the soul-baring of action painting to let their images speak for themselves.\nThe name \u201cCool Series\u201d came from her awareness that the word \u201ccool\u201d had come to mean a new type of art during the time. It was free from psychological self-examination that could involve just the viewer in a direct emotional and intellectual experience. It was simply about how the viewer interacted with the color and space. Through these aspects alone, this allowed viewers a \u201cvisceral, spiritual experience.\u201d\n\n==Accordment Series 1969-1980==\nThe Accordment Series was said to be a culmination of all the modes of paintings that came before from Fine. It was named Accordment which meant an agreement or acceptance and had a defined connection with Minimalism. Kathleen Housley states in Tranquil Power, \u201cClose in age and in temperament, Fine and [[Agnes Martin]] shared many similarities, one being that their art was routinely described by critics as \u201catmospheric and classic\u201d Both Martin and Fine were artist that appeared together in a group show at the Whitney Museum in 1962 in Geometric Abstraction in America. Perle\u2019s style is set apart by her minimalist tendencies, using colorful line work, planes of color and her distinct sweeping brushstrokes that are seen in her work.\n\n==Selected solo exhibitions==\n*1945: Marian [[Willard Gallery]], NY;\n*1946\u201347: Nierendorf Gallery, NYC;\n*1947: [[M.H. de Young Memorial Museum]], San Francisco, Ca;\n*1949, 1951\u201353: Betty Parsons Gallery, NY;\n*1955, 58: Tanager Gallery, NYC;\n*1961, 63, 64, 67: Graham Gallery, NY;\n*1972: Joan Washburn Gallery, NY;\n*1978: \"Major Works: 1954\u20131978: A Selection of Drawings, Paintings, and Collages,\" Guild Hall Museum, [[East Hampton, NY]].\n\n==Selected group exhibitions==\n*1945: [[The Art of This Century]], [[Solomon R.

He also edited and published compilations of his work, which greatly influenced [[visual artist]]s and the developing fields of scientific and industrial photography.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

The opening of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, and the development of [[steamship]]s made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the [[Royal Institution]] in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], notably the future [[King Edward VII]].<ref name=BCLG>Brian Clegg [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309101127/page/n172 <!-- pg=159 quote=King Edward - eadweard muybridge. --> ''The Man Who Stopped Time: The Illuminating Story of Eadweard Muybridge : Pioneer Photographer, Father of the Motion Picture, Murderer''], Joseph Henry Press, 2007</ref> He displayed his photographs on screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope.<ref name=BCLG/>\n\nMuybridge and Stanford had a major falling-out concerning his research on equine locomotion.

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public.

He returned to the US once more, in 1896\u20131897, to settle financial affairs and to dispose of property related to his work at the University of Pennsylvania.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

Flora's maternity nurse revealed many details and had  in her possession some love letters that the couple still had been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with \"Harry\" written on the back in Flora's handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be Larkyns'.\n\nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, \"Here's the answer to the letter you sent my wife\", and shot him [[point-blank]]. Larkyns died that night, and Muybridge was arrested without protest and put in the [[Napa, California|Napa]] jail.<ref name=\"Haas1976\">{{cite book |last=Haas |first=Robert Bartlett |authorlink= |year=1976 |origyear= |title=Muybridge: Man in Motion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivSaYmrI0TEC |location=Oakland, CA |publisher=University of California Press |page= |isbn=978-0-52002-464-9 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nA ''Sacramento Daily Union'' reporter visited Muybridge in Jail for an hour and related how he was coping with the situation. Muybridge was in moderately good spirits and very hopeful. He felt he was treated very kindly by the officers and was a little proud of the influence he had on other inmates, which had earned him everyone's respect. He had protested the abuse of a \"Chinaman\" from a tough inmate, by claiming \"No man of any country whose misfortunes shall bring him here shall be abused in my presence\" and had strongly but politely voiced threats against the offender. He had addressed an outburst of profanity in similar fashion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=SDU18750206.2.44&srpos=81&e=------187-en--20--81-byDA-txt-txIN-muybridge-------1|title=Sacramento Daily Union 6 February 1875 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nFlora filed for divorce on 17 December 1874 on the ground of extreme cruelty, but this first petition was dismissed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=SDU18750111&e=------187-en--20--1-byDA-txt-txIN-muybridge----1875---1|title=Sacramento Daily Union 11 January 1875 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> It was reported that she fully sympathized with the prosecution of her husband.<ref name=mercury>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=SJMN18750205.2.4&srpos=21&e=------187-en--20--21-byDA-txt-txIN-muybridge----1875---1|title=San Jose Mercury-news 5 February 1875 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> \n\nMuybridge was tried for murder in February 1875.

The opening of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, and the development of [[steamship]]s made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the [[Royal Institution]] in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], notably the future [[King Edward VII]].<ref name=BCLG>Brian Clegg [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309101127/page/n172 <!-- pg=159 quote=King Edward - eadweard muybridge. --> ''The Man Who Stopped Time: The Illuminating Story of Eadweard Muybridge : Pioneer Photographer, Father of the Motion Picture, Murderer''], Joseph Henry Press, 2007</ref> He displayed his photographs on screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope.<ref name=BCLG/>\n\nMuybridge and Stanford had a major falling-out concerning his research on equine locomotion.

Muybridge, looking elsewhere for funding, was more successful.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/> The Royal Society later invited Muybridge back to show his work.<ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n\nIn the 1880s, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] sponsored Muybridge's research using banks of cameras to photograph people in a studio, and animals from the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] to study their movement. The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public.
