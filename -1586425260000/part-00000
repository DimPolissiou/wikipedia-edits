In 2010 declared the [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|Bicentennial]] Dessert of Mexico.]]\n\t\n'''Mexican cuisine''' began about 9000 years ago, when agricultural communities such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] formed, domesticating [[maize]], creating the standard process of [[maize]] [[nixtamalization]], and establishing their [[Maya cuisine|foodways]]. Successive waves of other [[Mesoamerica]]n groups brought with them their own cooking methods. These included the [[Olmec]], [[Teotihuacan]]os, [[Toltec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Tarascan state|Pur\u00e9pecha]], [[Totonac]], [[Mazatec]], and [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]].\n\nThe [[Mexica]] establishment of the [[Aztec Empire]] created a multi-ethnic society where many different foodways became [[Aztec cuisine|infused]]. The staples are native foods, such as corn ([[maize]]), [[bean]]s, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[amaranth]], [[Chia seed|chia]], [[avocado]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[tomatillo]]s, [[cocoa bean|cacao]], [[vanilla]], [[agave]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)#Historical use|spirulina]], [[sweet potato]], [[Cactus#Food|cactus]], and [[chili pepper]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] in the 16th century and the subsequent [[Spanish_conquest_of_Yucat\u00e1n|conquest of the Maya area]], Europeans introduced a number of  [[European cuisine|other foods]], the most important of which were meats from domesticated animals ([[beef]], [[pork]], [[chicken]], [[goat]], and [[sheep]]), dairy products (especially cheese and milk), and [[rice]]. While the Spanish initially tried to impose their own diet on the country, this was not possible.\n\n[[Asian cuisine|Asian]] and [[African cuisine|African influences]] were also introduced into the [[indigenous cuisine]] during this era as a result of [[Afro-Mexican#African slavery in Mexico|African slavery in New Spain]] and the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]]s.<ref name=\"CONACULTA\">{{cite web|title= La cocina del virreinato| url=http://sic.conaculta.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=gastronomia&table_id=101 |publisher=[[CONACULTA]] |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOver the centuries, this resulted in regional cuisines based on local conditions, such as those in [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]] and the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture, social structure and popular traditions of Mexico. The most important example of this connection is the use of [[Mole sauce|mole]] for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the South and Central regions of the country. For this reason and others, traditional Mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{cite web |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-mexican-cuisine-ancestral-ongoing-community-culture-the-michoacan-paradigm-00400 |title=Traditional Mexican cuisine - ancestral, ongoing community culture, the Michoac\u00e1n paradigm |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Basic elements==\n[[File:Still-life_by_Jos\u00e9_Agust\u00edn_Arrieta,_San_Diego_Museum_of_Art.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Still-life, oil on canvas painting by [[Agust\u00edn Arrieta|Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn Arrieta]] (Mexican), c. 1870, San Diego Museum of Art]]\n[[File:Huitlacoche, quintoniles, huauhzontles, flor de calabaza et al., Santa Maria la Ribera Market.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ingredients at a market in Mexico City, including [[Amaranthus hybridus|quintoniles]], [[huauzontle]], [[huitlacoche]] and [[Squash blossom|squash flowers]].]]\n\nMexican cuisine is a complex and ancient cuisine, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history.<ref name=\"fife\">{{cite journal |last= MacNeil-Fife |first= Karen |date=September 2000 |title= Beyond beer: Wine with Mexican food |journal=Sunset |volume=205 |issue=3 |page=194 }}</ref> It is created mostly with ingredients native to [[Mexico]], as well as those [[Columbian Exchange|brought over]] by the [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, with some new influences since then.<ref name=\"malat88\">Malat, p. 88.</ref> Mexican cuisine has been influenced by its proximity to the US-Mexican border. For example, burritos were thought to have been invented for easier transportation of beans by wrapping them in [[tortillas]] for field labor. Modifications like these brought Mexican cuisine to the [[United States]], where states like Arizona further adapted burritos by deep frying them, creating the modern [[chimichanga]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/963509617|title=|website=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to staples, such as corn and chile peppers, native ingredients include [[tomato]]es, [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[avocado]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[vanilla]],<ref name=\"UNESCO\" /> as well as ingredients not generally used in other cuisines, such as [[edible flowers]], vegetables like [[huauzontle]] and [[Porophyllum ruderale|papaloquelite]], or small [[avocado#history|criollo]] avocados, whose skin is edible.<ref name=\"adapon11\">Adapon, p. 11.</ref> [[Chocolate]] originated in Mexico and was prized by the Aztecs. It remains an important ingredient in Mexican cookery.\n\nVegetables play an important role in Mexican cuisine. Common vegetables include [[zucchini]], [[cauliflower]], corn, [[potato]]es, [[spinach]], [[Swiss chard]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], jitomate (red tomato), green tomato, etc. Other traditional vegetable ingredients include [[Chili pepper]], huitlacoche (corn fungus), huauzontle, and [[nopal]] (cactus pads) to name a few.\n\nEuropean contributions include [[pork]], [[chicken as food|chicken]], [[beef]], [[cheese]], [[herbs]] and [[spices]], as well as some fruits.\n\n[[Tropical fruits]], many of which are indigenous to Mexico and the Americas, such as [[guava]], [[Opuntia|prickly pear]], [[sapote]], [[mango]]es, [[banana]]s, [[pineapple]] and [[cherimoya]] (custard apple) are popular, especially in the center and south of the country.<ref name=\"malat89\">Malat, p. 89.</ref>\n\nEdible bugs in Mexico are escamoles (ant larvae), cumiles ([[Brown marmorated stink bug|stink bugs]]) and ahuatle (water bug eggs).<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/23/mexico-insect-cuisine-sustainable-food</ref>\n\n===Corn===\n[[File:Museo_Nacional_de_Antropolog\u00eda_-_MA\u00cdZ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ancient [[mesoamerican]] [[engraving]] of [[maize]], [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|National Museum of Anthropology of Mexico]].]]\n\nDespite the introduction of [[wheat]] and [[rice]] to Mexico, corn is the most commonly consumed starch in almost all areas of the country and serves as the main ingredient in many local recipes (e.g. corn [[tortilla]]s, [[atole]], [[pozol]], [[Menudo (soup)|menudo]], [[tamal]]). While it is eaten fresh, most corn is dried, [[Nixtamalization|nixtamalized]] and ground into a dough called ''[[masa]]''.<ref name=\"iturr43\">Iturriaga, p. 43.</ref><ref name=\"othergods\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2093-rice-the-gift-of-the-other-gods |title= Rice: The Gift Of The Other Gods |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2003  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref> This dough is used both fresh and fermented to make a wide variety of dishes from drinks (atole, pozol, etc.) to tamales, [[sope]]s, and much more. However, the most common way to eat corn in Mexico is in the form of a tortilla, which accompanies almost every dish. Tortillas are made of corn in most of the country, but other versions exist, such as wheat in the north or [[Cooking banana|plantain]], [[yuca]] and wild greens in [[Oaxaca]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/><ref name=\"iturr43\"/>\n\n===Chili peppers===\n[[File:Chile Rellenos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chile relleno]]s, stuffed Chile peppers.]]\n\nThe other basic ingredient in all parts of Mexico is the [[Chili pepper|chile pepper]].<ref name=\"adapon7\">Adapon, p. 7.</ref> Mexican food has a reputation for being very spicy, but it has a wide range of flavors and while many spices are used for cooking, not all are spicy. Many dishes also have subtle flavors.<ref name=\"fife\"/><ref name=\"adapon11\"/> Chiles are indigenous to Mexico and their use dates back thousands of years. They are used for their flavors and not just their heat, with Mexico using the widest variety. If a savory dish or snack does not contain chile pepper, hot sauce is usually added, and chile pepper is often added to fresh fruit and sweets.<ref name=\"adapon7\"/>\n\n[[File:Molcajete y tejolote.jpg|thumb|A [[molcajete]] and tejolote, the traditional [[mortar and pestle]] of Mexico.]]\n\nThe importance of the chile goes back to the [[Mesoamerican]] period, where it was considered to be as much of a staple as corn and beans. In the 16th century, [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] wrote that without chiles, the [[indigenous people]] did not think they were eating. Even today, most [[Mexicans]] believe that their national identity would be at a loss without chiles and the many varieties of sauces and salsas created using chiles as their base.<ref name=\"adapon8\">Adapon, p. 8.</ref>\n\nMany dishes in Mexico are defined by their sauces and the chiles those sauces contain (which are usually very spicy), rather than the meat or vegetable that the sauce covers. These dishes include [[entomatada]] (in tomato sauce), [[adobo]] or adobados, pipians and [[Mole sauce|moles]]. A hominy soup called [[pozole]] is defined as white, green or red depending on the chile sauce used or omitted. Tamales are differentiated by the filling which is again defined by the sauce (red or green chile pepper strips or mole). Dishes without a sauce are rarely eaten without a salsa or without fresh or pickled chiles. This includes street foods, such as [[taco]]s, [[torta]]s, [[Chicken soup#Mexico|soup]], [[sope]]s, [[tlacoyo]]s, [[tlayuda]]s, [[gordita]]s and [[sincronizada]]s.<ref name=\"adapon114\">Adapon, p. 114.</ref> For most dishes, it is the type of chile used that gives it its main flavor.<ref name=\"adapon8\"/>  [[Chipotle]],  smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is very common in Mexican cuisine.\n\n===Spanish contributions===\n{{See also|Cheeses of Mexico}}\n[[File:Pechuga Adobada.jpg|thumb|''Pechuga [[adobada]]'', chicken breast in [[adobo]] with a side of [[chayote]], mushrooms, corn and [[Poblano|poblano rajas]]. Adobo, including a key item, [[vinegar]], arrived with the Spanish. A common characteristic of Mexican adobo is its incorporation of [[chile ancho]].]]\n\nNext to corn, [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from [[North Africa]] in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of Veracruz in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]s.\n\nSome of the main contributions of the Spanish were several kind of meat, dairy products and wheat to name few, as the Mesoamerican diet contained very little meat besides [[domesticated turkey]], and dairy products were absent. The Spanish also introduced the technique of frying in [[Lard|pork fat]]. Today, the main meats found in Mexico are pork, chicken, beef, goat, and sheep. Native seafood and [[Fish as food|fish]] remains popular, especially along the coasts.<ref name=\"malat8889\">Malat, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\n[[Cheeses of Mexico|Cheesemaking in Mexico]] has evolved its own specialties. It is an important economic activity, especially in the north, and is frequently done at home. The main cheese making areas are [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], and [[Chiapas]]. Goat cheese is still made, but it is not as popular and is harder to find in stores.<ref name=\"losquesos\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2155-a-guide-to-mexican-cheese-queso-mexicano |title= A guide to Mexican cheese: Los quesos mexicanos |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= October 1, 2000  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Food and society==\n{{See also|Abuelita|Ibarra (chocolate)}}\n\n===Home cooking===\n[[File:Ela_huevos_rancheros.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Huevos rancheros]]]]\n\nIn most of Mexico, especially in rural areas, much of the food is consumed in the home.<ref name=\"adapon3\">Adapon, p. 3.</ref> Cooking for the family is usually considered to be [[women's work]], and this includes cooking for [[party|celebrations]] as well.<ref name=\"adapon71\">Adapon, p. 71.</ref> Traditionally girls have been considered ready to [[marry]] when they can cook, and [[cooking]] is considered a main talent for [[Housewife|housewives]].<ref name=\"adapon75\">Adapon, p. 75.</ref>\n\nThe main meal of the day in Mexico is the \"comida\", meaning 'meal' in Spanish. This refers to [[dinner]] or [[supper]]. It sometimes begins with [[soup]], often [[chicken broth]] with [[pasta]] or a \"dry soup\", which is pasta or rice flavored with [[onions]], [[garlic]] or vegetables. The main course is [[meat]] served in a cooked [[sauce]] with [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]] on the side, accompanied with beans and tortillas and often with a fruit drink.<ref name=\"adapon93\">Adapon, p. 93.</ref>\n\nIn the evening, it is common to eat leftovers from the comida or sweet [[Mexican breads|bread]] accompanied by [[coffee]] or [[chocolate]].

Food preparation, especially for family and social events, is considered to be an investment in order to maintain social relationships.<ref name=\"adapon20\">Adapon, p. 20.</ref> Even the idea of flavor is considered to be social, with meals prepared for certain dinners and certain occasions when they are considered the most tasty.<ref name=\"adapon117\">Adapon, p. 117.</ref>\n\nThe ability to cook well, called \"saz\u00f3n\" (lit. seasoning) is considered to be a gift generally gained from experience and a sense of commitment to the diners.<ref name=\"abarca62\">Abarca, p. 62.</ref>  For the [[Day of the Dead]] festival, foods such as tamales and mole are set out on altars and it is believed that the visiting dead relatives eat the essence of the food. If eaten afterwards by the living it is considered to be tasteless.<ref name=\"adapon117\"/> In central Mexico, the main festival foods are mole, [[barbacoa]], [[carnitas]] and [[mixiote]]s. They are often prepared to feed hundreds of guests, requiring groups of cooks. The cooking is part of the social custom meant to bind families and communities.<ref name=\"adapon89\">Adapon, p. 89.</ref>\n\n[[File:Barbacoa (en Hidalgo).JPG|miniaturadeimagen|220px|left|thumb|Barbacoa in [[Actopan (Hidalgo)|Actopan]], [[Estado de Hidalgo|Hidalgo]]. The barbecue in a ground oven is a typical dish from the Mezquital Valley.]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9_de_olla_.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fruit punch]] is popular around Christmas time during [[Las Posadas]].]]\n\nMexican regional home cooking is completely different from the food served in most Mexican restaurants outside Mexico, which is usually some variety of [[Tex-Mex]].<ref name=\"adapon11\"/> Some of Mexico's traditional foods involved complex or long cooking processes. Before industrialization, traditional women spent several hours a day boiling dried corn then grinding it on a [[metate]] to make the dough for tortillas, cooking them one-by-one on a [[Comal (cookware)|comal]] griddle. In some areas, tortillas are still made this way. Sauces and salsas were also ground in a mortar called a [[molcajete]]. Today, blenders are more often used, though the texture is a bit different. Most people in Mexico would say that those made with a molcajete taste better, but few do this now.<ref name=\"adapon15\">Adapon, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe most important food for festivals and other special occasions is [[Mole sauce|mole]], especially mole poblano in the center of the country.<ref name=\"adapon89\" /><ref name=\"adapon97\">Adapon, p. 97.</ref> Mole is served at Christmas, Easter, Day of the Dead and at birthdays, baptisms, weddings and funerals, and tends to be eaten only for special occasions because it is such a complex and time-consuming dish.<ref name=\"adapon89\" /><ref name=\"adapon99\">Adapon, p. 99.</ref> While still dominant in this way, other foods have become acceptable for these occasions, such as barbacoa, carnitas and mixiotes, especially since the 1980s. This may have been because of economic crises at that time, allowing for the substitution of these cheaper foods, or the fact that they can be bought ready-made or may already be made as part of the family business.<ref name=\"adapon101\" /><ref name=\"adapon107\">Adapon, p. 107.</ref>\n\nAnother important festive food is the [[tamale]], also known as ''tamal'' in Spanish. This is a filled cornmeal dumpling, steamed in a wrapping (usually a corn [[husk]] or banana leaf) and one of the basic staples in most regions of Mexico. It has its origins in the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic era]] and today is found in many varieties in all of Mexico. Like mole, it is complicated to prepare and best done in large amounts.<ref name=\"knepp\">{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=Tamaladas and the role of food in Mexican-immigrant and Mexican-American cultures in Texas |last= Knepp |first= Mark Dustin |year=2010 |publisher= State University of New York at Albany |docket=3412031 }}</ref> Tamales are associated with certain celebrations such as [[Candlemas]].<ref name=\"adapon101\">Adapon, p. 101.</ref> They are wrapped in corn husks in the highlands and desert areas of Mexico and in banana leaves in the tropics.<ref name=\"iturr8489\">Iturriaga, p. 84-89.</ref>\n\n===Street food===\n{{Main|Mexican street food}}\n\nMexican street food is one of the most varied parts of the cuisine. It can include tacos, [[quesadilla]]s, [[pambazo]]s, tamales, [[Huarache (food)|huaraches]], [[alambre]]s, [[al pastor]], and food not suitable to cook at home, including barbacoa, carnitas, and since many homes in Mexico do not have or make use of ovens, [[Roast chicken|roasted chicken]].<ref name=\"adapon123\">Adapon, p. 123.</ref> One attraction of street food in Mexico is the satisfaction of hunger or craving without all the social and emotional connotation of eating at home, although longtime customers can have something of a friendship/familial relationship with a chosen vendor.<ref name=\"adapon126\">Adapon, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe best known of Mexico's street foods is the taco, whose origin is based on the pre-Hispanic custom of picking up other foods with tortillas as utensils were not used.<ref name=\"iturr43\"/> The origin of the word is in dispute, with some saying it is derived from [[Nahuatl]] and others from various Spanish phrases.<ref name=\"iturr4344\">Iturriaga, p. 43-44.</ref> Tacos are not eaten as the main meal; they are generally eaten before midday or late in the evening. Just about any other foodstuff can be wrapped in a tortilla, and in Mexico, it varies from rice, to meat (plain or in sauce), to cream, to vegetables, to cheese, or simply with plain chile peppers or fresh salsa. Preferred fillings vary from region to region with pork generally found more often in the center and south, beef in the north, seafood along the coasts, and chicken and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] in most of the country.<ref name=\"iturr44\">Iturriaga, p. 44.</ref>\n\nAnother popular street food, especially in [[Mexico City]] and the surrounding area is the [[Torta#Mexican sandwich|torta]]. It consists of a roll of some type, stuffed with several ingredients. This has its origins in the 19th century, when the French introduced a number of new kinds of bread. The torta began by splitting the roll and adding beans. Today, [[refried beans]] can still be found on many kinds of tortas. In Mexico City, the most common roll used for tortas is called ''[[Telera (bread)|telera]]'', a relatively flat roll with two splits on the upper surface. In Puebla, the preferred bread is called a [[cemita]], as is the sandwich. In both areas, the bread is stuffed with various fillings, especially if it is a hot sandwich, with beans, [[cream]] ([[mayonnaise]] is rare) and some kind of hot chile pepper.<ref name=\"iturr130133\">Iturriaga, p. 130-133.</ref>\n\nThe influence of American fast food on Mexican street food grew during the late 20th century. One example of this is the craving of the [[Sonoran hot dog|hot dog, but prepared Sonoran style]]. They are usually boiled then wrapped in [[bacon]] and fried together. They are served in the usual bun, but the condiments are typically a combination of diced tomatoes, onions and [[jalape\u00f1o]] peppers.<ref name=\"iturr130133\"/>\n\nAlong the US-Mexican border, specifically dense areas like Tijuana, Mexican vendors sell their food like [[Fruit salad|fruit melanged]] with [[Taj\u00edn (seasoning)|Tajin]] spice to people crossing the border via carts. In recent years, these [[food carts]] have been threatened by tightened border security at the Port of Entry. Both US and Mexican governments have proposed a project that would widen the streets of the border, allowing for more people to pass through the border. Widening the border would decimate neighboring [[Marketplace|mercados]] that rely on the business of travelers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/10/20/498285701/food-merchants-at-tijuana-border-fight-for-their-right-to-feed|title=Tijuana Border Plan Could Oust A Rich Food Culture And Its Cooks|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\nBesides food, street vendors also sell various kinds of drinks (including [[aguas frescas]], [[tejuino]], and [[tepache]]) and treats (such as [[bionico]]s, [[tostilocos]], and [[raspados]]). Most tamale stands will sell [[atole]] as a standard accompaniment.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:001_Tacos_de_carnitas,_carne_asada_y_al_pastor.jpg|[[Tacos]] of [[Carnitas]], [[Carne Asada]] and [[Al pastor]].\nFile:Tostadas_shrimp_cooking_food_dinner_salsa.jpg|[[Tostada (tortilla)|Tostada]]\nFile:tortamex.jpg|alt=Typical Mexican Torta|Mexican-style torta with typical accompaniments\nFile:ElBajio02.JPG|Mini bean [[gordita]] flavored with avocado leaf Veracruz style.\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Hispanic period===\n{{See also|Aztec cuisine|Gamesa}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   |total_width = 400\n   | header    =\n   | align     = right\n   | image1    =Mayan people and chocolate.jpg\n   |width1   = 418\n   |height1 = 333 \n   | caption1  = A [[Maya civilization|Maya]] lord sits before an individual with a container of frothed [[chocolate]].\n   | image2    = Guacomole.jpg\n   |width2   = 6048\n   |height2 =  4032 \n   | caption2  = [[Guacamole]] ([[Nahuatl]] ''\u0101huacamolli''), an avocado-based sauce that began in pre-Hispanic Mexico\n  }}\n\n[[File:Tool_(metate)-UBC_2010.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A native American grinder stone tool or \"[[metate]]\" from Central Mexico.]]\n\nAround 7000 BCE, the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America hunted [[Game (hunting)|game]] and gathered [[Plant-based diet|plants]], including wild chile peppers. Corn was not yet cultivated, so one main source of calories was roasted [[agave]] hearts. By 1200 BCE, corn was domesticated and a process called [[nixtamalization]], or treatment with lye, was developed to soften corn for grinding and improve its nutritional value.

Mexican cooking was of course still practiced in what is now the [[Cuisine of the Southwestern United States|Southwest United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], but [[Diana Kennedy]], in her book ''The Cuisines of Mexico'' (published in 1972), drew a sharp distinction between Mexican food and Tex-Mex.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/>\n\nTex-Mex food was developed from Mexican and Anglo influences, and was traced to the late 19th century in Texas. It still continues to develop with flour tortillas becoming popular north of the border only in the latter 20th century.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/> From north to south, much of the influence has been related to food industrialization, as well as the greater availability overall of food, especially after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. One other very visible sign of influence from the United States is the appearance of [[fast foods]], such as [[hamburgers]], [[hot dogs]] and [[pizza]].<ref name=\"luengas8085\">Luengas, pp. 80-85.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pujol_20.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Pujol (restaurant)|Pujol]] was named by ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as the best in [[Mexico City]].<ref name=\"STAN SESSER\">{{cite news  \n| last=  SESSER\n| first=  STAN \n| url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123215425094092359.html\n| title=  The World's Greatest Food City? \n| newspaper=  [[Wall Street Journal]] \n| date=      January 17, 2009\n| accessdate= January 17, 2011}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Portada-chilaquiles-rojos.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Chilaquiles]]]]\n\nIn the latter 20th century, international influence in Mexico has led to interest and development of [[haute cuisine]]. In Mexico, many professional chefs are trained in French or international cuisine, but the use of Mexican staples and flavors is still favored, including the simple foods of traditional markets. It is not unusual to see some quesadillas or small tacos among the other [[hors d'oeuvre]]s at fancy dinner parties in Mexico.<ref name=\"adapon11\"/>\n\nProfessional cookery in Mexico is growing and includes an emphasis upon traditional methods and ingredients. In the cities, there is interest in publishing and preserving what is authentic Mexican food. This movement is traceable to 1982 with the Mexican Culinary Circle of Mexico City. It was created by a group of women chefs and other culinary experts as a reaction to the fear of traditions being lost with the increasing introduction of foreign techniques and foods.<ref name=\"adapon11\"/> In 2010, Mexico's cuisine was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[Serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended [[soy]] sauce, or complemented with [[vinegar]], [[habanero pepper]]s, and chipotle peppers.\n\n==Beverages==\n{{See also|Mexican wine|Jarritos|Beer in Mexico|}}\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   |total_width =400\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = ManekiNeko horchata jar.jpg\n   |width1   = 500\n   |height1 = 531\n   | caption1  = Two large jars of aguas frescas.

Corn is the base of a hot drink called [[atole]], which is then flavored with fruit, chocolate, rice or other flavors. Fermented corn is the base of a cold drink, which goes by different names and varieties, such as [[tejuino]], [[pozol]] and others. [[Aguas frescas]] are flavored drinks usually made from fruit, water and sugar. Beverages also include [[hibiscus]] iced tea, one made from [[tamarind]] and one from rice called \"[[horchata]]\".

The area has at least forty different types of [[flour tortillas]].<ref name=\"rperez\"/> The main reason for this is that much of the land supports wheat production, introduced by the Spanish.

Much of the cuisine of this area is dependent on food preservation techniques, namely dehydration and canning. Dried foods include meat, chiles, squash, [[peas]], corn, [[lentils]], beans and [[dried fruit]]. A number of these are also canned. Preservation techniques change the flavor of foods; for example, many chiles are less hot after drying.<ref name=\"rperez\"/>\n\nIn Northeastern Mexico, during the Spanish colonial period, [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] was founded and settled by Spanish families of Jewish origin ([[Crypto-Jews]]). They contributed significantly to the regional cuisine with dishes, such as Pan de Semita or \"Semitic Bread\" (a type of bread made without [[leavening]]), [[capirotada]] (a type of dessert), and cabrito or \"baby goat\", which is the typical food of Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, as well as some regions of [[Coahuila]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditional food of Nuevo Le\u00f3n|url=http://www.nl.gob.mx/?P=nl_comida_tradicional|publisher=Gobierno del Estado de Nuevo Le\u00f3n|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=138&letter=C Jewish Encyclopedia: Carabajal].

However, it was the first area to experience the mixing of foods and cooking styles, while central Mexico was still recuperating. Despite its size, the state has a wide variety of ecosystems and a wide variety of native foods. Vegetables are grown in the central valley, seafood is abundant on the coast and the area bordering Veracruz grows tropical fruits.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMuch of the state's cooking is influenced by that of the [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]. Later in the colonial period, Oaxaca lost its position as a major food supplier and the area's cooking returned to a more indigenous style, keeping only a small number of foodstuffs, such as chicken and pork. It also adapted [[mozzarella]], brought by the Spanish, and modified it to what is now known as [[Oaxaca cheese]].<ref name=\"unioax\">{{cite book |title= Cocina Estado por estado: Oaxaca  |trans-title=State by state cuisine: Oaxaca |year=2007 |publisher= El Universal /Radar Editores |volume=1 |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}</ref><ref name=\"oaxcuis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2266-the-cuisine-of-oaxaca-land-of-the-seven-moles |title= The Cuisine of Oaxaca, Land of the Seven Moles  |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:EnchiladasTasajoOcotlan.JPG|thumb|[[Enchilada]]s with [[tasajo]] beef.]]\n\nOne major feature of Oaxacan cuisine is its seven [[Mole sauce|mole]] varieties, second only to mole poblano in popularity.

Tortillas are called blandas and are a part of every meal. Corn is also used to make empanadas, tamales and more. Black beans are favored, often served in soup or as a sauce for enfrijoladas. Oaxaca's regional chile peppers include [[pasilla]] oaxaque\u00f1a (red, hot and smoky), along with amarillos (yellow), [[chilhuacles]], chilcostles and coste\u00f1os. These, along with herbs, such as hoja santa, give the food its unique taste.<ref name=\"oaxcuis\"/>\n\nAnother important aspect to Oaxacan cuisine is [[chocolate]], generally consumed as a beverage.

The indigenous contribution is in the use of corn as a staple, as well as vanilla (native to the state) and herbs called acuyo and [[hoja santa]]. It is also supplemented by a wide variety of tropical fruits, such as [[papaya]], [[Pouteria sapota|mamey]] and [[zapote]], along with the introduction of [[citrus fruit]] and [[pineapple]] by the Spanish. The Spanish also introduced European herbs, such as [[parsley]], [[thyme]], [[marjoram]], [[bay laurel]], [[cilantro]] and others, which characterize much of the state's cooking. They are found in the best known dish of the region [[Huachinango a la veracruzana]], a red snapper dish.\n\nThe African influence is from the importation of [[slaves]] through the [[Caribbean]], who brought foods with them, which had been introduced earlier to Africa by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. As it borders the Gulf [[coast]], seafood figures prominently in most of the state. The state's role as a gateway to Mexico has meant that the dietary staple of corn is less evident than in other parts of Mexico, with rice as a heavy favorite. Corn dishes include [[Garnaches|garnachas]] (a kind of corn cake), which are readily available especially in the mountain areas, where indigenous influence is strongest.<ref name=\"veracuis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2085-the-cuisine-of-veracruz-a-tasty-blend-of-cultures|title= The cuisine of Veracruz: a tasty blend of cultures |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Western Mexico===\nWest of Mexico City are the states of [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]] and [[Colima]], as well as the Pacific coast. The cuisine of Michoacan is based on the [[Pur\u00e9pecha|Purepecha]] culture, which still dominates most of the state. The area has a large network of rivers and lakes providing [[Fish as food|fish]]. Its use of corn is perhaps the most varied.

Successive waves of other [[Mesoamerica]]n groups brought with them their own cooking methods. These included the [[Olmec]], [[Teotihuacan]]os, [[Toltec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Tarascan state|Pur\u00e9pecha]], [[Totonac]], [[Mazatec]], and [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]].\n\nThe [[Mexica]] establishment of the [[Aztec Empire]] created a multi-ethnic society where many different foodways became [[Aztec cuisine|infused]]. The staples are native foods, such as corn ([[maize]]), [[bean]]s, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[amaranth]], [[Chia seed|chia]], [[avocado]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[tomatillo]]s, [[cocoa bean|cacao]], [[vanilla]], [[agave]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)#Historical use|spirulina]], [[sweet potato]], [[Cactus#Food|cactus]], and [[chili pepper]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] in the 16th century and the subsequent [[Spanish_conquest_of_Yucat\u00e1n|conquest of the Maya area]], Europeans introduced a number of  [[European cuisine|other foods]], the most important of which were meats from domesticated animals ([[beef]], [[pork]], [[chicken]], [[goat]], and [[sheep]]), dairy products (especially cheese and milk), and [[rice]]. While the Spanish initially tried to impose their own diet on the country, this was not possible.\n\n[[Asian cuisine|Asian]] and [[African cuisine|African influences]] were also introduced into the [[indigenous cuisine]] during this era as a result of [[Afro-Mexican#African slavery in Mexico|African slavery in New Spain]] and the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]]s.<ref name=\"CONACULTA\">{{cite web|title= La cocina del virreinato| url=http://sic.conaculta.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=gastronomia&table_id=101 |publisher=[[CONACULTA]] |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOver the centuries, this resulted in regional cuisines based on local conditions, such as those in [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]] and the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture, social structure and popular traditions of Mexico. The most important example of this connection is the use of [[Mole sauce|mole]] for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the South and Central regions of the country. For this reason and others, traditional Mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{cite web |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-mexican-cuisine-ancestral-ongoing-community-culture-the-michoacan-paradigm-00400 |title=Traditional Mexican cuisine - ancestral, ongoing community culture, the Michoac\u00e1n paradigm |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Basic elements==\n[[File:Still-life_by_Jos\u00e9_Agust\u00edn_Arrieta,_San_Diego_Museum_of_Art.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Still-life, oil on canvas painting by [[Agust\u00edn Arrieta|Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn Arrieta]] (Mexican), c. 1870, San Diego Museum of Art]]\n[[File:Huitlacoche, quintoniles, huauhzontles, flor de calabaza et al., Santa Maria la Ribera Market.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ingredients at a market in Mexico City, including [[Amaranthus hybridus|quintoniles]], [[huauzontle]], [[huitlacoche]] and [[Squash blossom|squash flowers]].]]\n\nMexican cuisine is a complex and ancient cuisine, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history.<ref name=\"fife\">{{cite journal |last= MacNeil-Fife |first= Karen |date=September 2000 |title= Beyond beer: Wine with Mexican food |journal=Sunset |volume=205 |issue=3 |page=194 }}</ref> It is created mostly with ingredients native to [[Mexico]], as well as those [[Columbian Exchange|brought over]] by the [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, with some new influences since then.<ref name=\"malat88\">Malat, p. 88.</ref> Mexican cuisine has been influenced by its proximity to the US-Mexican border.

However, the most common way to eat corn in Mexico is in the form of a tortilla, which accompanies almost every dish. Tortillas are made of corn in most of the country, but other versions exist, such as wheat in the north or [[Cooking banana|plantain]], [[yuca]] and wild greens in [[Oaxaca]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/><ref name=\"iturr43\"/>\n\n===Chili peppers===\n[[File:Chile Rellenos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chile relleno]]s, stuffed Chile peppers.]]\n\nThe other basic ingredient in all parts of Mexico is the [[Chili pepper|chile pepper]].<ref name=\"adapon7\">Adapon, p. 7.</ref> Mexican food has a reputation for being very spicy, but it has a wide range of flavors and while many spices are used for cooking, not all are spicy. Many dishes also have subtle flavors.<ref name=\"fife\"/><ref name=\"adapon11\"/> Chiles are indigenous to Mexico and their use dates back thousands of years. They are used for their flavors and not just their heat, with Mexico using the widest variety. If a savory dish or snack does not contain chile pepper, hot sauce is usually added, and chile pepper is often added to fresh fruit and sweets.<ref name=\"adapon7\"/>\n\n[[File:Molcajete y tejolote.jpg|thumb|A [[molcajete]] and tejolote, the traditional [[mortar and pestle]] of Mexico.]]\n\nThe importance of the chile goes back to the [[Mesoamerican]] period, where it was considered to be as much of a staple as corn and beans. In the 16th century, [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] wrote that without chiles, the [[indigenous people]] did not think they were eating. Even today, most [[Mexicans]] believe that their national identity would be at a loss without chiles and the many varieties of sauces and salsas created using chiles as their base.<ref name=\"adapon8\">Adapon, p. 8.</ref>\n\nMany dishes in Mexico are defined by their sauces and the chiles those sauces contain (which are usually very spicy), rather than the meat or vegetable that the sauce covers. These dishes include [[entomatada]] (in tomato sauce), [[adobo]] or adobados, pipians and [[Mole sauce|moles]]. A hominy soup called [[pozole]] is defined as white, green or red depending on the chile sauce used or omitted. Tamales are differentiated by the filling which is again defined by the sauce (red or green chile pepper strips or mole). Dishes without a sauce are rarely eaten without a salsa or without fresh or pickled chiles. This includes street foods, such as [[taco]]s, [[torta]]s, [[Chicken soup#Mexico|soup]], [[sope]]s, [[tlacoyo]]s, [[tlayuda]]s, [[gordita]]s and [[sincronizada]]s.<ref name=\"adapon114\">Adapon, p. 114.</ref> For most dishes, it is the type of chile used that gives it its main flavor.<ref name=\"adapon8\"/>  [[Chipotle]],  smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is very common in Mexican cuisine.\n\n===Spanish contributions===\n{{See also|Cheeses of Mexico}}\n[[File:Pechuga Adobada.jpg|thumb|''Pechuga [[adobada]]'', chicken breast in [[adobo]] with a side of [[chayote]], mushrooms, corn and [[Poblano|poblano rajas]]. Adobo, including a key item, [[vinegar]], arrived with the Spanish. A common characteristic of Mexican adobo is its incorporation of [[chile ancho]].]]\n\nNext to corn, [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from [[North Africa]] in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of Veracruz in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]s.\n\nSome of the main contributions of the Spanish were several kind of meat, dairy products and wheat to name few, as the Mesoamerican diet contained very little meat besides [[domesticated turkey]], and dairy products were absent. The Spanish also introduced the technique of frying in [[Lard|pork fat]]. Today, the main meats found in Mexico are pork, chicken, beef, goat, and sheep. Native seafood and [[Fish as food|fish]] remains popular, especially along the coasts.<ref name=\"malat8889\">Malat, pp. 88-89.</ref>\n\n[[Cheeses of Mexico|Cheesemaking in Mexico]] has evolved its own specialties. It is an important economic activity, especially in the north, and is frequently done at home. The main cheese making areas are [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], and [[Chiapas]]. Goat cheese is still made, but it is not as popular and is harder to find in stores.<ref name=\"losquesos\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2155-a-guide-to-mexican-cheese-queso-mexicano |title= A guide to Mexican cheese: Los quesos mexicanos |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= October 1, 2000  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Food and society==\n{{See also|Abuelita|Ibarra (chocolate)}}\n\n===Home cooking===\n[[File:Ela_huevos_rancheros.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Huevos rancheros]]]]\n\nIn most of Mexico, especially in rural areas, much of the food is consumed in the home.<ref name=\"adapon3\">Adapon, p. 3.</ref> Cooking for the family is usually considered to be [[women's work]], and this includes cooking for [[party|celebrations]] as well.<ref name=\"adapon71\">Adapon, p. 71.</ref> Traditionally girls have been considered ready to [[marry]] when they can cook, and [[cooking]] is considered a main talent for [[Housewife|housewives]].<ref name=\"adapon75\">Adapon, p. 75.</ref>\n\nThe main meal of the day in Mexico is the \"comida\", meaning 'meal' in Spanish.

Food preparation, especially for family and social events, is considered to be an investment in order to maintain social relationships.<ref name=\"adapon20\">Adapon, p. 20.</ref> Even the idea of flavor is considered to be social, with meals prepared for certain dinners and certain occasions when they are considered the most tasty.<ref name=\"adapon117\">Adapon, p. 117.</ref>\n\nThe ability to cook well, called \"saz\u00f3n\" (lit. seasoning) is considered to be a gift generally gained from experience and a sense of commitment to the diners.<ref name=\"abarca62\">Abarca, p. 62.</ref>  For the [[Day of the Dead]] festival, foods such as tamales and mole are set out on altars and it is believed that the visiting dead relatives eat the essence of the food. If eaten afterwards by the living it is considered to be tasteless.<ref name=\"adapon117\"/> In central Mexico, the main festival foods are mole, [[barbacoa]], [[carnitas]] and [[mixiote]]s. They are often prepared to feed hundreds of guests, requiring groups of cooks. The cooking is part of the social custom meant to bind families and communities.<ref name=\"adapon89\">Adapon, p. 89.</ref>\n\n[[File:Barbacoa (en Hidalgo).JPG|miniaturadeimagen|220px|left|thumb|Barbacoa in [[Actopan (Hidalgo)|Actopan]], [[Estado de Hidalgo|Hidalgo]]. The barbecue in a ground oven is a typical dish from the Mezquital Valley.]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9_de_olla_.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fruit punch]] is popular around Christmas time during [[Las Posadas]].]]\n\nMexican regional home cooking is completely different from the food served in most Mexican restaurants outside Mexico, which is usually some variety of [[Tex-Mex]].<ref name=\"adapon11\"/> Some of Mexico's traditional foods involved complex or long cooking processes. Before industrialization, traditional women spent several hours a day boiling dried corn then grinding it on a [[metate]] to make the dough for tortillas, cooking them one-by-one on a [[Comal (cookware)|comal]] griddle. In some areas, tortillas are still made this way. Sauces and salsas were also ground in a mortar called a [[molcajete]]. Today, blenders are more often used, though the texture is a bit different. Most people in Mexico would say that those made with a molcajete taste better, but few do this now.<ref name=\"adapon15\">Adapon, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe most important food for festivals and other special occasions is [[Mole sauce|mole]], especially mole poblano in the center of the country.<ref name=\"adapon89\" /><ref name=\"adapon97\">Adapon, p. 97.</ref> Mole is served at Christmas, Easter, Day of the Dead and at birthdays, baptisms, weddings and funerals, and tends to be eaten only for special occasions because it is such a complex and time-consuming dish.<ref name=\"adapon89\" /><ref name=\"adapon99\">Adapon, p. 99.</ref> While still dominant in this way, other foods have become acceptable for these occasions, such as barbacoa, carnitas and mixiotes, especially since the 1980s. This may have been because of economic crises at that time, allowing for the substitution of these cheaper foods, or the fact that they can be bought ready-made or may already be made as part of the family business.<ref name=\"adapon101\" /><ref name=\"adapon107\">Adapon, p. 107.</ref>\n\nAnother important festive food is the [[tamale]], also known as ''tamal'' in Spanish. This is a filled cornmeal dumpling, steamed in a wrapping (usually a corn [[husk]] or banana leaf) and one of the basic staples in most regions of Mexico. It has its origins in the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic era]] and today is found in many varieties in all of Mexico. Like mole, it is complicated to prepare and best done in large amounts.<ref name=\"knepp\">{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=Tamaladas and the role of food in Mexican-immigrant and Mexican-American cultures in Texas |last= Knepp |first= Mark Dustin |year=2010 |publisher= State University of New York at Albany |docket=3412031 }}</ref> Tamales are associated with certain celebrations such as [[Candlemas]].<ref name=\"adapon101\">Adapon, p. 101.</ref> They are wrapped in corn husks in the highlands and desert areas of Mexico and in banana leaves in the tropics.<ref name=\"iturr8489\">Iturriaga, p. 84-89.</ref>\n\n===Street food===\n{{Main|Mexican street food}}\n\nMexican street food is one of the most varied parts of the cuisine. It can include tacos, [[quesadilla]]s, [[pambazo]]s, tamales, [[Huarache (food)|huaraches]], [[alambre]]s, [[al pastor]], and food not suitable to cook at home, including barbacoa, carnitas, and since many homes in Mexico do not have or make use of ovens, [[Roast chicken|roasted chicken]].<ref name=\"adapon123\">Adapon, p. 123.</ref> One attraction of street food in Mexico is the satisfaction of hunger or craving without all the social and emotional connotation of eating at home, although longtime customers can have something of a friendship/familial relationship with a chosen vendor.<ref name=\"adapon126\">Adapon, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe best known of Mexico's street foods is the taco, whose origin is based on the pre-Hispanic custom of picking up other foods with tortillas as utensils were not used.<ref name=\"iturr43\"/> The origin of the word is in dispute, with some saying it is derived from [[Nahuatl]] and others from various Spanish phrases.<ref name=\"iturr4344\">Iturriaga, p. 43-44.</ref> Tacos are not eaten as the main meal; they are generally eaten before midday or late in the evening. Just about any other foodstuff can be wrapped in a tortilla, and in Mexico, it varies from rice, to meat (plain or in sauce), to cream, to vegetables, to cheese, or simply with plain chile peppers or fresh salsa. Preferred fillings vary from region to region with pork generally found more often in the center and south, beef in the north, seafood along the coasts, and chicken and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] in most of the country.<ref name=\"iturr44\">Iturriaga, p. 44.</ref>\n\nAnother popular street food, especially in [[Mexico City]] and the surrounding area is the [[Torta#Mexican sandwich|torta]]. It consists of a roll of some type, stuffed with several ingredients. This has its origins in the 19th century, when the French introduced a number of new kinds of bread. The torta began by splitting the roll and adding beans. Today, [[refried beans]] can still be found on many kinds of tortas. In Mexico City, the most common roll used for tortas is called ''[[Telera (bread)|telera]]'', a relatively flat roll with two splits on the upper surface. In Puebla, the preferred bread is called a [[cemita]], as is the sandwich. In both areas, the bread is stuffed with various fillings, especially if it is a hot sandwich, with beans, [[cream]] ([[mayonnaise]] is rare) and some kind of hot chile pepper.<ref name=\"iturr130133\">Iturriaga, p. 130-133.</ref>\n\nThe influence of American fast food on Mexican street food grew during the late 20th century. One example of this is the craving of the [[Sonoran hot dog|hot dog, but prepared Sonoran style]]. They are usually boiled then wrapped in [[bacon]] and fried together. They are served in the usual bun, but the condiments are typically a combination of diced tomatoes, onions and [[jalape\u00f1o]] peppers.<ref name=\"iturr130133\"/>\n\nAlong the US-Mexican border, specifically dense areas like Tijuana, Mexican vendors sell their food like [[Fruit salad|fruit melanged]] with [[Taj\u00edn (seasoning)|Tajin]] spice to people crossing the border via carts. In recent years, these [[food carts]] have been threatened by tightened border security at the Port of Entry. Both US and Mexican governments have proposed a project that would widen the streets of the border, allowing for more people to pass through the border. Widening the border would decimate neighboring [[Marketplace|mercados]] that rely on the business of travelers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/10/20/498285701/food-merchants-at-tijuana-border-fight-for-their-right-to-feed|title=Tijuana Border Plan Could Oust A Rich Food Culture And Its Cooks|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\nBesides food, street vendors also sell various kinds of drinks (including [[aguas frescas]], [[tejuino]], and [[tepache]]) and treats (such as [[bionico]]s, [[tostilocos]], and [[raspados]]). Most tamale stands will sell [[atole]] as a standard accompaniment.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:001_Tacos_de_carnitas,_carne_asada_y_al_pastor.jpg|[[Tacos]] of [[Carnitas]], [[Carne Asada]] and [[Al pastor]].\nFile:Tostadas_shrimp_cooking_food_dinner_salsa.jpg|[[Tostada (tortilla)|Tostada]]\nFile:tortamex.jpg|alt=Typical Mexican Torta|Mexican-style torta with typical accompaniments\nFile:ElBajio02.JPG|Mini bean [[gordita]] flavored with avocado leaf Veracruz style.\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Hispanic period===\n{{See also|Aztec cuisine|Gamesa}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   |total_width = 400\n   | header    =\n   | align     = right\n   | image1    =Mayan people and chocolate.jpg\n   |width1   = 418\n   |height1 = 333 \n   | caption1  = A [[Maya civilization|Maya]] lord sits before an individual with a container of frothed [[chocolate]].\n   | image2    = Guacomole.jpg\n   |width2   = 6048\n   |height2 =  4032 \n   | caption2  = [[Guacamole]] ([[Nahuatl]] ''\u0101huacamolli''), an avocado-based sauce that began in pre-Hispanic Mexico\n  }}\n\n[[File:Tool_(metate)-UBC_2010.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A native American grinder stone tool or \"[[metate]]\" from Central Mexico.]]\n\nAround 7000 BCE, the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America hunted [[Game (hunting)|game]] and gathered [[Plant-based diet|plants]], including wild chile peppers. Corn was not yet cultivated, so one main source of calories was roasted [[agave]] hearts. By 1200 BCE, corn was domesticated and a process called [[nixtamalization]], or treatment with lye, was developed to soften corn for grinding and improve its nutritional value. This allowed the creation of tortillas and other kinds of flat breads.<ref name=\"sharpe\">{{cite journal |last= Sharpe |first= Patricia|date=December 2004 |title= More Mexican\u2014It's About Time; Mexican food through the ages. |journal=Texas Monthly |volume=32 |issue=12 |page=1  }}</ref> The indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica had numerous stories about the origin of corn, usually related to being a gift of one or more gods, such as [[Quetzalcoatl]].<ref name=\"luengas2728\">Luengas, pp. 27-28.</ref>\n\nThe other staple was beans, eaten with corn and some other plants as a complementary protein. Despite this, studies of bones have shown problems with the lack of protein in the indigenous diet {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, as meat was difficult to obtain.

It allowed them to expand an empire, bringing in [[tribute]] which consisted mostly of foods the Aztecs could not grow themselves.<ref name=\"adapon8\"/> According to [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]], the [[Nahua peoples]] of central Mexico ate corn, beans, turkey, fish, small game, insects and a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, [[pulses]], [[seeds]], [[tubers]], wild [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], plants and [[herbs]] that they collected or cultivated.<ref name=\"adapon9\">Adapon, p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Post-conquest===\n{{See also|Mexican breads}}\n[[File:Tortilleras Nebel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Las Tortilleras'', an 1836 [[lithograph]] after a painting by [[Carl Nebel]] of women grinding corn and making tortillas.]]\n\nMexican educator [[Justo Sierra]] said that \"the grocer, not the conquistador, is the real Spanish father of Mexican society.\"<ref name=\"losquesos\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], the Spanish introduced a variety of foodstuffs and cooking techniques from [[Europe]]. Spanish cooking at that time was already a mixture of ingredients because of eight centuries of [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] influence.<ref name=\"adapon10\">Adapon, p. 10.</ref> The original aim of the introduction was to reproduce their home cuisine, but over time it was incorporated with native ingredients and cooking techniques.<ref name=\"adapon9\"/> Introduced foods included [[olive oil]], rice, onions, garlic, [[oregano]], [[coriander]], [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, and many other herbs and spices.<ref name=\"adapon10\"/> More importantly, they introduced domesticated animals, such as pigs, cows, chickens, goats and sheep for meat and milk, raising the consumption of protein. Cheese became the most important dairy product.<ref name=\"losquesos\"/><ref name=\"adapon10\"/> The most important cooking technique introduced by the Spanish was [[frying]].<ref name=\"adapon10\"/>\n\n[[File:KitchenSMAHuejotzingo.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A reconstructed kitchen at the 16th century former monastery of San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel, [[Huejotzingo]], Puebla.]]\n\nDespite the domination of Spanish culture, Mexican cuisine has maintained its base of corn, beans and chili peppers.<ref name=\"adapon10\"/> One reason for this was the overwhelming population of indigenous people in the earlier colonial period, and the fact that many ingredients for Spanish cooking were not available or very expensive in Mexico. One of the main avenues for the mixing of the two cuisines was in [[convents]].<ref name=\"adapon10\"/>\n\n[[File:Puesto_de_Dulces_mexicanos_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mexican [[candy]] stand.]]\n\nFor example, the Spanish brought rice to Mexico and it has since grown well in [[Veracruz]].

For drink they alcoholic drink [[pulque]], as well as corn-based [[atole]], as well as drink chocolate twice a day, for those who can afford it. He notes that coffee is not drunk, nor is wine.

Mexican cooking was of course still practiced in what is now the [[Cuisine of the Southwestern United States|Southwest United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], but [[Diana Kennedy]], in her book ''The Cuisines of Mexico'' (published in 1972), drew a sharp distinction between Mexican food and Tex-Mex.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/>\n\nTex-Mex food was developed from Mexican and Anglo influences, and was traced to the late 19th century in Texas. It still continues to develop with flour tortillas becoming popular north of the border only in the latter 20th century.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/> From north to south, much of the influence has been related to food industrialization, as well as the greater availability overall of food, especially after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. One other very visible sign of influence from the United States is the appearance of [[fast foods]], such as [[hamburgers]], [[hot dogs]] and [[pizza]].<ref name=\"luengas8085\">Luengas, pp. 80-85.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pujol_20.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Pujol (restaurant)|Pujol]] was named by ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as the best in [[Mexico City]].<ref name=\"STAN SESSER\">{{cite news  \n| last=  SESSER\n| first=  STAN \n| url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123215425094092359.html\n| title=  The World's Greatest Food City? \n| newspaper=  [[Wall Street Journal]] \n| date=      January 17, 2009\n| accessdate= January 17, 2011}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Portada-chilaquiles-rojos.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Chilaquiles]]]]\n\nIn the latter 20th century, international influence in Mexico has led to interest and development of [[haute cuisine]]. In Mexico, many professional chefs are trained in French or international cuisine, but the use of Mexican staples and flavors is still favored, including the simple foods of traditional markets. It is not unusual to see some quesadillas or small tacos among the other [[hors d'oeuvre]]s at fancy dinner parties in Mexico.<ref name=\"adapon11\"/>\n\nProfessional cookery in Mexico is growing and includes an emphasis upon traditional methods and ingredients. In the cities, there is interest in publishing and preserving what is authentic Mexican food. This movement is traceable to 1982 with the Mexican Culinary Circle of Mexico City. It was created by a group of women chefs and other culinary experts as a reaction to the fear of traditions being lost with the increasing introduction of foreign techniques and foods.<ref name=\"adapon11\"/> In 2010, Mexico's cuisine was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[Serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended [[soy]] sauce, or complemented with [[vinegar]], [[habanero pepper]]s, and chipotle peppers.\n\n==Beverages==\n{{See also|Mexican wine|Jarritos|Beer in Mexico|}}\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   |total_width =400\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = ManekiNeko horchata jar.jpg\n   |width1   = 500\n   |height1 = 531\n   | caption1  = Two large jars of aguas frescas.

Fermented corn is the base of a cold drink, which goes by different names and varieties, such as [[tejuino]], [[pozol]] and others. [[Aguas frescas]] are flavored drinks usually made from fruit, water and sugar. Beverages also include [[hibiscus]] iced tea, one made from [[tamarind]] and one from rice called \"[[horchata]]\".

This led to the dominance of meat, especially beef, in the region, and some of the most popular dishes include [[machaca]], [[arrachera]] and [[cabrito]].<ref name=\"rperez\"/><ref name=\"mexnorte\"/> The region's distinctive cooking technique is grilling, as ranch culture has promoted outdoor cooking done by men.<ref name=\"mexnorte\"/>\n\nThe ranch culture has also prompted cheese production and the north produces the [[Cheeses of Mexico|widest varieties of cheese in Mexico]]. These include [[Queso blanco|queso fresco]] (fresh farmer's cheese), ranchero (similar to Monterey Jack), [[cuajada]] (a mildly sweet, creamy curd of fresh milk), [[reques\u00f3n]] (similar to [[cottage cheese]] or [[ricotta]]), Chihuahua's creamy semi-soft queso [[Queso Chihuahua|menonita]], and fifty-six varieties of asadero (smoked cheese).<ref name=\"rperez\"/>\n\nAnother important aspect of northern cuisine is the presence of wheat, especially in the use of [[flour]] tortillas. The area has at least forty different types of [[flour tortillas]].<ref name=\"rperez\"/> The main reason for this is that much of the land supports wheat production, introduced by the Spanish. These large tortillas allowed for the creation of burritos, usually filled with machaca in [[Sonora]], which eventually gained popularity in the [[Southwest United States]].<ref name=\"mexnorte\"/>\n\n[[File:Carne a la tampique\u00f1a.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Carne a la tampique\u00f1a]]]]\n\nThe variety of foodstuffs in the north is not as varied as in the south of Mexico, because of the mostly desert climate. Much of the cuisine of this area is dependent on food preservation techniques, namely dehydration and canning. Dried foods include meat, chiles, squash, [[peas]], corn, [[lentils]], beans and [[dried fruit]]. A number of these are also canned. Preservation techniques change the flavor of foods; for example, many chiles are less hot after drying.<ref name=\"rperez\"/>\n\nIn Northeastern Mexico, during the Spanish colonial period, [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] was founded and settled by Spanish families of Jewish origin ([[Crypto-Jews]]). They contributed significantly to the regional cuisine with dishes, such as Pan de Semita or \"Semitic Bread\" (a type of bread made without [[leavening]]), [[capirotada]] (a type of dessert), and cabrito or \"baby goat\", which is the typical food of Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, as well as some regions of [[Coahuila]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditional food of Nuevo Le\u00f3n|url=http://www.nl.gob.mx/?P=nl_comida_tradicional|publisher=Gobierno del Estado de Nuevo Le\u00f3n|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=138&letter=C Jewish Encyclopedia: Carabajal].

However, it was the first area to experience the mixing of foods and cooking styles, while central Mexico was still recuperating. Despite its size, the state has a wide variety of ecosystems and a wide variety of native foods. Vegetables are grown in the central valley, seafood is abundant on the coast and the area bordering Veracruz grows tropical fruits.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMuch of the state's cooking is influenced by that of the [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]. Later in the colonial period, Oaxaca lost its position as a major food supplier and the area's cooking returned to a more indigenous style, keeping only a small number of foodstuffs, such as chicken and pork. It also adapted [[mozzarella]], brought by the Spanish, and modified it to what is now known as [[Oaxaca cheese]].<ref name=\"unioax\">{{cite book |title= Cocina Estado por estado: Oaxaca  |trans-title=State by state cuisine: Oaxaca |year=2007 |publisher= El Universal /Radar Editores |volume=1 |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}</ref><ref name=\"oaxcuis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2266-the-cuisine-of-oaxaca-land-of-the-seven-moles |title= The Cuisine of Oaxaca, Land of the Seven Moles  |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:EnchiladasTasajoOcotlan.JPG|thumb|[[Enchilada]]s with [[tasajo]] beef.]]\n\nOne major feature of Oaxacan cuisine is its seven [[Mole sauce|mole]] varieties, second only to mole poblano in popularity.  The seven are Negro (black), Amarillo (yellow), Coloradito (little red), Mancha Manteles (table cloth stainer), Chichilo (smoky stew), Rojo (red), and Verde (green).<ref name=\"oaxcuis\"/>\n\nCorn is the staple food in the region. Tortillas are called blandas and are a part of every meal. Corn is also used to make empanadas, tamales and more. Black beans are favored, often served in soup or as a sauce for enfrijoladas. Oaxaca's regional chile peppers include [[pasilla]] oaxaque\u00f1a (red, hot and smoky), along with amarillos (yellow), [[chilhuacles]], chilcostles and coste\u00f1os. These, along with herbs, such as hoja santa, give the food its unique taste.<ref name=\"oaxcuis\"/>\n\nAnother important aspect to Oaxacan cuisine is [[chocolate]], generally consumed as a beverage. It is frequently hand ground and combined with [[almonds]], cinnamon and other ingredients.<ref name=\"oaxcuis\"/>\n\n===Veracruz===\n{{Main|Cuisine of Veracruz}}\n[[File:HuachinangoVeracruzana.JPG|thumb|[[Huachinango a la veracruzana]], a dish based on [[Northern red snapper|red snapper]].]]\n\nThe cuisine of [[Veracruz]] is a mix of indigenous, [[Afro-Mexican]] and Spanish. The indigenous contribution is in the use of corn as a staple, as well as vanilla (native to the state) and herbs called acuyo and [[hoja santa]]. It is also supplemented by a wide variety of tropical fruits, such as [[papaya]], [[Pouteria sapota|mamey]] and [[zapote]], along with the introduction of [[citrus fruit]] and [[pineapple]] by the Spanish. The Spanish also introduced European herbs, such as [[parsley]], [[thyme]], [[marjoram]], [[bay laurel]], [[cilantro]] and others, which characterize much of the state's cooking. They are found in the best known dish of the region [[Huachinango a la veracruzana]], a red snapper dish.\n\nThe African influence is from the importation of [[slaves]] through the [[Caribbean]], who brought foods with them, which had been introduced earlier to Africa by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. As it borders the Gulf [[coast]], seafood figures prominently in most of the state. The state's role as a gateway to Mexico has meant that the dietary staple of corn is less evident than in other parts of Mexico, with rice as a heavy favorite. Corn dishes include [[Garnaches|garnachas]] (a kind of corn cake), which are readily available especially in the mountain areas, where indigenous influence is strongest.<ref name=\"veracuis\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2085-the-cuisine-of-veracruz-a-tasty-blend-of-cultures|title= The cuisine of Veracruz: a tasty blend of cultures |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2006 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Western Mexico===\nWest of Mexico City are the states of [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]] and [[Colima]], as well as the Pacific coast. The cuisine of Michoacan is based on the [[Pur\u00e9pecha|Purepecha]] culture, which still dominates most of the state. The area has a large network of rivers and lakes providing [[Fish as food|fish]]. Its use of corn is perhaps the most varied. While [[atole]] is drunk in most parts of Mexico, it is made with more different flavors in Michoac\u00e1n, including [[blackberry]], [[cascabel chili]] and more. Tamales come in different shapes, wrapped in corn husks. These include those folded into polyhedrons called [[corunda]]s and can vary in name if the filling is different. In the [[Baj\u00edo]] area, tamales are often served with a meat [[stew]] called churipo, which is flavored with [[Opuntia|cactus fruit]].<ref name=\"mexmich\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2430-the-cuisine-of-michoac%C3%A1n-mexican-soul-food |title= The Cuisine of Michoac\u00e1n: Mexican Soul Food |first=Karen Hursh | last = Graber |date= January 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"univmich\">{{cite book |title= Cocina Estado por estado: Michoac\u00e1n  |trans-title=State by state cuisine: Michoac\u00e1n |year=2007 |publisher= El Universal /Radar Editores |volume=5 |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\nThe main Spanish contributions to Michoac\u00e1n cuisine are rice, pork and spices.

The latter can be found in many parts of Mexico, often claimed to be authentically Michoac\u00e1n. Other important ingredients in the cuisine include wheat (where bread symbolizes fertility) found in breads and [[pastries]]. Another is sugar, giving rise to a wide variety of desserts and sweets, such as [[Fruit preserves|fruit jellies]] and [[ice cream]], mostly associated with the town of [[Tocumbo Municipality|Tocumbo]]. The town of [[Cotija, Michoac\u00e1n|Cotija]] has a cheese named after it.

Taking place on an unnamed island, the player character is the Prisoner, a greenish blob of an unknown substance capable of possessing executed bodies in the depths of the island. While the \"Head\" of the Prisoner is immortal, the bodies it possesses are not, and dying will force it to slink back to the Prison Quarters.\n===Synopsis===\nThe Prisoner awakens in the depths of the Island's prison, next to a giant skeleton with a spear inside of it, a character named \"The Giant\", in the castle the player can discover that The Giant was murdered on the King's orders.\n\nA soldier implies that they have been trying to escape for an unspecified period of time. As the Prisoner works their way out of the Prison Quarters, they navigate the Island, and it is revealed to the player that the Island was once a mighty kingdom, until a plague known as \"The Malaise\" swept through, reducing most of its citizens to mindless zombies or monstrous husks. The Kingdom's Alchemist worked tirelessly to find a cure, but mysteriously disappeared as the king himself became reclusive. As the kingdom fell, the remaining citizens began to rebel against the King, only to either die by infection, seclusion, or by their own hands.\n\nOnce the prisoner dies, the giant skeleton disappears, and the soldier that told you about your previous escape attempts is found dead, and her body decays with each subsequent run.\n\nThe Prisoner encounters and fights several entities as they travel across the island: The Concierge, who was once the prison's guard Castaing, before his infection and subsequent transformation into a hulking monster; Conjonctivius, a nameless, faceless bloated corpse that was transformed into a grotesque tentacled Beholder-like monster; and The Time Keeper, a woman with some mastery over time, who continuously resets time each day to prevent her own infection. They also encounter The Collector, a hooded figure who trades items to the Prisoner in exchange for Cells, which drop from defeated enemies and are implied to be a sort of essence of life; and The Blacksmith and his apprentices, who upgrade the Prisoner's weapons and arsenal.\n\nEventually, the Prisoner reaches the castle's throne room, and faces off against the Hand of the King, while the King sits seemingly comatose upon his throne. The Prisoner defeats the Hand of the King, takes his weapon, and uses it to kill the King. The King's body violently explodes, destroying the Prisoner's host body and resetting the game, though giving the Prisoner the ability to act outside of a host body while still possessing the body. As the Prisoner's head returns to the quarters to find a new corpse to possess, it remarks on how even though the king has died, nothing has changed.\n\nThe Rise of the Giant DLC adds additional content, including new endings. The Prisoner gains access to a new area of the Island, The Cavern, which now houses the titanic undead skeletal Giant, who acts as a new boss for the area. The Giant, upon defeating it, reveals that the Prisoner is actually the King himself, his soul split from his body by consequence of his and the Alchemist's experiments. As the Prisoner continues, The Time Keeper begins actively altering the timeline to prevent her own death. After defeating the Hand of the King again (who is once more alive, though the King's body is still destroyed), if the player has all five Boss Cells (Modifiers which make the game substantially more difficult, earned by beating the game on each difficulty) active, they are able to gain access to the Astrolab and the Observatory. There, the Prisoner can find the Collector, who is implied to be the King's Alchemist. The Collector reveals that he has been collecting Cells to create a Panacea, to cure the Malaise once and for all. The Collector however, upon drinking the Panacea, goes mad with power and attempts to kill the Prisoner to reset the game so they'll bring him more Cells. While fighting the Collector, the Prisoner drinks some of the Panacea, which, upon the Collector's death, causes the Prisoner's host body to evaporate, resetting the game once more.\n\nThis time however, the Time Keeper fully resets the timeline. This allows the Prisoner, upon reaching the throne room and defeating the Hand of the King, to possess the King, getting his original body back. However, the body is infected with the Malaise, and so to prevent his own decay, he continues to the Observatory to face the Collector again. This time, upon the Collector's defeat, the Panacea cures the King and binds his body and soul once more.\n\nThe King returns to his throne, where he remarks over a glass of wine that he was honestly having more fun crawling around the sewers, when, due to the Time Keeper's meddling, a time-displaced Prisoner arrives in the throne room. The King and the Prisoner face off, and begin to duel.\n\n==Development==\n{{external media|right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqD1g6ROP_0 The Making of Dead Cells, by Red Bull Gaming]}}\n''Dead Cells''{{'}}s developer [[Motion Twin]] had been developing games for the [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile gaming]] market since 2001. The studio found that competition in the mobile market required more investment to make viable games, and decided to switch focus to develop what they considered their \"passion project\", a game that was \"something hardcore, ultra-niche, with pixel art and ridiculous difficulty\" that they knew would be a potential risk in terms of interested players.<ref name=\"vb\">{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/19/studio-abandons-free-to-play-web-and-mobile-games-for-passion-project-dead-cells/ | title = Studio abandons free-to-play web and mobile games for passion project: Dead Cells | first = Stephanie | last = Chan | date = April 19, 2017 | accessdate = May 12, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171019211620/https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/19/studio-abandons-free-to-play-web-and-mobile-games-for-passion-project-dead-cells/ | archive-date = October 19, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nInitially, Motion Twin had set out to make a follow-up to their browser game ''[[Die2Nite]]'', which was a cooperative [[tower defense]] game for up to forty players released in 2008; for most of the game, players would work together to form defenses around a town, and then during a night phase, wait to see if their town survived waves of attacks by zombies. Initially they wanted to have the sequel improved by allowing players to take actions and fight during the night phase, implementing [[free to play]] mechanics. While this version worked well with large number of players, Motion Twin found it was not very exciting for single players.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-cells-is-a-perfect-example-of-early-access-done-right/ | title = Dead Cells is a perfect example of Early Access done right | first = Jody | last = Macgregor | date = August 11, 2018 | accessdate = August 13, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180812083820/https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-cells-is-a-perfect-example-of-early-access-done-right/ | archive-date = August 12, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In 2014, they stripped down the game to basically a single-player experience between preparation and combat, and took it to an event called the Big Indie Pitch, where the idea came in second place. Inspired by this, they decided to strip away the game's preparation phase and focus it as a combat-based game. The process of figuring out how to keep and work from these combat elements took about a year up through the end of 2015.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\"/>\n\nTo tighten the gameplay, Motion Twin took inspiration of the Engineer class from ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', where the use of turrets and other buildable items helps to strengthen the character's abilities, and took ''Dead Cells'' into an action platformer where the player used weapons along with a variety of skills (including some elements they had developed for the tower defense approach).<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/> They did not want players to get used to having a single weapon/skill combination that they used indefinitely, and arranged the roguelike elements as to require the player to try out new combinations of weapons and skills as they progressed in a given run to defeat newer foes, and keeping what items they would get in a random manner every time they started a new game.<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/> Motion Twin's producer, Steve Filby, said that ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' was a significant influence, as there, the way the game proceeds \"is entirely based on the choice of items that you get. That\u2019s the fun of the game.\"<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299848/Designing_each_of_the_50_weapons_in_Dead_Cells_to_feel_distinctive.php | title = Designing each of the 50 weapons in Dead Cells to feel distinctive | first = Joel | last = Couture | date = July 7, 2017 | accessdate = July 7, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170707214608/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299848/Designing_each_of_the_50_weapons_in_Dead_Cells_to_feel_distinctive.php | archive-date = July 7, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> To give the player enough options, the developers crafted about 50 different weapons, avoiding having too much duplication in how each weapon worked so that there would be unique gameplay possibilities with each. The team used an iterative process in gameplay and graphics and art so that each of these weapons also exhibited unique animations or behavior so that the player would get a sense of a tactile response and the special nature of each weapon.<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/>\n\nMotion Twin opted to use [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s [[Early access]] approach to both gauge interest and to get real-time feedback from players on game features and the balance from procedural generation.<ref name=\"vb\"/> They also feared the stigma around indie games at the time, fueled by industry speculation of an \"indiepocalypse\" where too many indie games would have caused a collapse of the games market around 2015, but which never occurred.<ref name=\"gamasutra balance\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/325547/Tuning_Dead_Cells_to_appeal_to_players_both_fast_and_slow.php | title = Tuning Dead Cells to appeal to players both fast and slow |first = Carli | last=  Velocci | date = August 31, 2018 | accessdate = August 31, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> They did not want to release too early within early access, and made sure the first version available, while only about 30 to 40% complete, had tight combat and gameplay controls that players would appreciate.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\"/> Early access also allowed them to address balance issues, as they did not want to punish players for a specific style of play, and used the feedback to address this.

The player gains various weapons, treasure and other tools through exploration of the procedurally-generated levels to fight undead creatures within it. At times, the player may gain \"cells\", a type of in-game currency that can be used to purchase permanent upgrades or unlock new items for the player if they reach the vendor between each level. Dead Cells uses a permadeath system, causing the player to lose all cells and other currencies or items upon each instance of death. Motion Twin was inspired by ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' in developing the game.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Dead Cells'' is described as a \"roguevania\", a combination of procedurally-generated [[roguelike]] games and action-exploration-based [[metroidvania]] games.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/dead-cells/dead-cells-early-access-announcement | title = \u2018Roguevania\u2019 Dead Cells comes to Steam Early Access on May 10 | first = Sam | last = Foxall | date = April 22, 2017 | accessdate = May 12, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180407182946/https://www.pcgamesn.com/dead-cells/dead-cells-early-access-announcement | archive-date = April 7, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The player controls a mass of cells that occupy and control the body of a deceased prisoner at the start of each game.

Taking place on an unnamed island, the player character is the Prisoner, a greenish blob of an unknown substance capable of possessing executed bodies in the depths of the island. While the \"Head\" of the Prisoner is immortal, the bodies it possesses are not, and dying will force it to slink back to the Prison Quarters.\n===Synopsis===\nThe Prisoner awakens in the depths of the Island's prison, next to a giant skeleton with a spear inside of it, a character named \"The Giant\", in the castle the player can discover that The Giant was murdered on the King's orders.\n\nA soldier implies that they have been trying to escape for an unspecified period of time. As the Prisoner works their way out of the Prison Quarters, they navigate the Island, and it is revealed to the player that the Island was once a mighty kingdom, until a plague known as \"The Malaise\" swept through, reducing most of its citizens to mindless zombies or monstrous husks. The Kingdom's Alchemist worked tirelessly to find a cure, but mysteriously disappeared as the king himself became reclusive. As the kingdom fell, the remaining citizens began to rebel against the King, only to either die by infection, seclusion, or by their own hands.\n\nOnce the prisoner dies, the giant skeleton disappears, and the soldier that told you about your previous escape attempts is found dead, and her body decays with each subsequent run.\n\nThe Prisoner encounters and fights several entities as they travel across the island: The Concierge, who was once the prison's guard Castaing, before his infection and subsequent transformation into a hulking monster; Conjonctivius, a nameless, faceless bloated corpse that was transformed into a grotesque tentacled Beholder-like monster; and The Time Keeper, a woman with some mastery over time, who continuously resets time each day to prevent her own infection. They also encounter The Collector, a hooded figure who trades items to the Prisoner in exchange for Cells, which drop from defeated enemies and are implied to be a sort of essence of life; and The Blacksmith and his apprentices, who upgrade the Prisoner's weapons and arsenal.\n\nEventually, the Prisoner reaches the castle's throne room, and faces off against the Hand of the King, while the King sits seemingly comatose upon his throne. The Prisoner defeats the Hand of the King, takes his weapon, and uses it to kill the King. The King's body violently explodes, destroying the Prisoner's host body and resetting the game, though giving the Prisoner the ability to act outside of a host body while still possessing the body. As the Prisoner's head returns to the quarters to find a new corpse to possess, it remarks on how even though the king has died, nothing has changed.\n\nThe Rise of the Giant DLC adds additional content, including new endings. The Prisoner gains access to a new area of the Island, The Cavern, which now houses the titanic undead skeletal Giant, who acts as a new boss for the area. The Giant, upon defeating it, reveals that the Prisoner is actually the King himself, his soul split from his body by consequence of his and the Alchemist's experiments. As the Prisoner continues, The Time Keeper begins actively altering the timeline to prevent her own death. After defeating the Hand of the King again (who is once more alive, though the King's body is still destroyed), if the player has all five Boss Cells (Modifiers which make the game substantially more difficult, earned by beating the game on each difficulty) active, they are able to gain access to the Astrolab and the Observatory. There, the Prisoner can find the Collector, who is implied to be the King's Alchemist. The Collector reveals that he has been collecting Cells to create a Panacea, to cure the Malaise once and for all. The Collector however, upon drinking the Panacea, goes mad with power and attempts to kill the Prisoner to reset the game so they'll bring him more Cells. While fighting the Collector, the Prisoner drinks some of the Panacea, which, upon the Collector's death, causes the Prisoner's host body to evaporate, resetting the game once more.\n\nThis time however, the Time Keeper fully resets the timeline. This allows the Prisoner, upon reaching the throne room and defeating the Hand of the King, to possess the King, getting his original body back. However, the body is infected with the Malaise, and so to prevent his own decay, he continues to the Observatory to face the Collector again. This time, upon the Collector's defeat, the Panacea cures the King and binds his body and soul once more.\n\nThe King returns to his throne, where he remarks over a glass of wine that he was honestly having more fun crawling around the sewers, when, due to the Time Keeper's meddling, a time-displaced Prisoner arrives in the throne room. The King and the Prisoner face off, and begin to duel.\n\n==Development==\n{{external media|right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqD1g6ROP_0 The Making of Dead Cells, by Red Bull Gaming]}}\n''Dead Cells''{{'}}s developer [[Motion Twin]] had been developing games for the [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile gaming]] market since 2001. The studio found that competition in the mobile market required more investment to make viable games, and decided to switch focus to develop what they considered their \"passion project\", a game that was \"something hardcore, ultra-niche, with pixel art and ridiculous difficulty\" that they knew would be a potential risk in terms of interested players.<ref name=\"vb\">{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/19/studio-abandons-free-to-play-web-and-mobile-games-for-passion-project-dead-cells/ | title = Studio abandons free-to-play web and mobile games for passion project: Dead Cells | first = Stephanie | last = Chan | date = April 19, 2017 | accessdate = May 12, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171019211620/https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/19/studio-abandons-free-to-play-web-and-mobile-games-for-passion-project-dead-cells/ | archive-date = October 19, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nInitially, Motion Twin had set out to make a follow-up to their browser game ''[[Die2Nite]]'', which was a cooperative [[tower defense]] game for up to forty players released in 2008; for most of the game, players would work together to form defenses around a town, and then during a night phase, wait to see if their town survived waves of attacks by zombies. Initially they wanted to have the sequel improved by allowing players to take actions and fight during the night phase, implementing [[free to play]] mechanics. While this version worked well with large number of players, Motion Twin found it was not very exciting for single players.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-cells-is-a-perfect-example-of-early-access-done-right/ | title = Dead Cells is a perfect example of Early Access done right | first = Jody | last = Macgregor | date = August 11, 2018 | accessdate = August 13, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180812083820/https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-cells-is-a-perfect-example-of-early-access-done-right/ | archive-date = August 12, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In 2014, they stripped down the game to basically a single-player experience between preparation and combat, and took it to an event called the Big Indie Pitch, where the idea came in second place. Inspired by this, they decided to strip away the game's preparation phase and focus it as a combat-based game. The process of figuring out how to keep and work from these combat elements took about a year up through the end of 2015.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\"/>\n\nTo tighten the gameplay, Motion Twin took inspiration of the Engineer class from ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', where the use of turrets and other buildable items helps to strengthen the character's abilities, and took ''Dead Cells'' into an action platformer where the player used weapons along with a variety of skills (including some elements they had developed for the tower defense approach).<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/> They did not want players to get used to having a single weapon/skill combination that they used indefinitely, and arranged the roguelike elements as to require the player to try out new combinations of weapons and skills as they progressed in a given run to defeat newer foes, and keeping what items they would get in a random manner every time they started a new game.<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/> Motion Twin's producer, Steve Filby, said that ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' was a significant influence, as there, the way the game proceeds \"is entirely based on the choice of items that you get. That\u2019s the fun of the game.\"<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299848/Designing_each_of_the_50_weapons_in_Dead_Cells_to_feel_distinctive.php | title = Designing each of the 50 weapons in Dead Cells to feel distinctive | first = Joel | last = Couture | date = July 7, 2017 | accessdate = July 7, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170707214608/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299848/Designing_each_of_the_50_weapons_in_Dead_Cells_to_feel_distinctive.php | archive-date = July 7, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> To give the player enough options, the developers crafted about 50 different weapons, avoiding having too much duplication in how each weapon worked so that there would be unique gameplay possibilities with each.

The misery and squalor of their life in Kissimmee is contrasted with nearby [[Walt Disney World]], which can be seen at a distance in one shot.

She spends most of her summer days unsupervised with her motel-resident friends Scooty and Dicky, engaging in mischief. Bobby, the manager of Magic Castle, is protective of the children. After the kids are caught spitting on a guest's car at Futureland, the motel next door, Dicky's father restricts him from playing with Moonee and Scooty for a week. \n\nWhile cleaning up the car, they get to know its owner, Stacy and her granddaughter Jancey, who are living at Futureland. Jancey and Moonee become quick friends. Later on, Dicky's family relocates to [[New Orleans]], which saddens the group, but Dicky's father gives Dicky's toys to the kids under the guise of having no more room in his car.\n\nMoonee and Scooty come across a tourist couple at night, who are on their honeymoon. The woman wanted to go to Walt Disney World for her honeymoon and the man's assistant mistakenly booked a room at the Magic Castle instead of [[Magic Kingdom]]. While watching the couple bicker about the misunderstanding, Moonee tells Scooty that she always knows when adults are about to cry. \n\nHalley loses her job as an exotic dancer, which affects her eligibility for [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families|TANF]] benefits. She explains to the benefits officer that she was fired after refusing to have sex with clients at the strip club, but it is not seen as an extenuating circumstance. Unable to get a job at the diner and struggling to pay rent, Halley hawks perfume to tourists in hotel parking lots. Since the children are on summer vacation, she also babysits Scooty during the day in exchange for meals Scooty's mother Ashley steals from the diner where she works. \n\nHalley does not keep a watchful enough eye on the children, even after a scolding from Bobby. Despite his regular work and trying to host his son, who occasionally comes to visit and help with tasks around the motel, Bobby tries to monitor the kids, but their mischief grows increasingly dangerous.  They break into the room with the motel's electrical equipment, causing a blackout. Bobby also catches, beats, and ejects a pedophile talking to the kids in the parking lot. When the kids inadvertently burn down an abandoned condominium complex when trying to use the fireplace, Ashley finds out and cuts contact (and meals) from Halley.\n\nNeeding money for food and motel bills, Halley begins soliciting sex work online, closing Moonee in the bathroom with loud music when she has a client. When she steals a client's Disney [[MagicBands|resort passes]] to [[ticket resale|scalp]] them, the man returns to demand them back. Bobby scares him off but applies restrictions on unregistered guests in her motel room and warns Halley that he will evict her if the prostitution continues. Desperate, Halley approaches Ashley to apologize and ask for money. When Ashley criticises her sex work, Halley attacks and beats her in front of Scooty.

It stars [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Brooklynn Prince]], [[Bria Vinaite]], Valeria Cotto, Christopher Rivera, and [[Caleb Landry Jones]]. It was the first film appearance for many of the cast. The plot follows a six-year-old girl living with her rebellious single mother in a motel in [[Kissimmee, Florida]], as they try to stay out of trouble and make ends meet, so they may keep ahead of impending homelessness. The misery and squalor of their life in Kissimmee is contrasted with nearby [[Walt Disney World]], which can be seen at a distance in one shot. The Florida Project refers to the original name of the theme park.<ref>{{cite web|title=VIDEO: First trailer for \"The Florida Project\" film highlights life at budget motel near Walt Disney World|accessdate=August 27, 2018|url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/2017/08/video-first-trailer-florida-project-film-highlights-life-budget-motel-near-walt-disney-world/|first=Cristina|last=Sanza|publisher=JAK Schmidt|website=Inside the Magic|date=August 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''The Florida Project'' premiered in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2017 Cannes Film Festival]], and was theatrically released in the United States on October 6, 2017, by [[A24 (company)|A24]].

She spends most of her summer days unsupervised with her motel-resident friends Scooty and Dicky, engaging in mischief. Bobby, the manager of Magic Castle, is protective of the children. After the kids are caught spitting on a guest's car at Futureland, the motel next door, Dicky's father restricts him from playing with Moonee and Scooty for a week. \n\nWhile cleaning up the car, they get to know its owner, Stacy and her granddaughter Jancey, who are living at Futureland. Jancey and Moonee become quick friends. Later on, Dicky's family relocates to [[New Orleans]], which saddens the group, but Dicky's father gives Dicky's toys to the kids under the guise of having no more room in his car.\n\nMoonee and Scooty come across a tourist couple at night, who are on their honeymoon. The woman wanted to go to Walt Disney World for her honeymoon and the man's assistant mistakenly booked a room at the Magic Castle instead of [[Magic Kingdom]]. While watching the couple bicker about the misunderstanding, Moonee tells Scooty that she always knows when adults are about to cry. \n\nHalley loses her job as an exotic dancer, which affects her eligibility for [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families|TANF]] benefits. She explains to the benefits officer that she was fired after refusing to have sex with clients at the strip club, but it is not seen as an extenuating circumstance. Unable to get a job at the diner and struggling to pay rent, Halley hawks perfume to tourists in hotel parking lots. Since the children are on summer vacation, she also babysits Scooty during the day in exchange for meals Scooty's mother Ashley steals from the diner where she works. \n\nHalley does not keep a watchful enough eye on the children, even after a scolding from Bobby. Despite his regular work and trying to host his son, who occasionally comes to visit and help with tasks around the motel, Bobby tries to monitor the kids, but their mischief grows increasingly dangerous.  They break into the room with the motel's electrical equipment, causing a blackout. Bobby also catches, beats, and ejects a pedophile talking to the kids in the parking lot. When the kids inadvertently burn down an abandoned condominium complex when trying to use the fireplace, Ashley finds out and cuts contact (and meals) from Halley.\n\nNeeding money for food and motel bills, Halley begins soliciting sex work online, closing Moonee in the bathroom with loud music when she has a client. When she steals a client's Disney [[MagicBands|resort passes]] to [[ticket resale|scalp]] them, the man returns to demand them back. Bobby scares him off but applies restrictions on unregistered guests in her motel room and warns Halley that he will evict her if the prostitution continues. Desperate, Halley approaches Ashley to apologize and ask for money. When Ashley criticises her sex work, Halley attacks and beats her in front of Scooty. The next day, [[Florida Department of Children and Families]] (DCF) arrives to investigate Halley. She cleans up the room and gives away her [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]] but remains defiant. She takes Moonee to a resort hotel restaurant, where they charge the meal to a guest's room. \n\nWhen they return to the motel, DCF and the police are waiting to take Moonee into foster care pending investigation. Moonee says goodbye to Scooty and runs away to find Jancey, who, after seeing Moonee's shocking despair, takes her hand as the two run away to the [[Magic Kingdom]] theme park at Walt Disney World.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brooklynn Prince]] as Moonee, a six-year-old girl\n* [[Bria Vinaite]] as Halley, Moonee's mother\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Bobby Hicks, the manager of The Magic Castle Motel\n* Christopher Rivera as Scooty, Moonee's friend\n* Mela Murder as Ashley, Scooty's mother\n* Valeria Cotto as Jancey, Moonee's new friend\n* Josie Olivo as Grandma Stacey, Jancey's grandmother\n* Aiden Malik as Dicky, Moonee's friend who moves away\n* Edward \"Punky\" Pagan as Dicky's father\n* [[Caleb Landry Jones]] as Jack Hicks, Bobby's son\n* [[Macon Blair]] as Tourist John\n* Sandy Kane as Gloria\n* Sabina Friedman-Seitz as Church Group Sarah\n\n==Production==\n''The Florida Project'' was shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] and entirely on location in [[Osceola County, Florida]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/classified/realestate/os-bz-florida-project-film-20171015-story.html|title='Florida Project' film portrays life in Kissimmee hotels|last=Shanklin|first=Mary|date=October 15, 2017|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=July 27, 2018}}</ref> The film's fictional Magic Castle motel was shot at the existing Magic Castle Inn & Suites located on [[U.S. Route 192|U.S. Highway 192]] in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]], nearly six miles away from the [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World Resort]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/15/in-the-shadow-of-disney-living-life-on-the-margins|title=In the shadow of Disney, living life on the margins|last=Luscombe|first=Richard|date=October 15, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|access-date=July 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBaker filmed the final scene at Walt Disney World's [[Magic Kingdom]] Park clandestinely, using an [[IPhone 6S|iPhone 6S Plus]] without Disney's knowledge.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=http://www.papermag.com/the-florida-project-director-sean-baker-on-working-with-untrained-actos-and-secret-filming-in-disney-world-2499057069.html|title=\"The Florida Project\" Director Sean Baker on Working with Untrained Actors and Secret Filming in Disney World|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|date=October 20, 2017|access-date=October 22, 2017|first=Alexander|last=Hakimi}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/florida-project-ending-director-sean-baker-explains-meaning-how-he-did-it-1047215|title='The Florida Project': Director Sean Baker Explains How and Why He Shot That Ending|last=Lee|first=Ashley|date=October 11, 2017|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref> To maintain secrecy, the filming at the resort used only the bare minimum crew, including Baker, Bergoch, cinematographer [[Alexis Zabe]], acting coach Samantha Quan, Cotto, Prince, and the girls' guardians.<ref name=\":0\" /> Baker intended the ending to be left up to audience interpretation: \"We've been watching Moonee use her imagination and wonderment throughout the entire film to make the best of the situation she's in\u2014she can't go to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], so she goes to the [[Kilimanjaro Safaris|'safari']] behind the motel and looks at cows; she goes to the abandoned condos because she can't go to the [[Haunted Mansion]].
