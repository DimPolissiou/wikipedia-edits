He wasn't the first Puerto Rican to play in the MLB, however, he was arguably the most notable at the time. Roberto faced discrimination and disrespect while playing in MLB. Roberto persevered and continued to let his play shine and prove why he and many Latino players like him deserved to play among the best of the MLB. Recognized as \"The Great One\" , he often made his frustrations known about being overlooked by the media during his career. In Puerto Rico, Roberto was nothing less than a monumental superstar. He was considered a national hero and was idolized by all of the young players watching him. As rich and famous Roberto got, he never stopped helping others. He always helped the underprivileged as much as he could.\nMany stars have emerged from the ball fields of Puerto Rico since baseball arrived on the island in the late 1800s. There were Hall of Famers Orlando Cepeda, Pudge Rodriguez, and Roberto Alomar, and stars like Javy Lopez, Juan Gonzalez, Juan Pizarro, Ruben Gomez, Bernie Williams, and Jos\u00e9 Valentin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/cauldron/2015/09/16/excerpt-bengie-molina-remembers-roberto-clemente|title=How Clemente inspired the Molina baseball family|publisher=}}</ref>\nCarlos Correa has emerged as one of Puerto Rico's best talents in baseball.

Roberto showcased some of the best talent that Puerto Rico could offer and paved the way for thousands of players to follow his lead.

He was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1973, becoming both the first Latin American and Caribbean player to be enshrined. His untimely death established the precedent that, as an alternative to the five-year retirement period, a player who has been deceased for at least six months is eligible for entry into the Hall of Fame.\n\nClemente was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] for 12 seasons, playing in 15 All-Star Games.{{efn|MLB held two All-Star Games each season from 1959 through 1962.}} He was the [[National League]] (NL) [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in 1966, the NL [[Batting title|batting leader]] in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a [[Gold Glove Award]] winner for 12 consecutive seasons from 1961 through 1972.

On December 31, 1972, he died in a [[1972 Puerto Rico DC-7 crash|plane crash]] at the age of 38 while en route to deliver aid to earthquake victims in [[Nicaragua]]. The following season, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates#Retired numbers|Pirates retired his uniform number]] 21, and MLB renamed its annual Commissioner's Award in his honor; now known as the [[Roberto Clemente Award]], it is given to the player who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team\".\n\n== Early years ==\nClemente was born in Barrio San Ant\u00f3n,{{efn|Not to be confused with the better-known barrio [[San Ant\u00f3n]] in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]].}} [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TEmBnZP5klwC&pg=PT8 ''Baseball Hall of Famers: Roberto Clemente.''] Robert Kingsbury.

He wasn't the first Puerto Rican to play in the MLB, however, he was arguably the most notable at the time. Roberto faced discrimination and disrespect while playing in MLB. Roberto persevered and continued to let his play shine and prove why he and many Latino players like him deserved to play among the best of the MLB. Recognized as \"The Great One\" , he often made his frustrations known about being overlooked by the media during his career. In Puerto Rico, Roberto was nothing less than a monumental superstar. He was considered a national hero and was idolized by all of the young players watching him. As rich and famous Roberto got, he never stopped helping others. He always helped the underprivileged as much as he could.\nMany stars have emerged from the ball fields of Puerto Rico since baseball arrived on the island in the late 1800s. There were Hall of Famers Orlando Cepeda, Pudge Rodriguez, and Roberto Alomar, and stars like Javy Lopez, Juan Gonzalez, Juan Pizarro, Ruben Gomez, Bernie Williams, and Jos\u00e9 Valentin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/cauldron/2015/09/16/excerpt-bengie-molina-remembers-roberto-clemente|title=How Clemente inspired the Molina baseball family|publisher=}}</ref>\nCarlos Correa has emerged as one of Puerto Rico's best talents in baseball.

Although there are many varieties of pallet racking, all types allow for the storage of palletized materials in horizontal rows with multiple levels. [[Forklift truck]]s are usually required to place the loaded pallets onto the racks for storage. Since the [[Second World War]], pallet racks have become a ubiquitous element of most modern [[warehouse]]s, manufacturing facilities, retail centers, and other storage and distribution facilities. All types of pallet racking increase storage density of the stored goods.  Costs associated with the racking increases with increasing storage density.\n\n==Selective pallet racking systems==\n[[Image:Pallet racks.jpg|thumb|upright|Selective pallet rack]]\n[[Image:Hoogbouw-magazijn.JPG|thumb|upright|\"Very narrow aisle\" pallet racks. Picture taken from a \"man-up\" truck]]\n[[Image:Drive-In-Rack.jpg|thumb|upright|Drive-in pallet rack system]]\n[[Image:Push-Back-Rack.jpg|thumb|right|Push back system designed to store pallets of motorcycles]]\n[[Image:Pallet-Flow.jpg|thumb|right|Pallet flow lane showing rollers]]\n\n'''Selective pallet racking''' is a common pallet racking system in use today.  Selective pallet racking systems typically come in one of two configurations:  a '''roll formed''', or clip-in configuration, and a '''structural''' bolt-together configuration.\n\n#'''Roll formed''' selective rack is most commonly manufactured in a \"teardrop\" style (so named as the holes on the column of the upright are shaped like a teardrop). Pallets then rest on the horizontal load beams that are held in place by mounting clips.  Because the clips on teardrop configurations can be quickly moved, the shelves can be easily adjusted to different heights to accommodate various load sizes. This is convenient for a warehouse that needs to store a wide variety of product sizes.\n#'''Structural''' pallet rack systems are very similar to roll formed pallet rack systems except the horizontal load beams are attached to the uprights with bolts and have much greater weight-bearing capacity. The bolt fixings make this a form of [[adjustable shelving]] - racks can be constructed, reconfigured, and dismantled and reused as necessary.\n\nStructural pallet racking can be designed into the structure of the building itself, so that the upright columns are simultaneously used to support the roof of the storage facility, in which case the structural pallet rack uprights replace the storage building's vertical support I-beams.  This system is a rack supported building.\n\nSelective pallet rack systems provide easy accessibility to all products at all times - important if the inventory is rapidly depleted and restocked (called quick turnover). A selective pallet rack system is commonly used in a \"big-box\" distribution application, as well as in retail store inventory rooms, cold storage applications, wholesale stores, etc.\n\nCommon components of selective rack include the following:\n# {{anchor|G1|g1|beams}}'''Load beams''' (also called step beams or box beams).\n#* Most '''step beams''' are roll formed members with a 1\u215d\u201d step along the top inside edge.  This step is used to hold any load support components such as pallet supports or wire decks.\n#* '''Box beams''' have no inset step, instead have four flat sides like a box.  All load beams typically mount onto an upright frame column with integral rivets or hooks.  Some systems utilize an extra clip or bolt to lock the beam to the upright.\n#* '''Structural beams''' are hot formed structural C shapes with connecting clips at either end.  Structural load beams are generally used with structural uprights but can be used with standard roll formed uprights.  Structural load beams offer heavier weight capacities than step beams or box beams.\n# {{anchor|G2|g2|uprights}}'''Upright frames''' (also called upright columns or '''uprights''') vary in size and design depending on load requirements, and styles. The most common upright column is produced by roll forming flat coil stock steel into a modified \"C\" shape with returns.  This style is often referred to as open-back roll-formed columns. Holes or slots are punched during manufacturing up and down the column at standard intervals so that the load beams can be mounted into the upright columns.  Upright frames can also be constructed utilizing structural C shapes for columns.  Structural uprights have an increased weight capacity over roll formed uprights.\n# {{anchor|G8|g8|braces}}'''Diagonal braces''' and '''horizontal braces''', commonly referred to as upright frame lacing is usually welded between two upright columns to form selective upright frames.  The lacing may be bolted to the columns in some cases.\n# {{anchor|G3|g3|supports}}'''Pallet supports''' are roll formed channels that are placed front to back between the load beams to support pallets.\n# {{anchor|G4|g4|tdecking}}'''Timber decking''' comes in two forms: close boarded and slated. Close boarded decking provides a solid 'floor' to a level of racking while slatted is formed by rows of timber and acts as a permanent pallet.\n# {{anchor|G5|g5|decking}}'''Wire decking''' is commonly used as a safety measure on selective pallet rack to prevent pallets or the products stored on them from falling through the rack structure.  Wire mesh decking comes in various thicknesses and mesh dimensions. Wire mesh construction also allows for easy identification of shelf contents and prevents dirt and other debris from accumulating on the shelves because of the holes in the mesh.  Most wire mesh decking has U-shaped channel supports, also known as struts, to support the load. With this '''waterfall decking''', the wire mesh extends across the top and down the front of the beam to provide more support, and is more desirable in the marketplace. '''Reverse waterfall decking''' can provide containment of a loose product to prevent the product from falling behind the rack system. '''Lay-in decking''' rests inside the step of the beam, and wire mesh does not waterfall over the beam. Some types of decking are manufactured with solid metal instead of wire mesh. Even though the solid decking provides a greater distributed weight capacity, it is discouraged by fire inspectors because sprinkler systems cannot spray through the shelves to levels below.\n# {{anchor|G6|g6|footplates}}'''Footplates''', also known as footpads or baseplates, are at the base of columns and serve as anchors to give the rack more stability:  anchor bolts are inserted through the baseplate's holes to attach the column to the concrete floor. Footplates are made of thicker steel and in some geographic locations, they must be of a certain size and seismic rating. Footpads increase the pallet rack's overall stability and weight-bearing capacity.\n# {{anchor|G7|g7|shims}}'''Shims''' are used when the uprights are resting on uneven floors; the shims, equal in size to the base of the uprights, are installed beneath the uprights to level the rack.\n# {{anchor|G8|g8|rowspacers}}'''Row spacers''' are sometimes used if uprights are arranged in back-to-back rows; the spacers are mounted between adjacent columns to ensure that the rows are kept straight and to give the pallet racks even more strength and steadiness.\n# {{anchor|G9|g9|wallties}}'''Wall ties''' may be used for further support if the uprights are arranged in a row along a wall.\n# {{anchor|G10|g10|columnprotectors}}'''Column protectors''', also known as post protectors, are protective shields that can be installed around the base of an upright to minimize damage where forklifts might hit the upright. Damage to the base of a column can weaken the entire frame and could cause it to collapse. Column protectors are made of various materials such as polyethylene, ductile iron casting, and other durable materials.\n# {{anchor|G11|g11|guardrails}}'''Guard rails''' are installed to increase protection for upright columns and for human safety when platforms or steps are attached to pallet racks.\n\n'''Very narrow aisle''' otherwise known as '''VNA''', is the use of selective pallet racking in a tighter configuration to provide maximum space utilization within a storage facility. These systems typically operate in conjunction with wire-guided or rail-guided reach-truck systems. A wire-guided system consists of a wire embedded in the concrete floor that provides tracking for the reach-truck. A rail-guided system consists of angle iron bolted to the floor down the length of each row. Typically, the angle iron is 4\u201d by 3\u201d and \u00bc\u201d - \u215c\u201d inches thick. A distinct advantage of a [http://www.pdindustrial.co.uk/narrow-aisle-pallet-racking/ narrow aisle pallet racking] is fast picking without large aisles which results in improved use of space. When there is limited space, a compact storage method is ideal. Fully adjustable system flexibility and space saving aisles can be manipulated as one to give the greatest amount of pallet storage locations.\n\n==Other common types ==\n[[File:Industrial Park, Sackville, NB (45848977572).jpg|thumb|High bay racking supported cold storage facility, under construction in 2018]]\nMany types of pallet storage racks are available with different designs to fulfill specific functions or create specific advantages. To create the ideal pallet racking system, several considerations should be taken into account:\n\n*  Desired storage density\n*  Floor space and building height\n*  Placement of building doors and columns\n*  Inventory accessibility\n*  Inventory rotation\n*  Item/load size and weight\n*  Optimal storage design\n*  Cost of materials and installation\n\n'''Some of the most common types of pallet rack systems used include:'''\n# {{anchor|T4|t6|drive-in}}'''Drive-in'''<ref>{{US patent|3391795}}, Finlayson, T.J. 07/9/1968 \"Drive in pallet rack\"</ref> and '''drive-through''' (sometimes spelled Drive-thru) are storage rack configurations that allow the forklift to drive directly into the lane of stacked rows (called a bay). The difference between a drive-in and a drive-thru pallet rack system is simply whether the bays have an entry at only one end, or at both ends. Drive-in rack systems use a common entry and exit, while drive-thru systems have entry points at either end of the bay. Because a drive-in racking system has only one entrance, it uses what is called a LIFO (last in, first out) storage method. With only one entrance, the last pallet put into a row is necessarily the first one to be taken out. A drive-thru storage system, with two different entry points, can also use a FIFO (first in, first out) storage method. With a FIFO system, pallets are loaded in one end and are pushed back to the other end, where they are then at the front of the row on the opposite side. The first pallet put into such a row is the first one taken out at the other end. This system is advantageous for material with an expiration date or wherever shelf life is a major concern.\n# {{anchor|T5|t4|pushback}}'''Push-back pallet rack''' systems are designed around the principle of organizing space by depth rather than width. This depth arrangement greatly reduces aisle space and increases storage density. In this configuration, each bay can be up to six pallets deep; each pallet stored on wheeled carts that fit onto rails.<ref>{{US patent|4715765}}, Agnoff, Charles 12/29/1987, \"Gravity Flow Storage System\" Fig. 1 Shows Pallet on track and cart system.</ref>  The rails are slightly angled toward the load/unload side of the rack in order to take advantage of gravity, saving enormous amounts of energy for moving heavy pallets. When a forklift sets the pallet onto the cart, it drives forward and causes the pallet to bump the next pallet, causing the entire row of pallets to roll backwards. When removing a pallet from the front position the remaining pallets immediately stage themselves forward so that the next available pallet can be accessed.  Push back rack is a LIFO (last in, first out) storage system.\n# {{anchor|T6|t5|pallet flow}}'''Pallet flow''' systems are high density pallet storage systems that utilize depth to increase capacity.  This system uses a slightly inclined rail with rollers that allow pallets to move easily along the sloped plane. These systems are also called gravity flow\nor dynamic flow systems. The pallet flow system often has complex motion and braking systems to control the speed of the moving pallet.  Pallet flow racking systems are either a FIFO (first in, first out) or a LIFO (last in, first out) storage system.  If the system is loaded from the back and unloaded from the front, it is FIFO; if the system is loaded and unloaded from the front it is a LIFO system.\n# {{anchor|T7|t6|compact mobilized pallet racks}}'''Compact mobilized pallet racks''' (also known as motorized mobile pallet racks or mobile industrial rack system),<ref>{{US patent|20100200528A1}}, Tourdot, Matthew A 09/18/2007 \"Mobile Industrial Rack System\" Patent refers to this product.</ref> are designed to maximize the use of warehouse storage space.  This can reduce your pallet storage area in half, or double the capacity of your pallet rack storage in the same floor area.  It allocates space by converting static access aisles into productive storage space. By mounting rows of pallet racks onto heavy-duty rolling carriages and positioning them on floor tracks. Rows of pallet racks (up to 96\u2019 long) move sideways along the floor tracks creating a movable floating access aisle. Typical warehouse storage facilities may have dozens of static access aisles but only one or two forklifts capable of accessing stored materials.  This reduces the number of access aisles to match the velocity requirements of your storage area. Rows of pallet racks are moved by pushing a button or by remote control, which opens access aisles when and where they are needed.  \n[[Mobile shelving|Mobilized storage system]] has helped many organizations reduce or eliminate new building construction costs, auxiliary warehouses, building expansions, and decrease ongoing operational costs (lighting, energy, insurance) by redistributing the use of their storage floor space.\n\nSome disadvantages of high density pallet storage systems are; less access to all stock at any given moment (although if the stored product is all the same, it should not matter), and the expense of such systems.  Selective pallet rack systems are considerably less expensive per pallet position than their higher density counterparts.  In most medium to large facilities, however, high density pallet rack systems are essential, since they provide the efficiency of time and high cost facility space is better optimized.\n\nIdentifying the brand of racking systems is important to order compatible shelving or resell the racks. It is possible to differentiate between the many pallet rack brands by looking at the shape of the vertical beams, increments of height adjustment and the shape of the holes on the vertical beams.\n\n==Safety considerations==\n{{Howto|section|date=March 2016}} \nBecause of the size and weight of pallets, safety is relevant.\n\nWorkers must pay attention to any loose components in the pallet rack system, and also take the time to report any damage in the pallet rack frame. Such frame damage could cause the pallets to fall.\n\nIt is the owner's legal responsibility to communicate this important warning to all who are around storage racks: ''Never climb on racks during or after assembly. Storage racks are not designed to be stepped on or climbed on. A slip or fall may result in serious injury.'' 'It is especially important to have highly visible warning signs if the pallet rack system is used in retail environments, such as wholesale centers, where the public is present.\n\nQuality pallets that are not damaged must be used. To save money, or perhaps from neglectful management, some warehouses use pallets until they become faulty and dangerous. Regular inspection of pallets for broken or fractured planks or stringers, protruding nails, and missing support blocks is essential. Damaged pallets can cause loading and unloading problems; for example, loose stringers can get hung up on the pallet racks, which can cause loads to fall from high positions. Also, faulty pallets can cause obstruction problems in flow systems by jamming certain pallet rack designs.\n\nProper motorized equipment must be used for the application. Obstructing the end of aisles by staging pallets in these areas can cause severe and potentially fatal injuries and accidents. Overloading or exceeding the recommended load specifications for a racking system may cause a catastrophic failure of your storage rack system. Rack audits (safety checks) must be performed regularly  by a qualified inspector familiar with RMI design and safety standards. Food products must follow FDA regulations and use approved pallet racks.\n\nEuropean standards (EN 15 635) state that the racking user should consider ensuring that upright protection is provided where necessary. This is usually at end uprights located at the intersections of aisles and gangways. Upright protection can reduce the effects of an accidental collision and can prevent serious upright damage. They are however intended as sacrificial protection and will need to be replaced once they are damaged and ineffective.<ref>http://www.rackaware.co.uk</ref>\n\n== Load containment systems for pallet racks ==\n\nPallet racks are used throughout industry and distribution facilities for bulk storage of items. Generally, the items stored are boxed goods stacked on pallets which are placed on the rack. The pallets are accessed by some type of mechanized lifting and retrieval device. Sides of a pallet rack must be accessible by the mechanized device for storage and retrieval of goods. Thus these \"access sides\u201d must be open; entry to them cannot be permanently blocked/guarded.\n\nHowever, there are instances where an aisle way is designated along a row of pallet rack for pedestrian or other traffic and not for operational access by the lifting or retrieval device. When a pedestrian or other traffic aisle way is designated along a run of pallet racking it is good practice to guard the aisle way from a potential hazard created by objects that may fall from the pallet rack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=10685|title=General requirements for storage. - 1926.250 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-15}}</ref> In these situations, load containment systems are added to the designated aisle way side of the pallet rack to prevent or control any item from falling off of the back of the rack system or potentially falling on and injuring a person in the aisle way. Containment systems may also be placed between back to back installations to prevent items on one side of rack potentially pushing items off the adjacent rack.<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/pdfs/09ma042.pdf |title=Warehouse Worker Fatally Injured when Struck by Falling Metal Grates \u2013 Massachusetts |author= |authors= |first=|date=May 20, 2011 |publisher= Massachusetts Department of Public Health}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of load containment systems for pallet racking, steel mesh containment panels and netting containment systems.\n\n=== Netting containment systems ===\n[[File:Pallet Rack Netting System 1.png|thumb|Pallet rack protective netting system.]]\nLoad containment safety netting was originally adapted from cargo-based maritime netting used throughout the centuries for nautical trade and exploration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steinservicesupply.com/blog/why-you-need-safety-netting-in-your-warehouse|title=Why You Need Safety Netting in Your Warehouse {{!}} Stein Service & Supply|website=www.steinservicesupply.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-15}}</ref> Safety netting has found widespread industrial use in load containment, driven in part by the post-war expansion of warehouse distribution systems. Netting types of varying break-strength and deflection allowances can be used within a load containment netting system. Widely accepted as an alternative to metal or other solid barrier systems, load containment safety netting provides a light weight, high-strength, easily customizable means to protect goods and personnel while allowing airflow, humidity control and clear visibility within sectioned containment areas.\n\nNetting containment systems are used on rack bays or gravity-flow rack channels to contain loose or falling objects. Palletized parts or boxes can become dislodged during bay loading. Rack netting containment systems can be placed vertically at the front, or pick face, and/or at the rear sides of racking systems prevent dislodged objects or full pallets from falling. Netting containment systems can be applied across multiple bays or as single bay units and secured by varying fasteners determined by frequency of access, load requirements and net or load sizes. Actuating systems can also be found in current netting containment systems to allow remotely operated rack bay access by use of pull cords or other means. In addition to vertical placement, horizontal netting can also be utilized in rack systems to protect against objects falling from one level to another or into tunnel areas, and to provide barriers between storage between and rack supports.\n\n=== Steel mesh containment panels ===\n[[File:RackBack Pallet Rack Steel Mesh Containment Panels.jpg|thumb|Steel mesh containment panel system for pallet rack.]]\nAs the distribution industry grew, alternative methods were sought for containing items dislodged from palletized storage while stored on pallet rack systems. Distributors found steel wire mesh panels were a viable alternative to netting containment systems. The following are the two types of steel mesh containment panels used for pallet racking:\n* Framed steel wire mesh panels are constructed of steel wire mesh welded or woven into a square, diamond, or rectangular pattern. welded or otherwise fixed into a shaped steel frame. The panels are mechanically attached to the existing Pallet Rack uprights with brackets.

Wire mesh decking comes in various thicknesses and mesh dimensions. Wire mesh construction also allows for easy identification of shelf contents and prevents dirt and other debris from accumulating on the shelves because of the holes in the mesh.  Most wire mesh decking has U-shaped channel supports, also known as struts, to support the load. With this '''waterfall decking''', the wire mesh extends across the top and down the front of the beam to provide more support, and is more desirable in the marketplace. '''Reverse waterfall decking''' can provide containment of a loose product to prevent the product from falling behind the rack system. '''Lay-in decking''' rests inside the step of the beam, and wire mesh does not waterfall over the beam. Some types of decking are manufactured with solid metal instead of wire mesh. Even though the solid decking provides a greater distributed weight capacity, it is discouraged by fire inspectors because sprinkler systems cannot spray through the shelves to levels below.\n# {{anchor|G6|g6|footplates}}'''Footplates''', also known as footpads or baseplates, are at the base of columns and serve as anchors to give the rack more stability:  anchor bolts are inserted through the baseplate's holes to attach the column to the concrete floor. Footplates are made of thicker steel and in some geographic locations, they must be of a certain size and seismic rating. Footpads increase the pallet rack's overall stability and weight-bearing capacity.\n# {{anchor|G7|g7|shims}}'''Shims''' are used when the uprights are resting on uneven floors; the shims, equal in size to the base of the uprights, are installed beneath the uprights to level the rack.\n# {{anchor|G8|g8|rowspacers}}'''Row spacers''' are sometimes used if uprights are arranged in back-to-back rows; the spacers are mounted between adjacent columns to ensure that the rows are kept straight and to give the pallet racks even more strength and steadiness.\n# {{anchor|G9|g9|wallties}}'''Wall ties''' may be used for further support if the uprights are arranged in a row along a wall.\n# {{anchor|G10|g10|columnprotectors}}'''Column protectors''', also known as post protectors, are protective shields that can be installed around the base of an upright to minimize damage where forklifts might hit the upright. Damage to the base of a column can weaken the entire frame and could cause it to collapse. Column protectors are made of various materials such as polyethylene, ductile iron casting, and other durable materials.\n# {{anchor|G11|g11|guardrails}}'''Guard rails''' are installed to increase protection for upright columns and for human safety when platforms or steps are attached to pallet racks.\n\n'''Very narrow aisle''' otherwise known as '''VNA''', is the use of selective pallet racking in a tighter configuration to provide maximum space utilization within a storage facility. These systems typically operate in conjunction with wire-guided or rail-guided reach-truck systems. A wire-guided system consists of a wire embedded in the concrete floor that provides tracking for the reach-truck. A rail-guided system consists of angle iron bolted to the floor down the length of each row. Typically, the angle iron is 4\u201d by 3\u201d and \u00bc\u201d - \u215c\u201d inches thick. A distinct advantage of a [http://www.pdindustrial.co.uk/narrow-aisle-pallet-racking/ narrow aisle pallet racking] is fast picking without large aisles which results in improved use of space. When there is limited space, a compact storage method is ideal. Fully adjustable system flexibility and space saving aisles can be manipulated as one to give the greatest amount of pallet storage locations.\n\n==Other common types ==\n[[File:Industrial Park, Sackville, NB (45848977572).jpg|thumb|High bay racking supported cold storage facility, under construction in 2018]]\nMany types of pallet storage racks are available with different designs to fulfill specific functions or create specific advantages. To create the ideal pallet racking system, several considerations should be taken into account:\n\n*  Desired storage density\n*  Floor space and building height\n*  Placement of building doors and columns\n*  Inventory accessibility\n*  Inventory rotation\n*  Item/load size and weight\n*  Optimal storage design\n*  Cost of materials and installation\n\n'''Some of the most common types of pallet rack systems used include:'''\n# {{anchor|T4|t6|drive-in}}'''Drive-in'''<ref>{{US patent|3391795}}, Finlayson, T.J. 07/9/1968 \"Drive in pallet rack\"</ref> and '''drive-through''' (sometimes spelled Drive-thru) are storage rack configurations that allow the forklift to drive directly into the lane of stacked rows (called a bay). The difference between a drive-in and a drive-thru pallet rack system is simply whether the bays have an entry at only one end, or at both ends. Drive-in rack systems use a common entry and exit, while drive-thru systems have entry points at either end of the bay. Because a drive-in racking system has only one entrance, it uses what is called a LIFO (last in, first out) storage method. With only one entrance, the last pallet put into a row is necessarily the first one to be taken out. A drive-thru storage system, with two different entry points, can also use a FIFO (first in, first out) storage method. With a FIFO system, pallets are loaded in one end and are pushed back to the other end, where they are then at the front of the row on the opposite side. The first pallet put into such a row is the first one taken out at the other end. This system is advantageous for material with an expiration date or wherever shelf life is a major concern.\n# {{anchor|T5|t4|pushback}}'''Push-back pallet rack''' systems are designed around the principle of organizing space by depth rather than width. This depth arrangement greatly reduces aisle space and increases storage density. In this configuration, each bay can be up to six pallets deep; each pallet stored on wheeled carts that fit onto rails.<ref>{{US patent|4715765}}, Agnoff, Charles 12/29/1987, \"Gravity Flow Storage System\" Fig. 1 Shows Pallet on track and cart system.</ref>  The rails are slightly angled toward the load/unload side of the rack in order to take advantage of gravity, saving enormous amounts of energy for moving heavy pallets. When a forklift sets the pallet onto the cart, it drives forward and causes the pallet to bump the next pallet, causing the entire row of pallets to roll backwards. When removing a pallet from the front position the remaining pallets immediately stage themselves forward so that the next available pallet can be accessed.  Push back rack is a LIFO (last in, first out) storage system.\n# {{anchor|T6|t5|pallet flow}}'''Pallet flow''' systems are high density pallet storage systems that utilize depth to increase capacity.  This system uses a slightly inclined rail with rollers that allow pallets to move easily along the sloped plane. These systems are also called gravity flow\nor dynamic flow systems. The pallet flow system often has complex motion and braking systems to control the speed of the moving pallet.  Pallet flow racking systems are either a FIFO (first in, first out) or a LIFO (last in, first out) storage system.  If the system is loaded from the back and unloaded from the front, it is FIFO; if the system is loaded and unloaded from the front it is a LIFO system.\n# {{anchor|T7|t6|compact mobilized pallet racks}}'''Compact mobilized pallet racks''' (also known as motorized mobile pallet racks or mobile industrial rack system),<ref>{{US patent|20100200528A1}}, Tourdot, Matthew A 09/18/2007 \"Mobile Industrial Rack System\" Patent refers to this product.</ref> are designed to maximize the use of warehouse storage space.  This can reduce your pallet storage area in half, or double the capacity of your pallet rack storage in the same floor area.  It allocates space by converting static access aisles into productive storage space. By mounting rows of pallet racks onto heavy-duty rolling carriages and positioning them on floor tracks. Rows of pallet racks (up to 96\u2019 long) move sideways along the floor tracks creating a movable floating access aisle. Typical warehouse storage facilities may have dozens of static access aisles but only one or two forklifts capable of accessing stored materials.  This reduces the number of access aisles to match the velocity requirements of your storage area. Rows of pallet racks are moved by pushing a button or by remote control, which opens access aisles when and where they are needed.  \n[[Mobile shelving|Mobilized storage system]] has helped many organizations reduce or eliminate new building construction costs, auxiliary warehouses, building expansions, and decrease ongoing operational costs (lighting, energy, insurance) by redistributing the use of their storage floor space.\n\nSome disadvantages of high density pallet storage systems are; less access to all stock at any given moment (although if the stored product is all the same, it should not matter), and the expense of such systems.  Selective pallet rack systems are considerably less expensive per pallet position than their higher density counterparts.  In most medium to large facilities, however, high density pallet rack systems are essential, since they provide the efficiency of time and high cost facility space is better optimized.\n\nIdentifying the brand of racking systems is important to order compatible shelving or resell the racks. It is possible to differentiate between the many pallet rack brands by looking at the shape of the vertical beams, increments of height adjustment and the shape of the holes on the vertical beams.\n\n==Safety considerations==\n{{Howto|section|date=March 2016}} \nBecause of the size and weight of pallets, safety is relevant.\n\nWorkers must pay attention to any loose components in the pallet rack system, and also take the time to report any damage in the pallet rack frame. Such frame damage could cause the pallets to fall.\n\nIt is the owner's legal responsibility to communicate this important warning to all who are around storage racks: ''Never climb on racks during or after assembly. Storage racks are not designed to be stepped on or climbed on. A slip or fall may result in serious injury.'' 'It is especially important to have highly visible warning signs if the pallet rack system is used in retail environments, such as wholesale centers, where the public is present.\n\nQuality pallets that are not damaged must be used. To save money, or perhaps from neglectful management, some warehouses use pallets until they become faulty and dangerous. Regular inspection of pallets for broken or fractured planks or stringers, protruding nails, and missing support blocks is essential. Damaged pallets can cause loading and unloading problems; for example, loose stringers can get hung up on the pallet racks, which can cause loads to fall from high positions. Also, faulty pallets can cause obstruction problems in flow systems by jamming certain pallet rack designs.\n\nProper motorized equipment must be used for the application. Obstructing the end of aisles by staging pallets in these areas can cause severe and potentially fatal injuries and accidents. Overloading or exceeding the recommended load specifications for a racking system may cause a catastrophic failure of your storage rack system. Rack audits (safety checks) must be performed regularly  by a qualified inspector familiar with RMI design and safety standards. Food products must follow FDA regulations and use approved pallet racks.\n\nEuropean standards (EN 15 635) state that the racking user should consider ensuring that upright protection is provided where necessary. This is usually at end uprights located at the intersections of aisles and gangways. Upright protection can reduce the effects of an accidental collision and can prevent serious upright damage. They are however intended as sacrificial protection and will need to be replaced once they are damaged and ineffective.<ref>http://www.rackaware.co.uk</ref>\n\n== Load containment systems for pallet racks ==\n\nPallet racks are used throughout industry and distribution facilities for bulk storage of items. Generally, the items stored are boxed goods stacked on pallets which are placed on the rack. The pallets are accessed by some type of mechanized lifting and retrieval device. Sides of a pallet rack must be accessible by the mechanized device for storage and retrieval of goods. Thus these \"access sides\u201d must be open; entry to them cannot be permanently blocked/guarded.\n\nHowever, there are instances where an aisle way is designated along a row of pallet rack for pedestrian or other traffic and not for operational access by the lifting or retrieval device. When a pedestrian or other traffic aisle way is designated along a run of pallet racking it is good practice to guard the aisle way from a potential hazard created by objects that may fall from the pallet rack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=10685|title=General requirements for storage. - 1926.250 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-15}}</ref> In these situations, load containment systems are added to the designated aisle way side of the pallet rack to prevent or control any item from falling off of the back of the rack system or potentially falling on and injuring a person in the aisle way. Containment systems may also be placed between back to back installations to prevent items on one side of rack potentially pushing items off the adjacent rack.<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/pdfs/09ma042.pdf |title=Warehouse Worker Fatally Injured when Struck by Falling Metal Grates \u2013 Massachusetts |author= |authors= |first=|date=May 20, 2011 |publisher= Massachusetts Department of Public Health}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of load containment systems for pallet racking, steel mesh containment panels and netting containment systems.\n\n=== Netting containment systems ===\n[[File:Pallet Rack Netting System 1.png|thumb|Pallet rack protective netting system.]]\nLoad containment safety netting was originally adapted from cargo-based maritime netting used throughout the centuries for nautical trade and exploration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steinservicesupply.com/blog/why-you-need-safety-netting-in-your-warehouse|title=Why You Need Safety Netting in Your Warehouse {{!}} Stein Service & Supply|website=www.steinservicesupply.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-15}}</ref> Safety netting has found widespread industrial use in load containment, driven in part by the post-war expansion of warehouse distribution systems. Netting types of varying break-strength and deflection allowances can be used within a load containment netting system. Widely accepted as an alternative to metal or other solid barrier systems, load containment safety netting provides a light weight, high-strength, easily customizable means to protect goods and personnel while allowing airflow, humidity control and clear visibility within sectioned containment areas.\n\nNetting containment systems are used on rack bays or gravity-flow rack channels to contain loose or falling objects. Palletized parts or boxes can become dislodged during bay loading. Rack netting containment systems can be placed vertically at the front, or pick face, and/or at the rear sides of racking systems prevent dislodged objects or full pallets from falling. Netting containment systems can be applied across multiple bays or as single bay units and secured by varying fasteners determined by frequency of access, load requirements and net or load sizes. Actuating systems can also be found in current netting containment systems to allow remotely operated rack bay access by use of pull cords or other means. In addition to vertical placement, horizontal netting can also be utilized in rack systems to protect against objects falling from one level to another or into tunnel areas, and to provide barriers between storage between and rack supports.\n\n=== Steel mesh containment panels ===\n[[File:RackBack Pallet Rack Steel Mesh Containment Panels.jpg|thumb|Steel mesh containment panel system for pallet rack.]]\nAs the distribution industry grew, alternative methods were sought for containing items dislodged from palletized storage while stored on pallet rack systems. Distributors found steel wire mesh panels were a viable alternative to netting containment systems. The following are the two types of steel mesh containment panels used for pallet racking:\n* Framed steel wire mesh panels are constructed of steel wire mesh welded or woven into a square, diamond, or rectangular pattern. welded or otherwise fixed into a shaped steel frame. The panels are mechanically attached to the existing Pallet Rack uprights with brackets. The panels may be mounted flush with the rack uprights, or more commonly, offset by several inches to allow for load overhang.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.southwestsolutions.com/wire-partitions-machine-guarding/pallet-rack-safety-panels-guard-employees-from-falling-objects-osha-hazards|title=Pallet Rack Safety Panels Guard Employees From Falling Objects & OSHA Hazards|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n* Unframed steel wire mesh panels are constructed of welded wire mesh with a bond shear edge (no tails on the edge) mechanically attached to the existing upright posts by the way of stand-off brackets, or sleeves of various lengths.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pallet rack mover]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg412.pdf | author=Health and Safety Executive | title=Warehousing and storage: Keep it safe | accessdate=15 September 2017}}\n* {{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@storagespecialist/preventing-falling-item-from-pallet-racks-8a6ea96cc18f|title=Preventing Falling Items From Pallet Racks|last=Hogbin|first=John-Paul|date=2015-10-28|website=John-Paul Hogbin|access-date=2017-09-15}}\n* [http://www.mhi.org/ Material Handling Industry]\n* [http://www.mhi.org/progma Protective Guarding Manufacturers Association (ProGMA)]\n\n[[Category:Warehouses]]\n", "name_user": "Unraso", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFurther reading)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallet_racking"}

See [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]] for the general content of each topic. \nNote that, depending on the institution's stance, the weight and role assigned to Talmud particularly, and in fact textual-skills generally, will differ re men's yeshivot, and between ''midrashot''; \nsee [[Women in Judaism #Views on the education of women]] and [[Orthodox Judaism #Diversity]].\n\n[[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] aligned ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' include the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]], sister school of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]].\nTreatment of ''Tanakh'' and Jewish philosophy at these will typically be text-focused, built around ''[[chavruta]]''-based study as at yeshivot.\nAt some institutions, [[Talmud]] is studied directly, also as at men's {{lang|he-Latn|[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]}}, if less intensely\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Joseph Solovetchik]]).\nRegardless, Jewish law will generally be studied ''practically'', i.e. as opposed to following the complete derivation from Talmudic sources [[Yeshiva#Jewish_law|as at a men's Yeshiva]]\n(although see [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]], [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] and [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] where the treatment is Talmud-based).\n\nThe [[Haredi]] aligned ''midrashot'' - often referred to as \"seminaries\" - are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]], see for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]].\nThese are typically more conservative in their approach:\nselections from the Talmud may be studied, but only in the context of other classes - particular philosophy and Musar; \nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills, with content primarily delivered via lecture\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]]).\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hassidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned; their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \n\nIn the Religious Zionist community women often continue their studies at one of the religious affiliated [[List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges|teacher training colleges]], which offer a Torah-program in conjunction with the [[B.Ed.]] degree; \nspecializations are often offered in ''Tanakh''  or Jewish philosophy.\nOther institutions such as [[Machon Tal]], associated with the [[Jerusalem College of Technology]], similarly offer degrees in engineering or management. [[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nSeveral Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education. See also [[The Haredi Campus - The Academic College Ono]].\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'' in Israel for a year or more following high school, for example [[Midreshet HaRova]].\nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' also accommodate [[baal teshuva|the newly observant]]; well known are [[Neve Yerushalayim]] and [[Machon Roni]].\nMost ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' for English-speaking students are accredited by American colleges. Some ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' offer second-year programs with religious-studies classes in the morning and general-studies classes in the afternoons, allowing students to pursue a religious education and a general-studies education leading to a college degree simultaneously. \nThe Modern Orthodox [[Stern College for Women]]- in Manhattan, New York - combines Torah and University studies, as at Bar-Ilan;\nthe Haredi [[Touro_College_and_University_System#Undergraduate_schools|Lander College for Women]] similarly.\n<!-- \n==Coed high school Midrashot==\nWhile a [[Hebrew school]] program typically handles [[Jewish education]] for youths before their [[Bar/Bat Mitzvah]], students who wish to continue their Jewish education through high school enroll in a Midrasha.\n -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Beis Yaakov]]\n* [[List of Midrashot]]\n* [[Role of women in Judaism]]\n* [[Female seminary]]\n* [[Religious Zionism #Educational institutions]]\n* [[Haredi Judaism #Education]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n\n<!-- Categories -->\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Modern Orthodox Judaism]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Jewish schools for women]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStructure", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrasha"}

{"title_page": "Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation", "text_new": "[[File:Bell AH-1 Cobra flying head on.jpg|thumb|right|Masking their approach using trees, TOW-firing Cobras proved to be devastatingly effective anti-tank weapons.]] \n\nThe '''Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation''' was a series of [[military exercise]]s that tested the use of [[attack helicopter]]s against simulated [[Warsaw Pact]] formations. They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]] [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these comments home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref> This resulted in a complex design and development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US equipment that had been captured earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum. On 25 May, the battle opened in earnest. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets. The two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given the increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]] [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these comments home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref> This resulted in a complex design and development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US equipment that had been captured earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum. On 25 May, the battle opened in earnest. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets. The two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given the increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses.

The base design can be further altered and modified<ref>http://www.newsgeorgia.ge/v-gruzii-razrabotali-snajperskuyu-vintovku-sateravi/</ref>\n\n==Modularity==\nThe rifle design allows a multi-caliber setup with yet unspecified details. A total of 7 cartridge types can be fired with the weapon, ranging from [[.308 Win]] to [[.50 BMG]] giving it penetration capabilities against both soft and lightly armoured targets.\n\n==Accuracy==\nThe designer states an overall accuracy of 0.3 [[Minute of arc#Firearms|MOA]] field tested with bipod. Fixed may be more accurate.\n\n==Designation==\nThe name \"Satevari\" derives from a type of ceremonial Georgian dagger which is being carried together with a traditional national dress called [[Chokha]].

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

These narrations are typically placed during natural pauses in the audio, and sometimes during dialogue if deemed necessary.<ref name=\"definition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dcmp.org/descriptionkey/|title=Description Key for Educational Media|publisher=The Described and Captioned Media Program|date=November 4, 2008|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn [[museums]] or visual art exhibitions, audio described tours (or universally designed tours that include description or the augmentation of existing recorded programs on audio- or videotape), are used to provide access to visitors who are blind or have low vision.  Docents or tour guides can be trained to employ audio description in their presentations.{{citation needed lead|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn film and television, description is typically delivered via a secondary audio track. In North America, [[Second audio program]] (SAP) is typically used to deliver audio description by television broadcasters. To promote [[accessibility]], some countries (such as Canada and the United States) have implemented requirements for broadcasters to air specific quotas of programming containing audio description.\n\n==History==\n{{missing information|History in regards to theatrical use|date=April 2019}}\n[[Silent film|Silent films]] could naturally be enjoyed by the [[deaf]] due to the lack of spoken dialogue or sound whatsoever. The transition to \"[[talkies]]\" in the late 1920s displaced this audience, but resulted in a push to make them accessible to the [[visually impaired]].

It was developed in consultation with Dr. Margaret Pfanstiehl of [[Washington, D.C.]], who had performed descriptions at theatrical performances and had run a [[radio reading service]] known as the Washington Ear. After four years of development and on-air trials (which included a proof of concept that aired the descriptions on a [[radio station]] in simulcast with the television airing), WGBH officially launched audio description via 32 participating [[PBS]] member stations, beginning with the new season of ''[[American Playhouse]]'' on January 24, 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-12-29-8903210625-story.html|title=Words worth 1,000 pictures|last=Gibson|first=Gwen |website=Chicago Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/13/arts/new-tv-system-offers-descriptions-for-blind.html|title=New TV System Offers Descriptions for Blind|last=Molotsky|first=Irvin|date=1988-01-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=9EOEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT132&lpg=PT132&dq=%22Dr.+Margaret+Pfanstiehl%22&source=bl&ots=bXpDEXbNGY&sig=ACfU3U0Fa1IMSENbtalK3y2uQmrW0XKcaA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_6_-8jePhAhWyd98KHfhaAh4Q6AEwDXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Dr.%20Margaret%20Pfanstiehl%22&f=false|title=Disability and Digital Television Cultures: Representation, Access, and Reception|last=Ellis|first=Katie|date=2019-02-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317627845|language=en}}</ref> \n\nIn the 1990s at cinemas in California, [[Retinitis Pigmentosa International|RP International]] began to offer audio descriptions for theatrical films under the brand ''TheatreVision'', relayed via [[earpiece]]s to those who request it.

''DVS'' often is used to describe the product itself.\n\nIn 1985, [[PBS]] [[Network affiliate#Member stations|member]] [[television station]] [[WGBH-TV]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], began investigating uses for the new technology of [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic television broadcasting]], particularly [[multichannel television sound]] (MTS), which allowed for a third audio channel, called the ''[[Second audio program|Secondary Audio Program]]'' (''SAP''). With a history of developing [[closed captioning]] of programs for [[Hearing impairment|hearing-impaired]] viewers, WGBH considered the viability of using the new audio channel for narrated descriptions of key visual elements, much like those being done for live theatre in [[Washington, D.C.]], by Margaret Pfanstiehl, who had been experimenting with television description as part of her Washington Ear radio reading service.\n\nAfter reviewing and conducting various studies, which found that blind and visually impaired people were consuming more television than ever but finding the activity problematic (often relying on sighted family and friends to describe for them), WGBH consulted more closely with Pfanstiehl and her husband, Cody, and then conducted its first tests of DVS in Boston in 1986. These tests (broadcasting to local groups of people of various ages and visual impairments) and further study were successful enough to merit a grant from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] to complete plans to establish the DVS organization permanently in 1988. After national testing, more feedback, more development of description technique, and additional grants, DVS became a regular feature of selected PBS programming in 1990.<ref name=\"cronin\">[http://www2.edc.org/NCIP/library/v&c/cronin.htm The Development of the Descriptive Video Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Later, DVS became an available feature in some films and home videos, including DVDs.\n\n===Technique===\nDVS describers watch a program and write a script describing visual elements which are important in understanding what is occurring at the time and the plot as a whole. For example, in the opening credit sequence of the children's series ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' on PBS, the description has been performed as follows:\n<blockquote>\n\"Arthur is an 8-year-old aardvark. He wears round glasses with thick frames over his big eyes. He has two round ears on top of his oval-shaped head. He wears red sneakers and blue jeans, with a yellow sweater over a white shirt.\"<ref name=\"abcs\">[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/the-abcs-of-dvs.html WGBH - Media Access Group - ABCs of DVS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe length of descriptions and their placement by a producer into the program are largely dictated by what can fit in natural pauses in dialogue (other producers of description may have other priorities, such as synchronization with the timing of a described element's appearance, which differ from DVS's priority for detail).<ref name=\"avcanada\">[http://www.audiovisioncanada.com/ACCFMX/about.cfm About AudioVision<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Once recorded, placed and mixed with a copy of the original soundtrack, the DVS track is then \"laid back\" to the master tape on a separate audio track (for broadcast on the SAP) or to its own DVS master (for home video). For feature films, the descriptions are not mixed with the soundtrack, but kept separate as part of a [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] soundtrack.<ref name=\"dvs-faq\">[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/services/description/dvs-faq.html WGBH - Media Access Group - DVS FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===FCC involvement===\nWhen the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) started establishing various requirements for broadcasters in larger [[media market|markets]] to improve their accessibility to audiences with hearing and vision impairments<ref>http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/guides/mag_guide_vol3.html</ref>, DVS branched out to non-PBS programming, and soon description could be heard on the SAP for shows such as ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. However, a federal court ruled in 2002 that the Federal Communications Commission had exceeded its jurisdiction by requiring broadcasters in the top 25 markets to carry video description.\n\nSince that time, the amount of new DVS television programming in the United States declined, as did access to information regarding upcoming described programming, while broadcasters like ABC and Fox instead decided to devote their SAP channels to [[Spanish language]] [[Dub localization|dubbing tracks]] of their shows rather than DVS due to the technical limitations of the analog NTSC standard. Description by DVS and other producers was still available in a limited form on television (the greatest percentage of DVS programming is still on PBS).<ref name=\"pbs-sch\">[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/services/description/ontv/pbs-schedule.htm]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> WGBH's Media Access Group continues supporting description of feature films (known as DVS Theatrical)<ref name=\"mopix\">[http://ncam.wgbh.org/mopix/ MoPix \u2013 Motion Picture Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and DVS home videos/[[DVD]]s are available from WGBH as well as other vendors and libraries.<ref name=\"dvs-cat\">[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/dvs-home-video-catalogue.html WGBH - Media Access Group - DVS Home Video<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Commercial caption providers the [[National Captioning Institute]] and [[CaptionMax]] have also begun to describe programs. Benefit Media, Inc., a subsidiary of DuArt Film and Video in New York City provides DVS services to [[USA Network]]. For the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], [[NBC Olympics|NBC]] is providing description of events during the network's primetime block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/community/announcements/comcast-and-nbc-to-make-the-2016-summer-olympic-games-accessible-to-people-with-vision-loss-through-live-description/12|title=Comcast and NBC to Make the 2016 Summer Olympic Games Accessible to People with Vision Loss through Live Description|publisher=[[American Foundation for the Blind]]|accessdate=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808135514/http://www.afb.org/community/announcements/comcast-and-nbc-to-make-the-2016-summer-olympic-games-accessible-to-people-with-vision-loss-through-live-description/12|archive-date=8 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 reinstates the FCC's involvement in providing rules for video description. Under the rules, affiliates in the top 25 markets and the top five-rated cable networks will have to provide at least 50 hours of video described programming per quarter; the rules took effect on July 1, 2012.<ref name=source1/> However, this provision currently does not apply to [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming; notably, many programs which have audio description in their network runs, such as those produced by [[Twentieth Century Fox Television]], remove the DVS track for syndication, substituting in the Spanish dubbing track on SAP to reach more viewers, though as many stations affiliated with \"netlets\" like [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] are not under the video description provision, do not have SAP channels and thus, neither an audio description or Spanish dub track can be heard. In some markets where SAP is activated on affiliate stations though, The CW had provided a Spanish SAP dub for ''[[Jane the Virgin]]'' through the series' entire run, and audio description is available and passed through for their Saturday morning ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' [[E/I]] block, which is done for all of the blocks produced for the major broadcast networks by [[Litton Entertainment]]. In 2019, the first primetime series with DVS for the network, ''[[In the Dark (American TV series)|In the Dark]]'' (which has a blind protagonist), was launched (the series' description propagated to its Netflix run several weeks after it was placed on that service after the first season finale). MyNetworkTV has no provisions for audio description or language dub tracks, despite many of its scripted series having DVS tracks.\n\nOnline streaming services such as [[Hulu]] and the services of television networks themselves such as [[CBS All Access]] have yet to carry descriptive video service audio in most cases as they instead are currently focused on adding closed captioning to their libraries (the network app for ABC began to carry existing audio described shows in the fall of 2017). [[Netflix]] committed in April 2015 to begin audio description of their original series, starting with ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' (which features a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|blind protagonist]] with other heightened senses) and the remainder of their original programming in the next few months, making their goal in that timeframe, along with providing the DVS tracks of existing series in their library; however some platforms (mainly older versions for devices that are now unsupported) do not provide the alternate audio.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Netflix Begins Audio Description for Visually Impaired|publisher=Netflix corporate blog|date=14 April 2015|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/netflix-begins-audio-description-for-visually-impaired|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nABC, along with sister network [[Disney Channel]] has since added audio description to some of their programming (with a commensurate decline in Spanish-dubbed programming, though the [[ATSC]] standard allows more audio channels), but does not contract any of their shows to be described by the Media Access Group, instead going with commercial providers [[CaptionMax]] and [http://audioeyesllc.com/ Audio Eyes], though some special programming such as ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' and ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]'' is described by the Media Access Group under existing contracts with [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. NBC and their associated cable networks, along with outside productions by [[Universal Television]] such as ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' and ''[[The Mindy Project]]'', solely use CaptionMax for description services; Netflix also utilizes CaptionMax for their original series, while going per studio for acquired programming. Most scripted programming on Fox, except for the shows of [[Gordon Ramsay]] (''[[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'', ''[[Hotel Hell]]'' and ''[[Kitchen Nightmares]]'') is described by the Media Access Group; Ramsay's programs are contracted by his [[ITV Studios America|producing studio]] to have audio description done by Scottish-born voiceover artist [http://www.deyanaudio.com/femascottish.html Mhairi Morrison] with [http://www.descriptivevideoworks.com/ Descriptive Video Works]. Unique to most described shows, Fox's ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'' uses actress [[Adrienne Barbeau]] for their description. CBS's described shows all use the Media Access Group.\n\nSome shows have lost their DVS during their original network runs due to outside factors or complications. For instance, ''[[American Dad!]]'' had a two-season interregnum in part of season 12 and all of season 13 without any DVS service during its move from Fox to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in late 2014, before it returned in November 2016 for its fourteenth season. ''[[The Mindy Project]]'' lost DVS at the start of their fourth season upon the move to Hulu, which does not yet provide DVS service. [[Cartoon Network]] and their time-share partner [[Adult Swim]] began to pass-through DVS for their syndicated content in the last quarter of 2018.\n\n===Regular U.S. series with DVS available===\n'''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:'''<ref name=source1>{{cite web|title=Networks Set to Launch Video Descriptions|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/60097/networks-set-to-launch-video-descriptions|work=TVNewsCheck.com|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name=source2>{{cite web|title=Audio Description (Video Description) on TV|url=http://www.acb.org/adp/tv.html|work=The Audio Description Project|accessdate=August 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Audio Description|url=http://abc.go.com/audio-description|work=ABC.com|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n*''[[Beyond the Tank]]''\n*''[[Black-ish]]''\n*''[[Card Sharks]]'' (current primetime revival)\n*''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]''\n*''[[For the People (2018 TV series)|For the People]]''\n*''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]''\n*''[[Fresh Off the Boat]]''\n*''[[Jeopardy!

''DVS'' often is used to describe the product itself.\n\nIn 1985, [[PBS]] [[Network affiliate#Member stations|member]] [[television station]] [[WGBH-TV]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], began investigating uses for the new technology of [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic television broadcasting]], particularly [[multichannel television sound]] (MTS), which allowed for a third audio channel, called the ''[[Second audio program|Secondary Audio Program]]'' (''SAP''). With a history of developing [[closed captioning]] of programs for [[Hearing impairment|hearing-impaired]] viewers, WGBH considered the viability of using the new audio channel for narrated descriptions of key visual elements, much like those being done for live theatre in [[Washington, D.C.]], by Margaret Pfanstiehl, who had been experimenting with television description as part of her Washington Ear radio reading service.\n\nAfter reviewing and conducting various studies, which found that blind and visually impaired people were consuming more television than ever but finding the activity problematic (often relying on sighted family and friends to describe for them), WGBH consulted more closely with Pfanstiehl and her husband, Cody, and then conducted its first tests of DVS in Boston in 1986. These tests (broadcasting to local groups of people of various ages and visual impairments) and further study were successful enough to merit a grant from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] to complete plans to establish the DVS organization permanently in 1988. After national testing, more feedback, more development of description technique, and additional grants, DVS became a regular feature of selected PBS programming in 1990.<ref name=\"cronin\">[http://www2.edc.org/NCIP/library/v&c/cronin.htm The Development of the Descriptive Video Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Later, DVS became an available feature in some films and home videos, including DVDs.\n\n===Technique===\nDVS describers watch a program and write a script describing visual elements which are important in understanding what is occurring at the time and the plot as a whole. For example, in the opening credit sequence of the children's series ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' on PBS, the description has been performed as follows:\n<blockquote>\n\"Arthur is an 8-year-old aardvark. He wears round glasses with thick frames over his big eyes. He has two round ears on top of his oval-shaped head. He wears red sneakers and blue jeans, with a yellow sweater over a white shirt.\"<ref name=\"abcs\">[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/the-abcs-of-dvs.html WGBH - Media Access Group - ABCs of DVS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe length of descriptions and their placement by a producer into the program are largely dictated by what can fit in natural pauses in dialogue (other producers of description may have other priorities, such as synchronization with the timing of a described element's appearance, which differ from DVS's priority for detail).<ref name=\"avcanada\">[http://www.audiovisioncanada.com/ACCFMX/about.cfm About AudioVision<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Once recorded, placed and mixed with a copy of the original soundtrack, the DVS track is then \"laid back\" to the master tape on a separate audio track (for broadcast on the SAP) or to its own DVS master (for home video). For feature films, the descriptions are not mixed with the soundtrack, but kept separate as part of a [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] soundtrack.<ref name=\"dvs-faq\">[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/services/description/dvs-faq.html WGBH - Media Access Group - DVS FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===FCC involvement===\nWhen the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) started establishing various requirements for broadcasters in larger [[media market|markets]] to improve their accessibility to audiences with hearing and vision impairments<ref>http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/guides/mag_guide_vol3.html</ref>, DVS branched out to non-PBS programming, and soon description could be heard on the SAP for shows such as ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. However, a federal court ruled in 2002 that the Federal Communications Commission had exceeded its jurisdiction by requiring broadcasters in the top 25 markets to carry video description.\n\nSince that time, the amount of new DVS television programming in the United States declined, as did access to information regarding upcoming described programming, while broadcasters like ABC and Fox instead decided to devote their SAP channels to [[Spanish language]] [[Dub localization|dubbing tracks]] of their shows rather than DVS due to the technical limitations of the analog NTSC standard. Description by DVS and other producers was still available in a limited form on television (the greatest percentage of DVS programming is still on PBS).<ref name=\"pbs-sch\">[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/services/description/ontv/pbs-schedule.htm]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> WGBH's Media Access Group continues supporting description of feature films (known as DVS Theatrical)<ref name=\"mopix\">[http://ncam.wgbh.org/mopix/ MoPix \u2013 Motion Picture Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and DVS home videos/[[DVD]]s are available from WGBH as well as other vendors and libraries.<ref name=\"dvs-cat\">[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/dvs-home-video-catalogue.html WGBH - Media Access Group - DVS Home Video<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Commercial caption providers the [[National Captioning Institute]] and [[CaptionMax]] have also begun to describe programs.

Under the rules, affiliates in the top 25 markets and the top five-rated cable networks will have to provide at least 50 hours of video described programming per quarter; the rules took effect on July 1, 2012.<ref name=source1/> However, this provision currently does not apply to [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming; notably, many programs which have [[audio description]] in their network runs, such as those produced by [[Twentieth Century Fox Television]], remove the DVS track for syndication, substituting in the Spanish dubbing track on SAP to reach more viewers, though as many stations affiliated with \"netlets\" like [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] are not under the video description provision, do not have SAP channels and thus, neither an audio description or Spanish dub track can be heard. In some markets where SAP is activated on affiliate stations though, The CW does provide a Spanish SAP dub for ''[[Jane the Virgin]]'' and audio description is available and passed through for their Saturday morning ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' [[E/I]] block, which is done for all of the blocks produced for the major broadcast networks by [[Litton Entertainment]]. In 2019, the first primetime series with DVS for the network, ''[[In the Dark (American TV series)|In the Dark]]'' (which has a blind protagonist), was launched (the series' description propagated to its Netflix run several weeks after it was placed on that service after the first season finale). MyNetworkTV has no provisions for audio description or language dub tracks.\n\nOnline streaming services such as [[Hulu]] and the services of television networks themselves such as [[CBS All Access]] have yet to carry descriptive video service audio in most cases as they instead are currently focused on adding closed captioning to their libraries (the network app for ABC began to carry existing audio described shows in the fall of 2017). [[Netflix]] committed in April 2015 to begin audio description of their original series, starting with ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' (which features a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|blind protagonist]] with other heightened senses) and the remainder of their original programming in the next few months, making their goal in that timeframe, along with providing the DVS tracks of existing series in their library; however some platforms (mainly older versions for devices that are now unsupported) do not provide the alternate audio.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Netflix Begins Audio Description for Visually Impaired|publisher=Netflix corporate blog|date=14 April 2015|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/netflix-begins-audio-description-for-visually-impaired|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nABC, along with sister network [[Disney Channel]] has since added audio description to some of their programming (with a commensurate decline in Spanish-dubbed programming, though the [[ATSC]] standard allows more audio channels), but does not contract any of their shows to be described by the Media Access Group, instead going with commercial providers [[CaptionMax]] and [http://audioeyesllc.com/ Audio Eyes], though some special programming such as ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' and ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]'' is described by the Media Access Group under existing contracts with [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. NBC and their associated cable networks, along with outside productions by [[Universal Television]] such as ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' and ''[[The Mindy Project]]'', solely use CaptionMax for description services; Netflix also utilizes CaptionMax for their original series, while going per studio for acquired programming. Most scripted programming on Fox, except for the shows of [[Gordon Ramsay]] (''[[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'', ''[[Hotel Hell]]'' and ''[[Kitchen Nightmares]]'') is described by the Media Access Group; Ramsay's programs are contracted by his [[ITV Studios America|producing studio]] to have audio description done by Scottish-born voiceover artist [http://www.deyanaudio.com/femascottish.html Mhairi Morrison] with [http://www.descriptivevideoworks.com/ Descriptive Video Works]. Unique to most described shows, Fox's ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'' uses actress [[Adrienne Barbeau]] for their description. CBS's described shows all use the Media Access Group.\n\nSome shows have lost their DVS during their original network runs due to outside factors or complications. For instance, ''[[American Dad!]]'' had a two-season interregnum in part of season 12 and all of season 13 without any DVS service during its move from Fox to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in late 2014, before it returned in November 2016 for its fourteenth season. ''[[The Mindy Project]]'' lost DVS at the start of their fourth season upon the move to Hulu, which does not yet provide DVS service. [[Cartoon Network]] and their time-share partner [[Adult Swim]] began to pass-through DVS for their syndicated content in the last quarter of 2018.\n\n===Regular U.S. series with DVS available===\n'''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:'''<ref name=source1>{{cite web|title=Networks Set to Launch Video Descriptions|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/60097/networks-set-to-launch-video-descriptions|work=TVNewsCheck.com|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name=source2>{{cite web|title=Audio Description (Video Description) on TV|url=http://www.acb.org/adp/tv.html|work=The Audio Description Project|accessdate=August 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Audio Description|url=http://abc.go.com/audio-description|work=ABC.com|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n*''[[Beyond the Tank]]''\n*''[[Black-ish]]''\n*''[[Card Sharks]]'' (current primetime revival)\n*''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]''\n*''[[For the People (2018 TV series)|For the People]]''\n*''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]''\n*''[[Fresh Off the Boat]]''\n*''[[Jeopardy!
