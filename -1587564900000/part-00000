Hank spent his summers in [[Upperville, Virginia]] with his grandparents, and considered the Commonwealth his home state. His great, great, great grandfather was [[William Buckland]], the master woodcarver of [[Gunston Hall]] and architect of colonial houses in Maryland. Mann attended [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], then the [[University of Virginia]], from which he received both undergraduate and law (1931) degrees, and was a member of the [[Raven Society]]). In 1970, the university awarded him its outstanding alumnus award.\n\nHe married Betty Hart Mann on March 31, 1934, who survived him, as did their two daughters and five grandchildren.\n\n==Legal and military careers==\nAfter graduation, Mann specialized in banking law and wrote a book and several articles.\n\nDuring World War II, beginning in 1942 Mann organized the 113 Virginia Protective Force in Arlington (to replace the State Guard which had been called into active service) and served as its Captain, protecting the bridges across the Potomac River as well as National Airport, among other strategic locations. He entered the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] in 1944 as a Lieutenant and served at [[Mindanao]] in the [[Philippines]], receiving a citation for his combat activity.\n\n==Political career==\n\nMann began his political career as delegate to the Arlington Federation of Civic Associations, and as chairman of the Arlington County Democratic Committee. He also served as President of the Northern Virginia Chapter of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, which helped organize support that eventually led to the 1953 recommendation to open George Mason College as a two-year institution of higher education.\n\nMann served (part-time) in the [[Virginia General Assembly]], representing Arlington as a delegate from 1954 until 1970. In his last seven terms, Mann sponsored more bills than any other member of the General Assembly, and passed more bills than any other Northern Virginia delegate.\n\nMann was the named plaintiff in the reapportionment case [[Davis v. Mann]], concerning the reapportionment after the 1960 census and during Virginia's [[Massive Resistance]] crisis (although Arlington acceded to a court order in 1959). Other named plaintiffs were [[Kathryn H. Stone]] also of Arlington County, and [[John A. K. Donovan]] and [[John C. Webb]] of Fairfax County. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ultimately decided the case in favor of Mann and his fellow northern Virginians in 1964. During the resulting reapportionment, Northern Virginia received five more delegates in the General Assembly, as well as one additional state senator.\n\nMann considered his greatest legislative accomplishment the creation of [[George Mason University]] in northern Virginia, and he sponsored the bills that created George Mason College as a branch of the University of Virginia and later elevating it to a four-year university with the right to grant degrees and offer graduate programs. He also served on its first Board of Control, and later on its Board of Visitors (1975\u201377). Other education-related bills Mann sponsored created Virginia's State Educational Assistance Authority, and made millions of dollars available to construct public schools throughout the commonwealth. He also sponsored bills to provide for statewide driver education and medical assistance to the elderly, as well as to ban obscene literature and billboards on Virginia's highways. Mann led efforts to complete Interstate 66 inside the beltway, despite opposition from within Arlington.\n\nIn the March 1969 special election after the death of his mentor, State Senator [[Charles R. Fenwick]], Mann ran for that seat, but unexpectedly lost to Republican [[M. Patton Echols]], whom he had defeated during his 1963 delegate reelection campaign.<ref>https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/09/Candidate_History.pdf</ref> This proved to be the start of a Republican tide that devastated the local Democratic party that fall.

However, in 1971 his fellow delegate [[Mary A. R. Marshall]] and fellow Democrat [[John L.

A music talent contest with viewer voting and reality show elements that originated [[Endemol]]'s ''[[Star Academy]]'' franchise, the show aims to find the country's next solo singing sensation.\n\n''Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo'' (also known as ''OT'') first aired in 2001. On its first run between 2001 and 2004, three series were aired on [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]], which also served as the national final to select the [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest]]. The first series of ''OT'' was particularly successful in ratings, becoming one of the most popular shows in the history of Spanish television and featuring singers that went on to enjoy long-term recognition from the public: notably [[Rosa L\u00f3pez]], [[David Bisbal]], [[David Bustamante]] or [[Chenoa]]. After the third series, TVE decided not to renew the show and its rights were acquired by [[Telecinco]], which aired series 5\u20138 of the series. Series 8 in 2011 was cancelled due to poor ratings and its finale was rushed as a result.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, [[RTVE]] approved a new series of the talent show produced by Gestmusic Endemol, returning to TVE after 13 years.

Once a week, the contestants have to face a prime time show, where they sing a [[cover version]] of a popular song they have prepared during the week before, as well as recapping their trials and tribulations at The Academy from the past week.

[[talent show]] which first aired on [[Spain]]'s [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]] network in 2001. A music talent contest with viewer voting and reality show elements that originated [[Endemol]]'s ''[[Star Academy]]'' franchise, the show aims to find the country's next solo singing sensation.\n\n''Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo'' (also known as ''OT'') first aired in 2001. On its first run between 2001 and 2004, three series were aired on [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]], which also served as the national final to select the [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest]]. The first series of ''OT'' was particularly successful in ratings, becoming one of the most popular shows in the history of Spanish television and featuring singers that went on to enjoy long-term recognition from the public: notably [[Rosa L\u00f3pez]], [[David Bisbal]], [[David Bustamante]] or [[Chenoa]]. After the third series, TVE decided not to renew the show and its rights were acquired by [[Telecinco]], which aired series 5\u20138 of the series. Series 8 in 2011 was cancelled due to poor ratings and its finale was rushed as a result.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, [[RTVE]] approved a new series of the talent show produced by Gestmusic Endemol, returning to TVE after 13 years. The total cost of the series was \u20ac10.2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtve.es/television/20170426/operacion-triunfo-vuelve-1-16-anos-despues-su-estreno-tve/1532100.shtml|title='Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo' vuelve a La 1, 16 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno en TVE|date=April 26, 2017|website=RTVE.es}}</ref> Due to its ratings success, it was renewed for a further series.<ref name=\"OT2018\">{{cite news|url= http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/77319/tve-confirma-ot-2018-renovando-formato-nueva-edicion/|title= TVE confirma 'OT 2018', renovando el formato por una nueva edici\u00f3n|date= 28 February 2018|newspaper= FormulaTV.com}}</ref> This was the second most successful edition of the program to date,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltelevisero.com/2017/12/ha-superado-ot-2017-como-fenomeno-social-a-ot-1/|title=\u00bfHa superado 'OT 2017' a 'OT 1'?}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/play/television/noticias/abci-claves-convertido-2017-fenomeno-201801040013_noticia.html|title=Las claves que han convertido \"OT 2017\" en un fen\u00f3meno|date=January 3, 2018|website=abc}}</ref> artists like [[Aitana (singer)|Aitana]], [[Ana Guerra]], [[Amaia (singer)|Amaia]], [[Alfred Garc\u00eda]], [[Cepeda (singer)|Luis Cepeda]], [[Miriam Rodr\u00edguez]] or [[Lola \u00cdndigo]] have emerged from this edition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/es/actualidad/tv/a14404254/ot-2017-critica-fenomeno-audiencia/|title=\u00bfVirtuosismo o caricatura?

Once a week, the contestants have to face a prime time show, where they sing a [[cover version]] of a popular song they have prepared during the week before, as well as recapping their trials and tribulations at The Academy from the past week.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.

Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Some non-religious couples get married by a government official, such as a [[Celebrant (Australia)|civil celebrant]], judge, mayor, or [[Justice of the peace]].\n\n==Civil==\nIn the USA a marriage officiant is a civil officer such as a justice of the peace who performs acts of [[marriage]] or [[civil union]]. Their main responsibility is to witness the consent of the intended spouses for the wedding license and hence validate the marriage or civil union for legal purposes.\n\n==Religious==\n*Religious weddings are officiated by clergy people: \n*Christianity:\n**Catholic - [[Priest]]\n**Protestant - [[Minister (Christianity)]]\n*Other Faiths:\n**Hindu - [[Pujari]]\n**Islamic - [[Imam]]\n**Jewish - [[Rabbi]]\n\nThe officiant's duties and responsibilities, as well as who may be an officiant vary among jurisdictions.<ref>[http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/English/publications/generale/celebrant-a.htm Officiant's regulations in Quebec] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102203112/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/celebrant-a.htm |date=2007-01-02 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.dhs.ca.gov/hisp/chs/OVR/Marriage/FAQ.htm Officiant's FAQ in California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201111435/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/hisp/chs/OVR/Marriage/FAQ.htm |date=2006-12-01 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://roseministries.org/state_faq.php |title=FAQ Officiating Weddings throughout the United States, with links to State Code Sections |access-date=2007-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107045652/http://roseministries.org/state_faq.php |archive-date=2016-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==By country==\n===United States===\n{{Further|Officiant}}\nIn the United States, Canada and several other countries around the world, a '''celebrant''' is a person who performs religious or secular [[celebrancy]] services for weddings, funerals, child namings, coming of age ceremonies, and other rituals.\n\nMost celebrants are ordained clergy (such as a Christian [[pastor]]), while some are legal officials (usually (in some states) civil celebrants or judges). In [[Humanism|Humanist]] weddings, a [[Humanist officiant]] presides.\n\nCelebrants may perform alternative and nontraditional [[ceremony|ceremonies]] in places, and under circumstances where mainstream religious [[clergy]] will not. Some celebrants perform [[same-sex weddings]] and [[commitment ceremonies]]. Celebrants, also called [[officiant]]s, often perform ceremonies in parks, on beaches, on mountains, on boats, on hiking trails, in hotels, in banquet halls, in private homes, and many other places.\n\nLaws in each state of the United States vary about who has the ability to perform wedding ceremonies, but celebrants or officiants are usually categorized as \"clergy\" and have the same rights and responsibilities as ordained clergy. There is some controversy over whether these laws promote religious privilege that is incompatible with the United States Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/08/21/this-non-profit-is-fighting-give-non-religious-couples-more-choice-who-marries-them-texas-just-dealt-them-setback/|title=This nonprofit is fighting to give nonreligious couples more choice in who marries them. Texas just dealt them a setback.|author=Hannah Natanson|date=2019-08-21|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, celebrants are professional ceremony officiants who believe in the power and effectiveness of ceremony and ritual to serve basic needs of society and the individual. They collaborate with their clients to create and perform personalised ceremonies that reflect the client\u2019s beliefs, philosophy of life, and personality, not the celebrant\u2019s.\n\n===Scotland===\nIn [[Scotland]], since a June 2005 ruling by the Registrar General, humanist weddings are now legal, thanks to a campaign by the [[Humanist Society Scotland]]. [[Scotland]] is the only part of the [[United Kingdom]] where Humanist weddings are recognised as legal by the state and is only one of eight countries in the world where Humanist weddings are legally recognised, the others as of 2017 are: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and some states of the [[United States of America]].\n\nCelebrants differ from [[Chaplains]] in that Celebrants serve the unaffiliated public at large, while Chaplains are usually employed by an institution such as a hospital or other health care facility, the military, etc. However some celebrants of [[Humanist Society Scotland]] perform [[Chaplain]] duties at Scottish education establishments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Humanist Chaplain|url=http://www.gcu.ac.uk/student/faith/chaplains/humanistchaplain/|publisher=Glasgow Caledonian University|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Celebrant (Australia)}}\nIn Australia, Celebrants have a slightly different role, as regulated by local and national laws.\n\n== \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 ==\n[[File:Ev Stadtkirche

In [[Humanism|Humanist]] weddings, a [[Humanist officiant]] presides.\n\nCelebrants may perform alternative and nontraditional [[ceremony|ceremonies]] in places, and under circumstances where mainstream religious [[clergy]] will not. Some celebrants perform [[same-sex weddings]] and [[commitment ceremonies]]. Celebrants, also called [[officiant]]s, often perform ceremonies in parks, on beaches, on mountains, on boats, on hiking trails, in hotels, in banquet halls, in private homes, and many other places.\n\nLaws in each state of the United States vary about who has the ability to perform wedding ceremonies, but celebrants or officiants are usually categorized as \"clergy\" and have the same rights and responsibilities as ordained clergy. There is some controversy over whether these laws promote religious privilege that is incompatible with the United States Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/08/21/this-non-profit-is-fighting-give-non-religious-couples-more-choice-who-marries-them-texas-just-dealt-them-setback/|title=This nonprofit is fighting to give nonreligious couples more choice in who marries them.

They collaborate with their clients to create and perform personalised ceremonies that reflect the client\u2019s beliefs, philosophy of life, and personality, not the celebrant\u2019s.\n\n===Scotland===\nIn [[Scotland]], since a June 2005 ruling by the Registrar General, humanist weddings are now legal, thanks to a campaign by the [[Humanist Society Scotland]]. [[Scotland]] is the only part of the [[United Kingdom]] where Humanist weddings are recognised as legal by the state and is only one of eight countries in the world where Humanist weddings are legally recognised, the others as of 2017 are: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and some states of the [[United States of America]].\n\nCelebrants differ from [[Chaplains]] in that Celebrants serve the unaffiliated public at large, while Chaplains are usually employed by an institution such as a hospital or other health care facility, the military, etc. However some celebrants of [[Humanist Society Scotland]] perform [[Chaplain]] duties at Scottish education establishments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Humanist Chaplain|url=http://www.gcu.ac.uk/student/faith/chaplains/humanistchaplain/|publisher=Glasgow Caledonian University|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Celebrant (Australia)}}\nIn Australia, Celebrants have a slightly different role, as regulated by local and national laws.\n\n==By faith==\n[[File:Ev Stadtkirche Ravensburg innen.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Lutheran]] minister in Germany marries a young couple.]]\n\n===Christianity===\n{{Further|Marriage#Christianity}}\n\n====Catholicism====\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], it is the bride and groom who perform the [[Catholic marriage|Sacrament of Matrimony]] (marriage), but a marriage can only be valid if the Church has a witness at the wedding ceremony whose function is to question the couple to ensure that they have no obstacle to marriage (such as an [[Annulment|un-annulled]] previous marriage or certain undisclosed facts between the couple) and that they are freely choosing to wed each other.\n\nAll ordained clergy (i.e. a [[deacon]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], or [[bishop]]) may witness the wedding ceremony itself, though usually the wedding ceremony occurs during a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], which deacons lack the authority or ability to celebrate; however, in weddings that take place inside Mass, the deacon may still serve as the witness to the wedding, provided that a priest or bishop celebrates the Mass; and in weddings that take place outside Mass (which usually occurs in a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Christian or, less often, non-Catholic), the ceremony is the same for deacons, priests, and bishops (with few or no changes).\n\n====Protestantism====\nProtestant weddings are conducted by a minister or pastor, depending on Christian denomination.\n\n====Quaker====\nIn [[Quaker]] weddings the couple marry each other with no third party officiating.\n\n===Islam===\nIslamic weddings are performed by Imams.\n\n===Judaism===\n{{main|Jewish wedding}}\nIn [[Judaism]], a [[Rabbi]] officiates Jewish weddings. However, the Rabbi's function is to ensure that the Jewish religious laws of the wedding ceremony are followed, particularly making sure that the Jewish witnesses are valid.  The Rabbi traditionally recites the blessing for the ceremony on behalf of the groom, although in ancient times the groom would have recited this blessing.\n\n===Non-religious===\n====Non-denominational====\nSome organizations have limited or no requirements for ordination, like [[American Marriage Ministries]] and the [[Universal Life Church]]. Such organizations may be known as [[ordination mill]]s, however in most cases, their ordinations provide the same legal standing as mainstream officiants, and marriage licenses signed such organizations are valid and recognized.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/fashion/05marry.html|title=Great Wedding!
