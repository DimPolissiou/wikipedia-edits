They were used extensively in [[Great Britain]], the [[Royal Navy]] producing a steady supply of ships too worn-out to use in combat, but still afloat.  Their widespread use was a result of the large number of French sailors captured during the [[Seven Years' War]], and continued throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[French Revolutionary Wars]] a half-century later. By 1814 there were eighteen prison hulks operating at Portsmouth, sixteen at Plymouth and ten at Chatham.<ref name=Gardiner/>\n\nPrison hulks were also convenient for holding civilian prisoners, commencing in Britain in 1776 when the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] prevented the sending of convicts to North America. Instead, increasingly large numbers of British convicts were held aboard hulks in the major seaports and landed ashore in daylight hours for manual labour such as harbor dredging.<ref name=Gardiner/> From 1786 prison hulks were also used as temporary ''gaols'' (jails) for convicts being [[Penal transportation|transported]] to [[Australia]].\n\n==Powder hulk==\nA '''powder hulk''' was a hulk used to store [[gunpowder]]. The hulk was a floating warehouse which could be moved as needed to simplify the transfer of gunpowder to warships.  Its location, away from land, also reduced the possible damage from an explosion.\n\n==Salvage pontoon==\n[[Image:17th century salvaging.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A wide noose made of thick rope with anchors attached to it and two floating wooden ships overlaid with heavy beams with ropes hanging down from them|Illustration from a treatise on salvaging from 1734, showing the traditional method of raising a wreck with the help of [[anchor]]s and hulks as [[Floats (nautical)|pontoon]]s]]\n\nHulks were used in pairs during salvage operations. By passing heavy cables under a wreck and connecting them to two hulks, a wreck could be raised using the lifting force of the tide or by changing the buoyancy of the hulks.\n\n==Coal hulk==\nService as a coal hulk was usually, but not always, a ship's last.\n\nOf the fate of the fast and elegant [[clipper|clipper ships]], William L. Carothers wrote, \"Clippers functioned well as [[barges]]; their fine ends made for little resistance when under tow ... The ultimate degradation awaited a barge. There was no way up, only down-- down to the category of coal hulks ... Having strong solid bottoms ... they could handle the great weight of bulk coal which filled their holds.

The receiving ship was part of the solution; it was difficult to get off the ship without being detected, and most seamen of the era did not know how to swim.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organisation 1793-1815|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|year=2012|page=144, 189|isbn=9781591146124}}</ref>\n\nReceiving ships were typically older vessels that could still be kept afloat, but were obsolete or no longer seaworthy. The practice was especially common in the age of wooden ships, since the old hulls would remain afloat for many years in relatively still waters after they had become too weak to withstand the rigors of the open ocean.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}\n\nReceiving ships often served as floating hospitals as many were assigned in locations without shore-based station hospitals.  Often the afloat surgeon would take up station on the receiving ship.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Prison hulk===\n[[Image:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|Her front line days over, [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|HMS ''Temeraire'']] served as a [[prison ship|prison hulk]], [[barracks ship|receiving ship]], [[Depot ship|victualing depot]], and finally a [[guard ship]] before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] and sold to the [[Ship breaking|breakers]].]]\n{{Main|Prison ship}}\nA '''prison hulk''' was a hulk used as a [[Prison ship|floating prison]].  They were used extensively in [[Great Britain]], the [[Royal Navy]] producing a steady supply of ships too worn-out to use in combat, but still afloat.  Their widespread use was a result of the large number of French sailors captured during the [[Seven Years' War]], and continued throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[French Revolutionary Wars]] a half-century later. By 1814 there were eighteen prison hulks operating at Portsmouth, sixteen at Plymouth and ten at Chatham.<ref name=Gardiner/>\n\nPrison hulks were also convenient for holding civilian prisoners, commencing in Britain in 1776 when the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] prevented the sending of convicts to North America. Instead, increasingly large numbers of British convicts were held aboard hulks in the major seaports and landed ashore in daylight hours for manual labour such as harbor dredging.<ref name=Gardiner/> From 1786 prison hulks were also used as temporary ''gaols'' (jails) for convicts being [[Penal transportation|transported]] to [[Australia]].\n\n==Powder hulk==\nA '''powder hulk''' was a hulk used to store [[gunpowder]]. The hulk was a floating warehouse which could be moved as needed to simplify the transfer of gunpowder to warships.  Its location, away from land, also reduced the possible damage from an explosion.\n\n==Salvage pontoon==\n[[Image:17th century salvaging.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A wide noose made of thick rope with anchors attached to it and two floating wooden ships overlaid with heavy beams with ropes hanging down from them|Illustration from a treatise on salvaging from 1734, showing the traditional method of raising a wreck with the help of [[anchor]]s and hulks as [[Floats (nautical)|pontoon]]s]]\n\nHulks were used in pairs during salvage operations. By passing heavy cables under a wreck and connecting them to two hulks, a wreck could be raised using the lifting force of the tide or by changing the buoyancy of the hulks.\n\n==Coal hulk==\nService as a coal hulk was usually, but not always, a ship's last.\n\nOf the fate of the fast and elegant [[clipper|clipper ships]], William L. Carothers wrote, \"Clippers functioned well as [[barges]]; their fine ends made for little resistance when under tow ... The ultimate degradation awaited a barge. There was no way up, only down-- down to the category of coal hulks ... Having strong solid bottoms ... they could handle the great weight of bulk coal which filled their holds. It was a grimy, untidy, unglamorous end for any vessel which had seen the glory days.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Crothers\n  | first = William L\n  | title = The American-built clipper ship, 1850-1856 : characteristics, construction, and details\n  | publisher = International Marine\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = Camden, ME\n  | isbn = 0-07-014501-6}}</ref>\n\nThe famed clipper ''[[Red Jacket (clipper)|Red Jacket]]'' ended her days as a coaling hulk in the Cape Verde Islands.\n\n{{quote|One by one these old Champions of the Seas disappeared.

Ever and anon as if to emphasize her newly acquired importance, the tug would bury the old-time [[Square rig|square-rigged]] beauty in a cloud of filthy smoke. Imagine the feelings of an ex-Cape Horner under such conditions! There should have been a ''Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Old Clippers''.

He played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, winning four [[Serie A]] titles, among other trophies; he is mainly remembered for his time with [[Inter Milan|Inter]], where he won several trophies, including a league title and the [[UEFA Cup]]. At international level, he represented the [[Italy national football team]] in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], helping the team to a third-place finish in the latter tournament.\n\nHe currently works as a pundit for [[Mediaset]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/calcio/championsleague/champions-league-lione-juventus-su-canale-5_1123044-201602a.shtml|title=Champions League: Lione-Juventus su Canale 5|publisher=Mediaset|language=Italian|date=17 October 2016|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nDuring his career, Serena played for a number of Italian clubs: Montebelluna, [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]], [[Como Calcio 1907|Como]], [[A.S. Bari|Bari]], [[A.C. Milan]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[Torino F.C.|Torino]]. Born in Montebelluna, in the province of Treviso, he spent his youth playing with his hometown side's youth academy. After making his professional debut with the Montebelluna senior team in [[Serie D]] in 1977, and scoring 9 goals in 29 appearances during his debut season, Serena first joined Inter the [[1978\u201379 Serie A|following season]] in 1978; he made his [[Serie A]] debut later that year, on 19 November, in a 4\u20130 home win over [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], marking the occasion with his first Serie A goal, and also making another league appearance later that the season. Although he initially won the [[Coppa Italia|1981\u201382 Coppa Italia]] during his first spell with the club, he mainly served as a back-up, and was initially loaned out to several other Italian sides: he spent seasons on loan with Como, Bari, cross-city rivals Milan, and Torino. He also briefly enjoyed a successful two-season loan spell with [[Derby d'Italia|rivals]] Juventus between 1985 and 1987, scoring 21 Serie A goals in 51 appearances, and winning the [[1985 Intercontinental Cup]], and the [[1985\u201386 Serie A]] title; in total, he scored 36 goals in all competitions for the Turin side in 71 appearances. Serena enjoyed greater success after returning to Inter for his second spell in 1987. His best season with the Milan-side came during the [[1988\u201389 Serie A|1988\u201389 campaign]] under manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], when he won the [[Scudetto]] with Inter with a record 58 points (the club's thirteenth Serie A title overall), and was crowned [[Capocannoniere|top scorer of the league]], scoring 22 goals. He also later won the [[1989 Supercoppa Italiana]] and the [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup]] during his second spell with the club.<ref name=tuttojuve/><ref name=\"magliarossonera\"/><ref name=\"treccani\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/aldo-serena_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Serena, Aldo|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=Italian|author1=Fabio Monti|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"vivoazzurro\"/>\n\nAfter his second move to local rivals Milan in 1991, Serena's reputation as an Inter legend was somewhat tarnished, however; this was shown recently when Serena's name was booed by some of Inter's Ultras supporters when it was announced that he was to be part of an Inter Legends gathering after the final game of the [[2006\u201307 Serie A|2006\u201307 league]] trophy presentation. Although Serena's first spell with Milan saw him help the team win the [[Serie B]] title and achieve Serie A promotion in [[1982\u201383 Serie B|1983]], as he scored 8 goals in 20 appearances, his second spell with Milan was less successful; despite winning another [[1992 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana in 1992]], and another two [[Serie A]] titles in [[1991\u201392 Serie A|1992]] and [[1992\u201393 Serie A|1993]] under manager [[Fabio Capello]], he was used with less frequency due to several injury struggles, only making 10 appearances over his two final seasons, and he failed to score in Serie A during his second spell with the club, ultimately retiring from professional football in 1993.<ref name=\"magliarossonera\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/>\n\nSerena is the only footballer to have played for the both of the rival teams of Turin and Milan,<ref name=\"magliarossonera\"/> and is one of six footballers to win the Serie A title with three clubs, a feat he managed with Juventus, Inter, and Milan; the others to have achieved the same feat are [[Giovanni Ferrari]], Filippo Cavalli, [[Pietro Fanna]], [[Sergio Gori]] and [[Attilio Lombardo]].<ref name=\"SERGIO BOBO GORI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/sergio-bobo-gori.html|title=SERGIO \"BOBO\" GORI|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_maggio_7/celo-manca-aldo-serena-inter-bar-sport-2121012724545.shtml|title=Serena, la punta con la valigia|publisher=Il Corriere della Sera|language=Italian|author1=Roberto Perrone|date=7 May 2013|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nSerena played for the [[Italy national football team|Azzurri]] in two World Cups, first in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] and then in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] on home soil, where Italy finished in third place, although he did not make a single appearance in the former tournament.

He was also capable of finishing well with his powerful and accurate left footed shot.

He played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, winning four [[Serie A]] titles, among other trophies; he is mainly remembered for his time with [[Inter Milan|Inter]], where he won several trophies, including a league title and the [[UEFA Cup]]. At international level, he represented the [[Italy national football team]] in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], helping the team to a third-place finish in the latter tournament.\n\nHe currently works as a pundit for [[Mediaset]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/calcio/championsleague/champions-league-lione-juventus-su-canale-5_1123044-201602a.shtml|title=Champions League: Lione-Juventus su Canale 5|publisher=Mediaset|language=Italian|date=17 October 2016|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nDuring his career, Serena played for a number of Italian clubs: Montebelluna, [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]], [[Como Calcio 1907|Como]], [[A.S. Bari|Bari]], [[A.C. Milan]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[Torino F.C.|Torino]]. Born in Montebelluna, in the province of Treviso, he spent his youth playing with his hometown side's youth academy. After making his professional debut with the Montebelluna senior team in [[Serie D]] in 1977, and scoring 9 goals in 29 appearances during his debut season, Serena first joined Inter the [[1978\u201379 Serie A|following season]] in 1978; he made his [[Serie A]] debut later that year, on 19 November, in a 4\u20130 home win over [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], marking the occasion with his first Serie A goal, and also making another league appearance later that the season. Although he initially won the [[Coppa Italia|1981\u201382 Coppa Italia]] during his first spell with the club, he mainly served as a back-up, and was initially loaned out to several other Italian sides: he spent seasons on loan with Como, Bari, cross-city rivals Milan, and Torino. He also briefly enjoyed a successful two-season loan spell with [[Derby d'Italia|rivals]] Juventus between 1985 and 1987, scoring 21 Serie A goals in 51 appearances, and winning the [[1985 Intercontinental Cup]], and the [[1985\u201386 Serie A]] title; in total, he scored 36 goals in all competitions for the Turin side in 71 appearances. Serena enjoyed greater success after returning to Inter for his second spell in 1987. His best season with the Milan-side came during the [[1988\u201389 Serie A|1988\u201389 campaign]] under manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], when he won the [[Scudetto]] with Inter with a record 58 points (the club's thirteenth Serie A title overall), and was crowned [[Capocannoniere|top scorer of the league]], scoring 22 goals. He also later won the [[1989 Supercoppa Italiana]] and the [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup]] during his second spell with the club.<ref name=tuttojuve/><ref name=\"magliarossonera\"/><ref name=\"treccani\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/aldo-serena_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Serena, Aldo|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=Italian|author1=Fabio Monti|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"vivoazzurro\"/>\n\nAfter his second move to local rivals Milan in 1991, Serena's reputation as an Inter legend was somewhat tarnished, however; this was shown recently when Serena's name was booed by some of Inter's Ultras supporters when it was announced that he was to be part of an Inter Legends gathering after the final game of the [[2006\u201307 Serie A|2006\u201307 league]] trophy presentation. Although Serena's first spell with Milan saw him help the team win the [[Serie B]] title and achieve Serie A promotion in [[1982\u201383 Serie B|1983]], as he scored 8 goals in 20 appearances, his second spell with Milan was less successful; despite winning another [[1992 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana in 1992]], and another two [[Serie A]] titles in [[1991\u201392 Serie A|1992]] and [[1992\u201393 Serie A|1993]] under manager [[Fabio Capello]], he was used with less frequency due to several injury struggles, only making 10 appearances over his two final seasons, and he failed to score in Serie A during his second spell with the club, ultimately retiring from professional football in 1993.<ref name=\"magliarossonera\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/>\n\nSerena is the only footballer to have played for the both of the rival teams of Turin and Milan,<ref name=\"magliarossonera\"/> and is one of six footballers to win the Serie A title with three clubs, a feat he managed with Juventus, Inter, and Milan; the others to have achieved the same feat are [[Giovanni Ferrari]], Filippo Cavalli, [[Pietro Fanna]], [[Sergio Gori]] and [[Attilio Lombardo]].<ref name=\"SERGIO BOBO GORI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/sergio-bobo-gori.html|title=SERGIO \"BOBO\" GORI|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_maggio_7/celo-manca-aldo-serena-inter-bar-sport-2121012724545.shtml|title=Serena, la punta con la valigia|publisher=Il Corriere della Sera|language=Italian|author1=Roberto Perrone|date=7 May 2013|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nSerena played for the [[Italy national football team|Azzurri]] in two World Cups, first in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] and then in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] on home soil, where Italy finished in third place, although he did not make a single appearance in the former tournament.

He was also capable of finishing well with his powerful and accurate left footed shot.
