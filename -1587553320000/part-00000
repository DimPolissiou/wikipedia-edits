First opened in 1836 as the [[Whitby and Pickering Railway]], the railway was planned in 1831 by [[George Stephenson]] as a means of opening up trade routes inland from the then important seaport of [[Whitby]]. The line between {{rws|Grosmont}} and {{rws|Rillington}} was closed in 1965 and the section between Grosmont and {{rws|Pickering}} was reopened in 1973 by the North York Moors Historical Railway Trust Ltd. The preserved line is now a tourist attraction and has been awarded several industry accolades.\n\nIn 2007, the railway started to run regular services over the {{convert|6|mi}} section of the [[Esk Valley Line]] north of Grosmont to {{rws|Whitby}}. In 2014, a second platform was opened at Whitby which allowed the NYMR to run an enhanced service and led to passenger numbers in the same year of nearly 350,000 people.\n\n==Overview==\nThe NYMR carries more passengers than any other heritage railway in the UK and may be the busiest steam heritage line in the world, carrying 355,000 passengers in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title = End of the line for Philip after 12 glorious years on the railway|url = http://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/news/local/end-of-the-line-for-philip-after-12-glorious-years-on-the-railway-1-7542848|work = Whitby Gazette|accessdate = 30 October 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151030132646/http://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/news/local/end-of-the-line-for-philip-after-12-glorious-years-on-the-railway-1-7542848|archive-date = 30 October 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> The {{Convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}}<ref name=NYMRAboutUs>{{cite web|title=North Yorkshire Moors Railway - About Us|url=http://www.nymr.co.uk/information/about-us/|work=North Yorkshire Moors Railway website|accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> railway is the third-longest standard gauge heritage line in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Behrens |first1=David |title=Across the moors to Whitby, a revamp for a classic rail route |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/our-region/north-yorkshire-moors-and-coast/across-the-moors-to-whitby-a-revamp-for-a-classic-rail-route-1-8415413 |accessdate=2 May 2019 |work=The Yorkshire Post |date=1 March 2017}}</ref> after the [[West Somerset Railway]] ({{Convert|22.75|mi|km}}) and the [[Wensleydale Railway]] ({{Convert|22|mi|km}}),<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Brailsford |editor1-first=Martyn |title=Railway Track Diagrams Book 2: Eastern |date=2016 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Frome |isbn=978-0-9549866-8-1 |edition=4|at=20D}}</ref> and runs across the [[North York Moors National Park|North York Moors]] from [[Pickering, North Yorkshire|Pickering]] via [[Levisham]], [[Newton Dale]], [[Goathland]] and terminating at [[Grosmont, North Yorkshire|Grosmont]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Winn |first1=Christopher |title=I never knew that about Yorkshire |date=2010 |publisher=Ebury |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-193313-5 |page=92}}</ref>\n\nSome heritage rail operations continue along Network Rail tracks to [[Whitby]].

The railway was planned in 1831 by [[George Stephenson]] as a means of opening up trade routes inland from the then important seaport of [[Whitby]]. The initial railway was designed and built to be used by horse-drawn carriages. Construction was carried out by [[navvies]] and coordinated by top engineers. Their three main achievements were cutting a {{convert|120|yd}} [[Grosmont Tunnel|tunnel]] through rock at [[Grosmont, North Yorkshire|Grosmont]], constructing a rope-worked incline system at [[Beck Hole]] and traversing the marshy and deep [[Fen Bog]] using a bed of timber and sheep fleeces.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=G W J |title=A History of the Whitby and Pickering Railway |date=1969 |publisher=SR Publisher |location=East Ardsley |orig-year=1906|page=25 |edition=2|oclc=\t931366101}}</ref> The tunnel is believed to be one of the oldest railway tunnels in England.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Rennison|editor1-first=R W|title=Civil engineering heritage|date=1996|publisher=T. Telford|location=London|isbn=07277-2518-1|pages=139&ndash;140|edition=2}}</ref> \n\nIn its first year of operation, the railway carried {{convert|10,000|tonne}} of stone from Grosmont to Whitby, as well as 6,000 passengers, who paid a fare of 1&nbsp;[[shilling]] to sit on the roof of a coach, or 1&nbsp;[[shilling]] and 3&nbsp;pence to sit inside.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1915|p=270}} It took two and a half hours to travel from Whitby to Pickering.{{sfn|Suggitt|2007|p=87}}\n\nIn 1845, the railway was acquired by the [[York and North Midland Railway]] who re-engineered the line to allow the use of [[steam locomotives]].{{sfn|Bairstow|2008|p=17}} They also constructed the permanent stations and other structures along the line which still remain today. The Beck Hole Incline was re-equipped with a steam powered stationary engine and iron rope.  They also added the line south from Pickering so that the line had a connection to [[York]] and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chapman |first1=Stephen |title=York to Scarborough, Whitby & Ryedale |date=2008 |publisher=Bellcode Books |location=Todmorden |isbn=9781871233193 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1854 the [[York and North Midland Railway]] became part of the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]. Steam locomotives could not operate on the Beck Hole incline; so in the early 1860s the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] started construction of an alternative route which opened in 1865 \u2013 this is the route which is still in use today. The original route is now a {{convert|3.5|mi|adj=on}} [[rail trail]] named the ''Rail Trail''.{{sfn|Holland|Spaven|2015|p=176}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Sally Ann |title=National Park focus: North York Moors |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/National-Park-focus-North-York-Moors/ |accessdate=24 March 2019 |work=The Telegraph |date=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923 the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] was absorbed into the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] as a result of the [[Railways Act 1921]]. In 1948 nationalisation meant that [[British Railways]] took control. During this time, little changed on the line. However, in his controversial report [[Dr Beeching]] declared that the Whitby-Pickering line was uneconomic and listed it for closure; the last passenger service ran on 6 March 1965 with freight continuing until July 1966.{{sfn|Bairstow|2008|p=111}}  The line was used in June 1965 to house the Royal Train for the Duke of Edinburgh's visit to the [[RAF Fylingdales]] early warning station.\n\nIn 1967, the NYMR Preservation Society was formed, and negotiations began for the purchase of the line. After running various Open Weekends and Steam Galas during the early 1970s (by permission of [[British Railways]]) the NYMRPS transformed itself into a [[Charitable Trust]] (to ensure the future of the railway) and became The North York Moors Historical Railway Trust Ltd in 1972.{{sfn|Vanns|2017|p=8}} Purchase of the line was completed and the necessary [[Light Railway Order]] obtained, giving powers to operate the railway.  The railway was able to reopen for running in 1973 as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, with much of the traction provided by the [[North Eastern Locomotive Preservation Group]].{{sfn|Vanns|2017|p=60}}\n\nServices to Whitby were also mooted as a possibility; one of the first was in 1987 when ''[[92220 Evening Star|92220 \"Evening Star]]\"'' worked a service between Pickering and Whitby. Since then, services ran sporadically with third party operators (such as the West Coast Railway Company in the early 2000s) as the NYMR were not a licensed company authorised to operate over Network Rail metals.{{sfn|Bairstow|2008|p=103}} From 2007, regular trains operated over the Esk Valley Line from Grosmont to Whitby, thus providing a service over the entire length of the original Whitby and Pickering Railway.{{sfn|Bairstow|2008|p=104}} Services were further improved in 2014 by the re-opening of a second platform at Whitby to enable services to increase from three out and back workings a day, to five. After a year of operation, the NMYR stated that 120,000 people had travelled over the new operating section to Whitby and that overall in 2014, the railway had attracted nearly 350,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite news |title=Full steam ahead as new platform sees major increase in passengers |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&t=&sort=YMD_date%3AD&page=1&fld-base-0=alltext&maxresults=20&val-base-0=North%20Yorkshire%20Moors%20Railway%20passenger%20numbers&docref=news/157979C7C728A440 |accessdate=20 June 2019 |work=infoweb.newsbank.com |date=1 September 2015|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nThe preserved line is now a tourist attraction and has been awarded several tourist industry and heritage accolades.<ref name=\"NRHA1\">{{cite web |title=Winners 2006: {{!}} National Railway Heritage Awards |url=http://nrha.org.uk/winners-2006/ |website=nrha.org.uk |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"NRHA2\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Tourism Awards Ceremony - Yorkshire Coast Oscars |url=https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/news/tourism-awards-ceremony-yorkshire-coast-oscars-1-1400908 |accessdate=2 May 2019 |work=The Scarborough News |date=19 November 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"GAA\"/> In May 2019, the line was awarded \u00a34.4&nbsp;million of [[National Lottery Heritage Fund|National Lottery Heritage Funding]] towards the renewal of iron bridges at {{rws|Goathland}} railway station and a new carriage shed at {{rws|Pickering}}.<ref>{{cite magazine |editor1-last=Bickerdyke |editor1-first=Paul |title=NYMR wins lottery grant |magazine=Rail Express |date=June 2019 |issue=277 |page=8 |publisher=Mortons Media |location=Horncastle |issn=1362-234X}}</ref>\n\nAs of 11 January 2020, bridge 27 at Goathland was removed, and is expected to be fully replaced by the end of the same month.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d00BrnwUd20</ref>\n\n==Stations==\n[[File:Goathland station.jpg|thumb|BR 76079 arrives in [[Goathland]] station]]\n*[[Pickering railway station]] is the current terminus of the railway and serves the market town of Pickering.

The station has been restored to represent an NER country station post First World War  {{circa|1922}}.  The station is popular with tourists due to its appearances in Yorkshire TV's ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' and the first of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films (see below). The station has a newly refurbished tea room which is inside a goods warehouse. The station also has a traditional [[camping coach]], which is let for holidays.\n*[[Grosmont railway station]] was the railway's permanent northern terminus until 2007, when trains began operating into Whitby on a regular basis. The locomotive sheds are situated here, just south of the tunnel through which trains run en route for Goathland and beyond. The station itself has been restored to the [[British Railways]] style {{circa|1952}}. It has full facilities including a shop, caf\u00e9 serving cooked meals, toilets including disabled, a ticket office and a waiting room. The shed area has facilities to provide water and coal for the engines, as well as stabling. The 'running shed' is usually open to public access at one end, where stationary engines can be viewed. These are usually either operational but not in service that day, or undergoing light repair work. Also open to the public is the 'deviation shed' which houses locomotives and stock owned by NELPG as well as a small display about the history of the organisation. A number of other sheds not available for public access are used for the maintenance and overhaul of the engines. At Grosmont, the line connects with the [[Network Rail]] operated [[Esk Valley Line]], where passengers may change trains to travel to the coast at [[Whitby]], or inland to [[Middlesbrough]] and the rest of the national network. Thus, platform one of the station is served by Northern Rail services, whilst platforms two, three and four are used by the NYMR.\n*[[Whitby railway station]] is, on many operating days, the railway's northern terminus. All but two of the various timetables see steam trains operating through from Pickering, including daily throughout July and August except on Sundays. When NYMR trains terminate at Grosmont rather than Whitby at off-peak times, connecting trains with Northern Rail are usually available at Grosmont, allowing passengers to begin their journey at Whitby and board a steam-hauled train at Grosmont through to Goathland or Pickering. Facilities available at Whitby station include Ticket office and shop. National Rail tickets & Railcards are also available to purchase. In August 2014 a second platform was opened at the station to cater for the railway's trains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-28817679|title=North Yorkshire Moors Railway's new platform opens|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Locomotives==\n{{main|List of rolling stock preserved on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway}}\n\n==Future and possibility of expansion==\nThe possibility of reopening the 'missing \"{{convert|8|mile|km|adj=on}}\" section' between Malton via [[Rillington railway station|Rillington Junction]] (on the York \u2013 Malton \u2013 Scarborough Line) and Pickering has often been discussed.

The railway was planned in 1831 by [[George Stephenson]] as a means of opening up trade routes inland from the then important seaport of [[Whitby]]. The initial railway was designed and built to be used by horse-drawn carriages. Construction was carried out by [[navvies]] and coordinated by top engineers. Their three main achievements were cutting a {{convert|120|yd}} [[Grosmont Tunnel|tunnel]] through rock at [[Grosmont, North Yorkshire|Grosmont]], constructing a rope-worked incline system at [[Beck Hole]] and traversing the marshy and deep [[Fen Bog]] using a bed of timber and sheep fleeces.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=G W J |title=A History of the Whitby and Pickering Railway |date=1969 |publisher=SR Publisher |location=East Ardsley |orig-year=1906|page=25 |edition=2|oclc=\t931366101}}</ref> The tunnel is believed to be one of the oldest railway tunnels in England.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Rennison|editor1-first=R W|title=Civil engineering heritage|date=1996|publisher=T.

The Beck Hole Incline was re-equipped with a steam powered stationary engine and iron rope.

In 1948 nationalisation meant that [[British Railways]] took control. During this time, little changed on the line. However, in his controversial report [[Dr Beeching]] declared that the Whitby-Pickering line was uneconomic and listed it for closure; the last passenger service ran on 6 March 1965 with freight continuing until July 1966.{{sfn|Bairstow|2008|p=111}}  The line was used in June 1965 to house the Royal Train for the Duke of Edinburgh's visit to the [[RAF Fylingdales]] early warning station.\n\nIn 1967, the NYMR Preservation Society was formed, and negotiations began for the purchase of the line. After running various Open Weekends and Steam Galas during the early 1970s (by permission of [[British Railways]]) the NYMRPS transformed itself into a [[Charitable Trust]] (to ensure the future of the railway) and became The North York Moors Historical Railway Trust Ltd in 1972.{{sfn|Vanns|2017|p=8}} Purchase of the line was completed and the necessary [[Light Railway Order]] obtained, giving powers to operate the railway.  The railway was able to reopen for running in 1973 as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, with much of the traction provided by the [[North Eastern Locomotive Preservation Group]].{{sfn|Vanns|2017|p=60}}\n\nServices to Whitby were also mooted as a possibility; one of the first was in 1987 when ''[[92220 Evening Star|92220 \"Evening Star]]\"'' worked a service between Pickering and Whitby. Since then, services ran sporadically with third party operators (such as the West Coast Railway Company in the early 2000s) as the NYMR were not a licensed company authorised to operate over Network Rail metals.{{sfn|Bairstow|2008|p=103}} From 2007, regular trains operated over the Esk Valley Line from Grosmont to Whitby, thus providing a service over the entire length of the original Whitby and Pickering Railway.{{sfn|Bairstow|2008|p=104}} Services were further improved in 2014 by the re-opening of a second platform at Whitby to enable services to increase from three out and back workings a day, to five.

The station is popular with tourists due to its appearances in Yorkshire TV's ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' and the first of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films (see below). The station has a newly refurbished tea room which is inside a goods warehouse. The station also has a traditional [[camping coach]], which is let for holidays.\n*[[Grosmont railway station]] was the railway's permanent northern terminus until 2007, when trains began operating into Whitby on a regular basis. The locomotive sheds are situated here, just south of the tunnel through which trains run en route for Goathland and beyond. The station itself has been restored to the [[British Railways]] style {{circa|1952}}. It has full facilities including a shop, caf\u00e9 serving cooked meals, toilets including disabled, a ticket office and a waiting room. The shed area has facilities to provide water and coal for the engines, as well as stabling. The 'running shed' is usually open to public access at one end, where stationary engines can be viewed. These are usually either operational but not in service that day, or undergoing light repair work. Also open to the public is the 'deviation shed' which houses locomotives and stock owned by NELPG as well as a small display about the history of the organisation. A number of other sheds not available for public access are used for the maintenance and overhaul of the engines. At Grosmont, the line connects with the [[Network Rail]] operated [[Esk Valley Line]], where passengers may change trains to travel to the coast at [[Whitby]], or inland to [[Middlesbrough]] and the rest of the national network. Thus, platform one of the station is served by Northern Rail services, whilst platforms two, three and four are used by the NYMR.\n*[[Whitby railway station]] is, on many operating days, the railway's northern terminus. All but two of the various timetables see steam trains operating through from Pickering, including daily throughout July and August except on Sundays. When NYMR trains terminate at Grosmont rather than Whitby at off-peak times, connecting trains with Northern Rail are usually available at Grosmont, allowing passengers to begin their journey at Whitby and board a steam-hauled train at Grosmont through to Goathland or Pickering. Facilities available at Whitby station include Ticket office and shop. National Rail tickets & Railcards are also available to purchase. In August 2014 a second platform was opened at the station to cater for the railway's trains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-28817679|title=North Yorkshire Moors Railway's new platform opens|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Locomotives==\n{{main|List of rolling stock preserved on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway}}\n\n==Future and possibility of expansion==\nThe possibility of reopening the 'missing \"{{convert|8|mile|km|adj=on}}\" section' between Malton via [[Rillington railway station|Rillington Junction]] (on the York \u2013 Malton \u2013 Scarborough Line) and Pickering has often been discussed.
