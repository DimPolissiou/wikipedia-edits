Early AD tends to be associated with less severe increases in blood pressure. \n\nOne common causative factor may be an undetected urinary tract infection. The difficulty in assessing this may be complicated with the usage of indwelling or suprapubic catheters. Other causes include medication side effects and various disease processes. The use of stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines which can result in urinary retention, and the use of CNS depressants and other psychoactive drugs can also lead to urinary retention and constipation thus leading to autonomic dysreflexia when in use over an extended period of time. \n\n=== Pain ===\n\nCurrent scientific literature suggests that noxious (painful) stimuli are the primary initiators of AD. (Note: Not all noxious stimuli will cause AD. Some otherwise severe noxious stimuli in normal people, e.g. broken bones, may not result in AD, and may in fact even go unnoticed.)  However, different studies have found that activation of pain receptors in muscle and skin below the lesion in spinal cord injured individuals did not trigger AD.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton AR, Brown R, Macefield VG | title = Selective activation of muscle and skin nociceptors does not trigger exaggerated sympathetic responses in spinal-injured subjects | journal = Spinal Cord | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 660\u20135 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18427566 | doi = 10.1038/sc.2008.33 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marsh DR, Weaver LC | title = Autonomic dysreflexia, induced by noxious or innocuous stimulation, does not depend on changes in dorsal horn substance p | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 817\u201328 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15253807 | doi = 10.1089/0897715041269605 }}</ref> These studies suggests that not all noxious stimuli are reliable triggers of AD, and because non-noxious stimuli can also trigger AD, attribution of an episode of AD to noxious stimuli may cause clinicians to overlook underlying non-noxious triggers.  As a result, non-noxious trigger factors remain undetected, prolonging an episode of AD. They concluded that when deducing the potential causes of AD it is important to consider non-noxious sources of stimulation in addition to noxious triggers. Current assessment of autonomic dysreflexia in patients with known causative factors include palpation of the bladder and bowel and can also include bladder scan.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nSupraspinal vasomotor neurons send projections to the [[Intermediolateral nucleus|intermediolateral]] cell column, which is composed of sympathetic [[Preganglionic nerve fibers|preganglionic neurons]] (SPN) through the T1-L2 segments.<ref name=\":2\" /> The supraspinal neurons act on the SPN and its tonic firing, modulating its action on the [[Sympathetic ganglion|peripheral sympathetic chain ganglia]] and the [[adrenal medulla]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The sympathetic ganglia act directly on the blood vessels they innervate throughout the body, controlling vessel diameter and resistance, while the adrenal medulla indirectly controls the same action through the release of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The descending autonomic pathways, which are responsible for the supraspinal communication with the SPN, are interrupted resulting in decreased sympathetic outflow below the level of the injury.<ref name=\":2\" /> In this circumstance, the SPN is controlled only by spinal influences.<ref name=\":2\" /> The first couple of weeks after a spinal injury, the decreased sympathetic outflow causes reduced blood pressure and sympathetic reflex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Eventually, synaptic reorganization and plasticity of SPN develops into an overly sensitive state, which results in abnormal reflex activation of SPN due to afferent stimuli, such as bowel or bladder distension.<ref name=\":2\" /> Reflex activation results in systemic vasoconstriction below the spinal cord disruption.  The peripheral arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension activates the [[baroreceptor]]s, resulting in a [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] surge originating in the [[central nervous system]], which inhibits the sympathetic outflow; however, the parasympathetic signal is unable to transmit below the level of the spinal cord lesion.<ref name=\":3\" /> This results in [[vasodilation]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[Pupillary response|pupillary constriction]] and [[Nasal congestion|nasal stuffiness]] above the spinal lesion, while there's [[Goose bumps|piloerection]], pale and cool skin below the lesion due to the prevailing sympathetic outflow.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\nThe symptoms are usually not subtle, although asymptomatic events have been documented. Autonomic dysreflexia differs from [[autonomic instability]], the various modest cardiac and neurological changes that accompany a spinal cord injury, including [[bradycardia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], and ambient temperature intolerance.  In autonomic dysreflexia, patients will experience hypertension, sweating, spasms (sometimes severe spasms) and [[erythema]] (more likely in upper extremities) and may suffer from headaches and blurred vision.  Mortality is rare with AD, but morbidity such as stroke, retinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema if left untreated can be quite severe.  Older patients with very incomplete spinal cord injuries and systolic [[hypertension]] without symptoms are usually experiencing essential hypertension, not autonomic dysreflexia. Aggressive treatment of these elderly patients with rapidly acting [[antihypertensive]] medications can have disastrous results.\n\n== Treatment ==\n\nProper treatment of autonomic dysreflexia involves administration of anti-hypertensives along with immediate determination and removal of the triggering stimuli. Often, sitting the patient up and dangling legs over the bedside can reduce blood pressures below dangerous levels and provide partial symptom relief. Tight clothing and stockings should be removed. [[Straight catheterization]] of the bladder or relief of a blocked urinary catheter tube may resolve the problem.  The rectum should be cleared of stool impaction, using anaesthetic lubricating jelly. If the noxious precipitating trigger cannot be identified, drug treatment is needed to decrease elevating intracranial pressure until further studies can identify the cause.\n\nDrug treatment includes the rapidly acting [[vasodilator]]s, including sublingual or topical [[nitrate]]s or oral hydralazine or [[clonidine]].  [[Ganglionic blockers]] are also used to control [[sympathetic nervous system]] outflow.  Topical nitroglycerin ointment is a convenient and safe treatment\u2014an inch or two can be applied to the chest wall or forehead, and wiped off when blood pressures begin to normalize.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Pharmacodynamics and effectiveness of topical nitroglycerin at lowering blood pressure during autonomic dysreflexia|journal=Spinal Cord|volume=55|issue=10|pages=911\u2013914|doi=10.1038/sc.2017.58|pmid = 28585557|year=2017|last1=Solinsky|first1=R.|last2=Bunnell|first2=A.

P.}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />  Autonomic dysreflexia is abolished temporarily by [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal]] or [[general anaesthesia]]. These treatments are used during obstetric delivery of women with autonomic dysreflexia.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThe cause of autonomic dysreflexia itself can be life-threatening, and must also be completely investigated and treated appropriately to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine has developed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of autonomic dysreflexia in adults, children, and pregnant women.

However, different studies have found that activation of pain receptors in muscle and skin below the lesion in spinal cord injured individuals did not trigger AD.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton AR, Brown R, Macefield VG | title = Selective activation of muscle and skin nociceptors does not trigger exaggerated sympathetic responses in spinal-injured subjects | journal = Spinal Cord | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 660\u20135 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18427566 | doi = 10.1038/sc.2008.33 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marsh DR, Weaver LC | title = Autonomic dysreflexia, induced by noxious or innocuous stimulation, does not depend on changes in dorsal horn substance p | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 817\u201328 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15253807 | doi = 10.1089/0897715041269605 }}</ref> These studies suggests that not all noxious stimuli are reliable triggers of AD, and because non-noxious stimuli can also trigger AD, attribution of an episode of AD to noxious stimuli may cause clinicians to overlook underlying non-noxious triggers.  As a result, non-noxious trigger factors remain undetected, prolonging an episode of AD. They concluded that when deducing the potential causes of AD it is important to consider non-noxious sources of stimulation in addition to noxious triggers. Current assessment of autonomic dysreflexia in patients with known causative factors include palpation of the bladder and bowel and can also include bladder scan.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nSupraspinal vasomotor neurons send projections to the [[Intermediolateral nucleus|intermediolateral]] cell column, which is composed of sympathetic [[Preganglionic nerve fibers|preganglionic neurons]] (SPN) through the T1-L2 segments.<ref name=\":2\" /> The supraspinal neurons act on the SPN and its tonic firing, modulating its action on the [[Sympathetic ganglion|peripheral sympathetic chain ganglia]] and the [[adrenal medulla]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The sympathetic ganglia act directly on the blood vessels they innervate throughout the body, controlling vessel diameter and resistance, while the adrenal medulla indirectly controls the same action through the release of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The descending autonomic pathways, which are responsible for the supraspinal communication with the SPN, are interrupted resulting in decreased sympathetic outflow below the level of the injury.<ref name=\":2\" /> In this circumstance, the SPN is controlled only by spinal influences.<ref name=\":2\" /> The first couple of weeks after a spinal injury, the decreased sympathetic outflow causes reduced blood pressure and sympathetic reflex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Eventually, synaptic reorganization and plasticity of SPN develops into an overly sensitive state, which results in abnormal reflex activation of SPN due to afferent stimuli, such as bowel or bladder distension.<ref name=\":2\" /> Reflex activation results in systemic vasoconstriction below the spinal cord disruption.  The peripheral arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension activates the [[baroreceptor]]s, resulting in a [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] surge originating in the [[central nervous system]], which inhibits the sympathetic outflow; however, the parasympathetic signal is unable to transmit below the level of the spinal cord lesion.<ref name=\":3\" /> This results in [[vasodilation]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[Pupillary response|pupillary constriction]] and [[Nasal congestion|nasal stuffiness]] above the spinal lesion, while there's [[Goose bumps|piloerection]], pale and cool skin below the lesion due to the prevailing sympathetic outflow.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\nThe symptoms are usually not subtle, although asymptomatic events have been documented. Autonomic dysreflexia differs from [[autonomic instability]], the various modest cardiac and neurological changes that accompany a spinal cord injury, including [[bradycardia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], and ambient temperature intolerance.  In autonomic dysreflexia, patients will experience hypertension, sweating, spasms (sometimes severe spasms) and [[erythema]] (more likely in upper extremities) and may suffer from headaches and blurred vision.  Mortality is rare with AD, but morbidity such as stroke, retinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema if left untreated can be quite severe.  Older patients with very incomplete spinal cord injuries and systolic [[hypertension]] without symptoms are usually experiencing essential hypertension, not autonomic dysreflexia. Aggressive treatment of these elderly patients with rapidly acting [[antihypertensive]] medications can have disastrous results.\n\n== Treatment ==\n\nProper treatment of autonomic dysreflexia involves administration of anti-hypertensives along with immediate determination and removal of the triggering stimuli. Often, sitting the patient up and dangling legs over the bedside can reduce blood pressures below dangerous levels and provide partial symptom relief. Tight clothing and stockings should be removed. [[Straight catheterization]] of the bladder or relief of a blocked urinary catheter tube may resolve the problem.  The rectum should be cleared of stool impaction, using anaesthetic lubricating jelly. If the noxious precipitating trigger cannot be identified, drug treatment is needed to decrease elevating intracranial pressure until further studies can identify the cause.\n\nDrug treatment includes the rapidly acting [[vasodilator]]s, including sublingual or topical [[nitrate]]s or oral hydralazine or [[clonidine]].  [[Ganglionic blockers]] are also used to control [[sympathetic nervous system]] outflow.  Topical nitroglycerin ointment is a convenient and safe treatment\u2014an inch or two can be applied to the chest wall or forehead, and wiped off when blood pressures begin to normalize.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Pharmacodynamics and effectiveness of topical nitroglycerin at lowering blood pressure during autonomic dysreflexia|journal=Spinal Cord|volume=55|issue=10|pages=911\u2013914|doi=10.1038/sc.2017.58|pmid = 28585557|year=2017|last1=Solinsky|first1=R.|last2=Bunnell|first2=A.

P.}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />  Autonomic dysreflexia is abolished temporarily by [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal]] or [[general anaesthesia]]. These treatments are used during obstetric delivery of women with autonomic dysreflexia.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThe cause of autonomic dysreflexia itself can be life-threatening, and must also be completely investigated and treated appropriately to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine has developed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of autonomic dysreflexia in adults, children, and pregnant women. There is also a consumer version of this guideline.\n\n== See also ==\n* Notable individual with AD - [[Jeff Erlanger]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP_cLHIYGiI interviewed by Fred Rogers]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n* {{cite book | first1 = Keith G. | last1 = Allman | first2 = Andrew | last2 = McIndoe | first3 = Iain H. | last3 = Wilson | name-list-format = vanc | title = Emergencies in anaesthesia | date = 2005 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-852099-3 | page = 18 }}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=((Lin VWH)), Cardenas DD, Cutter NC, Frost FS, Hammond MC |title=Spinal Cord Medicine: Principles and Practice |publisher=Demos Medical Publishing |year=2010 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-1-933864-19-8 }}\n* {{cite web |author=Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine |title = Acute Management of Autonomic Dysreflexia: Individuals with Spinal Cord Injury Presenting to Health-Care Facilities |year=2001 | edition = 2nd | publisher = Paralyzed Veterans of America | location = Washington DC | url = http://www.pva.org/media/pdf/cpg_autonomic%20dysreflexia.pdf }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Vall\u00e8s M, Benito J, Portell E, Vidal J | title = Cerebral hemorrhage due to autonomic dysreflexia in a spinal cord injury patient | journal = Spinal Cord | volume = 43 | issue = 12 | pages = 738\u201340 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16010281 | doi = 10.1038/sj.sc.3101780 }}\n{{refend}}\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 1155 \n|  ICD10          =  \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|337.3}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           =  \n|  MedlinePlus    = 001431 \n|  eMedicineSubj  = article \n|  eMedicineTopic = 322809 \n|  MeshID         = D020211\n}}\n\n{{Autonomic diseases}}\n{{Shock types}}\n[[Category:Neurotrauma]]\n[[Category:Medical emergencies]]\n[[Category:Medical terminology]]\n[[Category:Peripheral nervous system disorders]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_dysreflexia"}

While per-capita agricultural output has grown since then, it has been outpaced by the growth of the non-agricultural sectors, and the share of agriculture has dropped to roughly one-fifth of Pakistan's economy. In recent years, the country has seen rapid growth in industries (such as apparel, textiles, and cement) and services (such as telecommunications, transportation, advertising, and finance).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Major sectors ==\n{{See also|List of Pakistani companies}}\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\n[[File:Agriculture by Province.jpg|thumb|Agriculture by Province]]\n[[File:MangoTree.jpeg|thumb|Mango Orchard in [[Multan]], Pakistan]]\n\nThe most important crops are wheat, [[sugarcane]], cotton, and rice, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan produced 26,674,000 tonnes of wheat, almost equal to all of Africa (27.1 million tonnes) and more than all of South America (25.9 million tonnes), according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=wheat production|website=fao.org|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> In the previous market year of 2018/19 Pakistan exported a record 4.5 million tonnes of rice  as compared to around 4 MMT during the corresponding period last year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Grain%20and%20Feed%20Update_Islamabad_Pakistan_12-30-2019|title=Pakistan Grain and Feed Update|last=|first=|date=|website=gain.fas.usda.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/field/2007/1000497/index.html|title=Pakistan cuts pesticide use dramatically|website=fao.org}}</ref>\n\nPakistan is a net food exporter, except in occasional years when its harvest is adversely affected by droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest [[camel]] market, second-largest [[apricot]] and [[ghee]] market and third-largest cotton, onion and milk market. The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit. From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%. Agricultural reforms, including increased wheat and oil seed production, play a central role in the government's economic reform package.\n\nMajority of the population, directly or indirectly, dependent on this sector. It contributes about 18.5% percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and accounts for 37.4% of employed labor force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings.<ref name=\":3\" /> During 2017\u201318, agriculture sector recorded a remarkable growth of 3.70 percent and surpassed its targeted growth of 3.5 percent and last year's growth of 2.18 percent.

About 25% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. Pakistan irrigates three times more acres than Russia. Pakistan agriculture also benefits from year round warmth. Agriculture accounts for about 18.9% of GDP and employs about 42.3% of the labour force. [[Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited]] is the largest financial institution geared towards the development of agriculture sector through provision of financial services and technical expertise.\n\n==== Mining ====\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is endowed with significant mineral resources and is emerging as a very promising area for prospecting/exploration for mineral deposits. Based on available information, the country's more than 6,00,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of outcrops area demonstrates varied geological potential for metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits. In the wake of 18th amendment to the constitution all the provinces are free to exploit and explore the mineral resources which are in their jurisdiction.\nMining and quarrying contributes 13.19% in industrial sector and its share in GDP is 2.8%. Pakistan mining and quarrying sector grew by 3.04% in 2018 against the negative growth of -0.38% last year.\n\nIn the recent past, exploration by government agencies as well as by multinational mining companies presents ample evidence of the occurrences of sizeable minerals deposits. Recent discoveries of a thick oxidised zone underlain by sulphide zones in the shield area of the Punjab province, covered by thick alluvial cover have opened new vistas for metallic minerals exploration. Pakistan has a large base for industrial minerals. The discovery of coal deposits having over 175 billion tonnes of reserves at Thar in the Sindh province has given an impetus to develop it as an alternative source of energy. There is vast potential for precious and dimension stones.\n\nExtraction of principal minerals in the last 5 fiscal years is given in the table below :-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//mbs/monthly_bulletin_of_statistics_july_2019.pdf|title=Extraction of Principal Minerals|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Pakistan is manufacturing and selling weapons to over 40 countries, bringing in $20 million annually.The country's arms imports increased by 119 percent between the 2004\u20132008 and 2009\u201313, with China providing 54pc and the USA 27pc of Pakistan's imports.\n\n==== Textiles ====\n{{Main|Textile industry in Pakistan}}\nMost of the Textile Industry is established in Punjab. Before 1990, the situation was different; most of the industry was in Karachi. Textile industry in Pakistan is traditional and conservative, producing and exporting most of low cost raw articles e.g. Raw Cotton, Yarn, fabric etc. Share of finished goods and branded articles is nominal. Pakistan has a potential to quadruple its textile production and export, due to emerging Chinese markets and with its existing infrastructure. 10% of United States imports regarding clothing and other form of textiles is covered by Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe textile sector accounts for 70% of Pakistan's exports, but the working conditions of workers are deplorable. Small manufacturing workshops generally do not sign employment contracts, do not respect the minimum wage and sometimes employ children. Violations of labour law also occur among major subcontractors of international brands, where workers may be beaten, insulted by their superiors or paid below the minimum wage. Factories do not comply with safety standards, leading to accidents: in 2012, 255 workers died in a fire at a [[Karachi]] factory. With 547 labour inspectors in Pakistan supervising the country's 300,000 factories, the textile industry is out of control. Nor are workers protected by trade unions, which are prohibited in industrial export zones. Elsewhere, \"workers involved in the creation of trade unions are victims of violence, intimidation, threats or dismissals\".<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2019/01/25/un-rapport-de-l-ong-human-rights-watch-denonce-les-conditions-de-travail-dans-le-textile-au-pakistan_5414575_3234.html</ref>\n\n==== Other ====\n{{as of|2010}}, Pakistan is one of the largest users of CNG ([[compressed natural gas]]) in the world.

However, in subsequent years exports have declined considerably. This declined started from financial year 2014-15 when an international commodity slump set in. This was compounded by structural supply side constraints including energy shortages, high input costs and an overvalued exchange rate. From financial year 2014 to 2016, exports declined by 12.4 percent. Exports growth trend over this period was similar to the world trade growth patterns. Pakistan's external sector continued facing stress during 2016\u201317. But still Pakistan's merchandise trade exports grew by 0.1 percent during the fiscal year 2016\u201317. The imports continued to grow at a much faster rate and grew by a large percentage of 18.0 during the FY 2017 as compared to the previous year.<ref name=\"sbp.gov.pk\">http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Aug/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\nWorld imports had been stagnant between 2011 and 2014 but registered significant drop since early 2015 because of weak commodity and product prices and weak global economic activity. Economic growth was lacklustre in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]\ncountries which contributed to the slowdown in China. Furthermore, the ratio between real growth in world imports and world real GDP growth substantially declined. This decline in the import content of economic activity triggered a shift in consumption worldwide from traded towards non-traded goods, import substitution, a slowdown in the pace of [[Free trade|trade liberalization]], and gave currency to protectionist measures. A bulk of Pakistan's exports are directed to the OECD region and China. Historical data suggest strong correlation between Pakistani exports to imports in OECD and China. As per FY 2016 data, more than half of country's exports are shipped to these two destinations i.e. OECD and China. A decline in Pakistan overall exports,thus occurred in this backdrop.<ref name=\"financegov\">http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/08-Trade.pdf</ref>\n\nPakistan's imports are showing rising trend at a relatively faster rate due to the increased economic activity as part of [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), particularly in the Energy sector. The construction projects under CPEC require heavy machinery that has to be imported. It is also observed that the economy is currently being led both by investments as well as consumption, resulting in relatively higher levels of imports. During FY 2018 Pakistan's exports picked up and reached to US$24.8 billion showing a growth of 12.6 percent over previous year FY 2017. Imports on the other hand also increased by 16.2 percent and touched the highest figure of US$56.6 billion. As a result, the trade deficit widened to US$31.8 billion which was the highest since last ten years.

A reversal in global oil prices led to\nincrease in POL imports, accompanied by falling exports, as a result the merchandised [[trade deficit]] grew by 39.4 percent to US$26.885 billion in FY 2017. While [[remittances]] and Coalition Support Fund inflows both declined slightly over the same period last year, however, the impact was offset by an improvement in the income account, mainly due to lower profit repatriations by oil and gas firms.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n'''Current account'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Current account deficit]] increased to US$12.4 billion in FY 2017, against US$3.2 billion in FY 2016.<ref>http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Nov/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\n\nHowever, the impact of high current deficit on [[foreign exchange reserves]] was not severe, as financial inflows were available to the country to partially offset the gap; these inflows helped ensure stability in the exchange rate. Net [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] grew by 12.4 percent and reached US$1.6 billion in the nine-months period, whereas net FPI saw an inflow of US$631 million, against an outflow of US$393 million last year. Encouragingly for the country, the period saw the completion of multiple merger and acquisition deals between local and foreign companies. Moreover, multiple foreign automakers announced their intention to enter the Pakistani market, and some also entered into joint ventures with local conglomerates. This indicates that Pakistan is clearly on foreign investors' radar, and provides a positive outlook for FDI inflows going forward. government's successful issuance of a US$1.0 billion Sukuk in the international capital market, at an extremely low rate of 5.5 percent.\nBesides, Pakistan continued to enjoy support from international financial institutions (IFIs) like the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]], and from bilateral partners like China, in the post-EFF period: net official loan inflows of US$1.1 billion were recorded during the period. As a result, the country's FX reserve amounted to US$20.8 billion by 4 May 2017 sufficient to finance around four month of import payments.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n=== Economic aid ===\n{{Main|Foreign aid to Pakistan}}\nPakistan receives economic aid from several sources as loans and grants. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]] (WB), [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB), etc. provide long-term loans to Pakistan. Pakistan also receives bilateral aid from developed and oil-rich countries. [[Foreign aid to Pakistan|Foreign aid]] has been one of the main sources of money for the Pakistani Economy.

As a result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982/83 many of the industries built by his predecessor suffered with a huge surge in import costs. After years of appreciation under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and despite huge increases in foreign aid the Rupee depreciated.\n\n=== Foreign exchange rate ===\nThe Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar until around the start of the 21st century, when Pakistan's large current-account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up versus the dollar. Pakistan's central bank then stabilised by lowering interest rates and buying dollars, in order to preserve the country's export competitiveness\n\n=== Foreign exchange reserves ===\n\nPakistan maintains foreign reserves with [[State Bank of Pakistan]]. The currency of the reserves was solely US dollar incurring speculated losses after the dollar prices fell during 2005, forcing the then Governor SBP [[Ishrat Hussain]] to step down.

While per-capita agricultural output has grown since then, it has been outpaced by the growth of the non-agricultural sectors, and the share of agriculture has dropped to roughly one-fifth of Pakistan's economy. In recent years, the country has seen rapid growth in industries (such as apparel, textiles, and cement) and services (such as telecommunications, transportation, advertising, and finance).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Major sectors ==\n{{See also|List of Pakistani companies}}\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\n[[File:Agriculture by Province.jpg|thumb|Agriculture by Province]]\n[[File:MangoTree.jpeg|thumb|Mango Orchard in [[Multan]], Pakistan]]\n\nThe most important crops are wheat, [[sugarcane]], cotton, and rice, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan produced 26,674,000 tonnes of wheat, almost equal to all of Africa (27.1 million tonnes) and more than all of South America (25.9 million tonnes), according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=wheat production|website=fao.org|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> In the previous market year of 2018/19 Pakistan exported a record 4.5 million tonnes of rice  as compared to around 4 MMT during the corresponding period last year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Grain%20and%20Feed%20Update_Islamabad_Pakistan_12-30-2019|title=Pakistan Grain and Feed Update|last=|first=|date=|website=gain.fas.usda.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/field/2007/1000497/index.html|title=Pakistan cuts pesticide use dramatically|website=fao.org}}</ref>\n\nPakistan is a net food exporter, except in occasional years when its harvest is adversely affected by droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest [[camel]] market, second-largest [[apricot]] and [[ghee]] market and third-largest cotton, onion and milk market. The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit. From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%. Agricultural reforms, including increased wheat and oil seed production, play a central role in the government's economic reform package.\n\nMajority of the population, directly or indirectly, dependent on this sector. It contributes about 18.5% percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and accounts for 37.4% of employed labor force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings.<ref name=\":3\" /> During 2017\u201318, agriculture sector recorded a remarkable growth of 3.70 percent and surpassed its targeted growth of 3.5 percent and last year's growth of 2.18 percent. All the major crops showed a positive trend in their production except maize.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theindependent.in/water-shortages-in-pakistan-an-impending-economic-crisis/|title=Water shortages in Pakistan: An impending economic crisis \u2013 The Independent.in|publisher=}}</ref> Sugarcane and rice production surpassed their historic level with 82.1 and 7.4 million tons respectively. [[Pakistan Bureau of Statistics]] provisionally valued this sector at Rs. 7,764,218 million for the year 2018 thus registering the growth of 6.1% over the last year.<ref name=\":8\" /> Again in 2018-19, Agriculture sector did not hit its target growth and only grew by 0.85%.

About 25% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. Pakistan irrigates three times more acres than Russia. Pakistan agriculture also benefits from year round warmth. Agriculture accounts for about 18.9% of GDP and employs about 42.3% of the labour force. [[Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited]] is the largest financial institution geared towards the development of agriculture sector through provision of financial services and technical expertise.\n\n==== Mining ====\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is endowed with significant mineral resources and is emerging as a very promising area for prospecting/exploration for mineral deposits. Based on available information, the country's more than 6,00,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of outcrops area demonstrates varied geological potential for metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits. In the wake of 18th amendment to the constitution all the provinces are free to exploit and explore the mineral resources which are in their jurisdiction.\nMining and quarrying contributes 13.19% in industrial sector and its share in GDP is 2.8%. Pakistan mining and quarrying sector grew by 3.04% in 2018 against the negative growth of -0.38% last year.\n\nIn the recent past, exploration by government agencies as well as by multinational mining companies presents ample evidence of the occurrences of sizeable minerals deposits. Recent discoveries of a thick oxidised zone underlain by sulphide zones in the shield area of the Punjab province, covered by thick alluvial cover have opened new vistas for metallic minerals exploration. Pakistan has a large base for industrial minerals. The discovery of coal deposits having over 175 billion tonnes of reserves at Thar in the Sindh province has given an impetus to develop it as an alternative source of energy. There is vast potential for precious and dimension stones.\n\nExtraction of principal minerals in the last 5 fiscal years is given in the table below :-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//mbs/monthly_bulletin_of_statistics_july_2019.pdf|title=Extraction of Principal Minerals|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Pakistan is manufacturing and selling weapons to over 40 countries, bringing in $20 million annually.The country's arms imports increased by 119 percent between the 2004\u20132008 and 2009\u201313, with China providing 54pc and the USA 27pc of Pakistan's imports.\n\n==== Textiles ====\n{{Main|Textile industry in Pakistan}}\nMost of the Textile Industry is established in Punjab. Before 1990, the situation was different; most of the industry was in Karachi. Textile industry in Pakistan is traditional and conservative, producing and exporting most of low cost raw articles e.g. Raw Cotton, Yarn, fabric etc. Share of finished goods and branded articles is nominal. Pakistan has a potential to quadruple its textile production and export, due to emerging Chinese markets and with its existing infrastructure. 10% of United States imports regarding clothing and other form of textiles is covered by Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe textile sector accounts for 70% of Pakistan's exports, but the working conditions of workers are deplorable. Small manufacturing workshops generally do not sign employment contracts, do not respect the minimum wage and sometimes employ children. Violations of labour law also occur among major subcontractors of international brands, where workers may be beaten, insulted by their superiors or paid below the minimum wage. Factories do not comply with safety standards, leading to accidents: in 2012, 255 workers died in a fire at a [[Karachi]] factory. With 547 labour inspectors in Pakistan supervising the country's 300,000 factories, the textile industry is out of control. Nor are workers protected by trade unions, which are prohibited in industrial export zones.

Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends, service fees or capital is now the rule.

However, in subsequent years exports have declined considerably. This declined started from financial year 2014-15 when an international commodity slump set in. This was compounded by structural supply side constraints including energy shortages, high input costs and an overvalued exchange rate. From financial year 2014 to 2016, exports declined by 12.4 percent. Exports growth trend over this period was similar to the world trade growth patterns. Pakistan's external sector continued facing stress during 2016\u201317. But still Pakistan's merchandise trade exports grew by 0.1 percent during the fiscal year 2016\u201317. The imports continued to grow at a much faster rate and grew by a large percentage of 18.0 during the FY 2017 as compared to the previous year.<ref name=\"sbp.gov.pk\">http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Aug/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\nWorld imports had been stagnant between 2011 and 2014 but registered significant drop since early 2015 because of weak commodity and product prices and weak global economic activity. Economic growth was lacklustre in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]\ncountries which contributed to the slowdown in [[China]]. Furthermore, the ratio between real growth in world imports and world real GDP growth substantially declined. This decline in the import content of economic activity triggered a shift in consumption worldwide from traded towards non-traded goods, import substitution, a slowdown in the pace of [[Free trade|trade liberalization]], and gave currency to protectionist measures. A bulk of Pakistan's exports are directed to the OECD region and China. Historical data suggest strong correlation between Pakistani exports to imports in OECD and China. As per FY 2016 data, more than half of country's exports are shipped to these two destinations i.e. OECD and China. A decline in Pakistan overall exports,thus occurred in this backdrop.<ref name=\"financegov\">http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/08-Trade.pdf</ref>\n\nPakistan's imports are showing rising trend at a relatively faster rate due to the increased economic activity as part of [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), particularly in the Energy sector. The construction projects under CPEC require heavy machinery that has to be imported. It is also observed that the economy is currently being led both by investments as well as consumption, resulting in relatively higher levels of imports. During FY 2018 Pakistan's exports picked up and reached to US$24.8 billion showing a growth of 12.6 percent over previous year FY 2017. Imports on the other hand also increased by 16.2 percent and touched the highest figure of US$56.6 billion. As a result, the trade deficit widened to US$31.8 billion which was the highest since last ten years.

A reversal in global oil prices led to\nincrease in POL imports, accompanied by falling exports, as a result the merchandised [[trade deficit]] grew by 39.4 percent to US$26.885 billion in FY 2017. While [[remittances]] and Coalition Support Fund inflows both declined slightly over the same period last year, however, the impact was offset by an improvement in the income account, mainly due to lower profit repatriations by oil and gas firms.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n'''Current account'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Current account deficit]] increased to US$12.4 billion in FY 2017, against US$3.2 billion in FY 2016.<ref>http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Nov/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\n\nHowever, the impact of high current deficit on [[foreign exchange reserves]] was not severe, as financial inflows were available to the country to partially offset the gap; these inflows helped ensure stability in the exchange rate. Net [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] grew by 12.4 percent and reached US$1.6 billion in the nine-months period, whereas net FPI saw an inflow of US$631 million, against an outflow of US$393 million last year. Encouragingly for the country, the period saw the completion of multiple merger and acquisition deals between local and foreign companies. Moreover, multiple foreign automakers announced their intention to enter the Pakistani market, and some also entered into joint ventures with local conglomerates. This indicates that Pakistan is clearly on foreign investors' radar, and provides a positive outlook for FDI inflows going forward. government's successful issuance of a US$1.0 billion Sukuk in the international capital market, at an extremely low rate of 5.5 percent.\nBesides, Pakistan continued to enjoy support from international financial institutions (IFIs) like the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]], and from bilateral partners like [[China]], in the post-EFF period: net official loan inflows of US$1.1 billion were recorded during the period. As a result, the country's FX reserve amounted to US$20.8 billion by 4 May 2017 sufficient to finance around four month of import payments.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n=== Economic aid ===\n{{Main|Foreign aid to Pakistan}}\nPakistan receives economic aid from several sources as loans and grants. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]] (WB), [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB), etc. provide long-term loans to Pakistan. Pakistan also receives bilateral aid from developed and oil-rich countries. [[Foreign aid to Pakistan|Foreign aid]] has been one of the main sources of money for the Pakistani Economy. Collection of Foreign aid has been one of the priorities of almost every Pakistani Government with the Prime Minister himself leading delegations on a regular basis to collect Foreign aid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/11/after-khans-visit-pakistan-doubles-down-on-china-dependence/|title=After Khan's Visit, Pakistan Doubles Down on China Dependence|last=Diplomat|first=Tridivesh Singh Maini , The|website=The Diplomat|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/12/10/experts-discuss-pakistans-imran-khans-first-100-days-in-office/|title=Experts discuss Pakistan's Imran Khan's first 100 days in office|last=Saber|first=Israa|date=2018-12-10|website=Brookings|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Asian Development Bank]] will provide close to $6 billion development assistance to Pakistan during 2006\u20139.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?id=480165&currPageNo=1&query=&search=&term=&supDate=|title=Business Recorder [Pakistan's First Financial Daily&#93;|publisher=Brecorder.com|date=2004-01-01|accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> The [[World Bank]] unveiled a lending programme of up to $6.5 billion for Pakistan under a new four-year, 2006\u20132009, aid strategy showing a significant increase in funding aimed largely at beefing up the country's infrastructure.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2006/06/01/afx2788717.html |title=World Bank plans 6.5 bln usd lending to Pakistan |date=2 January 2006 |magazine=Forbes.com |accessdate=6 March 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904191340/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2006/06/01/afx2788717.html |archivedate=4 September 2006 }}</ref> Japan will provide $500 million annual economic aid to Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200605290311.htm|title=Japan to resume USD 500 mn annual funding for Pak|date=29 May 2006|publisher=The Hindu News Update Service|accessdate=2006-06-03|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930221948/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200605290311.htm|archivedate=30 September 2007 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref> In November 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a loan of 7.6 billion to Pakistan, to help stabilise and rebuild the country's economy.

The Pakistanis settled in Western Europe and North America are important sources of remittances to Pakistan.

This decline in remittances is mainly due to the adverse economic conditions of Arabian and gulf countries after the fall in oil prices in 2016. However, the recent development activities in the Qatar FIFA World Cup, Dubai Expo, Saudi Arabia's implementation of its Vision 2030 and particularly the recent visit of the P.M to Kuwait should all be helpful in opening new avenues for employment in these countries .

It received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $117 million worldwide for a budget of $38 million. Raja son kumaran is the real water elephant..\n\n==Plot==\nCharlie O'Brien ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]), Circus Vargas' owner, encounters an elderly man named Jacob Jankowski ([[Robert Pattinson]]), who is separated from his [[nursing home]] group. The two strike up a conversation and Jacob reveals he had a career in the circus business and was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time, equal in seriousness to the 1944 [[Hartford circus fire]] and the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus wreck]].\n\nJankowski tells his story to O'Brien, starting in 1931 when he was a 23-year-old [[veterinary medicine]] student at [[Cornell University]]. During his final exam, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car accident. His father has left huge debts, and the bank was foreclosing on Jacob's home. Feeling there is no point in returning to school, and having no home to go to, he jumps onto a passing train where he meets a kind old man named Camel ([[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]]).\n\nJacob wakes up the next morning and discovers that he jumped on the Benzini Bros. [[circus train]]. He sees a beautiful young woman named Marlena Rosenbluth ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), and meets August ([[Christoph Waltz]]), the circus's ringmaster, head animal trainer, and Marlena's husband. Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and August hires Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver (a show horse) has [[laminitis]].\n\nAugust instructs Jacob to fix Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver's suffering and takes it upon himself to tell Marlena and shoots Silver.  August is furious with Jacob's decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him off the moving train \u2014 telling him that an animal's suffering is nothing compared to a man's, and that Jacob must carry out all of August's future orders if he wishes to keep his job.\n\nAugust eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver's replacement. He invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob watches the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but it becomes clear that their relationship is complicated because August is possessive, jealous and rough with Marlena.\n\nIn the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her with a bullhook when she fails to follow orders. After a brutal beating that August gave to Rosie when she ran away after fleeing from the event and dropping Marlena, Jacob realizes that the elephant only understands [[Polish language|Polish]] commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts the two, even to a point where he forced the two of them to kiss in front of him. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. Soon after consummating their relationship, they are ambushed by August's henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.\n\nJacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. Marlena tells Jacob that his friends Walter ([[Mark Povinelli]]) and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals' cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosie's performance. Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos, but August attacks him. Marlena tries to save Jacob from being beaten by August, but this causes the latter to turn his fury on her. August attempts to kill Marlena by choking her while Jacob fights with one of August's henchmen, who easily defeats him. Wade and Grady (Stephen Monroe Taylor and [[Richard Brake]]), two of Jacob's best friends and one of the circus workers save Jacob, who sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with an iron stake, killing him. As a result, Benzini Bros. is officially shut down, and no one is charged with releasing the animals.\n\nBack in the present, Jacob explains to O'Brien in flashbacks that he returned to Cornell and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several horses and Rosie, and got jobs with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Jacob worked as a veterinarian and she continued to perform with Rosie. They married, had children and kept Rosie until her death. He took on a job as a vet at the Albany Zoo and after more children and many happy years together Marlena died.\n \nO'Brien then asks Jacob to work as the ticket taker, to which Jacob agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Marlena Rosenbluth\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Jacob Jankowski\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as older Jacob Jankowski\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as August Rosenbluth\n* [[Tai (elephant)|Tai]] as Rosie, the elephant\n* [[James Frain]] as Rosie's caretaker\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Charlie O'Brien\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Earl\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Diamond Joe\n* [[Mark Povinelli]] as Kinko/Walter\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]] as Blackie\n* [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as Camel\n* [[Richard Brake]] as Grady\n* [[Sam Anderson]] as Mr. Hyde\n* [[John Aylward]] as Mr. Ervin\n* [[Brad Greenquist]] as Mr. Robinson \n* [[Uggie]] as Queenie, the terrier\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nOn a budget of $38 million,<ref name=\"LABox\">{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/04/movie-projector-water-for-elephants-tyler-perrys-madeas-big-happy-family.html |title=Movie Projector: Tyler Perry's latest 'Madea' film should trample 'Water for Elephants' |last=Kaufman |first=Amy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2011}}</ref> filming began on May 20, 2010 in [[Los Angeles]], [[Piru, California|Piru]], [[Fillmore, California|Fillmore]] in [[California]]; [[Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]]; [[Kensington, Georgia|Kensington]] and [[Chickamauga, Georgia|Chickamauga]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

A spokesperson from the AHA assured people that all scenes of abuse in the film were the work of special effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and that the moaning and crying sounds that Tai is seen making on film were audio tracks, and were not actually made by Tai.\n\nControversy erupted, however, regarding concerns Tai was mistreated prior to filming. A video released by the [[Animal Defenders International]] (ADI) in 2011 shows footage of Tai allegedly being shocked with handheld stun guns and beaten around the body and legs with bull hooks, while in the care of ''Have Trunk Will Travel'' in 2005. The ADI contacted AHA, urging them to re-evaluate how they assess the use of animals in films and the statements being made which effectively endorse the use of performing animals.\n\n''Have Trunk Will Travel'' responded to the video stating, \"The video shows heavily edited and very short snippets, obviously taken surreptitiously six years ago, purporting mistreatment of our elephants. If there was truly any abuse going on why wait six minutes, much less six years?\" and added \"None of the footage being shown was taken during Tai's training for Water for Elephants.\"\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 60% based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10.

It received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $117 million worldwide for a budget of $38 million.\n\n==Plot==\nCharlie O'Brien ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]), Circus Vargas' owner, encounters an elderly man named Jacob Jankowski ([[Robert Pattinson]]), who is separated from his [[nursing home]] group. The two strike up a conversation and Jacob reveals he had a career in the circus business and was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time, equal in seriousness to the 1944 [[Hartford circus fire]] and the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus wreck]].\n\nJankowski tells his story to O'Brien, starting in 1931 when he was a 23-year-old [[veterinary medicine]] student at [[Cornell University]]. During his final exam, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car accident. His father has left huge debts, and the bank was foreclosing on Jacob's home. Feeling there is no point in returning to school, and having no home to go to, he jumps onto a passing train where he meets a kind old man named Camel ([[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]]).\n\nJacob wakes up the next morning and discovers that he jumped on the Benzini Bros. [[circus train]]. He sees a beautiful young woman named Marlena Rosenbluth ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), and meets August ([[Christoph Waltz]]), the circus's ringmaster, head animal trainer, and Marlena's husband. Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and August hires Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver (a show horse) has [[laminitis]].\n\nAugust instructs Jacob to fix Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver's suffering and takes it upon himself to tell Marlena and shoots Silver.  August is furious with Jacob's decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him off the moving train \u2014 telling him that an animal's suffering is nothing compared to a man's, and that Jacob must carry out all of August's future orders if he wishes to keep his job.\n\nAugust eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver's replacement. He invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob watches the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but it becomes clear that their relationship is complicated because August is possessive, jealous and rough with Marlena.\n\nIn the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her with a bullhook when she fails to follow orders. After a brutal beating that August gave to Rosie when she ran away after fleeing from the event and dropping Marlena, Jacob realizes that the elephant only understands [[Polish language|Polish]] commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts the two, even to a point where he forced the two of them to kiss in front of him. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. Soon after consummating their relationship, they are ambushed by August's henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.\n\nJacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. Marlena tells Jacob that his friends Walter ([[Mark Povinelli]]) and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals' cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosie's performance. Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos, but August attacks him. Marlena tries to save Jacob from being beaten by August, but this causes the latter to turn his fury on her. August attempts to kill Marlena by choking her while Jacob fights with one of August's henchmen, who easily defeats him. Wade and Grady (Stephen Monroe Taylor and [[Richard Brake]]), two of Jacob's best friends and one of the circus workers save Jacob, who sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with an iron stake, killing him. As a result, Benzini Bros. is officially shut down, and no one is charged with releasing the animals.\n\nBack in the present, Jacob explains to O'Brien in flashbacks that he returned to Cornell and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several horses and Rosie, and got jobs with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Jacob worked as a veterinarian and she continued to perform with Rosie. They married, had children and kept Rosie until her death. He took on a job as a vet at the Albany Zoo and after more children and many happy years together Marlena died.\n \nO'Brien then asks Jacob to work as the ticket taker, to which Jacob agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Marlena Rosenbluth\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Jacob Jankowski\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as older Jacob Jankowski\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as August Rosenbluth\n* [[Tai (elephant)|Tai]] as Rosie, the elephant\n* [[James Frain]] as Rosie's caretaker\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Charlie O'Brien\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Earl\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Diamond Joe\n* [[Mark Povinelli]] as Kinko/Walter\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]] as Blackie\n* [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as Camel\n* [[Richard Brake]] as Grady\n* [[Sam Anderson]] as Mr. Hyde\n* [[John Aylward]] as Mr. Ervin\n* [[Brad Greenquist]] as Mr. Robinson \n* [[Uggie]] as Queenie, the terrier\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nOn a budget of $38 million,<ref name=\"LABox\">{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/04/movie-projector-water-for-elephants-tyler-perrys-madeas-big-happy-family.html |title=Movie Projector: Tyler Perry's latest 'Madea' film should trample 'Water for Elephants' |last=Kaufman |first=Amy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2011}}</ref> filming began on May 20, 2010 in [[Los Angeles]], [[Piru, California|Piru]], [[Fillmore, California|Fillmore]] in [[California]]; [[Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]]; [[Kensington, Georgia|Kensington]] and [[Chickamauga, Georgia|Chickamauga]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

A spokesperson from the AHA assured people that all scenes of abuse in the film were the work of special effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and that the moaning and crying sounds that Tai is seen making on film were audio tracks, and were not actually made by Tai.\n\nControversy erupted, however, regarding concerns Tai was mistreated prior to filming. A video released by the [[Animal Defenders International]] (ADI) in 2011 shows footage of Tai allegedly being shocked with handheld stun guns and beaten around the body and legs with bull hooks, while in the care of ''Have Trunk Will Travel'' in 2005. The ADI contacted AHA, urging them to re-evaluate how they assess the use of animals in films and the statements being made which effectively endorse the use of performing animals.\n\n''Have Trunk Will Travel'' responded to the video stating, \"The video shows heavily edited and very short snippets, obviously taken surreptitiously six years ago, purporting mistreatment of our elephants. If there was truly any abuse going on why wait six minutes, much less six years?\" and added \"None of the footage being shown was taken during Tai's training for Water for Elephants.\"\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 60% based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the ''goal crease'' (often referred to simply as '' the crease'' or ''the net''). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater, but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty (if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop).\n\nThe goaltender is also known as the ''goalie,''{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|pp=87\u201388}} ''goaler,''{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|p=88}} ''goalkeeper,''{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|p=88}} ''net minder,'' and ''tender'' by those involved in the hockey community. In the early days of the sport, the term was spelled with a hyphen as ''goal-tender.''{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|p=88}} The art of playing the position is called ''goaltending'' and there are coaches, usually called the ''goalie coach'' who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders.{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|p=88}} The variation goalie is typically used for items associated with the position, such as ''goalie stick'' and ''goalie pads''.\n\n==Goaltenders in ice hockey==\n===Roster===\nGoaltending is a specialized position in ice hockey; at higher levels in the game, no goaltenders play other positions and no other players play goaltender. At minor levels and recreational games, goaltenders do occasionally switch with others players that have been taught goaltending; however, most recreational hockey rules are now forbidding position swapping due to an increase in injuries.\n\nA typical ice hockey team may have two or three goaltenders on its roster. Most teams typically have a starting goaltender who plays the majority of the regular season games and all of the playoffs, with the [[#Back-up_goaltender|backup goaltender]] only stepping in if the starter is pulled or injured, or in cases where the schedule is too heavy for one goaltender to play every game.\n\nThe NHL requires each team have a list of \"emergency\" goaltenders. The list provides goaltender options for both the home and visiting teams. These goaltenders are to be called to a game if a team does not have two goaltenders to start the game. An \"emergency\" goaltender may also be called if both roster goaltenders are injured in the same game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2017/01/06/emergency-goalie-the-most-unique-one-day-job-in-sports/96265280/|title=Emergency goalie: The most unusual 1-day job in sports|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=March 30, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212607/https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2017/01/06/emergency-goalie-the-most-unique-one-day-job-in-sports/96265280/|archivedate=March 30, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Goalie tandem====\nSome teams have used a goaltender tandem where two goaltenders split the regular season playing duties, though often one of them is considered the number one goaltender who gets the start in the playoffs. An example is the 1982-83 [[New York Islanders]] with [[Billy Smith (ice hockey)|Billy Smith]] and [[Roland Melanson]]; Melanson was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team for his regular season play while Smith won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the playoff MVP and both players shared the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for fewest goals allowed. Another instance is the [[Edmonton Oilers]]' [[Andy Moog]] and [[Grant Fuhr]]; both of them earned [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearances for the regular season play, with Moog being the starter in the 1983 playoffs and Fuhr for the 1984 playoffs (although Moog started Game 4 and 5 of the 1984 Stanley Cup Finals due to Fuhr's injury) and subsequent postseasons.\n\nThe [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] had [[Terry Sawchuk]] and [[Johnny Bower]] share goaltending duties in the regular season and playoffs, winning the 1964\u201365 [[Vezina Trophy]] (shared) and the 1967 [[Stanley Cup]].

He wears special [[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|goaltending equipment]] that is different from that worn by other players and is subject to specific regulations. Goaltenders may use any part of their bodies to block shots. The goaltender may legally hold (or freeze) the puck with his hands to cause a stoppage of play. If a player from the other team hits the goaltender without making an attempt to get out of his way, the offending player may be penalized. In some leagues (including the NHL), if a goaltender's stick breaks, he can continue playing with a broken stick until the play is stopped, unlike other players who must drop any broken sticks immediately.\n\nAdditionally, if a goaltender acts in such a way that would cause a normal player to be given a penalty, such as slashing or tripping another player, the goaltender cannot be sent to the penalty box. Instead, one of the goaltender's teammates who was on the ice at the time of the infraction is sent to the penalty box in his place. However, the goaltender does receive the penalty minutes on the scoresheet. If the goaltender receives a Game Misconduct or Match [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]], he is removed from the ice and a replacement goaltender is played.\n\nNormally, the goaltender plays in or near the goal crease the entire game, unlike the other positions where players are on ice for shifts and make line changes. However, goaltenders are often pulled if they have allowed several goals in a short period of time, whether they were at fault for the surrendered goals or not, and usually a substituted goaltender does not return for the rest of the game. In 1995, [[Patrick Roy]] was famously [[Patrick Roy#Trade to Colorado|kept in net]] by the head coach as \"humiliation\" despite allowing nine goals on 26 shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2012030312&navid=sc.com-series-recap|title=Boston Bruins at Pittsburgh Penguins - 06/03/2013|work=NHL.com|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609035455/http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2012030312&navid=sc.com-series-recap|archivedate=June 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=145407|title=404|work=TSN|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224093010/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=145407|archivedate=December 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[List of goaltenders who have scored a goal in an NHL game|Eleven goaltenders]] have scored a total of fourteen goals in [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an [[Own goal#Ice hockey|''own goal'']]. A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; in the case of own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/sports/it-s-snow-as-flyers-switch-goalies.html?scp=574&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |title=It's Snow As Flyers Switch Goalies |work=The New York Times |last=Diamos |first=Jason |date=June 3, 1997 |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108133950/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/sports/it-s-snow-as-flyers-switch-goalies.html?scp=574&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/sports/legion-of-brooms-red-wings-wait-ends-with-sweep.html?scp=580&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |title=Legion of Brooms: Red Wings' Wait Ends With Sweep |work=The New York Times |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |date=June 8, 1997 |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108133541/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/sports/legion-of-brooms-red-wings-wait-ends-with-sweep.html?scp=580&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nA team is not required to use a goaltender. At any time in a game, a team may remove its goaltender from the ice in favor of an [[extra attacker]]. Using an extra attacker is usually intended to overwhelm the opposing team's defense, and unlike during a [[power play (sporting term)|power play]], the defense cannot legally [[icing (ice hockey)|ice the puck]], (if they are not already shorthanded due to a penalty. If the team on defense is serving a penalty, then the usual icing rules prevail.) putting the team without a goaltender at a significant advantage on offense. The vulnerability that comes with leaving the net untended means that, if the opposing team does manage to advance the puck out of their own defensive zone, a far easier [[empty net goal]] can be scored. NHL rules strongly encourage that teams use goaltenders in [[overtime (sport)|overtime]]; if a team opts for the extra attacker in overtime and an empty-net goal is scored, the game is credited as a regulation loss instead of an overtime loss. (An overtime loss earns one standings point, as opposed to two for a win of any sort and none for a regulation loss or overtime loss incurred under an empty net.) Teams thus typically forgo using a goaltender only in situations where they are trailing by one or two goals with only a short time (typically less than four minutes) left in the game and have possession of the puck in their opponent's defensive zone.\n\nThe rules of the IIHF, NHL and Hockey Canada do not permit goaltenders to be designated as on-ice [[Captain (ice hockey)|captains]],<ref name=\"IIHF-rules\">{{cite web |title=IIHF Rule Book |publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation |url= http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html |format=PDF |accessdate=October 18, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002092827/http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html |archivedate=October 2, 2008 |df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"NHL-rules\">{{cite web|author=National Hockey League |title=National Hockey League Official Rules |publisher=Triumph Books |year=2007 |url= http://www.nhl.com/rules/index.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050925113900/http://www.nhl.com/rules/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 25, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 20, 2007}}</ref> because of the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches and then return to the [[Crease (hockey)|crease]].

Goaltenders often use a particular style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goaltender's own team to get control of the puck. Goaltenders may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goaltender may choose to hold on to the puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goaltender holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute [[Delay of game (ice hockey)|delay of game]] penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goaltenders have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.\n\n{{See also|shot on goal|save percentage|goals against average}}\n\n===Glossary and techniques===\n* '''Angle play:''' The method where, by positioning himself in a direct line between the puck (not the shooter) and the net, a goaltender covers more of the net than he would otherwise be able to, and often \"skulling\" slowly, directly towards and closing on the opposing shooter to block more of the net. Two of the most notable angle goaltenders in the 1970s were [[Gilles Gilbert]] and [[Bernie Parent]].\n* '''[[Blocker (ice hockey)|Blocker]]:''' The blocker is a rectangular piece of equipment with a glove to hold the stick. The blocker is predominantly worn on the dominant hand of the goaltender. The blocker protects the wrist area and can be used to direct shots away from the net. The blocker should be positioned at one's side, and at a height which allows the goaltender's stick to remain flat on the ice while in their ready stance.\n* '''[[Trapper (ice hockey)|Trapper]]:''' This goalie's catching glove was originally shaped in the same fashion as a [[baseball glove]]. It has evolved into a highly specific piece of equipment that is designed specifically for catching the puck. Some of the more significant changes are the use of a \"string mesh\" in the pocket of the trapper and the substantial palm and wrist protection. The pocket is the area between the thumb and first finger of the glove and is where most goaltenders try to catch the puck; catching in the pocket reduces the chance of a rebound falling out of the glove. The trapper must not be more than 18 inches across. The trapper can be held in a variety of positions depending upon the individual goaltender, but the trend among younger goaltenders is to hold the glove with the palm facing towards the shooter, instead of the \"shake hands\" position that was popular previously. The \"Cheater\" portion of the glove is the portion of the glove on the outside area of the thumb and the part that covers the wrist of the goaltender.\n* '''Butterfly save:''' On low shots, modern goaltenders usually work in the \"butterfly\" position, keeping their knees together and their stick covering their [[five-hole]], or knee gap. A fairly new, more effective way of stopping low shots is to redirect the puck with the stick. The goalie does this by rotating their hips, their glove and stick square with the puck as they direct it to the corner to the left or right of them, depending on which side the puck is shot to, rather than kicking the puck way out of reach. The glove is kept up and out, ready for a possible deflection, and the goaltender is focused on the incoming shot. Goaltenders should keep both arms out in front of them at all times, covering the gaps between the goaltender's arms and body (sometimes called the 7 and 11 holes), and making it easier to direct rebounds with the stick and blocker.\n* '''Butterfly slide:''' On breakaways or any other movement goaltenders should be using this technique to make \"proper saves\". To perform this goaltender move, you must use your leg to push off with your skate and with one knee hovering just above the ice while using your other skate to push your body side to side.\n* '''Hasek roll:''' The Hasek roll is a desperation maneuver named after Czech goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek]]. In the stacked pad stance the lower part of the net is protected very well, but the upper third is completely open. In a last-ditch effort to block an incoming high shot the goaltender can roll around his upper back, flailing his pads through the air and stacking them on the other side. If the timing is right the goalie might get his leg up just in time to make the save.\n[[File:Goalie-holes.png|thumb|right|The holes on the goal.]]\n* '''Holes one through five:''' When a goaltender stands in the net in the ready position, there are seven open areas that the goalie must cover.<ref>{{cite web|last=Korn|first=Mitch|title=A hole is a hole is hole|url=http://www.hockeyplayer.com/artman/publish/article_487.shtml|website=hockeyplayer.com|accessdate=February 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524141733/http://www.hockeyplayer.com/artman/publish/article_487.shtml|archivedate=May 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They are:\n# Glove side, high: this area is defined by the goaltender's arm and catcher on the bottom, mask on the inside, and the post and top of the goal on the outside.\n# Glove side, low: this area is defined by the goaltender's arm and catcher on the top, the ice on the bottom, and the outside post of the goal. During a butterfly-style save, this area is closed off completely and the catcher is typically stacked on top of the leg pad as the leg is extended to cover the post.\n# Stick side, high: this area is defined by the goal post, top of the goal, and the goalie's arm and blocker. The top half of the goaltender's stick is held in this area, but is not commonly used for stopping the puck.\n# Stick side, low: this area is the lower half of the stick side, defined by the blocker and arm, the ice, and the outer post of the goal. During a butterfly save this area is also covered by the leg pad with the blocker stacked on top to protect against low shots. When a goaltender is standing, the paddle of their stick is used to cover this area and to deflect the puck away from the net.\n# 'Five Hole': the fifth and final area is between the goalie's leg pads and skates. This area is protected by the blade of the stick at all times, and is closed up by the upper leg pads when the goalie is in the butterfly position.\n# 'Six and Seven Hole': the six and seven holes are relatively new terms to identify the areas under either armpit of the goalie. Goaltenders who hold their trapper high or blocker further out to the side of their body are said to have six and seven holes. \n# 'Six Hole (slang)': The \"six hole\" is also used as a slang term used when a save is made, but the puck goes into the net, resulting in a goal. The term is used when the goalie is unsure how the puck made it past him or her.\n\n* '''Leg pads:''' Worn on the goaltender's legs to both protect the legs and help stop shots. Current NHL Rules have reduced leg pad width to {{convert|11|in|mm}}; the overall height is restricted based upon an individual proportionally. The leg pads generally come to about three inches above the knee. Pads that are too long will affect balance and timing; pads that are too short will not protect the knees or allow the goaltender to make butterfly saves properly.\n* '''(Leg) kick save:''' A save made with any part of the leg pads. The goaltender should remain relaxed and skate backwards with the incoming shot, thus helping to absorb the blow and reduce the rebound effect. One type of leg pad save is the butterfly save.\n* '''Lie:''' The angle created between the handle (paddle) of a goaltender's stick and the blade. The higher the lie, the closer the stick resembles the capital letter \"L\". A higher lie number of 15+ is traditionally for goaltenders who tend to stand up more in their stance; A lower lie number of 11 or 12 is for goaltenders who play with a more butterfly stance down on the ice more often.\n* '''[[Goaltender mask|Mask]]''': The protective headgear worn by goaltenders. The first goaltender to wear a mask in the National Hockey League was [[Clint Benedict]] in 1930 who wore a crude form made of leather.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sporting News |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/article/2009-10-30/fifty-years-after-plantes-breakthrough-goalie-mask-about-sanity-not-toughness |title=Fifty years after Plante's breakthrough, goalie mask is about sanity, not toughness |last=Custance |first=Craig |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207043325/http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/article/2009-10-30/fifty-years-after-plantes-breakthrough-goalie-mask-about-sanity-not-toughness |archivedate=December 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In November 1959, [[Jacques Plante]], wore a self-made fiberglass mask after taking a [[New York Rangers]] shot to the face. Following his lead, goaltenders around the world began to don protective headgear, which is now a requirement. Masks have evolved from the flush style introduced by Plante, to the player's helmet/special \"birdcage\" style best associated with [[Vladislav Tretiak]] and [[Chris Osgood]], to the modern hybrid helmet, made of advanced materials such as carbon fiber or [[Kevlar]], increasing in safety as time went on. Especially at higher levels of hockey, many goaltenders have their masks painted to represent their team's colors/imagery, landmarks in the city they play in or personal interests/nicknames. Examples of this include [[Mike Richter]]'s [[Statue of Liberty]] mask, [[Ed Belfour]]'s Eagle on his mask (Eddie the Eagle nickname), [[Ryan Miller (ice hockey)|Ryan Miller]] featuring the words \"Matt Man\" on his masks in honor of his late cousin, and [[Craig Anderson (ice hockey)|Craig Anderson]] honouring his father's [[National Corvette Museum]] board service (as a former Corvette racer) by having a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] on his masks.\n* '''Paddle:''' The thick part of the goaltender's stick, not to be confused with the blade. The paddle has a maximum length of {{convert|26|in|mm}} in the NHL. The blade is the part of the stick that should remain flat on the ice, as compared with the paddle.\n* '''Paddle down:''' A type of stance by the goaltender when the play is coming from the corner to the front of the net and the puck carrier is carrying the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or [[Glossary of ice hockey terms#W|wrap around]]s where the skater would normally out\u2013skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.\n* '''Poke check:''' When the goaltender wants to poke the puck away from an opposing player, he quickly slides his hand up the stick, thrusting forward towards the puck. An improperly played poke check is a risky play; the goaltender may miss, and the puck-carrier will be left with an unguarded net. In tight situations, a quick, hard jab could be used.\n* '''Pro-fly:''' This style of play is derived from the butterfly style of play, although most will argue that this is nothing more than a marketing term. Current leg pad design allows for the full face of the pad to be perpendicular to the ice, maximizing blocking area. This is also called \"flaring the pad\", almost all modern goaltenders play this style. The stance is very wide and low to maximize the amount of body blocking the net. Many of today's great goaltenders have adopted this technique. This forces the shooter to get the puck off the ice to score. The con of this stance is that it is very hard to move quickly. The more efficient users of this style include [[Henrik Lundqvist]] of the New York Rangers, [[Jonathan Quick]] of the Los Angeles Kings, and [[Roberto Luongo]] of the Florida Panthers. This is still considered a butterfly motion, as the mechanics of making the save are the same, however it is the design of the leg pad that achieves this rotation more than anything.\n* '''Screen shot:''' Screen shots are blind shots, in which the goalie can not find the location of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do everything possible to try to see the shot, as dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as [[Ed Belfour]] or [[Ron Hextall]], went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.\n* '''Shuffle:''' A technique for lateral movement when the puck is relatively close to the net. The goaltender slides his legs, one at a time, in the desired direction. If the goaltender is not quick this technique momentarily leaves the five-hole open. This is the most common method of movement for a goaltender when in the butterfly position.\n* '''Skate save:''' A save made with the goaltender's skate. The goaltender decides which direction the rebound should travel in, and turns his skate in that direction. Then, bending the other leg, he pushes towards the puck with the off leg, as the bent knee drops to the ice. This move is rarely used since the butterfly method has become popular. A skate save's effectiveness is more limited because of the difficulty in directing a puck compared with using a stick, a blocker, or the pad.\n* '''Skating:''' A common fallacy is that the goaltender can get by with merely adequate skating, and often young players are placed in net because of their poor skating. In fact, the goaltender must be one of the best technical skaters on the team, and must be able to keep up with the moves of every skater on opposing teams. In particular, goaltenders must be adept at lateral skating and quick pivoting. Goaltenders must also have exceptional leg strength and the capability for very explosive movement.\n* '''Stacked Pad Slide:''' When a goaltender is on the angle, often a sudden pass close to the net will leave the net relatively unguarded. Stacking the pads is a desperation move in which the goaltender slides feet-first, with legs together (and consequently, \"stacked\"), across the crease, attempting to cover as much space as possible.\n* '''Stance:''' In a proper stance, the goaltender has the weight on the balls of his feet, the trapper and blocker just above knee-height and slightly out in front so they can be seen in the goalies peripheral vision, and the stick flat on the ice. Stance should also be conformed to the goaltender's style and comfort.\n* '''Stick:''' The stick, held by the goaltender in their blocker hand, the blade of the stick should remain flat on the ice. Keep notice of the lie on a new stick. A high lie will force a goaltender to play on their heels, offsetting balance, while a low lie places a goaltender lower to the ice, and may affect high saves.\n* '''Stick save:''' A save made with the goaltender's stick. On stick saves, the goaltender should not keep a tight grip on the stick, instead allowing the shot's momentum to push the stick back into the skates/pads, cushioning the blow.\n*{{anchor|Stood on his head}} '''Stood on his head:''' This is a term to describe an outstanding performance by an ice hockey goaltender in a short period of time. Often when a goalie lets out a rebound, the opposition returns the shot quickly, and the goalie has to make a quick save. A goalie often falls on his side and \"stacks the pads\" and appears to nearly stand on their head. The term may have been derived after NHL President [[Frank Calder]], alluding to the 1918 rules change that permitted goalies to leave their feet to make a save, remarked, \"As far as I am concerned, they can stand on their head(s).\"<ref>''The Hockey News: Century Of Hockey'', 1st ed. 2000, p. 20 - \"As far as I am concerned, they can stand on their head(s). ''NHL president Frank Calder, announcing goalies can leave their feet to stop a puck''\"</ref>\n* ''''T-push:'''' A technique used by goaltenders to move in a lateral direction. To perform a C-step, a goaltender directs his outside skate at the desired angle, pushing with the opposite leg, covering the five hole. This method of lateral movement is most effective when the puck is far from the net. Use of this move when the puck is in close is not needed. Shuffling is good when the puck is in close.\n* '''Skulling:''' Skulling is a method of moving inward and outward from the goal crease, often used in \"angle play\". Most often used in setting up prior to the puck entering their zone, especially to \"cut down the angle\", this move is accomplished by simply allowing your skates to separate, resulting in forward motion, then pulling your skates back together and stopping. At no time during a skull do your skates leave the ice. This can also be referred to as telescoping or bubbling.\n\n===Playing styles===\n====Stand-up style====\nThe oldest playing style is the '''stand-up style'''. In this style, goaltenders are to stop the puck from a standing position, not going down. The goaltenders may bend over to stop the puck with their upper body or may kick the puck. Such saves made by kicking are known as kick saves or skate saves. They may also simply use their stick to stop it, known as a stick save. This was the style seen in the early NHL and was most commonly used up until the early 60s. One of the more notable goaltenders who was last seen using stand up was [[Bill Ranford]], but most of the goaltenders from earlier decades such as [[Jacques Plante]] were considered pure stand up goaltenders.\n\nAs the name suggests, the ''stand-up style'' refers to a style of goaltending in which the goaltender makes the majority of the saves standing up. This style is not as popular in the modern era, with the majority of contemporary goaltenders switching to the [[butterfly style]] and the hybrid style. The stand-up style is in contrast to the butterfly style, where goaltenders protect the net against incoming shots by dropping to their knees and shifting their legs out.\n\nThe advantage of the stand-up style is in the continued mobility of the goaltender mid save. While standing, a stand-up goaltender can remain square to the puck and adjust his positioning to ensure that he is covering as much of the net as possible at all times. The goaltender is also in a better position to stop pucks that are headed towards the upper part of the net.\n\nThe main disadvantage of the stand-up style, however, is a susceptibility to shots travelling along the bottom half of the net. A larger percentage of shots occur in the bottom portion of the net, and a goaltender utilizing the butterfly will cover a larger portion of that area. If there is a screen, however, a stand-up goaltender is generally in a better position to see the [[slapshot]].\n\n====Butterfly style====\n{{main|Butterfly style}}\n\nAnother style is the \"Butterfly\", where goaltenders go down on both pads with their toes pointing outwards and the tops of their pads meeting in the middle, thus closing up the [[five-hole|five hole]]. This results in a \"wall\" of padding without any holes, lowering the chances of low angle shots getting in. These goaltenders rely on timing and position. Early innovators of this style were goaltending greats [[Glenn Hall]] and [[Tony Esposito]] who played during the 50s-60s and 70s-80s, respectively. Hall is credited to be among the very first to use this style, and both he and Esposito had tremendous success with it. The most successful goaltender to adopt this style was Patrick Roy, who has 550 career wins in the NHL. This is the most widely used style in the NHL today. \"Butterfly\" goaltenders have developed methods of sliding in the \"Butterfly\" position in order to move around fast in one-timer situations. As pad size increased, it became a more notable style of goaltending and is still evolving.\n\n====Hybrid style====\nThis style of goaltending is a combination of both stand-up and butterfly style, where the goaltender primarily relies on reaction, save selection, and positioning to make saves. Hybrid goaltenders will usually control rebounds well, deflect low shots with their sticks, will utilize the butterfly, and are generally not as predictable as goaltenders who rely heavily on the butterfly as a save selection. Most players are not pure stand-up or butterfly, but simply tend to prefer stand-up or butterfly over the other. If a player does not have any preferences, he is considered a hybrid goaltender. All modern NHL goaltenders generally use some form of this style. Some goaltenders who do this effectively are [[Ryan Miller]], [[Jaroslav Hal\u00e1k]], [[Jimmy Howard]], [[Tuukka Rask]], [[Carey Price]] and formerly [[Evgeni Nabokov]] and [[Martin Brodeur]].\n\n===Empty net situations===\n[[File:Delayed penalty.jpg|thumb|300px|A delayed penalty call situation, in which the referee (top-left) indicates a coming penalty by raising his arm, and prepares to blow the whistle when a player from the team to be penalized (in white) touches the puck. Goaltender [[Jere Myllyniemi]] can be seen (right) rushing to the bench to send on an extra attacker.]]\n\nNormally, the goaltender plays in or near the goal crease the entire game. However, teams may legally ''pull the goalie'' by substituting in a normal skater and taking the goaltender off the ice. A team temporarily playing with no goaltender is said to be playing with an ''empty net''. This gives the team an extra attacker, but at significant risk\u2014if the opposing team gains control of the puck, they may easily score a goal. However, shooters that attempt to score on an empty net from the opposite side of the red line face getting called for [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]] the puck if they miss the net. There are two common situations where a goaltender is generally pulled, as well as two less common situations:\n\n:1. '''The opposing team has a [[delayed penalty]] coming against them'''\n::The offended team, if in control of the puck, will pull their goaltender for an extra man. This is safe since as soon as a player on the team to be penalized touches the puck, the whistle is called, so they cannot score on the empty net. This effectively increases the one-man disadvantage beyond the standard penalty time. It is possible, however, for a team to accidentally score on their own empty net.\n:2. '''A team needs a goal in order to avoid losing (such as trailing in the remaining minute or two of a game)'''\n::The 6 on 5 play advantage is very risky, as it is fairly certain that if the opposing team gets control of the puck they will be able to [[Empty net goal|score on the empty net]]. Sometimes if a team is trailing in the last minutes of regulation, and has a power play advantage, they may pull the goaltender for a 6 on 4 or even 6 on 3 advantage.\n:3. '''In the last few seconds of a period with a faceoff in the attacking zone'''\n::Because the defending team would likely not have enough time to start an attack even if they win the faceoff, the attacking team may pull the goalie to have a short man advantage.\n:4. '''In a tournament that takes goal differential into account, a team may pull the goalie with a significant amount of time left in an effort to create a more advantageous goal differential.'''\n::If the team could be eliminated even if they win but could still advance with a loss based on goal differential, the team may decide it has nothing to lose by trying to score with a man advantage, similar to the second situation.\nA goal scored in an empty net situation is not recorded as a shot faced or goal against on the personal stats of the goaltender who has left the ice.\n\n===Back-up goaltender===\nIn professional ice hockey, the back-up goaltender fills an important team role. Although the back-up will spend most games sitting on the bench, the back-up must be prepared to play every game. A back-up may be forced into duty at any time to relieve the starting goaltender in the event of an injury or poor game performance. The back-up will also be called upon to start some games to give the starter the opportunity to rest from game-play during the [[Season (sports)|season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/top-five-nhl-backup-goalies/|title=Net worth: Top 5 NHL backup goalies|author=Rogers Digital Media|work=Sportsnet.ca|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134704/http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/top-five-nhl-backup-goalies/|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMost professional leagues require each home team to maintain a list of local non-professional goaltenders, available to either team, who can be used in the exceptional case that one or both of a team's normal goaltenders are injured or unavailable (such as a player acquired in a trade or minor league call-up arriving late on short notice); such a goaltender who fulfills that role is known as an '''emergency back\u2013up goaltender''' (or EBUG).<ref name=\"emergency\">{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/sports/hockey/nhls-emergency-goalies-are-ready-to-answer-the-call.html |title = N.H.L.'s Emergency Goalies Are Ready to Answer the Call |agency = Associated Press |date = January 7, 2017 |work = The New York Times |access-date = March 30, 2018 |language = en-US |issn = 0362-4331 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180330043741/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/sports/hockey/nhls-emergency-goalies-are-ready-to-answer-the-call.html |archivedate = March 30, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"emgnhl\">[https://www.nhl.com/news/nhls-emergency-goalies-live-on-edge/c-278299936 NHL.com: \"NHL's emergency goalies live on edge\"]</ref> Similar rules are in place for the [[Minor league#Ice Hockey|NHL's minor leagues]], where emergency goaltenders are used much more frequently.<ref name=\"emgnhl\"/> Those on a team's emergency list are given free attendance to home games they are assigned and may also help out as a practice goalie.<ref name=\"emgnhl\"/> Emergency goalies are often called from nearby [[College ice hockey|college teams]], adult semi-pro/amateur leagues, or the home team's own coaching/facilities staff.<ref name=\"emergency\"/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HubXdsr3c9M \"NHL: Emergency Goalies\" (YouTube)]</ref> If activated for a game, most emergency goaltenders only dress to sit on the bench, as a team's normal back-up takes over; only three emergency goalies ([[David Ayres]], [[Scott Foster (ice hockey)|Scott Foster]], and [[Jorge Alves (ice hockey)|Jorge Alves]]) have ever seen recorded playing time in an NHL game.

NHL rules forbid goaltenders from participating in play past the center line, so a goal by a goaltender is possible only under unusual circumstances.\n\nEight of those fifteen goals resulted from the goaltender shooting into an empty net. The remaining seven goals were not actually shot into the net by the goaltender; rather the goaltender was awarded the goal because he was the last player on his team to touch the puck before the opposition scored on themselves. [[Martin Brodeur]] is the only NHL goaltender to be credited with three career goals (two in the regular season and one in the playoffs), [[Ron Hextall]] is the only goaltender who has scored two goals by shooting the puck into an empty net (once in the regular season and once in the playoffs). [[Damian Rhodes]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore]] are the only goaltenders in NHL history to score a goal in which they also had a [[shutout]] game. [[Evgeni Nabokov]] of the [[San Jose Sharks]] was the first goaltender to score a power play goal. If a goaltender crosses the center line and shoots the puck from that location or any other location past the center line, the goal does not count.\n\n===NHL===\n{{main|List of goaltenders who have scored a goal in an NHL game}}\n\n===AHL===\nA chronological list of goals scored in the AHL by goaltenders:<ref>[http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=8401 \" MacIntyre makes history in unlikely Moose win - AHL Goals Scored by a Goaltender:\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324035928/http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=8401 |date=March 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n* [[Darcy Wakaluk]], December 5, 1987, [[Rochester Americans]] at Utica\n* [[Paul Cohen (ice hockey)|Paul Cohen]], March 28, 1992, [[Springfield Indians]] vs. Rochester\n* [[Robb Stauber]], October 9, 1995, [[Rochester Americans]] at Prince Edward Island\n* [[Christian Bronsard]], October 30, 1999, [[Syracuse Crunch]] at Rochester\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Labb\u00e9]], February 5, 2000, [[Hartford Wolf Pack]] at Quebec\n* [[Chris Mason (ice hockey)|Chris Mason]], October 15, 2001, [[Milwaukee Admirals]] at Utah\n* [[Antero Niittym\u00e4ki]], April 11, 2004, [[Philadelphia Phantoms]] at Hershey\n* [[Seamus Kotyk]], April 17, 2005, [[Milwaukee Admirals]] at San Antonio\n* [[Drew MacIntyre]], February 20, 2008, [[Manitoba Moose]] at Chicago (overtime winner)\n* [[Chris Holt (ice hockey)|Chris Holt]], March 19, 2010, [[Binghamton Senators]] vs. Rochester\n* [[Reto Berra]], January 16, 2015, [[Lake Erie Monsters]] at Chicago Wolves\n* [[Alex Nedeljkovic]], March 10th, 2018, [[Charlotte Checkers]] vs. Hartford\n* [[Tristan Jarry]], November 14, 2018, [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]] at Springfield\n* [[Maxime Lagac\u00e9]], May 25, 2019, [[Chicago Wolves]] at San Diego (first ever goalie goal in Calder Cup Playoffs history)<ref name=\"lagace\">{{Cite web |url=https://theahl.com/lagace-credited-with-goal-in-wolves-win |title=Lagace credited with goal in Wolves win |date=May 26, 2019 |website=[[American Hockey League]] |access-date=July 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===ECHL===\nA chronological list of goals scored in the ECHL by goaltenders:\n\n* [[Corwin Saurdiff]], March 18, 1995, [[Hampton Roads Admirals]] versus [[Charlotte Checkers (ECHL)|Charlotte Checkers]]\n* [[Olie Sundstrom]], December 15, 1995,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://articles.dailypress.com/1995-12-20/sports/9512200002_1_hampton-roads-echl-commissioner-pat-kelly-penalty | title = Admirals Briefs: Erie Goalie Joins Saurdiff As Scorer | author = Al Pearce | website = DailyPress.com | date = December 20, 1995 | accessdate = January 5, 2011 | url-status=live | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111101195536/http://articles.dailypress.com/1995-12-20/sports/9512200002_1_hampton-roads-echl-commissioner-pat-kelly-penalty | archivedate = November 1, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> [[Erie Panthers]] versus [[Wheeling Nailers]]\n* [[Sean Gauthier]], December 19, 1995<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stingrayshockey.com/team/teamnews/index.html?article_id=1106&content_type=printable&plugin_id=news.front.system&block_id=5001 | title = 50 Moments in Stingrays History | author = | website = StingraysHockey.com | date = January 5, 2011 | accessdate = January 5, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143740/http://www.stingrayshockey.com/team/teamnews/index.html?article_id=1106&content_type=printable&plugin_id=news.front.system&block_id=5001 | archivedate = July 16, 2011 | df = }}</ref> at [[Raleigh IceCaps]]\n* [[Nick Vitucci]], March 6, 1996, [[Charlotte Checkers (1993-2010)|Charlotte Checkers]] versus [[Louisville RiverFrogs]] (Vitucci is the only goalie to be credited with a goal on a guarded net)\n* [[Mark Bernard]], March 22, 2001, [[Toledo Storm]] versus [[Johnstown Chiefs]]\n* Mike Smith, October 26, 2002, [[Lexington Men O'War]] versus [[Dayton Bombers]]\n* [[Brian Eklund]], December 5, 2003, [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]] at [[Mississippi Sea Wolves]]\n* [[Trevor Koenig]], March 2, 2005, [[Atlantic City Boardwalk Bullies]] at [[Wheeling Nailers]]\n* [[Jonathan Quick]], October 24, 2007, [[Reading Royals]] at Pensacola Ice Pilots\n* [[Timo Pielmeier]], December 19, 2009, [[Bakersfield Condors (1998\u20132015)|Bakersfield Condors]] at [[Utah Grizzlies]]\n* [[Brian Foster (ice hockey)|Brian Foster]], February 15, 2013, [[Trenton Titans]] at [[Cincinnati Cyclones]] (Trenton own goal on empty net, Foster last Cyclone to touch puck)\n* [[Alex Nedeljkovic]], December 30, 2016, [[Florida Everblades]] Vs.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the ''goal crease'' (often referred to simply as '' the crease'' or ''the net''). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater, but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty (if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop).\n\nThe goaltender is also known as the ''goalie,''{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|pp=87\u201388}} ''goaler,''{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|p=88}} ''goalkeeper,''{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|p=88}} ''net minder,'' and ''tender'' by those involved in the hockey community. In the early days of the sport, the term was spelled with a hyphen as ''goal-tender.''{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|p=88}} The art of playing the position is called ''goaltending'' and there are coaches, usually called the ''goalie coach'' who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders.{{sfn|Podnieks|2007|p=88}} The variation goalie is typically used for items associated with the position, such as ''goalie stick'' and ''goalie pads''.\n\n==Goaltenders in ice hockey==\n===Roster===\nGoaltending is a specialized position in ice hockey; at higher levels in the game, no goaltenders play other positions and no other players play goaltender. At minor levels and recreational games, goaltenders do occasionally switch with others players that have been taught goaltending; however, most recreational hockey rules are now forbidding position swapping due to an increase in injuries.\n\nA typical ice hockey team may have two or three goaltenders on its roster. Most teams typically have a starting goaltender who plays the majority of the regular season games and all of the playoffs, with the [[#Back-up_goaltender|backup goaltender]] only stepping in if the starter is pulled or injured, or in cases where the schedule is too heavy for one goaltender to play every game.\n\nThe NHL requires each team have a list of \"emergency\" goaltenders. The list provides goaltender options for both the home and visiting teams. These goaltenders are to be called to a game if a team does not have two goaltenders to start the game. An \"emergency\" goaltender may also be called if both roster goaltenders are injured in the same game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2017/01/06/emergency-goalie-the-most-unique-one-day-job-in-sports/96265280/|title=Emergency goalie: The most unusual 1-day job in sports|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=March 30, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212607/https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2017/01/06/emergency-goalie-the-most-unique-one-day-job-in-sports/96265280/|archivedate=March 30, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Goalie tandem====\nSome teams have used a goaltender tandem where two goaltenders split the regular season playing duties, though often one of them is considered the number one goaltender who gets the start in the playoffs. An example is the 1982-83 [[New York Islanders]] with [[Billy Smith (ice hockey)|Billy Smith]] and [[Roland Melanson]]; Melanson was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team for his regular season play while Smith won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the playoff MVP and both players shared the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for fewest goals allowed. Another instance is the [[Edmonton Oilers]]' [[Andy Moog]] and [[Grant Fuhr]]; both of them earned [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearances for the regular season play, with Moog being the starter in the 1983 playoffs and Fuhr for the 1984 playoffs (although Moog started Game 4 and 5 of the 1984 Stanley Cup Finals due to Fuhr's injury) and subsequent postseasons.\n\nThe [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] had [[Terry Sawchuk]] and [[Johnny Bower]] share goaltending duties in the regular season and playoffs, winning the 1964\u201365 [[Vezina Trophy]] (shared) and the 1967 [[Stanley Cup]].  The 1996-97 [[Philadelphia Flyers]]' [[Ron Hextall]] and [[Garth Snow]] alternated in the playoffs;<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/16/sports/time-to-drop-the-puck-on-stanley-cup-season.html?scp=542&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |title=Time to Drop the Puck On Stanley Cup Season |work=The New York Times |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |date=April 16, 1997 |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108114714/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/16/sports/time-to-drop-the-puck-on-stanley-cup-season.html?scp=542&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Snow started nine of the ten games during the first two rounds,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/15/sports/flyers-question-who-will-start-in-goal.html?scp=552&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |title=Flyers' Question: Who Will Start in Goal? |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |work=The New York Times |date=May 15, 1997 |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305154515/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/15/sports/flyers-question-who-will-start-in-goal.html?scp=552&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but Hextall took over in game two of Conference Finals and remained the starting goaltender for the remainder of the playoffs, though Snow started for game two of the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\n===Privileges===\nThe goaltender has special privileges and training that other players do not. He wears special [[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|goaltending equipment]] that is different from that worn by other players and is subject to specific regulations. Goaltenders may use any part of their bodies to block shots. The goaltender may legally hold (or freeze) the puck with his hands to cause a stoppage of play. If a player from the other team hits the goaltender without making an attempt to get out of his way, the offending player may be penalized. In some leagues (including the NHL), if a goaltender's stick breaks, he can continue playing with a broken stick until the play is stopped, unlike other players who must drop any broken sticks immediately.\n\nAdditionally, if a goaltender acts in such a way that would cause a normal player to be given a penalty, such as slashing or tripping another player, the goaltender cannot be sent to the penalty box. Instead, one of the goaltender's teammates who was on the ice at the time of the infraction is sent to the penalty box in his place. However, the goaltender does receive the penalty minutes on the scoresheet. If the goaltender receives a Game Misconduct or Match [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]], he is removed from the ice and a replacement goaltender is played.\n\nNormally, the goaltender plays in or near the goal crease the entire game, unlike the other positions where players are on ice for shifts and make line changes. However, goaltenders are often pulled if they have allowed several goals in a short period of time, whether they were at fault for the surrendered goals or not, and usually a substituted goaltender does not return for the rest of the game. In 1995, [[Patrick Roy]] was famously [[Patrick Roy#Trade to Colorado|kept in net]] by the head coach as \"humiliation\" despite allowing nine goals on 26 shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2012030312&navid=sc.com-series-recap|title=Boston Bruins at Pittsburgh Penguins - 06/03/2013|work=NHL.com|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609035455/http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2012030312&navid=sc.com-series-recap|archivedate=June 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=145407|title=404|work=TSN|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224093010/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=145407|archivedate=December 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[List of goaltenders who have scored a goal in an NHL game|Eleven goaltenders]] have scored a total of fourteen goals in [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an [[Own goal#Ice hockey|''own goal'']]. A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; in the case of own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/sports/it-s-snow-as-flyers-switch-goalies.html?scp=574&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |title=It's Snow As Flyers Switch Goalies |work=The New York Times |last=Diamos |first=Jason |date=June 3, 1997 |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108133950/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/sports/it-s-snow-as-flyers-switch-goalies.html?scp=574&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/sports/legion-of-brooms-red-wings-wait-ends-with-sweep.html?scp=580&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |title=Legion of Brooms: Red Wings' Wait Ends With Sweep |work=The New York Times |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |date=June 8, 1997 |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108133541/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/sports/legion-of-brooms-red-wings-wait-ends-with-sweep.html?scp=580&sq=Ron+Hextall&st=nyt |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nA team is not required to use a goaltender. At any time in a game, a team may remove its goaltender from the ice in favor of an [[extra attacker]]. Using an extra attacker is usually intended to overwhelm the opposing team's defense, and unlike during a [[power play (sporting term)|power play]], the defense cannot legally [[icing (ice hockey)|ice the puck]], (if they are not already shorthanded due to a penalty. If the team on defense is serving a penalty, then the usual icing rules prevail.) putting the team without a goaltender at a significant advantage on offense. The vulnerability that comes with leaving the net untended means that, if the opposing team does manage to advance the puck out of their own defensive zone, a far easier [[empty net goal]] can be scored. NHL rules strongly encourage that teams use goaltenders in [[overtime (sport)|overtime]]; if a team opts for the extra attacker in overtime and an empty-net goal is scored, the game is credited as a regulation loss instead of an overtime loss. (An overtime loss earns one standings point, as opposed to two for a win of any sort and none for a regulation loss or overtime loss incurred under an empty net.) Teams thus typically forgo using a goaltender only in situations where they are trailing by one or two goals with only a short time (typically less than four minutes) left in the game and have possession of the puck in their opponent's defensive zone.\n\nThe rules of the IIHF, NHL and Hockey Canada do not permit goaltenders to be designated as on-ice [[Captain (ice hockey)|captains]],<ref name=\"IIHF-rules\">{{cite web |title=IIHF Rule Book |publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation |url= http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html |format=PDF |accessdate=October 18, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002092827/http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html |archivedate=October 2, 2008 |df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"NHL-rules\">{{cite web|author=National Hockey League |title=National Hockey League Official Rules |publisher=Triumph Books |year=2007 |url= http://www.nhl.com/rules/index.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050925113900/http://www.nhl.com/rules/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 25, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 20, 2007}}</ref> because of the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches and then return to the [[Crease (hockey)|crease]].

Goaltenders often use a particular style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goaltender's own team to get control of the puck. Goaltenders may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goaltender may choose to hold on to the puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goaltender holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute [[Delay of game (ice hockey)|delay of game]] penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goaltenders have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.\n\n{{See also|shot on goal|save percentage|goals against average}}\n\n===Glossary and techniques===\n* '''Angle play:''' The method where, by positioning himself in a direct line between the puck (not the shooter) and the net, a goaltender covers more of the net than he would otherwise be able to, and often \"skulling\" slowly, directly towards and closing on the opposing shooter to block more of the net. Two of the most notable angle goaltenders in the 1970s were [[Gilles Gilbert]] and [[Bernie Parent]].\n* '''[[Blocker (ice hockey)|Blocker]]:''' The blocker is a rectangular piece of equipment with a glove to hold the stick. The blocker is predominantly worn on the dominant hand of the goaltender. The blocker protects the wrist area and can be used to direct shots away from the net. The blocker should be positioned at one's side, and at a height which allows the goaltender's stick to remain flat on the ice while in their ready stance.\n* '''[[Trapper (ice hockey)|Trapper]]:''' This goalie's catching glove was originally shaped in the same fashion as a [[baseball glove]]. It has evolved into a highly specific piece of equipment that is designed specifically for catching the puck. Some of the more significant changes are the use of a \"string mesh\" in the pocket of the trapper and the substantial palm and wrist protection. The pocket is the area between the thumb and first finger of the glove and is where most goaltenders try to catch the puck; catching in the pocket reduces the chance of a rebound falling out of the glove. The trapper must not be more than 18 inches across. The trapper can be held in a variety of positions depending upon the individual goaltender, but the trend among younger goaltenders is to hold the glove with the palm facing towards the shooter, instead of the \"shake hands\" position that was popular previously. The \"Cheater\" portion of the glove is the portion of the glove on the outside area of the thumb and the part that covers the wrist of the goaltender.\n* '''Butterfly save:''' On low shots, modern goaltenders usually work in the \"butterfly\" position, keeping their knees together and their stick covering their [[five-hole]], or knee gap. A fairly new, more effective way of stopping low shots is to redirect the puck with the stick. The goalie does this by rotating their hips, their glove and stick square with the puck as they direct it to the corner to the left or right of them, depending on which side the puck is shot to, rather than kicking the puck way out of reach. The glove is kept up and out, ready for a possible deflection, and the goaltender is focused on the incoming shot. Goaltenders should keep both arms out in front of them at all times, covering the gaps between the goaltender's arms and body (sometimes called the 7 and 11 holes), and making it easier to direct rebounds with the stick and blocker.\n* '''Butterfly slide:''' On breakaways or any other movement goaltenders should be using this technique to make \"proper saves\". To perform this goaltender move, you must use your leg to push off with your skate and with one knee hovering just above the ice while using your other skate to push your body side to side.\n* '''Hasek roll:''' The Hasek roll is a desperation maneuver named after Czech goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek]]. In the stacked pad stance the lower part of the net is protected very well, but the upper third is completely open. In a last-ditch effort to block an incoming high shot the goaltender can roll around his upper back, flailing his pads through the air and stacking them on the other side. If the timing is right the goalie might get his leg up just in time to make the save.\n[[File:Goalie-holes.png|thumb|right|The holes on the goal.]]\n* '''Holes one through five:''' When a goaltender stands in the net in the ready position, there are seven open areas that the goalie must cover.<ref>{{cite web|last=Korn|first=Mitch|title=A hole is a hole is hole|url=http://www.hockeyplayer.com/artman/publish/article_487.shtml|website=hockeyplayer.com|accessdate=February 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524141733/http://www.hockeyplayer.com/artman/publish/article_487.shtml|archivedate=May 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They are:\n# Glove side, high: this area is defined by the goaltender's arm and catcher on the bottom, mask on the inside, and the post and top of the goal on the outside.\n# Glove side, low: this area is defined by the goaltender's arm and catcher on the top, the ice on the bottom, and the outside post of the goal. During a butterfly-style save, this area is closed off completely and the catcher is typically stacked on top of the leg pad as the leg is extended to cover the post.\n# Stick side, high: this area is defined by the goal post, top of the goal, and the goalie's arm and blocker. The top half of the goaltender's stick is held in this area, but is not commonly used for stopping the puck.\n# Stick side, low: this area is the lower half of the stick side, defined by the blocker and arm, the ice, and the outer post of the goal. During a butterfly save this area is also covered by the leg pad with the blocker stacked on top to protect against low shots. When a goaltender is standing, the paddle of their stick is used to cover this area and to deflect the puck away from the net.\n# 'Five Hole': the fifth and final area is between the goalie's leg pads and skates. This area is protected by the blade of the stick at all times, and is closed up by the upper leg pads when the goalie is in the butterfly position.\n# 'Six and Seven Hole': the six and seven holes are relatively new terms to identify the areas under either armpit of the goalie. Goaltenders who hold their trapper high or blocker further out to the side of their body are said to have six and seven holes. \n# 'Six Hole (slang)': The \"six hole\" is also used as a slang term used when a save is made, but the puck goes into the net, resulting in a goal. The term is used when the goalie is unsure how the puck made it past him or her.\n\n* '''Leg pads:''' Worn on the goaltender's legs to both protect the legs and help stop shots. Current NHL Rules have reduced leg pad width to {{convert|11|in|mm}}; the overall height is restricted based upon an individual proportionally. The leg pads generally come to about three inches above the knee. Pads that are too long will affect balance and timing; pads that are too short will not protect the knees or allow the goaltender to make butterfly saves properly.\n* '''(Leg) kick save:''' A save made with any part of the leg pads. The goaltender should remain relaxed and skate backwards with the incoming shot, thus helping to absorb the blow and reduce the rebound effect. One type of leg pad save is the butterfly save.\n* '''Lie:''' The angle created between the handle (paddle) of a goaltender's stick and the blade. The higher the lie, the closer the stick resembles the capital letter \"L\". A higher lie number of 15+ is traditionally for goaltenders who tend to stand up more in their stance; A lower lie number of 11 or 12 is for goaltenders who play with a more butterfly stance down on the ice more often.\n* '''[[Goaltender mask|Mask]]''': The protective headgear worn by goaltenders. The first goaltender to wear a mask in the National Hockey League was [[Clint Benedict]] in 1930 who wore a crude form made of leather.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sporting News |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/article/2009-10-30/fifty-years-after-plantes-breakthrough-goalie-mask-about-sanity-not-toughness |title=Fifty years after Plante's breakthrough, goalie mask is about sanity, not toughness |last=Custance |first=Craig |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207043325/http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/article/2009-10-30/fifty-years-after-plantes-breakthrough-goalie-mask-about-sanity-not-toughness |archivedate=December 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In November 1959, [[Jacques Plante]], wore a self-made fiberglass mask after taking a [[New York Rangers]] shot to the face. Following his lead, goaltenders around the world began to don protective headgear, which is now a requirement. Masks have evolved from the flush style introduced by Plante, to the player's helmet/special \"birdcage\" style best associated with [[Vladislav Tretiak]] and [[Chris Osgood]], to the modern hybrid helmet, made of advanced materials such as carbon fiber or [[Kevlar]], increasing in safety as time went on. Especially at higher levels of hockey, many goaltenders have their masks painted to represent their team's colors/imagery, landmarks in the city they play in or personal interests/nicknames. Examples of this include [[Mike Richter]]'s [[Statue of Liberty]] mask, [[Ed Belfour]]'s Eagle on his mask (Eddie the Eagle nickname), [[Ryan Miller (ice hockey)|Ryan Miller]] featuring the words \"Matt Man\" on his masks in honor of his late cousin, and [[Craig Anderson (ice hockey)|Craig Anderson]] honouring his father's [[National Corvette Museum]] board service (as a former Corvette racer) by having a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] on his masks.\n* '''Paddle:''' The thick part of the goaltender's stick, not to be confused with the blade. The paddle has a maximum length of {{convert|26|in|mm}} in the NHL. The blade is the part of the stick that should remain flat on the ice, as compared with the paddle.\n* '''Paddle down:''' A type of stance by the goaltender when the play is coming from the corner to the front of the net and the puck carrier is carrying the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or [[Glossary of ice hockey terms#W|wrap around]]s where the skater would normally out\u2013skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.\n* '''Poke check:''' When the goaltender wants to poke the puck away from an opposing player, he quickly slides his hand up the stick, thrusting forward towards the puck. An improperly played poke check is a risky play; the goaltender may miss, and the puck-carrier will be left with an unguarded net. In tight situations, a quick, hard jab could be used.\n* '''Pro-fly:''' This style of play is derived from the butterfly style of play, although most will argue that this is nothing more than a marketing term. Current leg pad design allows for the full face of the pad to be perpendicular to the ice, maximizing blocking area. This is also called \"flaring the pad\", almost all modern goaltenders play this style. The stance is very wide and low to maximize the amount of body blocking the net. Many of today's great goaltenders have adopted this technique. This forces the shooter to get the puck off the ice to score. The con of this stance is that it is very hard to move quickly. The more efficient users of this style include [[Henrik Lundqvist]] of the New York Rangers, [[Jonathan Quick]] of the Los Angeles Kings, and [[Roberto Luongo]] of the Florida Panthers. This is still considered a butterfly motion, as the mechanics of making the save are the same, however it is the design of the leg pad that achieves this rotation more than anything.\n* '''Screen shot:''' Screen shots are blind shots, in which the goalie can not find the location of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do everything possible to try to see the shot, as dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as [[Ed Belfour]] or [[Ron Hextall]], went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.\n* '''Shuffle:''' A technique for lateral movement when the puck is relatively close to the net. The goaltender slides his legs, one at a time, in the desired direction. If the goaltender is not quick this technique momentarily leaves the five-hole open. This is the most common method of movement for a goaltender when in the butterfly position.\n* '''Skate save:''' A save made with the goaltender's skate. The goaltender decides which direction the rebound should travel in, and turns his skate in that direction. Then, bending the other leg, he pushes towards the puck with the off leg, as the bent knee drops to the ice. This move is rarely used since the butterfly method has become popular. A skate save's effectiveness is more limited because of the difficulty in directing a puck compared with using a stick, a blocker, or the pad.\n* '''Skating:''' A common fallacy is that the goaltender can get by with merely adequate skating, and often young players are placed in net because of their poor skating. In fact, the goaltender must be one of the best technical skaters on the team, and must be able to keep up with the moves of every skater on opposing teams. In particular, goaltenders must be adept at lateral skating and quick pivoting. Goaltenders must also have exceptional leg strength and the capability for very explosive movement.\n* '''Stacked Pad Slide:''' When a goaltender is on the angle, often a sudden pass close to the net will leave the net relatively unguarded. Stacking the pads is a desperation move in which the goaltender slides feet-first, with legs together (and consequently, \"stacked\"), across the crease, attempting to cover as much space as possible.\n* '''Stance:''' In a proper stance, the goaltender has the weight on the balls of his feet, the trapper and blocker just above knee-height and slightly out in front so they can be seen in the goalies peripheral vision, and the stick flat on the ice. Stance should also be conformed to the goaltender's style and comfort.\n* '''Stick:''' The stick, held by the goaltender in their blocker hand, the blade of the stick should remain flat on the ice. Keep notice of the lie on a new stick. A high lie will force a goaltender to play on their heels, offsetting balance, while a low lie places a goaltender lower to the ice, and may affect high saves.\n* '''Stick save:''' A save made with the goaltender's stick. On stick saves, the goaltender should not keep a tight grip on the stick, instead allowing the shot's momentum to push the stick back into the skates/pads, cushioning the blow.\n*{{anchor|Stood on his head}} '''Stood on his head:''' This is a term to describe an outstanding performance by an ice hockey goaltender in a short period of time. Often when a goalie lets out a rebound, the opposition returns the shot quickly, and the goalie has to make a quick save. A goalie often falls on his side and \"stacks the pads\" and appears to nearly stand on their head. The term may have been derived after NHL President [[Frank Calder]], alluding to the 1918 rules change that permitted goalies to leave their feet to make a save, remarked, \"As far as I am concerned, they can stand on their head(s).\"<ref>''The Hockey News: Century Of Hockey'', 1st ed. 2000, p. 20 - \"As far as I am concerned, they can stand on their head(s). ''NHL president Frank Calder, announcing goalies can leave their feet to stop a puck''\"</ref>\n* ''''T-push:'''' A technique used by goaltenders to move in a lateral direction. To perform a C-step, a goaltender directs his outside skate at the desired angle, pushing with the opposite leg, covering the five hole. This method of lateral movement is most effective when the puck is far from the net. Use of this move when the puck is in close is not needed. Shuffling is good when the puck is in close.\n* '''Skulling:''' Skulling is a method of moving inward and outward from the goal crease, often used in \"angle play\". Most often used in setting up prior to the puck entering their zone, especially to \"cut down the angle\", this move is accomplished by simply allowing your skates to separate, resulting in forward motion, then pulling your skates back together and stopping. At no time during a skull do your skates leave the ice. This can also be referred to as telescoping or bubbling.\n\n===Playing styles===\n====Stand-up style====\nThe oldest playing style is the '''stand-up style'''. In this style, goaltenders are to stop the puck from a standing position, not going down. The goaltenders may bend over to stop the puck with their upper body or may kick the puck. Such saves made by kicking are known as kick saves or skate saves. They may also simply use their stick to stop it, known as a stick save. This was the style seen in the early NHL and was most commonly used up until the early 60s. One of the more notable goaltenders who was last seen using stand up was [[Bill Ranford]], but most of the goaltenders from earlier decades such as [[Jacques Plante]] were considered pure stand up goaltenders.\n\nAs the name suggests, the ''stand-up style'' refers to a style of goaltending in which the goaltender makes the majority of the saves standing up. This style is not as popular in the modern era, with the majority of contemporary goaltenders switching to the [[butterfly style]] and the hybrid style. The stand-up style is in contrast to the butterfly style, where goaltenders protect the net against incoming shots by dropping to their knees and shifting their legs out.\n\nThe advantage of the stand-up style is in the continued mobility of the goaltender mid save. While standing, a stand-up goaltender can remain square to the puck and adjust his positioning to ensure that he is covering as much of the net as possible at all times. The goaltender is also in a better position to stop pucks that are headed towards the upper part of the net.\n\nThe main disadvantage of the stand-up style, however, is a susceptibility to shots travelling along the bottom half of the net. A larger percentage of shots occur in the bottom portion of the net, and a goaltender utilizing the butterfly will cover a larger portion of that area. If there is a screen, however, a stand-up goaltender is generally in a better position to see the [[slapshot]].\n\n====Butterfly style====\n{{main|Butterfly style}}\n\nAnother style is the \"Butterfly\", where goaltenders go down on both pads with their toes pointing outwards and the tops of their pads meeting in the middle, thus closing up the [[five-hole|five hole]]. This results in a \"wall\" of padding without any holes, lowering the chances of low angle shots getting in. These goaltenders rely on timing and position. Early innovators of this style were goaltending greats [[Glenn Hall]] and [[Tony Esposito]] who played during the 50s-60s and 70s-80s, respectively. Hall is credited to be among the very first to use this style, and both he and Esposito had tremendous success with it. The most successful goaltender to adopt this style was Patrick Roy, who has 550 career wins in the NHL. This is the most widely used style in the NHL today. \"Butterfly\" goaltenders have developed methods of sliding in the \"Butterfly\" position in order to move around fast in one-timer situations. As pad size increased, it became a more notable style of goaltending and is still evolving.\n\n====Hybrid style====\nThis style of goaltending is a combination of both stand-up and butterfly style, where the goaltender primarily relies on reaction, save selection, and positioning to make saves. Hybrid goaltenders will usually control rebounds well, deflect low shots with their sticks, will utilize the butterfly, and are generally not as predictable as goaltenders who rely heavily on the butterfly as a save selection. Most players are not pure stand-up or butterfly, but simply tend to prefer stand-up or butterfly over the other. If a player does not have any preferences, he is considered a hybrid goaltender. All modern NHL goaltenders generally use some form of this style. Some goaltenders who do this effectively are [[Ryan Miller]], [[Jaroslav Hal\u00e1k]], [[Jimmy Howard]], [[Tuukka Rask]], [[Carey Price]] and formerly [[Evgeni Nabokov]] and [[Martin Brodeur]].\n\n===Empty net situations===\n[[File:Delayed penalty.jpg|thumb|300px|A delayed penalty call situation, in which the referee (top-left) indicates a coming penalty by raising his arm, and prepares to blow the whistle when a player from the team to be penalized (in white) touches the puck. Goaltender [[Jere Myllyniemi]] can be seen (right) rushing to the bench to send on an extra attacker.]]\n\nNormally, the goaltender plays in or near the goal crease the entire game. However, teams may legally ''pull the goalie'' by substituting in a normal skater and taking the goaltender off the ice. A team temporarily playing with no goaltender is said to be playing with an ''empty net''. This gives the team an extra attacker, but at significant risk\u2014if the opposing team gains control of the puck, they may easily score a goal. However, shooters that attempt to score on an empty net from the opposite side of the red line face getting called for [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]] the puck if they miss the net. There are two common situations where a goaltender is generally pulled, as well as two less common situations:\n\n:1. '''The opposing team has a [[delayed penalty]] coming against them'''\n::The offended team, if in control of the puck, will pull their goaltender for an extra man. This is safe since as soon as a player on the team to be penalized touches the puck, the whistle is called, so they cannot score on the empty net. This effectively increases the one-man disadvantage beyond the standard penalty time. It is possible, however, for a team to accidentally score on their own empty net.\n:2. '''A team needs a goal in order to avoid losing (such as trailing in the remaining minute or two of a game)'''\n::The 6 on 5 play advantage is very risky, as it is fairly certain that if the opposing team gets control of the puck they will be able to [[Empty net goal|score on the empty net]]. Sometimes if a team is trailing in the last minutes of regulation, and has a power play advantage, they may pull the goaltender for a 6 on 4 or even 6 on 3 advantage.\n:3. '''In the last few seconds of a period with a faceoff in the attacking zone'''\n::Because the defending team would likely not have enough time to start an attack even if they win the faceoff, the attacking team may pull the goalie to have a short man advantage.\n:4. '''In a tournament that takes goal differential into account, a team may pull the goalie with a significant amount of time left in an effort to create a more advantageous goal differential.'''\n::If the team could be eliminated even if they win but could still advance with a loss based on goal differential, the team may decide it has nothing to lose by trying to score with a man advantage, similar to the second situation.\nA goal scored in an empty net situation is not recorded as a shot faced or goal against on the personal stats of the goaltender who has left the ice.\n\n===Back-up goaltender===\nIn professional ice hockey, the back-up goaltender fills an important team role. Although the back-up will spend most games sitting on the bench, the back-up must be prepared to play every game. A back-up may be forced into duty at any time to relieve the starting goaltender in the event of an injury or poor game performance. The back-up will also be called upon to start some games to give the starter the opportunity to rest from game-play during the [[Season (sports)|season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/top-five-nhl-backup-goalies/|title=Net worth: Top 5 NHL backup goalies|author=Rogers Digital Media|work=Sportsnet.ca|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134704/http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/top-five-nhl-backup-goalies/|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMost professional leagues require each home team to maintain a list of local non-professional goaltenders, available to either team, who can be used in the exceptional case that one or both of a team's normal goaltenders are injured or unavailable (such as a player acquired in a trade or minor league call-up arriving late on short notice); such a goaltender who fulfills that role is known as an '''emergency back\u2013up goaltender'''.<ref name=\"emergency\">{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/sports/hockey/nhls-emergency-goalies-are-ready-to-answer-the-call.html |title = N.H.L.'s Emergency Goalies Are Ready to Answer the Call |agency = Associated Press |date = January 7, 2017 |work = The New York Times |access-date = March 30, 2018 |language = en-US |issn = 0362-4331 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180330043741/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/sports/hockey/nhls-emergency-goalies-are-ready-to-answer-the-call.html |archivedate = March 30, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"emgnhl\">[https://www.nhl.com/news/nhls-emergency-goalies-live-on-edge/c-278299936 NHL.com: \"NHL's emergency goalies live on edge\"]</ref> Similar rules are in place for the [[Minor league#Ice Hockey|NHL's minor leagues]], where emergency goaltenders are used much more frequently.<ref name=\"emgnhl\"/> Those on a team's emergency list are given free attendance to home games they are assigned and may also help out as a practice goalie.<ref name=\"emgnhl\"/> Emergency goalies are often called from nearby [[College ice hockey|college teams]], adult semi-pro/amateur leagues, or the home team's own coaching/facilities staff.<ref name=\"emergency\"/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HubXdsr3c9M \"NHL: Emergency Goalies\" (YouTube)]</ref> If activated for a game, most emergency goaltenders only dress to sit on the bench, as a team's normal back-up takes over; only three emergency goalies ([[David Ayres]], [[Scott Foster (ice hockey)|Scott Foster]], and [[Jorge Alves (ice hockey)|Jorge Alves]]) have ever seen recorded playing time in an NHL game.

Jennings Trophy]] is awarded each year by the NHL to the goaltender(s) from the team that allowed the fewest goals during the regular season, from 1981-82 onwards.\n* The [[Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award]] was awarded from 1999-2000 to the 2006-07 seasons by the NHL to the goaltender with the best save percentage during the regular season.\n* The [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] is awarded to the [[Most valuable player|Most Valuable Player]] in the NHL.\n* The [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] is awarded to the [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]].\n* The [[Ted Lindsay Award]] is awarded to the most outstanding player in the regular season as judged by the members of the NHL Players Association.\n\n==Goaltenders credited with goals==\nA goaltender scoring a goal in an NHL game is a very rare feat, having occurred only fifteen times in the history of the NHL, the first time occurring in 1979 after the league had been in existence for six decades. NHL rules forbid goaltenders from participating in play past the center line, so a goal by a goaltender is possible only under unusual circumstances.\n\nEight of those fifteen goals resulted from the goaltender shooting into an empty net. The remaining seven goals were not actually shot into the net by the goaltender; rather the goaltender was awarded the goal because he was the last player on his team to touch the puck before the opposition scored on themselves. [[Martin Brodeur]] is the only NHL goaltender to be credited with three career goals (two in the regular season and one in the playoffs), [[Ron Hextall]] is the only goaltender who has scored two goals by shooting the puck into an empty net (once in the regular season and once in the playoffs). [[Damian Rhodes]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore]] are the only goaltenders in NHL history to score a goal in which they also had a [[shutout]] game. [[Evgeni Nabokov]] of the [[San Jose Sharks]] was the first goaltender to score a power play goal. If a goaltender crosses the center line and shoots the puck from that location or any other location past the center line, the goal does not count.\n\n===NHL===\n{{main|List of goaltenders who have scored a goal in an NHL game}}\n\n===AHL===\nA chronological list of goals scored in the AHL by goaltenders:<ref>[http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=8401 \" MacIntyre makes history in unlikely Moose win - AHL Goals Scored by a Goaltender:\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324035928/http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=8401 |date=March 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n* [[Darcy Wakaluk]], December 5, 1987, [[Rochester Americans]] at Utica\n* [[Paul Cohen (ice hockey)|Paul Cohen]], March 28, 1992, [[Springfield Indians]] vs. Rochester\n* [[Robb Stauber]], October 9, 1995, [[Rochester Americans]] at Prince Edward Island\n* [[Christian Bronsard]], October 30, 1999, [[Syracuse Crunch]] at Rochester\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Labb\u00e9]], February 5, 2000, [[Hartford Wolf Pack]] at Quebec\n* [[Chris Mason (ice hockey)|Chris Mason]], October 15, 2001, [[Milwaukee Admirals]] at Utah\n* [[Antero Niittym\u00e4ki]], April 11, 2004, [[Philadelphia Phantoms]] at Hershey\n* [[Seamus Kotyk]], April 17, 2005, [[Milwaukee Admirals]] at San Antonio\n* [[Drew MacIntyre]], February 20, 2008, [[Manitoba Moose]] at Chicago (overtime winner)\n* [[Chris Holt (ice hockey)|Chris Holt]], March 19, 2010, [[Binghamton Senators]] vs. Rochester\n* [[Reto Berra]], January 16, 2015, [[Lake Erie Monsters]] at Chicago Wolves\n* [[Alex Nedeljkovic]], March 10th, 2018, [[Charlotte Checkers]] vs. Hartford\n* [[Tristan Jarry]], November 14, 2018, [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]] at Springfield\n* [[Maxime Lagac\u00e9]], May 25, 2019, [[Chicago Wolves]] at San Diego (first ever goalie goal in Calder Cup Playoffs history)<ref name=\"lagace\">{{Cite web |url=https://theahl.com/lagace-credited-with-goal-in-wolves-win |title=Lagace credited with goal in Wolves win |date=May 26, 2019 |website=[[American Hockey League]] |access-date=July 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===ECHL===\nA chronological list of goals scored in the ECHL by goaltenders:\n\n* [[Corwin Saurdiff]], March 18, 1995, [[Hampton Roads Admirals]] versus [[Charlotte Checkers (ECHL)|Charlotte Checkers]]\n* [[Olie Sundstrom]], December 15, 1995,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://articles.dailypress.com/1995-12-20/sports/9512200002_1_hampton-roads-echl-commissioner-pat-kelly-penalty | title = Admirals Briefs: Erie Goalie Joins Saurdiff As Scorer | author = Al Pearce | website = DailyPress.com | date = December 20, 1995 | accessdate = January 5, 2011 | url-status=live | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111101195536/http://articles.dailypress.com/1995-12-20/sports/9512200002_1_hampton-roads-echl-commissioner-pat-kelly-penalty | archivedate = November 1, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> [[Erie Panthers]] versus [[Wheeling Nailers]]\n* [[Sean Gauthier]], December 19, 1995<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stingrayshockey.com/team/teamnews/index.html?article_id=1106&content_type=printable&plugin_id=news.front.system&block_id=5001 | title = 50 Moments in Stingrays History | author = | website = StingraysHockey.com | date = January 5, 2011 | accessdate = January 5, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143740/http://www.stingrayshockey.com/team/teamnews/index.html?article_id=1106&content_type=printable&plugin_id=news.front.system&block_id=5001 | archivedate = July 16, 2011 | df = }}</ref> at [[Raleigh IceCaps]]\n* [[Nick Vitucci]], March 6, 1996, [[Charlotte Checkers (1993-2010)|Charlotte Checkers]] versus [[Louisville RiverFrogs]] (Vitucci is the only goalie to be credited with a goal on a guarded net)\n* [[Mark Bernard]], March 22, 2001, [[Toledo Storm]] versus [[Johnstown Chiefs]]\n* Mike Smith, October 26, 2002, [[Lexington Men O'War]] versus [[Dayton Bombers]]\n* [[Brian Eklund]], December 5, 2003, [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]] at [[Mississippi Sea Wolves]]\n* [[Trevor Koenig]], March 2, 2005, [[Atlantic City Boardwalk Bullies]] at [[Wheeling Nailers]]\n* [[Jonathan Quick]], October 24, 2007, [[Reading Royals]] at Pensacola Ice Pilots\n* [[Timo Pielmeier]], December 19, 2009, [[Bakersfield Condors (1998\u20132015)|Bakersfield Condors]] at [[Utah Grizzlies]]\n* [[Brian Foster (ice hockey)|Brian Foster]], February 15, 2013, [[Trenton Titans]] at [[Cincinnati Cyclones]] (Trenton own goal on empty net, Foster last Cyclone to touch puck)\n* [[Alex Nedeljkovic]], December 30, 2016, [[Florida Everblades]] Vs.

The Barq Brothers bottled [[carbonation|carbonated]] water and various soft drinks of their own creation. Early on, their most popular creation was an [[orange (fruit)|orange]]-flavored soda called ''Orangine'', which won a gold medal at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] [[World's Fair]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].{{citation needed|reason=not verified|date=May 2016}}\n\nEdward Barq moved to [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] in 1897 with his new wife. [[File:Barqs Sign.jpg|thumb|right]]The following year he opened the '''Biloxi Artesian Bottling Works'''. 1898 is often given as the debut year for what was later to be known as \"Barq's root beer,\" but some sources say this particular product was not produced until some two years later.<ref>{{cite web | title = Digging for facts | url = http://www.bottlebooks.com/questions/September2001/digging_for_facts.htm | publisher = bottlebooks.com}}</ref>\n\nIt was on the Mississippi coast that Barq met and employed a young boy, Jesse Robinson. Robinson was mentored by Barq and later moved to New Orleans to find his fortune. In 1934 Edward Barq, Sr. and Robinson signed a contractual agreement on Barq's product rights. The agreement was unique from other franchises in many aspects. For one thing, Robinson was allowed to make his own concentrate. The two men remained close their entire lives, working on flavors and production challenges. A distinctive difference between the Biloxi-based root beer and the Louisiana's was that the Louisiana bottle was printed in red (versus Biloxi's blue). This was to distinguish ownership of bottles as blue labeled ones were returned to Mississippi and vice versa. There were also regional taste differences between the various Barq's bottlers. While there may have been minor formula differences, water generally defined these differences.\n\nFor many decades, Barq's was not marketed as a \"root beer.\" This was in part a desire to avoid legal conflict with the [[Hires Root Beer]] company, which was attempting to claim a trademark on the term \"root beer.\" It was also due to differences from other root beers at the time. The formulation was [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]]-based, contained less sugar, had a higher carbonation, and less of a foamy head than other brands.<ref>{{cite web | title = Root Beer: An Exclusively American Soft Drink | url = http://grubamericana.com/2013/08/17/root-beer-an-exclusively-american-soft-drink/ | publisher = Grub Americana | accessdate = 2015-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional slogan was the simple affirmation \"Drink Barq's. It's good\" which first appeared on the classic diamond-necked bottle, patented in 1935 by Ed Barq.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lockhart|first1=Bill|title=Bottles on the Border: The History and Bottles of the Soft Drink Industry in El Paso, Texas, 1881-2000|url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/pdffiles/EPChap11b.pdf|website=Society for Historical Archaeology|publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|accessdate=29 June 2016|page=495|format=PDF|date=2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Biloxi Barq's Company was purchased from the third generation of Barq family members by John Oudt and John Koerner. An aggressive television campaign was developed based on the \"Barq's Got Sparks\" theme. Their plans to market the brand nationally were complicated by the existence of the Louisiana-based Barq's companies which were owned and operated by Robinson's heirs.\n\nThere were extended legal conflicts over the rights and ownership of the trademark Barq's, Barq's Sr. and Barq's Root Beer. The legal battle went all the way to the United States Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit, which ruled in favor of the Robinson heirs. The last family-held Louisiana Barq's was sold by Robinson's heirs to Coca-Cola in 2000.\n\nIn 1990, Barq's partnered with the Pick N Save grocery store in [[Dekalb, Illinois]] to create the World's Largest [[Root Beer Float]]. It was mixed in an above ground swimming pool in the parking lot and consisted of 1,500 gallons of Barq's root beer and 1,000 gallons of vanilla ice cream.\n\nIn recent years, Barq's has marketed with the slogan \"Barq's has bite!\"{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nRegular Barq's has 22.5 [[Milligram|mg]] of [[caffeine]] per 12 ounce serving (similar to [[green tea]]), while Diet Barq's has no caffeine. Barq's also contains [[Benzene in soft drinks#2008|sodium benzoate]] as a flavor protectant, which under the right conditions, is a precursor to the known carcinogen benzene.<ref>{{cite web | title = Barq's Root Beer Caffeine Levels | url = http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/barqs-root-beer | publisher = Caffeine Informer | accessdate = 2015-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe Barq's that is dispensed from [[Coca-Cola Freestyle]] machines is caffeine-free.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/cocacolafreestyle/posts/10153199844082063 Statement by Coca-Cola on Facebook] 16 January 2016.

The Barq Brothers bottled [[carbonation|carbonated]] water and various soft drinks of their own creation. Early on, their most popular creation was an [[orange (fruit)|orange]]-flavored soda called ''Orangine'', which won a gold medal at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] [[World's Fair]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].{{citation needed|reason=not verified|date=May 2016}}\n\nEdward Barq moved to [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] in 1897 with his new wife. [[File:Barqs Sign.jpg|thumb|right]]The following year he opened the '''Biloxi Artesian Bottling Works'''. 1898 is often given as the debut year for what was later to be known as \"Barq's root beer,\" but some sources say this particular product was not produced until some two years later.<ref>{{cite web | title = Digging for facts | url = http://www.bottlebooks.com/questions/September2001/digging_for_facts.htm | publisher = bottlebooks.com}}</ref>\n\nIt was on the Mississippi coast that Barq met and employed a young boy, Jesse Robinson. Robinson was mentored by Barq and later moved to New Orleans to find his fortune. In 1934 Edward Barq, Sr. and Robinson signed a contractual agreement on Barq's product rights. The agreement was unique from other franchises in many aspects. For one thing, Robinson was allowed to make his own concentrate. The two men remained close their entire lives, working on flavors and production challenges. A distinctive difference between the Biloxi-based root beer and the Louisiana's was that the Louisiana bottle was printed in red (versus Biloxi's blue). This was to distinguish ownership of bottles as blue labeled ones were returned to Mississippi and vice versa. There were also regional taste differences between the various Barq's bottlers. While there may have been minor formula differences, water generally defined these differences.\n\nFor many decades, Barq's was not marketed as a \"root beer.\" This was in part a desire to avoid legal conflict with the [[Hires Root Beer]] company, which was attempting to claim a trademark on the term \"root beer.\" It was also due to differences from other root beers at the time. The formulation was [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]]-based, contained less sugar, had a higher carbonation, and less of a foamy head than other brands.<ref>{{cite web | title = Root Beer: An Exclusively American Soft Drink | url = http://grubamericana.com/2013/08/17/root-beer-an-exclusively-american-soft-drink/ | publisher = Grub Americana | accessdate = 2015-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional slogan was the simple affirmation \"Drink Barq's. It's good\" which first appeared on the classic diamond-necked bottle, patented in 1935 by Ed Barq.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lockhart|first1=Bill|title=Bottles on the Border: The History and Bottles of the Soft Drink Industry in El Paso, Texas, 1881-2000|url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/pdffiles/EPChap11b.pdf|website=Society for Historical Archaeology|publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|accessdate=29 June 2016|page=495|format=PDF|date=2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Biloxi Barq's Company was purchased from the third generation of Barq family members by John Oudt and John Koerner. An aggressive television campaign was developed based on the \"Barq's Got Sparks\" theme. Their plans to market the brand nationally were complicated by the existence of the Louisiana-based Barq's companies which were owned and operated by Robinson's heirs.\n\nThere were extended legal conflicts over the rights and ownership of the trademark Barq's, Barq's Sr. and Barq's Root Beer. The legal battle went all the way to the United States Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit, which ruled in favor of the Robinson heirs. The last family-held Louisiana Barq's was sold by Robinson's heirs to Coca-Cola in 2000.\n\nIn 1990, Barq's partnered with the Pick N Save grocery store in [[Dekalb, Illinois]] to create the World's Largest [[Root Beer Float]]. It was mixed in an above ground swimming pool in the parking lot and consisted of 1,500 gallons of Barq's root beer and 1,000 gallons of vanilla ice cream.\n\nIn recent years, Barq's has marketed with the slogan \"Barq's has bite!\"{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nRegular Barq's has 22.5 [[Milligram|mg]] of [[caffeine]] per 12 ounce serving (similar to [[green tea]]), while Diet Barq's has no caffeine. Barq's also contains [[Benzene in soft drinks#2008|sodium benzoate]] as a flavor protectant, which under the right conditions, is a precursor to the known carcinogen benzene.<ref>{{cite web | title = Barq's Root Beer Caffeine Levels | url = http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/barqs-root-beer | publisher = Caffeine Informer | accessdate = 2015-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe Barq's that is dispensed from [[Coca-Cola Freestyle]] machines is caffeine-free.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/cocacolafreestyle/posts/10153199844082063 Statement by Coca-Cola on Facebook] 16 January 2016.

Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where ''dukkha'' is the subject. Other forms take \"the world, the arising of the world\" or \"the [[Asava|\u0101savas]], the arising of the \u0101savas\" as their subject. According to Cousins, \"the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms.\"{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=36}} \"The world\" refers to the [[sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra]]s, that is, all compounded things,<ref group=web>[http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/7.2-Rohitassa-S-s2.26-piya.pdf The Dharmafarers, ''Rhitassa Sutra'' (Samyutta Nikaya 2.26)]</ref> or to the [[Ayatana|six sense spheres]].{{sfn|Choong|2000|p=84}}\n\nThe various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas|twelve nid\u0101nas]]. In the five skandhas, sense-contact with objects leads to sensation and perception; the [[sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra]] ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.) determine the interpretation of, and the response to, these sensations and perceptions, and affect consciousness in specific ways. The ''twelve nid\u0101nas'' describe the further process: craving and clinging (''[[up\u0101d\u0101na]]'') lead to ''[[bhava]]'' (becoming) and ''[[j\u0101ti]]'' (birth). \n\nIn the orthodox interpretation, ''bhava'' is interpreted as ''kammabhava'', that is , ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', while ''j\u0101ti'' is interpreted as rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=840}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=55\u201359}} In Thai Buddhism, ''bhava'' is interpreted as behavior which serves craving and clinging, while ''j\u0101ti'' is interpreted as the repeated birth of the ego or self-sense, which perpetuates the process of self-serving responses and actions.<ref name=\"Payutto\"/><ref name=\"Buddhadasa\"/>\n\n===Truths for the noble ones===\nThe Pali terms ''ariya sacca'' (Sanskrit: ''arya satya'') are commonly translated as \"noble truths\". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]],{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}\n{{quote|[T]here is no particular reason why the Pali expression ariyasaccani should be translated as 'noble truths'. It could equally be translated as 'the nobles' truths', or 'the truths for nobles', or 'the nobilising truths', or 'the truths of, possessed by, the noble ones' [...] In fact the Pali expression (and its Sanskrit equivalent) can mean all of these, although the Pali commentators place 'the noble truths' as the least important in their understanding.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}}\n\nThe term \"arya\" was later added to the four truths.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}}{{sfn|Analayo|2013|p=15}} The term ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'' (Sanskrit: ''arya'') can be translated as \"noble\", \"not ordinary\", \"valuable\", \"precious\".{{refn|group=note|Ajahn Sucitto states: \"So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called \u201cnoble\u201d truths, although one might also translate ariya as \"precious\", \"{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} \"pure\".{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Paul Williams:\n{{quote|The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}}}\n\nThe term ''[[satya|sacca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''[[satya]]'') is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as \"truth\"; but it also means \"that which is in accord with reality\", or \"reality\". According to [[Rupert Gethin]], the four truths are \"four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}} They function as \"a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name=\"Gethin_framework\"|Gethin: \"The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'.

[...] This is not to say that the Buddha's discourses do not contain theoretical statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}}} According to K.

Instead, they are a rather late theory on the content of the Buddha's enlightenment.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1990|p=28}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of ''dhyana'',{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi\u2013xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=93\u2013111}} leading to a calm of mind and [[Sati (Buddhism)|awareness]] (mindfulness){{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxv}} which according to Vetter ''is'' the liberation which is being sought.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi\u2013xxxvii}}{{refn|group=note|Note that ''dhyana'' is not the same as ''samatha'', the calming of the mind by one-pointedly concentration. While ''dhyana'' also leads to a calm of mind, it aids in developing mindfulness, which is necessary to be aware of the arising of disturbing, selfish, thoughts and emotions, and to counter them. Wynne: \"...the Buddha taught a \u2018middle way\u2019 between pure meditation and cognitive practices. The states of absorption induced by meditation were considered useful and necessary, but in distinction from the meditative mainstream their ultimate aim was insight. For the Buddha it was vitally important that the meditative adept should apply his concentrative state to the practice of mindfulness (Sn 1070: ''satima''; Sn 1111: ''ajjhatta\u00f1 ca bahiddha ca nabhinandato''; Sn 1113: ''ajjhatta\u00f1 ca bahiddha ca natthi ti passato''), and work towards the attainment of insight.

Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight \"varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=54\u201355, 96, 99}}}} This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,\n\n{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}\n\nAccording to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this \"liberating insight\" was not fixed but developed over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi\u2013xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Bronkhorst, in [[Presectarian Buddhism|earliest Buddhism]] the four truths did not serve as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this \"liberating insight\".

According to Bronkhorst, those are added the bridge the original sequence of \"I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants. My mind was liberated\", which was interrupted by the addition of the four truths. Bronkhorst points out that those do not fit here, since the four truths culminate in the knowledge of the path to be followed, while the Buddha himself is already liberated at that point.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\n====''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta''====\n[[File:Gandharan - Expounding the Law - Walters 2551.jpg|right|thumb|A relief depicting the first discourse of the Buddha, from the 2nd century (Kushan).<ref group=web>[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21971 Expounding the Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000844/http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21971 |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[The Walters Art Museum]]</ref> The Walters Art Museum.

In traditional Buddhism, rebirth continues the ''dukkha'' and the path to cessation of ''dukkha'' isn't suicide, but the fourth reality of the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=39\u201342}} The \"naturalized Buddhism\", according to Gowans, is a radical revision to traditional Buddhist thought and practice, and it attacks the structure behind the hopes, needs and rationalization of the realities of human life to traditional Buddhists in East, Southeast and South Asia.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|pp=18\u201323, 91\u201394}} According to Keown, it may not be necessary to believe in some of the core Buddhist doctrines to be a Buddhist, but the rebirth, karma, [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (Buddhism)|realms of existence]] and cyclic universe doctrines underpin the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown|2009|pp=60\u201363, 74\u201385, 185\u2013187}}\n\nTraditional Buddhist scholars disagree with these modernist Western interpretations. Bhikkhu Bodhi, for example, states that rebirth is an integral part of the Buddhist teachings as found in the sutras, despite the problems that \"modernist interpreters of Buddhism\" seem to have with it.<ref group=web name=\"BB-rebirth\"/>{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: \"Newcomers to Buddhism are usually impressed by the clarity, directness, and earthy practicality of the Dhamma as embodied in such basic teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the threefold training. These teachings, as clear as day-light, are accessible to any serious seeker looking for a way beyond suffering. When, however, these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth, they often balk, convinced it just doesn't make sense. At this point, they suspect that the teaching has swerved off course, tumbling from the grand highway of reason into wistfulness and speculation. Even modernist interpreters of Buddhism seem to have trouble taking the rebirth teaching seriously. Some dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage, \"ancient Indian metaphysics\", that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his age. Others interpret it as a metaphor for the change of mental states, with the realms of rebirth seen as symbols for psychological archetypes. A few critics even question the authenticity of the texts on rebirth, arguing that they must be interpolations.<br>A quick glance at the Pali suttas would show that none of these claims has much substance. The teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon, and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters. Moreover, when the suttas speak about rebirth into the five realms\u2014the hells, the animal world, the spirit realm, the human world, and the heavens\u2014they never hint that these terms are meant symbolically. To the contrary, they even say that rebirth occurs \"with the breakup of the body, after death,\" which clearly implies they intend the idea of rebirth to be taken quite literally.\"<ref group=web name=\"BB-rebirth\"/>}} [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], as another example, rejects the \"modern argument\" that \"one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth.\" He states, \"rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition.\"<ref group=web name=\"TB_Rebirth\">Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html ''The Truth of Rebirth.

After all, all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness, so there should be no need, when trying to abandon them, to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the future.<br>This objection, however, ignores the role of appropriate attention on the path. As we noted above, one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie one's views on the metaphysics of personal identity. Unless you're willing to step back from your own views\u2014such as those concerning what a person is, and why that makes rebirth impossible\u2014and subject them to this sort of examination, there's something lacking in your path. You'll remain entangled in the questions of inappropriate attention, which will prevent you from actually identifying and abandoning the causes of suffering and achieving the full results of the practice.<br><br>In addition, the terms of appropriate attention\u2014the four noble truths\u2014are not concerned simply with events arising and passing away in the present moment. They also focus on the causal connections among those events, connections that occur both in the immediate present and over time. If you limit your focus solely to connections in the present while ignoring those over time, you can't fully comprehend the ways in which craving causes suffering: not only by latching on to the four kinds of nutriment, but also giving rise to the four kinds of nutriment as well.<ref group=web name=\"TB_Rebirth\"/>}}{{refn|group=note|According to Konik: {{quote|No doubt, according to the early Indian Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's great discovery, as condensed in his experience of nirvana, involved the remembrance of his many former existences, presupposing as fact the reality of a never-ending process of rebirth as a source of deep anxiety, and an acceptance of the Buddha's overcoming of that fate as ultimate liberation.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}}}\n\nAccording to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that \"Buddhists believe in rebirth\" and that this belief has been common among his followers.

Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where ''dukkha'' is the subject. Other forms take \"the world, the arising of the world\" or \"the [[Asava|\u0101savas]], the arising of the \u0101savas\" as their subject. According to Cousins, \"the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms.\"{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=36}} \"The world\" refers to the [[sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra]]s, that is, all compounded things,<ref group=web>[http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/7.2-Rohitassa-S-s2.26-piya.pdf The Dharmafarers, ''Rhitassa Sutra'' (Samyutta Nikaya 2.26)]</ref> or to the [[Ayatana|six sense spheres]].{{sfn|Choong|2000|p=84}}\n\nThe various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas|twelve nid\u0101nas]]. In the five skandhas, sense-contact with objects leads to sensation and perception; the [[sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra]] ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.) determine the interpretation of, and the response to, these sensations and perceptions, and affect consciousness in specific ways. The ''twelve nid\u0101nas'' describe the further process: craving and clinging (''[[up\u0101d\u0101na]]'') lead to ''[[bhava]]'' (becoming) and ''[[j\u0101ti]]'' (birth). \n\nIn the orthodox interpretation, ''bhava'' is interpreted as ''kammabhava'', that is , ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', while ''j\u0101ti'' is interpreted as rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=840}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=55\u201359}} In Thai Buddhism, ''bhava'' is interpreted as behavior which serves craving and clinging, while ''j\u0101ti'' is interpreted as the repeated birth of the ego or self-sense, which perpetuates the process of self-serving responses and actions.<ref name=\"Payutto\"/><ref name=\"Buddhadasa\"/>\n\n===Truths for the noble ones===\nThe Pali terms ''ariya sacca'' (Sanskrit: ''arya satya'') are commonly translated as \"noble truths\". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]],{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}\n{{quote|[T]here is no particular reason why the Pali expression ariyasaccani should be translated as 'noble truths'. It could equally be translated as 'the nobles' truths', or 'the truths for nobles', or 'the nobilising truths', or 'the truths of, possessed by, the noble ones' [...] In fact the Pali expression (and its Sanskrit equivalent) can mean all of these, although the Pali commentators place 'the noble truths' as the least important in their understanding.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}}\n\nThe term \"arya\" was later added to the four truths.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}}{{sfn|Analayo|2013|p=15}} The term ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'' (Sanskrit: ''arya'') can be translated as \"noble\", \"not ordinary\", \"valuable\", \"precious\".{{refn|group=note|Ajahn Sucitto states: \"So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called \u201cnoble\u201d truths, although one might also translate ariya as \"precious\", \"{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} \"pure\".{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Paul Williams:\n{{quote|The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}}}\n\nThe term ''[[satya|sacca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''[[satya]]'') is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as \"truth\"; but it also means \"that which is in accord with reality\", or \"reality\". According to [[Rupert Gethin]], the four truths are \"four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}} They function as \"a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name=\"Gethin_framework\"|Gethin: \"The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'.

[...] This is not to say that the Buddha's discourses do not contain theoretical statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}}} According to K.

In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, \"without drastic changes in lifestyle\".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=172\u2013174}} The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia.{{refn|group=note|Stephen Batchelor states, \"Such craving is at the root of greed, hatred, and bewilderment that prompt one to commit acts that cause one to be reborn after death in more or less favourable conditions in samsara. Although I have presented this formulation of the existential dilemma and its resolution in Buddhist terms, the same soteriological framework is shared by Hindus and Jains. (...) So embedded is this Indian soteriological framework in Buddhism that Buddhists might find it unintelligible that one would even consider questioning it. For to dispense with such key doctrines as rebirth, the law of kamma, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death would surely undermine the entire edifice of Buddhism itself. Yet for those who have grown up outside of Indian culture, who feel at home in a modernity informed by the natural sciences, to then be told that one cannot \u201creally\u201d practise the dharma unless one adheres to the tenets of ancient Indian soteriology makes little sense. The reason people can no longer accept these beliefs need not be because they reject them as false, but because such views are too much at variance with everything else they know and believe about the nature of themselves and the world. They simply do not work anymore, and the intellectual gymnastics one needs to perform to make them work seem casuistic and, for many, unpersuasive.

The possibility of achieving nirvana is primarily a concern for Buddhist monastics, while the laity are more concerned with avoiding karma that would propel them to a miserable rebirth, and with accumulating meritorious karma that will lead to a favorable rebirth and, in the long run, to ultimate liberation. (...) As a direct result of their belief in the efficacy of karma, Theravada lay Buddhists commonly make offerings of food, goods, and money to the ordained Sangha.

Wynne: \"...the Buddha taught a \u2018middle way\u2019 between pure meditation and cognitive practices. The states of absorption induced by meditation were considered useful and necessary, but in distinction from the meditative mainstream their ultimate aim was insight.

By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight \"varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=54\u201355, 96, 99}}}} This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,\n\n{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}\n\nAccording to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this \"liberating insight\" was not fixed but developed over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi\u2013xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Bronkhorst, in [[Presectarian Buddhism|earliest Buddhism]] the four truths did not serve as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this \"liberating insight\".

When, however, these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth, they often balk, convinced it just doesn't make sense. At this point, they suspect that the teaching has swerved off course, tumbling from the grand highway of reason into wistfulness and speculation. Even modernist interpreters of Buddhism seem to have trouble taking the rebirth teaching seriously. Some dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage, \"ancient Indian metaphysics\", that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his age. Others interpret it as a metaphor for the change of mental states, with the realms of rebirth seen as symbols for psychological archetypes. A few critics even question the authenticity of the texts on rebirth, arguing that they must be interpolations.<br>A quick glance at the Pali suttas would show that none of these claims has much substance. The teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon, and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters. Moreover, when the suttas speak about rebirth into the five realms\u2014the hells, the animal world, the spirit realm, the human world, and the heavens\u2014they never hint that these terms are meant symbolically.

After all, all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness, so there should be no need, when trying to abandon them, to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the future.<br>This objection, however, ignores the role of appropriate attention on the path. As we noted above, one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie one's views on the metaphysics of personal identity. Unless you're willing to step back from your own views\u2014such as those concerning what a person is, and why that makes rebirth impossible\u2014and subject them to this sort of examination, there's something lacking in your path.

It is based on the [[Fight Club (novel)|1996 novel of the same name]] by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. Norton plays [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|the unnamed narrator]], who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with him and a destitute woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).\n\nPalahniuk's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by [[Fox 2000 Pictures]] producer [[Laura Ziskin]], who hired [[Jim Uhls]] to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. He and the cast compared the film to ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), with a theme of conflict between [[Generation X]] and the [[value (ethics)#Value system|value system]] of advertising.<ref name=CNN1999/><ref name=Laist/>\n\nStudio executives did not like the film, and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. ''Fight Club'' failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office, and received polarized reactions from critics. It was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999. ''The Guardian'' saw it as an omen for change in American political life, and described its visual style as ground-breaking. The film later found commercial success with its DVD release, establishing ''Fight Club'' as a [[Cult film|cult classic]] and causing media to revisit the film. On the tenth anniversary of the film's release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' dubbed it the \"defining cult movie of our time.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Dennis |title=Forget Rule No. 1: Still Talking About 'Fight Club' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/movies/homevideo/08lim.html |accessdate=July 24, 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=November 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe unnamed [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|Narrator]] is an automobile [[Product recall|recall]] specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions. He finds [[catharsis]] by posing as a sufferer of [[testicular cancer]] and other afflictions in [[support group]]s, curing his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer. The two agree to split which groups they attend.\n\nOn a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment and all his belongings have been destroyed by an explosion. He is disheartened by the loss of his [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] items. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to [[consumerism]]. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight.\n\nThe Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights move to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally.\n\nMarla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla begin a sexual relationship, much to the Narrator's irritation. Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss for his company's assets to support Fight Club and quits his job.\n\nSoon, Fight Clubs begin to form across the country. New members begin to join en masse, including Robert Paulson, a man with testicular cancer who the Narrator had previously met in a support group. Tyler recruits their members to a new anti-[[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[anti-corporate]] organization, Project Mayhem, without the Narrator's involvement. The group engages in subversive acts of vandalism and violence, increasingly troubling the Narrator. After the Narrator complains that Tyler has excluded him, Tyler leaves the house. The Narrator realizes that Tyler caused the explosion at his apartment.\n\nWhen Paulson is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries to halt the project. He follows a paper trail to cities Tyler has visited. In one city, a Project Mayhem member addresses the Narrator as \"Mr. Durden.\" Confused, the Narrator calls Marla and discovers that she also believes he is Tyler. Tyler appears in his hotel room and reveals that they are [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociated personalities]] in the same body; the Narrator assumed the personality of Tyler when he believed he was sleeping.\n\nThe Narrator blacks out. When he returns to the house, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card records. He apologizes to Marla and warns her that she is in danger, but she is tired of his contradictory behavior and refuses to listen. He tries to warn the police, but the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in one building, but Tyler subdues him.  With Tyler holding him by gunpoint in the top floor, the Narrator realizes that, as he and Tyler are the same person, he is holding the gun. He fires it into his own mouth, shooting through his cheek, which causes Tyler to collapse since he thinks he has committed suicide; the Narrator ceases [[mental projection]] of Tyler. Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to the building. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing buildings around them.\nRules of fight club. rule ONE: do not talk about fight club (whoops broke the rules) TWO: DO NOT talk about fight club (broke the rules again oops-) THIRD rule of Fight Club: Someone yells \"Stop!\", goes limp, taps out, the fight is over.

Fincher described the Narrator as an \"[[everyman]]\";<ref name=\"smith64\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=64}}</ref> the character is identified in the script as \"Jack\", but left unnamed in the film.<ref>{{cite magazine | title = 100 DVDs You Must Own | page = 31 |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=January 2003 }}</ref> Fincher outlined the Narrator's background: \"He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't.\" He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must \"kill\" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.<ref name=\"smith60\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=60}}</ref>\n\nThe character is a 1990s inverse of the ''Graduate'' archetype: \"a guy who does ''not'' have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has ''no'' possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'', in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained: \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\"<ref name=\"smith64\" /> While studio executives worried that ''Fight Club'' was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\nScreenwriter [[Jim Uhls]] described the film as a [[romantic comedy]], explaining: \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which ''seems'' unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them\u2014because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Sragow |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |title=Testosterama |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=October 14, 1999 |accessdate=December 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209021705/http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |archive-date=December 9, 2007}}</ref> The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler.

Before its publication, a [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] book scout sent a [[galley proof]] of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers [[Lawrence Bender]] and [[Art Linson]], who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to [[Laura Ziskin]], head of the division [[Fox 2000]], who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to ''Fight Club'' from Palahniuk for $10,000.<ref name=\"mav1\">{{Harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=137\u2013151}}</ref>\n\nZiskin initially considered hiring [[Buck Henry]] to write the adaptation, finding ''Fight Club'' similar to the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, [[Jim Uhls]], lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered [[Peter Jackson]] the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film ''[[The Frighteners]]'' in New Zealand. [[Bryan Singer]] received the book but did not read it. [[Danny Boyle]] met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. [[David Fincher]], who had read ''Fight Club'' and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]]'' for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head [[Bill Mechanic]].<ref name=\"mav1\" /> In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of ''Fight Club''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Michael |last= Fleming |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678264 |title=Thornton holds reins of 'Horses' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 19, 1997 |accessdate= November 30, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nProducer Ross Bell met with actor [[Russell Crowe]] to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.<ref name= mav1 /> Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 film ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', and the studio believed ''Fight Club'' would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5&nbsp;million.<ref name= mav2 />\n\nFor the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \"sexier marquee name\" such as [[Matt Damon]] to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered [[Sean Penn]].

He was cast in ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5&nbsp;million for ''Fight Club''. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed [[Paramount Pictures]] a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary.

Fincher compared ''Fight Club'' to his subsequent, less complex film ''[[Panic Room (film)|Panic Room]]'': \"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Covert | url= | title=Fear factor is Fincher's forte | work=[[Star Tribune]] | date=March 29, 2002 }}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\nFincher used the [[Super 35]] format to film ''Fight Club'' since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired [[Jeff Cronenweth]] as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father [[Jordan Cronenweth]] had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]],'' but left midway through production due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'', and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for ''Fight Club''.<ref name=\"anarchy\" />\n\nFincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \"sort of shiny\".<ref name=\"comment65\" /> The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense\u2014a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \"[[Heroin|smack]]-fiend [[patina]]\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.<ref name=\"comment65\" />\n\nThe crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]]' technique as the influence.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" />\n\n''Fight Club'' was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.<ref name=\"anarchy\" />\n\nThe scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in [[two shot]]s with a group of people, nor was he shown in any [[over the shoulder shot|over-the-shoulder shot]]s in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for [[subliminal message|subliminal effect]].<ref name=\"comment65\" /> Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \"little devil on the shoulder\".<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> Fincher explained the subliminal frames: \"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\"<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nWhile Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak [[film stock]] normally on ''Fight Club'', several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. [[Flashing (cinematography)|Flashing]] was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be [[exposure (photography)|underexposed]], [[Technicolor]]'s ENR [[bleach bypass|silver retention]] was used on a select number of prints to increase the [[optical density|density]] of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \"stepped-on\" look on the print with a dirty patina.<ref name=\"comment65\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFincher hired [[visual effects supervisor]] [[Kevin Tod Haug]], who worked for him on ''The Game'', to create visual effects for ''Fight Club''. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \"[[mind's eye]]\" view and structured a [[myopia|myopic]] framework for the film audiences.

The network was mapped using an [[L-system]] and drawn out by a medical illustrator.]]\nThe film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse.<ref name=\"comment61\u201362\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=61\u201362}}</ref> The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999.<ref name=\"cinefex\" /> Fincher hired [[Digital Domain]] and its visual effects supervisor [[Kevin Mack (visual effects artist)|Kevin Mack]], who won an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] for the 1998 film ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'', for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an [[L-system]],<ref>{{cite magazine | first=Mark | last=Frauenfelder | authorlink=Mark Frauenfelder | url= | title=Hollywood's Head Case |magazine=[[Wired magazine|Wired]] |date=August 1999 }}</ref> and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included [[neuron]]s, [[action potential]]s, and a [[hair follicle]]. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like [[electron microscopy|electron microscope photography]], that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive\u2014wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\" The shallow [[depth of field]] was accomplished with the [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] process.<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nOther visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100&nbsp;photographs of Los Angeles and [[Century City]] by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen&nbsp;months.<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nMidway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the [[cue mark]]\u2014nicknamed \"cigarette burn\" in the film\u2014to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \"fairly subjective reality\" that existed earlier in the film.

They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm [[Wieden+Kennedy]] to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \"Fight Club\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \"a bad joke\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake [[public service announcement]]s presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20&nbsp;million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised ''Fight Club'' on cable during [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.<ref name=\"mav4\" /> Linson believed that the \"ill-conceived one-dimensional\" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to ''Fight Club''{{'}}s lukewarm box office performance in the United States.<ref name=\"what\">{{harvnb|Linson|2002|p=155}}</ref>\n\n===Theatrical run===\nThe studio held ''Fight Club''{{'}}s world premiere at the [[56th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 10, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title='Fight Club' gets Venice premiere |url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/091199/wor_LA0734.001.shtml |accessdate=February 16, 2015 |publisher=Associated Press via [[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |date=September 11, 1999 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216182818/http://lubbockonline.com/stories/091199/wor_LA0734.001.shtml |archive-date=February 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gristwood |first=Sarah |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/14/1 |title=Fury of fists |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=September 14, 1999 |accessdate=July 15, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107181749/http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/14/1 |archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref> For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross between US$13&nbsp;million and US$15&nbsp;million in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bruce | last=Orwall | url= | title=L.A.

It is based on the [[Fight Club (novel)|1996 novel of the same name]] by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. Norton plays [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|the unnamed narrator]], who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with him and a destitute woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).\n\nPalahniuk's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by [[Fox 2000 Pictures]] producer [[Laura Ziskin]], who hired [[Jim Uhls]] to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. He and the cast compared the film to ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), with a theme of conflict between [[Generation X]] and the [[value (ethics)#Value system|value system]] of advertising.<ref name=CNN1999/><ref name=Laist/>\n\nStudio executives did not like the film, and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. ''Fight Club'' failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office, and received polarized reactions from critics. It was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999. ''The Guardian'' saw it as an omen for change in American political life, and described its visual style as ground-breaking. The film later found commercial success with its DVD release, establishing ''Fight Club'' as a [[Cult film|cult classic]] and causing media to revisit the film. On the tenth anniversary of the film's release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' dubbed it the \"defining cult movie of our time.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Dennis |title=Forget Rule No. 1: Still Talking About 'Fight Club' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/movies/homevideo/08lim.html |accessdate=July 24, 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=November 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe unnamed [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|Narrator]] is an automobile [[Product recall|recall]] specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions. He finds [[catharsis]] by posing as a sufferer of [[testicular cancer]] and other afflictions in [[support group]]s, curing his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer. The two agree to split which groups they attend.\n\nOn a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment and all his belongings have been destroyed by an explosion. He is disheartened by the loss of his [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] items. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to [[consumerism]]. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight.\n\nThe Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights move to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally.\n\nMarla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla begin a sexual relationship, much to the Narrator's irritation. Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss for his company's assets to support Fight Club and quits his job.\n\nSoon, Fight Clubs begin to form across the country. New members begin to join en masse, including Robert Paulson, a man with testicular cancer who the Narrator had previously met in a support group. Tyler recruits their members to a new anti-[[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[anti-corporate]] organization, Project Mayhem, without the Narrator's involvement. The group engages in subversive acts of vandalism and violence, increasingly troubling the Narrator. After the Narrator complains that Tyler has excluded him, Tyler leaves the house. The Narrator realizes that Tyler caused the explosion at his apartment.\n\nWhen Paulson is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries to halt the project. He follows a paper trail to cities Tyler has visited. In one city, a Project Mayhem member addresses the Narrator as \"Mr. Durden.\" Confused, the Narrator calls Marla and discovers that she also believes he is Tyler. Tyler appears in his hotel room and reveals that they are [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociated personalities]] in the same body; the Narrator assumed the personality of Tyler when he believed he was sleeping.\n\nThe Narrator blacks out. When he returns to the house, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card records. He apologizes to Marla and warns her that she is in danger, but she is tired of his contradictory behavior and refuses to listen. He tries to warn the police, but the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in one building, but Tyler subdues him.  With Tyler holding him by gunpoint in the top floor, the Narrator realizes that, as he and Tyler are the same person, he is holding the gun. He fires it into his own mouth, shooting through his cheek, which causes Tyler to collapse since he thinks he has committed suicide; the Narrator ceases [[mental projection]] of Tyler. Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to the building. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing buildings around them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Brad Pitt]] (left) in 2014 and [[Edward Norton]] (right) in 2012\n| image1 = Brad Pitt June 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| alt1 = A Caucasian man with black hair and glasses.

By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.<ref name=\"smith60\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=60}}</ref>\n\nThe character is a 1990s inverse of the ''Graduate'' archetype: \"a guy who does ''not'' have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has ''no'' possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'', in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained: \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\"<ref name=\"smith64\" /> While studio executives worried that ''Fight Club'' was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\nScreenwriter [[Jim Uhls]] described the film as a [[romantic comedy]], explaining: \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which ''seems'' unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them\u2014because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Sragow |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |title=Testosterama |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=October 14, 1999 |accessdate=December 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209021705/http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |archive-date=December 9, 2007}}</ref> The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler.

Before its publication, a [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] book scout sent a [[galley proof]] of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers [[Lawrence Bender]] and [[Art Linson]], who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to [[Laura Ziskin]], head of the division [[Fox 2000]], who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to ''Fight Club'' from Palahniuk for $10,000.<ref name=\"mav1\">{{Harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=137\u2013151}}</ref>\n\nZiskin initially considered hiring [[Buck Henry]] to write the adaptation, finding ''Fight Club'' similar to the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, [[Jim Uhls]], lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered [[Peter Jackson]] the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film ''[[The Frighteners]]'' in New Zealand. [[Bryan Singer]] received the book but did not read it. [[Danny Boyle]] met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. [[David Fincher]], who had read ''Fight Club'' and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]]'' for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head [[Bill Mechanic]].<ref name=\"mav1\" /> In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of ''Fight Club''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Michael |last= Fleming |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678264 |title=Thornton holds reins of 'Horses' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 19, 1997 |accessdate= November 30, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nProducer Ross Bell met with actor [[Russell Crowe]] to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.<ref name= mav1 /> Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 film ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', and the studio believed ''Fight Club'' would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5&nbsp;million.<ref name= mav2 />\n\nFor the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \"sexier marquee name\" such as [[Matt Damon]] to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered [[Sean Penn]].

He was cast in ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5&nbsp;million for ''Fight Club''. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed [[Paramount Pictures]] a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary.

Fincher compared ''Fight Club'' to his subsequent, less complex film ''[[Panic Room (film)|Panic Room]]'': \"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Covert | url= | title=Fear factor is Fincher's forte | work=[[Star Tribune]] | date=March 29, 2002 }}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\nFincher used the [[Super 35]] format to film ''Fight Club'' since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired [[Jeff Cronenweth]] as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father [[Jordan Cronenweth]] had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]],'' but left midway through production due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'', and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for ''Fight Club''.<ref name=\"anarchy\" />\n\nFincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \"sort of shiny\".<ref name=\"comment65\" /> The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense\u2014a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \"[[Heroin|smack]]-fiend [[patina]]\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.<ref name=\"comment65\" />\n\nThe crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.<ref name=\"anarchy\" /> On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]]' technique as the influence.<ref name=\"DVDcom\" />\n\n''Fight Club'' was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.<ref name=\"anarchy\" />\n\nThe scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in [[two shot]]s with a group of people, nor was he shown in any [[over the shoulder shot|over-the-shoulder shot]]s in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for [[subliminal message|subliminal effect]].<ref name=\"comment65\" /> Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \"little devil on the shoulder\".<ref name=\"DVDcom\" /> Fincher explained the subliminal frames: \"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\"<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nWhile Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak [[film stock]] normally on ''Fight Club'', several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. [[Flashing (cinematography)|Flashing]] was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be [[exposure (photography)|underexposed]], [[Technicolor]]'s ENR [[bleach bypass|silver retention]] was used on a select number of prints to increase the [[optical density|density]] of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \"stepped-on\" look on the print with a dirty patina.<ref name=\"comment65\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFincher hired [[visual effects supervisor]] [[Kevin Tod Haug]], who worked for him on ''The Game'', to create visual effects for ''Fight Club''. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \"[[mind's eye]]\" view and structured a [[myopia|myopic]] framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used [[previsualization|previsualized]] footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.<ref name=\"cinefex\">{{cite journal |first=Kevin H. |last=Martin |title=A World of Hurt |journal=[[Cinefex]] |date=January 2000 |url=http://www.edward-norton.org/fc/articles/worldofhurt.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040227070738/http://www.edward-norton.org/fc/articles/worldofhurt.html |archive-date=February 27, 2004 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Fight Club fear center.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Blue and rough-looking tendrils stretch into a vanishing point in the middle; tendrils on the right side are visible, where the rest are obscured in darkness.

The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an [[L-system]],<ref>{{cite magazine | first=Mark | last=Frauenfelder | authorlink=Mark Frauenfelder | url= | title=Hollywood's Head Case |magazine=[[Wired magazine|Wired]] |date=August 1999 }}</ref> and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included [[neuron]]s, [[action potential]]s, and a [[hair follicle]]. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like [[electron microscopy|electron microscope photography]], that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive\u2014wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\" The shallow [[depth of field]] was accomplished with the [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] process.<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nOther visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100&nbsp;photographs of Los Angeles and [[Century City]] by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen&nbsp;months.<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\nMidway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the [[cue mark]]\u2014nicknamed \"cigarette burn\" in the film\u2014to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \"fairly subjective reality\" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained: \"Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.\"<ref name=\"cinefex\" />\n\n===Score===\nFincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing [[film score]]s would be unable to tie the themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film.

They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm [[Wieden+Kennedy]] to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \"Fight Club\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \"a bad joke\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake [[public service announcement]]s presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20&nbsp;million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised ''Fight Club'' on cable during [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.<ref name=\"mav4\" /> Linson believed that the \"ill-conceived one-dimensional\" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to ''Fight Club''{{'}}s lukewarm box office performance in the United States.<ref name=\"what\">{{harvnb|Linson|2002|p=155}}</ref>\n\n===Theatrical run===\nThe studio held ''Fight Club''{{'}}s world premiere at the [[56th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 10, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title='Fight Club' gets Venice premiere |url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/091199/wor_LA0734.001.shtml |accessdate=February 16, 2015 |publisher=Associated Press via [[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |date=September 11, 1999 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216182818/http://lubbockonline.com/stories/091199/wor_LA0734.001.shtml |archive-date=February 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gristwood |first=Sarah |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/14/1 |title=Fury of fists |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=September 14, 1999 |accessdate=July 15, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107181749/http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/14/1 |archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref> For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross between US$13&nbsp;million and US$15&nbsp;million in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bruce | last=Orwall | url= | title=L.A.
