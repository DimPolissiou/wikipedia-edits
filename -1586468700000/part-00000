It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Dens have been observed under fallen trees and tree roots, from wherein the area outside could be easily surveyed. Kittens leave the den after about five weeks, and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but do not reach the full adult size until around two years old. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years.

Canada lynxes shun open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s.

The animal remained unidentified at the time and was preserved by [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]], and was finally identified in a 2014 study. The researchers concluded that it had probably been captive for some time, perhaps as an [[exotic pet]] or part of a traveling menagerie, but may have survived for a substantial period after escaping.

To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as [[habitat fragmentation]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Holloway Harris''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] on the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[Mad Men]]'' (2007\u201315). She is portrayed by [[Christina Hendricks]].\n\nHendricks has received six consecutive [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] and has won two [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] for her performance. She has also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]] twice along with the cast of ''Mad Men''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Background===\n\nJoan was born on February 24, 1931. From Season 1 through Season 3, Joan is the [[office manager]] at the advertising agency Sterling Cooper. Her primary responsibilities are to manage the secretarial, steno, and telephone operators pools; attend to the needs of the executives; and organize agency events. She is also seen during meetings with the heads of departments, implementing ''[[Roberts Rules of Order]]'', taking notes, and reminding the male staff of their duties to their clients, and assisting Creative Director [[Don Draper]] ([[Jon Hamm]]) and [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] [[Lane Pryce]] ([[Jared Harris]]) with SC financial duties. She also serves as the direct superior of secretary [[Peggy Olson]] ([[Elisabeth Moss]]). Joan and Peggy do not get along at first; Joan is contemptuous of Peggy's demure attitude and conservative dress, while Peggy is intimidated by Joan's beauty and assertiveness. Over the course of the series, however, the two become good friends, and support each other through their personal and professional struggles, with Joan being especially supportive of Peggy's evolution as a copywriter in the male-dominated culture of advertising.\n\nJoan had a lengthy romantic involvement with [[Roger Sterling]] ([[John Slattery]]), which ended after Roger's [[heart attack]]. After [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s death, Roger walks into his office to find Joan lying on his couch and crying. Realizing she is upset over the similarities she sees between the actress's life and her own, Roger comforts Joan by assuring her she will not end up alone and in despair like Monroe.\n\nSometime before the start of the series, Joan was briefly married to a man named Scotty. Though Scotty is never seen, she mentioned to a friend in the [[Mad Men (season 6)|season 6]] episode \"To Have and To Hold\" that her marriage to him was the \"worst six months of my life.\"\n\nJoan had also had an intimate relationship with copywriter [[Paul Kinsey]] ([[Michael Gladis]]) sometime before the series began; Joan ended the relationship because Paul had \"a big mouth\" (implying that he bragged about the relationship to others). Her roommate, Carol ([[Kate Norby]]), whom Joan knows from college, expresses romantic interest in Joan in the episode \"The Long Weekend\", although Joan gently rebuffs her advances.\n\nIn [[Mad Men (season 2)|Season 2]], Joan becomes engaged to Greg Harris ([[Samuel Page]]), a [[physician|doctor]] at St. Luke's Hospital. As the season goes on, Joan is clearly torn between wanting to be a well-off, married woman (the pinnacle of her ambition) and the fear that she will become a bored, lonely housewife. Her feelings are exacerbated when she is briefly given additional responsibilities at Sterling Cooper reading television scripts to determine ad placement, which thrills her. However, Media Director [[List of Mad Men characters#Harry Crane|Harry Crane]] ([[Rich Sommer]]) ultimately hires a young, unqualified man to take over the ad placement job, to her disappointment.\n\nIn \"[[The Mountain King (Mad Men)|The Mountain King]]\", Greg picks Joan up at Sterling Cooper for a dinner date. Greg meets Roger Sterling for the first time and immediately picks up that Roger knows Joan's likes and dislikes. Joan attempts to dismiss his suspicions by claiming that Roger only knows her well because of how long she has been with the agency. Unconvinced, Greg follows Joan as she enters Don's office to lock up, then forces her to the floor, and [[rape]]s her.\n\nIn the interim between Seasons 2 and 3, Joan and Greg have married. In Season 3's third episode, \"My Old Kentucky Home\", it is revealed that Greg is not the accomplished surgeon that Joan had hoped he would be. She leaves Sterling Cooper to become a housewife in [[Mad Men (season 3)|Season 3]], but is later seen by Accounts Executive [[Pete Campbell]] ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]) working at [[Bonwit Teller]] due to Greg's failure to receive a promotion. Joan mentions to Pete that Greg is considering going into psychiatry, in hopes of salvaging his career.\n\nJoan helps Greg prepare for a job interview, but he fails to get the job. The two have a heated argument, ending with Joan smashing a vase over Greg's head. Joan later places a call to Roger Sterling's office after hours, asking him to help her find another office manager job. Greg ultimately obtains an officer's commission in the Army where he will serve as a military surgeon, and tells Joan she will no longer have to work. Despite this, Joan comes to the aid of Don, Roger, Lane, and Bert Cooper ([[Robert Morse]]) to launch the new Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce by finding accounting materials and client records. When the new company sets up shop at [[The Pierre]] hotel, Joan takes the position of office manager.\n\n===At Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce (SCDP)===\nJoan is recognized by most (though not all) of the staff as being integral in SCDP's daily operations. A notable feature of Joan's new office is an intercom to the conference room that she can use to monitor meetings with; a feature conveniently forgotten by everyone except her and Peggy.\n\nIn [[Mad Men (season 4)|Season 4]], Joan and Greg are shown trying to conceive, but their marriage is strained by Greg's having to attend [[basic training]] and later being sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. In his absence, Joan and Roger briefly rekindle their affair, after being mugged one night while walking home from a friendly dinner. Their night of passion leaves Joan pregnant, so she and Roger decide to \"take care of it\". Joan makes an appointment at an [[abortion]] clinic but in the waiting room, she is mistaken for a mother waiting for her daughter to get an abortion. Joan realizes her time to conceive is running out, so she decides to pass Roger's baby off as Greg's. Also in season 4, Joan receives a title-only promotion to Director of Agency Operations, in recognition of her role in keeping SCDP afloat amid its recent financial troubles. Other season 4 developments include Joan's working relationship with Peggy, the only other high-ranking woman at SCDP.\n\nIn the [[A Little Kiss|Season 5 premiere]], Greg is still in Vietnam. Joan has given birth to a boy named Kevin and is finishing her maternity leave from SCDP.  She begins making plans to return to work, while her mother, Gail ([[Christine Estabrook]]), is staying with her to help with the baby.\n\nIn \"[[Mystery Date (Mad Men)|Mystery Date]]\", Greg returns home from Vietnam, but informs Joan he is being ordered to go back for an additional year. However, it is revealed that Greg actually reenlisted voluntarily since the army makes him feel purposeful, even though the war is becoming increasingly dangerous. Joan becomes enraged and throws him out. Joan tells him he has never been a good man, alluding to his rape. He threatens to divorce her if he leaves, but Joan simply tells him to leave.\n\nIn \"[[Christmas Waltz (Mad Men)|Christmas Waltz]]\", a process server shows up at the SCDP office to serve Joan with divorce papers, which upsets her. Joan yells at SCDP's receptionist, Meredith ([[Stephanie Drake]]), and storms off. Don offers to take her out for the day and the two test drive a Jaguar.  They spend the remainder of the afternoon drinking in a midtown bar, and she confesses to Don that she is unsure of how to start over with a baby.\n\nIn \"[[The Other Woman (Mad Men)|The Other Woman]]\", Joan is taken aback when the partners (minus Don, who dissents) present her with an offer to sleep with Herb Rennet ([[Gary Basaraba]]), in order to secure them the Jaguar account. She eventually agrees, thinking that all the partners agreed to the offer. At Lane's suggestion, she demands 5% of SCDP and a voting partnership, instead of the $50,000 lump sum she was initially offered (unbeknownst to her, Lane's suggestion that she turn down the lump sum was in part to cover up his embezzlement). As partner, Joan's overall role in day-to-day operations doesn't change much beyond the fact that she now votes in partners' meetings.\n\nDuring this time, Lane expresses romantic interest in Joan but she does not return it. In \"[[Commissions and Fees]]\", Joan discovers Lane's body after he commits suicide in his office. She later expresses confusion to Don, saying that if she had slept with him, he would not have died. Don assures her that she is worth more than her body, which she is grateful for. In the Season 5 finale, Joan appears to have taken over Lane's accounting duties and presides over the acquisition of new office space for the firm.\n\n===At Sterling Cooper & Partners (SC&P)===\nAt the start of Season 6, Joan has settled into her new role as partner at SCDP.  In \"To Have and To Hold\", Joan discovers that Harry Crane's secretary, Scarlet ([[Sadie Alexandru]]), has been having Dawn ([[Teyonah Parris]]), Don's secretary, punch out her time cards. Joan confronts them and fires Scarlet, angering Harry. He yells at the other partners for letting Joan do whatever she wants, clearly resenting being passed over for partner. He implies that Joan prostituted herself for her partnership, much to Joan's humiliation.\n\nIn the same episode, Joan is visited by a childhood friend, Kate ([[Marley Shelton]]), who now works for [[Mary Kay Cosmetics]]. Kate expresses her admiration for Joan, believing that Joan's partnership has more power than it actually has. This causes Joan to realize that she must stop acting like a secretary.  She transfers many of her office manager duties to Dawn in order to concentrate on her new role.\n\nIn \"For Immediate Release\", Joan is outraged when Don fires Jaguar after a tense meeting with Rennett. She publicly lambasts Don for negating the sacrifice she made to ensure the account and their personal relationship permanently suffers. In \"Man with a Plan\", Joan presides over the complicated physical logistics of SCDP's merger with CGC. CGC's secretaries express irritation at being placed under Joan's command, but she brushes them off to warmly welcome back Peggy, who had briefly left to work for [[McCann-Erickson]]. Bob Benson ([[James Wolk]]), an eager new hire in accounts, walks in on Joan, who is in extreme pain.  He discreetly escorts her to the hospital and is also able to expedite her care. Joan is suspicious of Bob's motives for helping her, but her mother advises her that not every good deed is a front. In return, Joan quietly steps in to save Bob's job when he is about to be laid off.\n\nBy \"The Better Half\", Joan and Bob have become close friends, and are preparing to go to the beach together with Kevin. Roger appears unannounced and is suspicious of Bob's presence. Roger attempts to be a part of Joan and Kevin's lives, but she tells him that she intends to let Kevin grow up thinking that Greg is his father.\n\nIn \"A Tale of Two Cities\", Joan goes on a blind date with an Avon executive, which is arranged by Kate. However, it turns out to be a business meeting, as Avon is looking for a new direction. Joan is eager to expand her role in the firm and recruits Peggy to assist her in securing the account.  However, she nearly blows it by excluding Pete from the proceedings and coming on aggressively at the meeting. Peggy is able to narrowly salvage the situation and the two women again reach an understanding.\n\nLater on, Joan easily sees the attraction between Peggy and CGC executive Ted Chaough ([[Kevin Rahm]]), but doesn't mention it to Don until they go over budget for a commercial. Joan is shocked when Don smooths the client's feathers by saying the expensive idea was that of the deceased Gleason.  This averts the client's anger but embarrasses Ted and takes credit away from Peggy in the process. Don\u2019s choice in dealing with the situation, in addition to his earlier impetuousness in firing Jaguar, makes her wary of Don. When Thanksgiving 1968 approaches, Joan agrees with Cooper, Sterling, and Senior Partner Jim Cutler ([[Harry Hamlin]]) that Don should be placed on leave, as she is concerned with Don's erratic behavior and its overall effect on the firm. Joan reveals that she has made arrangements for Creative to continue functioning, with Ted overseeing Peggy long-distance. Joan invites Roger to spend Thanksgiving with her. When Roger responds negatively to the presence of Bob, whom Joan had also invited, she warns him that she is allowing him into Kevin's life, but not hers.\n\nIn Season 7, Joan completely cedes her office-manager role to Dawn and takes a more active role as junior partner and account executive - handling Avon and Butler Footwear.  She proves to be capable, as well as a quick study.  Her personality has hardened considerably, and she seems more money-conscious, which is likely motivated by her status as single mother.  Initially, she bears a clear animus towards Don for having fired Jaguar, as it cost her a substantial amount of money when the public offering fell through. She casts a vote to fire Don for \"costing me money\" when he violates the terms of his return, though she later favors the sale to McCann-Erickson because it stands to provide her with more than $1 million. Joan also rejects a marriage proposal from Bob, who is [[gay]], on the grounds that both of them deserve real love and not an \"arrangement\" that is meant only to cope with Joan's financial difficulties and Bob's need to be in [[the closet]].\n\nDuring the second half of Season 7, Joan has gained confidence in her new position.  During a business trip to SCDP's West Coast office, she meets Richard ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), a wealthy and very charming real estate developer whom she begins dating (though he initially expresses regret over the fact that Joan has a small child). However, as her personal life begins to come together for the first time since her divorce from Greg, she suffers professionally when SCDP is absorbed into McCann. She takes issue with the lewd and sexist treatment that she receives from her male colleagues at the new agency and complains to Jim Hobart (H. Richard Greene), the Director at McCann.  Hobart responds first with condescension and then with contempt. When Joan threatens to take legal action and to reveal McCann's misogynistic culture to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Hobart offers to buy Joan's remaining contract out for half of what it's worth. Joan vows to stay at McCann and fight, but Roger convinces her that it would be more pragmatic to take the money and walk away.\n\nIn the series finale, \"Person to Person\", Joan starts her own film production company. She attempts to recruit Peggy as a partner, but Peggy chooses to stay at McCann.  Joan and Richard continue dating and become somewhat serious about one another, but he is opposed to her re-entering the business world.  When Joan announces she is starting her own company, he ends their relationship.  She is last seen watching her mother and Kevin go off to the park and then resuming her work at the new venture, which is operating out of her apartment under the name Holloway and Harris.\n\n==Personality==\nEmbodying the role of [[femme fatale]],<ref>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Ripley|title=See Mad Men Already|work=[[Daily Democrat]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|location=[[Woodland, California]]|date=July 25, 2008}}</ref> Holloway is a bold and sassy character.<ref>{{cite web | title=Where style matches substance | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/tv--radio/style-matching-substance/2009/04/15/1239474916154.html?page=2 | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]| location = Melbourne, Australia| accessdate=June 20, 2009|date=April 16, 2009|author=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Steve|last=Penner|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080822/LIFE/808220311 | title=Does Mad Men make you mad?|work=[[Portsmouth Herald]]|publisher=[[Local Media Group]]|location=Portsmouth, New Hampshire|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref> When creating the character, ''Mad Men''{{'}}s creator [[Matthew Weiner]] tried to make her appear not as a television stereotype, but as an unpredictable and complicated woman.<ref>{{cite news|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/08/mad-men-calvaca.html|| title=\"Mad Men\" calvacade of Stars, part 5: christina hendricks on joan holloway|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref> ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' has said that Holloway occupies \"a sort of middle ground between the show's main female characters, who represent opposing paths for women of their day\"; as [[Betty Draper]] ([[January Jones]]) gave up a modeling career to become a housewife and [[Peggy Olson]] ([[Elisabeth Moss]]) tries to become a copywriter in \"a world where men routinely call women 'girls', and sometimes literally chase them through the office\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Joanna|last=Weiss|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2008/09/21/what_the_women_of_mad_men_can_teach_us_about_sarah_palin/|title=What the women of 'Mad Men' can teach us about Sarah Palin|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=September 21, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHolloway is considered the [[Queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]] of the office secretarial pool, with a sharp sense of office politics and protocol.<ref>{{cite web |first=Alison|last=Prato|url=http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20081012/Some+It+Hot+Christina+Hendricks|title=Some Like it Hot: Christina Hendricks| work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corp.]]|location=New York City|date=October 12, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Rob|last=Salem| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Television/article/467599|title=Don't be mad, baby|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.|location=Toronto, Ontario |date=July 27, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref> While her conduct is generally professional, she is also apt to bully her subordinates in order to make her point.

Holloway Harris''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] on the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[Mad Men]]'' (2007\u201315). She is portrayed by [[Christina Hendricks]].\n\nHendricks has received six consecutive [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] and has won two [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] for her performance. She has also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]] twice along with the cast of ''Mad Men''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Background===\n\nJoan was born on February 24, 1931. From Season 1 through Season 3, Joan is the [[office manager]] at the advertising agency Sterling Cooper. Her primary responsibilities are to manage the secretarial, steno, and telephone operators pools; attend to the needs of the executives; and organize agency events. She is also seen during meetings with the heads of departments, implementing ''[[Roberts Rules of Order]]'', taking notes, and reminding the male staff of their duties to their clients, and assisting Creative Director [[Don Draper]] ([[Jon Hamm]]) and [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] [[Lane Pryce]] ([[Jared Harris]]) with SC financial duties. She also serves as the direct superior of secretary [[Peggy Olson]] ([[Elisabeth Moss]]). Joan and Peggy do not get along at first; Joan is contemptuous of Peggy's demure attitude and conservative dress, while Peggy is intimidated by Joan's beauty and assertiveness. Over the course of the series, however, the two become good friends, and support each other through their personal and professional struggles, with Joan being especially supportive of Peggy's evolution as a copywriter in the male-dominated culture of advertising.\n\nJoan had a lengthy romantic involvement with [[Roger Sterling]] ([[John Slattery]]), which ended after Roger's [[heart attack]]. After [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s death, Roger walks into his office to find Joan lying on his couch and crying. Realizing she is upset over the similarities she sees between the actress's life and her own, Roger comforts Joan by assuring her she will not end up alone and in despair like Monroe.\n\nSometime before the start of the series, Joan was briefly married to a man named Scotty. Though Scotty is never seen, she mentioned to a friend in the [[Mad Men (season 6)|season 6]] episode \"To Have and To Hold\" that her marriage to him was the \"worst six months of my life.\"\n\nJoan had also had an intimate relationship with copywriter [[Paul Kinsey]] ([[Michael Gladis]]) sometime before the series began; Joan ended the relationship because Paul had \"a big mouth\" (implying that he bragged about the relationship to others). Her roommate, Carol ([[Kate Norby]]), whom Joan knows from college, expresses romantic interest in Joan in the episode \"The Long Weekend\", although Joan gently rebuffs her advances.\n\nIn [[Mad Men (season 2)|Season 2]], Joan becomes engaged to Greg Harris ([[Samuel Page]]), a [[physician|doctor]] at St. Luke's Hospital. As the season goes on, Joan is clearly torn between wanting to be a well-off, married woman (the pinnacle of her ambition) and the fear that she will become a bored, lonely housewife. Her feelings are exacerbated when she is briefly given additional responsibilities at Sterling Cooper reading television scripts to determine ad placement, which thrills her. However, Media Director [[List of Mad Men characters#Harry Crane|Harry Crane]] ([[Rich Sommer]]) ultimately hires a young, unqualified man to take over the ad placement job, to her disappointment.\n\nIn \"[[The Mountain King (Mad Men)|The Mountain King]]\", Greg picks Joan up at Sterling Cooper for a dinner date. Greg meets Roger Sterling for the first time and immediately picks up that he knows her likes and dislikes. Joan attempts to dismiss his suspicions by claiming that Roger only knows her well because of how long she has been with the agency. Greg is unconvinced and then follows Joan as she goes into Don's office to lock up, forces her to the floor, and [[rape]]s her.\n\nIn the interim between Seasons 2 and 3, Joan and Greg have married. In Season 3's third episode, \"My Old Kentucky Home\", it is revealed that Greg is not the accomplished surgeon that Joan had hoped he would be. She leaves Sterling Cooper to become a housewife in [[Mad Men (season 3)|Season 3]], but is later seen by Accounts Executive [[Pete Campbell]] ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]) working at [[Bonwit Teller]] due to Greg's failure to receive a promotion. Joan mentions to Pete that Greg is considering going into psychiatry, in hopes of salvaging his career.\n\nJoan helps Greg prepare for a job interview, but he fails to get the job. The two have a heated argument, ending with Joan smashing a vase over Greg's head. Joan later places a call to Roger Sterling's office after hours, asking him to help her find another office manager job. Greg ultimately obtains an officer's commission in the Army where he will serve as a military surgeon, and tells Joan she will no longer have to work. Despite this, Joan comes to the aid of Don, Roger, Lane, and Bert Cooper ([[Robert Morse]]) to launch the new Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce by finding accounting materials and client records. When the new company sets up shop at [[The Pierre]] hotel, Joan takes the position of office manager.\n\n===At Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce (SCDP)===\nJoan is recognized by most (though not all) of the staff as being integral in SCDP's daily operations. A notable feature of Joan's new office is an intercom to the conference room that she can use to monitor meetings with; a feature conveniently forgotten by everyone except her and Peggy.\n\nIn [[Mad Men (season 4)|Season 4]], Joan and Greg are shown trying to conceive, but their marriage is strained by Greg's having to attend [[basic training]] and later being sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. In his absence, Joan and Roger briefly rekindle their affair, after being mugged one night while walking home from a friendly dinner. Their night of passion leaves Joan pregnant, so she and Roger decide to \"take care of it\". Joan makes an appointment at an [[abortion]] clinic but in the waiting room, she is mistaken for a mother waiting for her daughter to get an abortion. Joan realizes her time to conceive is running out, so she decides to pass Roger's baby off as Greg's. Also in season 4, Joan receives a title-only promotion to Director of Agency Operations, in recognition of her role in keeping SCDP afloat amid its recent financial troubles. Other season 4 developments include Joan's working relationship with Peggy, the only other high-ranking woman at SCDP.\n\nIn the [[A Little Kiss|Season 5 premiere]], Greg is still in Vietnam. Joan has given birth to a boy named Kevin and is finishing her maternity leave from SCDP.  She begins making plans to return to work, while her mother, Gail ([[Christine Estabrook]]), is staying with her to help with the baby.\n\nIn \"[[Mystery Date (Mad Men)|Mystery Date]]\", Greg returns home from Vietnam, but informs Joan he is being ordered to go back for an additional year. However, it is revealed that Greg actually reenlisted voluntarily since the army makes him feel purposeful, even though the war is becoming increasingly dangerous. Joan becomes enraged and throws him out. Joan tells him he has never been a good man, alluding to his rape. He threatens to divorce her if he leaves, but Joan simply tells him to leave.\n\nIn \"[[Christmas Waltz (Mad Men)|Christmas Waltz]]\", a process server shows up at the SCDP office to serve Joan with divorce papers, which upsets her. Joan yells at SCDP's receptionist, Meredith ([[Stephanie Drake]]), and storms off. Don offers to take her out for the day and the two test drive a Jaguar.  They spend the remainder of the afternoon drinking in a midtown bar, and she confesses to Don that she is unsure of how to start over with a baby.\n\nIn \"[[The Other Woman (Mad Men)|The Other Woman]]\", Joan is taken aback when the partners (minus Don, who dissents) present her with an offer to sleep with Herb Rennet ([[Gary Basaraba]]), in order to secure them the Jaguar account. She eventually agrees, thinking that all the partners agreed to the offer. At Lane's suggestion, she demands 5% of SCDP and a voting partnership, instead of the $50,000 lump sum she was initially offered (unbeknownst to her, Lane's suggestion that she turn down the lump sum was in part to cover up his embezzlement). As partner, Joan's overall role in day-to-day operations doesn't change much beyond the fact that she now votes in partners' meetings.\n\nDuring this time, Lane expresses romantic interest in Joan but she does not return it. In \"[[Commissions and Fees]]\", Joan discovers Lane's body after he commits suicide in his office. She later expresses confusion to Don, saying that if she had slept with him, he would not have died. Don assures her that she is worth more than her body, which she is grateful for. In the Season 5 finale, Joan appears to have taken over Lane's accounting duties and presides over the acquisition of new office space for the firm.\n\n===At Sterling Cooper & Partners (SC&P)===\nAt the start of Season 6, Joan has settled into her new role as partner at SCDP.  In \"To Have and To Hold\", Joan discovers that Harry Crane's secretary, Scarlet ([[Sadie Alexandru]]), has been having Dawn ([[Teyonah Parris]]), Don's secretary, punch out her time cards. Joan confronts them and fires Scarlet, angering Harry. He yells at the other partners for letting Joan do whatever she wants, clearly resenting being passed over for partner. He implies that Joan prostituted herself for her partnership, much to Joan's humiliation.\n\nIn the same episode, Joan is visited by a childhood friend, Kate ([[Marley Shelton]]), who now works for [[Mary Kay Cosmetics]]. Kate expresses her admiration for Joan, believing that Joan's partnership has more power than it actually has. This causes Joan to realize that she must stop acting like a secretary.  She transfers many of her office manager duties to Dawn in order to concentrate on her new role.\n\nIn \"For Immediate Release\", Joan is outraged when Don fires Jaguar after a tense meeting with Rennett.

Bob Benson ([[James Wolk]]), an eager new hire in accounts, walks in on Joan, who is in extreme pain.  He discreetly escorts her to the hospital and is also able to expedite her care. Joan is suspicious of Bob's motives for helping her, but her mother advises her that not every good deed is a front. In return, Joan quietly steps in to save Bob's job when he is about to be laid off.\n\nBy \"The Better Half\", Joan and Bob have become close friends, and are preparing to go to the beach together with Kevin.

However, she nearly blows it by excluding Pete from the proceedings and coming on aggressively at the meeting. Peggy is able to narrowly salvage the situation and the two women again reach an understanding.\n\nLater on, Joan easily sees the attraction between Peggy and CGC executive Ted Chaough ([[Kevin Rahm]]), but doesn't mention it to Don until they go over budget for a commercial. Joan is shocked when Don smooths the client's feathers by saying the expensive idea was that of the deceased Gleason.  This averts the client's anger but embarrasses Ted and takes credit away from Peggy in the process. Don\u2019s choice in dealing with the situation, in addition to his earlier impetuousness in firing Jaguar, makes her wary of Don. When Thanksgiving 1968 approaches, Joan agrees with Cooper, Sterling, and Senior Partner Jim Cutler ([[Harry Hamlin]]) that Don should be placed on leave, as she is concerned with Don's erratic behavior and its overall effect on the firm. Joan reveals that she has made arrangements for Creative to continue functioning, with Ted overseeing Peggy long-distance. Joan invites Roger to spend Thanksgiving with her. When Roger responds negatively to the presence of Bob, whom Joan had also invited, she warns him that she is allowing him into Kevin's life, but not hers.\n\nIn Season 7, Joan completely cedes her office-manager role to Dawn and takes a more active role as junior partner and account executive - handling Avon and Butler Footwear.  She proves to be capable, as well as a quick study.  Her personality has hardened considerably, and she seems more money-conscious, which is likely motivated by her status as single mother.  Initially, she bears a clear animus towards Don for having fired Jaguar, as it cost her a substantial amount of money when the public offering fell through. She casts a vote to fire Don for \"costing me money\" when he violates the terms of his return, though she later favors the sale to McCann-Erickson because it stands to provide her with more than $1 million. Joan also rejects a marriage proposal from Bob, who is [[gay]], on the grounds that both of them deserve real love and not an \"arrangement\" that is meant only to cope with Joan's financial difficulties and Bob's need to be in [[the closet]].\n\nDuring the second half of Season 7, Joan has gained confidence in her new position.  During a business trip to SCDP's West Coast office, she meets Richard ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), a wealthy and very charming real estate developer whom she begins dating (though he initially expresses regret over the fact that Joan has a small child). However, as her personal life begins to come together for the first time since her divorce from Greg, she suffers professionally when SCDP is absorbed into McCann. She takes issue with the lewd and sexist treatment that she receives from her male colleagues at the new agency and complains to Jim Hobart (H. Richard Greene), the Director at McCann.  Hobart responds first with condescension and then with contempt. When Joan threatens to take legal action and to reveal McCann's misogynistic culture to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Hobart offers to buy Joan's remaining contract out for half of what it's worth. Joan vows to stay at McCann and fight, but Roger convinces her that it would be more pragmatic to take the money and walk away.\n\nIn the series finale, \"Person to Person\", Joan starts her own film production company. She attempts to recruit Peggy as a partner, but Peggy chooses to stay at McCann.  Joan and Richard continue dating and become somewhat serious about one another, but he is opposed to her re-entering the business world.  When Joan announces she is starting her own company, he ends their relationship.  She is last seen watching her mother and Kevin go off to the park and then resuming her work at the new venture, which is operating out of her apartment under the name Holloway and Harris.\n\n==Personality==\nEmbodying the role of [[femme fatale]],<ref>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Ripley|title=See Mad Men Already|work=[[Daily Democrat]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|location=[[Woodland, California]]|date=July 25, 2008}}</ref> Holloway is a bold and sassy character.<ref>{{cite web | title=Where style matches substance | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/tv--radio/style-matching-substance/2009/04/15/1239474916154.html?page=2 | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]| location = Melbourne, Australia| accessdate=June 20, 2009|date=April 16, 2009|author=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Steve|last=Penner|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080822/LIFE/808220311 | title=Does Mad Men make you mad?|work=[[Portsmouth Herald]]|publisher=[[Local Media Group]]|location=Portsmouth, New Hampshire|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref> When creating the character, ''Mad Men''{{'}}s creator [[Matthew Weiner]] tried to make her appear not as a television stereotype, but as an unpredictable and complicated woman.<ref>{{cite news|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/08/mad-men-calvaca.html|| title=\"Mad Men\" calvacade of Stars, part 5: christina hendricks on joan holloway|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref> ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' has said that Holloway occupies \"a sort of middle ground between the show's main female characters, who represent opposing paths for women of their day\"; as [[Betty Draper]] ([[January Jones]]) gave up a modeling career to become a housewife and [[Peggy Olson]] ([[Elisabeth Moss]]) tries to become a copywriter in \"a world where men routinely call women 'girls', and sometimes literally chase them through the office\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Joanna|last=Weiss|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2008/09/21/what_the_women_of_mad_men_can_teach_us_about_sarah_palin/|title=What the women of 'Mad Men' can teach us about Sarah Palin|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=September 21, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHolloway is considered the [[Queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]] of the office secretarial pool, with a sharp sense of office politics and protocol.<ref>{{cite web |first=Alison|last=Prato|url=http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20081012/Some+It+Hot+Christina+Hendricks|title=Some Like it Hot: Christina Hendricks| work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corp.]]|location=New York City|date=October 12, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Rob|last=Salem| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Television/article/467599|title=Don't be mad, baby|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.|location=Toronto, Ontario |date=July 27, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref> While her conduct is generally professional, she is also apt to bully her subordinates in order to make her point.

On February 23, 1929, [[Maddux Air Lines]] began the airport's first scheduled passenger service with a route between San Francisco and El Paso stopping in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and several other cities however the service was short lived, ending by autumn 1929. [[Standard Air Lines]] had been serving Phoenix since late 1927 through a different airport and began landing at Sky Harbor on August 5, 1929. Standard operated a route between Los Angeles and El Paso stopping at Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas, Arizona. Standard was acquired by American Airways in 1930 which later became [[American Airlines]]. American extended the route eastward to New York by way of Dallas, Nashville, and many other cities making for a southern transcontinental route across the United States. In 1935 the city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] purchased Sky Harbor airport from Acme for $100,000.\n \n[[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] began service to [[San Francisco]] in 1938 and added Phoenix onto its transcontinental network by 1944 with flights to Los Angeles and eastward to New York stopping at Albuquerque, Kansas City, and many more cities. \n[[Arizona Airways]] began intrastate service within Arizona in 1946 and merged into [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]] in 1950 which added new routes to Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso. \n[[Bonanza Airlines]] began service by 1951 with a route to Las Vegas and Reno making several stops at smaller communities. New routes to Salt Lake City and southern California were added in the 1960's along with nonstop flights to Las Vegas and Reno aboard [[Douglas DC-9]] jets in 1965. Bonanza merged with two other carriers to become [[Air West]] in 1968 and was changed to [[Hughes Airwest]] in 1970 adding several new routes, including service to Mexico, creating a hub at Phoenix. Hughes Airwest was then merged into [[Republic Airlines (1979-1986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1980 which continued the Phoenix hub operation until the mid 1980's. \n[[Western Airlines]] came to Sky Harbor in 1957 with flights to Denver, Los Angeles and San Diego, [[Continental Airlines]] came in 1961 to El Paso, Los Angeles, and Tucson, and [[Delta Air Lines]] began flights to Dallas by 1969. <ref>{{cite web |title=1935 and The Farm \u2013 Sky Harbor's Early Years and Memories |url=http://skyharbor.com/about/earlyYears.html |website=Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport |date=August 30, 2010 |access-date=July 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627205926/http://skyharbor.com/about/earlyYears.html |archive-date=June 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Since airline deregulation in 1978, Phoenix has seen numerous new air carriers begin service including [[United Airlines]] in 1980 and [[Southwest Airlines]] in 1982.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] the airport began work on a new passenger terminal, as well as a new parallel runway and a diagonal runway.<ref name=\"tempe\">{{cite web |title=Phoenix Sky Harbor \u2013 City of Tempe History |url=http://www.tempe.gov/aircraftnoise/History.htm |work=[[Tempe, Arizona|City of Tempe]] |access-date=July 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914155141/http://www.tempe.gov/aircraftnoise/History.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> On the February 1953 C&GS diagram runways 8L and 8R are each {{convert|6000|ft}} long and runway 3 is {{convert|5500|ft}}.\n\nThe $835,000 Terminal 1 (originally called the \"West Wing\") which also had the first [[control tower]], opened in October 1952.<ref name=\"tempe\"/> It was torn down in 1991 and replaced by a [[cellphone lot|cell phone waiting lot]], with Terminal 1's parking lot now being the West Economy lot.\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 42 scheduled airline departures a day: 16 American, 11 TWA, 10 Bonanza, and 5 Frontier.

On February 23, 1929, [[Maddux Air Lines]] began the airport's first scheduled passenger service with a route between San Francisco and El Paso stopping in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and several other cities however the service was short lived, ending by autumn 1929. [[Standard Air Lines]] had been serving Phoenix since late 1927 through a different airport and began landing at Sky Harbor on August 5, 1929. Standard operated a route between Los Angeles and El Paso stopping at Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas, Arizona. Standard was acquired by American Airways in 1930 which later became [[American Airlines]]. American extended the route eastward to New York by way of Dallas, Nashville, and many other cities making for a southern transcontinental route across the United States.

Bonanza merged with two other carriers to become [[Air West]] in 1968 and was changed to [[Hughes Airwest]] in 1970 adding several new routes, including service to Mexico, creating a hub at Phoenix.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Canada lynxes shun open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]].

These chit companies provide employment to about 35,000 persons directly and an equal number indirectly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/chit-fund-cos-on-the-rise-in-kerala/513907/|title=Chit fund cos on the rise in Kerala|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=2010-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==How it works==\nA chit fund comprises a group of members, called subscribers. An organizer, a company or a trusted relative or neighbor, brings the group together and administers the activities of the group. For their efforts, the organizer is either compensated each month or at withdrawal time. (The fee may be omitted in informal situations.)\n\nThe fund starts at an announced date and continues for the number of months equal to the number of subscribers. Each month, the subscribers put in their monthly installments into the pot. Then, an open auction is conducted to determine the lowest sum a subscriber is willing to take that month. For example, if the monthly installment is \u20b91000 and there are 50 members, the pot in the first month will contain \u20b950,000. If the auction determines a winner who is willing to accept \u20b945,000 for that month, the surplus \u20b95,000 is distributed to the other 49 members, after subtracting fees paid to the organizer. The subscriber who won the auction was able to access \u20b945,000 in the first month and the others benefited in their share of the \u20b95,000 surplus. The process repeats, distributing the auction amount to one member each month. All of the other subscribers, including the ones who took their share in a previous month, continue paying the monthly installments.\n\nThe system acts as a borrowing scheme, because subscribers are able to access large sums of money before they've paid the full amount. It also acts as a savings system, because each subscriber contributes every month and may retrieve a large sum in the future while receiving their share of the surpluses. \n\nVariations of the system omit the auction part, instead drawing a winner by picking a chit out of a box. (The term ''chit fund'' comes from such an arrangement.)\n\n== Risk ==\nBoth organizers and subscribers in chit funds are exposed to credit risk because subscribers might default on their periodic payments.<ref name=\":0\" /> One analysis of data from two chit fund companies found that 35% of subscribers have defaulted at least once during their tenure at one of the companies and 24% of them have defaulted after winning an auction for the pot.<ref name=\":0\" /> Chit fund companies can sue defaulters in court but the procedure is time-consuming and is unlikely to produce a timely settlement.<ref name=\":0\" /> It's up to the chit fund organizers to vet the credit-worthiness of subscribers. To reduce the risk of default, some organizers also require subscribers who win auctions to submit sureties for their future liabilities.\n\nSince chit fund payments are not insured by the government, the system is a riskier method of saving than using a bank savings account.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legal framework==\nOrganised chit fund schemes are required to register with the Registrar of Firms, Societies and Chits. A ''chit fund company'' is a company that manages, conducts, or supervises such a chit fund, as defined in Section of the Chit Funds Act, 1982. According to Section 2(b) of the Chit Funds Act, 1982:\n\n:\"Chit means a transaction whether called chit, chit fund, chitty, kuree or by any other name by or under which a person enters into an agreement with a specified number of persons that every one of them shall subscribe a certain sum of money (or a certain quantity of grain instead) by way of periodical installments over a definite period and that each such subscriber shall, in his turn, as determined by lot or by auction or by tender or in such other manner as may be specified in the chit agreement, be entitled to the prize amount\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fiuindia.gov.in/relatedacts-chitfunds.htm|title=Chit Funds Act, 1982|publisher=Financial Intelligence Unit \u2013 India|accessdate=2010-02-15}}</ref>\n\nThough they are not required to be registered under the RBI Act, chit funds are regulated as Miscellaneous Non-Banking Companies (MNBCs).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sathyadevi|first=R|last2=Thomas|first2=Renju|date=July 2018|title=CHIT FUND AS AN INVESTMENT OPTION: A STUDY WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO KERALA STATE FINANCIAL ENTERPRISES LTD, MANNARKKAD|url=http://www.ijrar.com/upload_issue/ijrar_issue_1459.pdf|journal=International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews|volume=5|pages=1314-1317|via=}}</ref> Their activities relating to soliciting deposits are governed by the Non-Banking Financial Companies and Miscellaneous Non-Banking Companies (Advertisement) Rules (1977) framed by the Government of India under Section 58A of the Companies Act 1956.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe following laws govern chit funds:\n\n* Union Government - [[Chit Fund Act, 1982]] (except the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]])\n* [[Kerala]]: Kerala Chit Fund Rules 2012 & Amendment 2016\n* [[Tamil Nadu]]: Tamil Nadu Chit Funds Act, 1961\n* [[Karnataka]]: The Chit Funds (Karnataka) Rules, 1983\n* [[Andhra Pradesh]]: The Andhra Pradesh Chit Funds Act, 1971\n* [[New Delhi]]: The Chit Funds Act, 1982 and Delhi Chit Funds Rules, 2007\n* [[Maharashtra]]: Maharashtra Chit Fund Act 1975\n\n==Special purpose funds==\nSome chit funds are conducted as a savings scheme for a specific purpose. An example is the [[Deepavali]] sweets fund, which has a specific end date about a week before Deepavali.  Neighbourhood ladies pool their savings each week.  They use this fund to buy and prepare sweets in bulk just before the Deepavali festival, and they distribute sweets to all members.  Preparation of Deepavali sweets may be a time consuming and costly activity for individuals.  Such a chit reduces costs, and relieves members from extra work in a busy festival season. Nowadays, such special purpose chits are conducted by jewellery shops, kitchenware shops, etc. to promote their products.\n\n==Online chit funds==\nWith the advent of ecommerce in India, chit funds have also started going online. Online chit funds conduct auctions, and subscribers can pay their monthly dues and receive the prize amounts online through online transactions, including electronic fund transfers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rotating Savings and Credit Association]]\n* [[Saradha Group financial scandal]]\n* [[Peerless Group]]\n* [[Kitty Party]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*{{citation |last=Klonner |first=Stefan |title=Understanding Chit Funds: Price Determination and the Role of Auction Formats in Rotating Savings and Credit Associations |url=http://web.williams.edu/Economics/neudc/papers/klonner1.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/669fKQZQ1?url=http://web.williams.edu/Economics/neudc/papers/klonner1.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Williams College]] |date=October 2002 |accessdate=14 March 2012 |url-status=dead|ref=none }}.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chit Fund}}\n[[Category:Financial services in India]]\n[[Category:Informal finance]]\n[[Category:Informal economy in Asia]]\n[[Category:Microfinance]]\n[[Category:Collaborative finance]]\n[[Category:Contexts_for_auctions]]\n", "text_old": "A '''chit fund''' is a type of [[rotating savings and credit association]] system practiced in [[India]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Preethi|last2=Buteau|first2=Sharon|date=2018-05-04|title=Modelling credit and savings behaviour of chit fund participants|url=https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/2-26#toc8|journal=Gates Open Research|volume=2|pages=26|doi=10.12688/gatesopenres.12767.1|issn=2572-4754}}</ref> Chit fund schemes may be organized by financial institutions, or informally among friends, relatives, or neighbours.
