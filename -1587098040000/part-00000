William Milton Tryon and [[Robert Emmett Bledsoe Baylor|R.E.B. Baylor]] to establish a Baptist university in Texas, then an independent republic. Baylor, a Texas district [[judge]] and onetime [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] and soldier from [[Alabama]], became the school's namesake. Some at first wished to name the new university \"San Jacinto\" to recognize the victory which enabled the Texans to become an independent nation, then before the final vote of the Congress, the petitioners requested the university be named in honor of Judge R. E. B. Baylor.\n[[File:R.E.B. Baylor.jpg|left|thumb|241x241px|Judge R. E. B. Baylor]]\nIn the fall of 1844, the Texas Baptist Education Society petitioned the Congress of the [[Republic of Texas]] to charter a Baptist university. Republic President [[Anson Jones]] signed the Act of Congress on February 1, 1845, officially establishing Baylor University. The founders built the original university campus in [[Independence, Texas]]. Rev. James Huckins, the first Southern Baptist [[missionary]] to Texas, was Baylor's first full-time fundraiser. He is considered the third founding father of the university. Although these three men are credited as being the founders of the university, many others worked to see the first university established in Texas and thus they were awarded Baylor's Founders Medal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baylor.edu/about/index.php?id=48921 |title=Founders Day |publisher=Baylor University |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=April 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127124529/http://www.baylor.edu/about/index.php?id=48921 |archivedate=November 27, 2011 }}</ref> The noted Texas revolutionary war leader and hero [[Sam Houston]] gave the first $5,000 donation to start the university.

The tradition continues today and has been a part of the life of students for over 160 years. In 1849, R.E.B. Baylor and Abner S. Lipscomb of the Texas Supreme Court began teaching classes in the \"science of law,\" making Baylor the first in Texas and the second university west of the Mississippi to teach law. During this time Stephen Decatur Rowe would earn the first degree awarded by Baylor. He would be followed by the first female graduate, Mary Kavanaugh Gentry, in 1855.\n\nIn 1851, Baylor's second president [[Rufus Columbus Burleson]] decided to separate the students by sex, making the Baylor Female College an independent and separate institution. Baylor University became an all-male institution. During this time, Baylor thrived as the only university west of the Mississippi offering instruction in law, mathematics, and medicine. At the time a Baylor education cost around $8\u2013$15 per term for tuition. And many of the early leaders of the Republic of Texas, such as Sam Houston, would later send their children to Baylor to be educated. Some of those early students were [[Temple Lea Houston]], son of President [[Sam Houston]], a famous western gun-fighter and attorney; and [[Lawrence Sullivan \"Sul\" Ross]] famous Confederate General and later President of [[Texas A&M University]].\n\n[[File:Baylor University 1892 front.GIF|thumb|350px|In 1892, Baylor University had two main buildings, Old Main and Burleson Hall]]\n\nFor the first half of the [[American Civil War]], the Baylor president was [[George Washington Baines]], maternal great-grandfather of the future [[President of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. He worked vigorously to sustain the university during the Civil War, when male students left their studies to enlist in the [[Confederate Army]]. Following the war, the city of Independence slowly declined, primarily caused by the rise of neighboring cities being serviced by the [[Santa Fe Railroad]]. Because Independence lacked a railroad line, university fathers began searching for a location to build a new campus.\n\nBeginning in 1885, Baylor University moved to [[Waco, Texas]], a growing town on the railroad line. It merged with a local college called Waco University. At the time, Rufus Burleson, Baylor's second president, was serving as the local college's president. That same year, the Baylor Female College also was moved to a new location, [[Belton, Texas]]. It later became known as the [[University of Mary Hardin-Baylor]]. A Baylor College Park still exists in Independence in memory of the college's history there. Around 1887, Baylor University began readmitting women and became [[coeducational]] again.\n\nIn 1900, three [[physicians]] founded the University of Dallas Medical Department in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], although a university by that name did not exist. In 1903, Baylor University acquired the medical school, which became known as the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], while remaining in Dallas. In 1943, Dallas civic leaders offered to build larger facilities for the university in a new medical center if the College of Medicine would surrender its denominational alliances with the Baptist state convention. The Baylor administration refused the offer and, with funding from the [[The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center|M. D. Anderson Foundation]] and others, moved the College of Medicine to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. In 1969, the Baylor College of Medicine became technically independent from Baylor University. The two institutions still maintain strong links and Baylor still elects around 25 percent of the medical school's regents. They also share academic links and combine in research efforts.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Baylor was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College

[[John Riley Kane]] also received the Medal of Honor for his service after flying 43 combat missions for a total of 250 combat hours in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Kane's daring operations caused German intelligence reports to dub him \"Killer Kane.\"\n\nIn July 1948, the Air Force and Baylor University partnered in the creation of Air Force ROTC Detachment 810 - one of the first detachments ever created. In 2008, Detachment 810 was awarded the Air Force ROTC Right Of Line Award as the No. 1 large detachment in the nation. The unit was additionally awarded the High Flight Award, recognizing it as one of the top four detachments in America. It has been named best in the AFROTC Southwest Region for 1996, 2003 and 2008.\n\nBaylor runs several postgraduate and professional health sciences programs in partnership with the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] headquartered in [[San Antonio]].

William Milton Tryon and [[Robert Emmett Bledsoe Baylor|R.E.B. Baylor]] to establish a Baptist university in Texas, then an independent republic. Baylor, a Texas district [[judge]] and onetime [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] and soldier from [[Alabama]], became the school's namesake. Some at first wished to name the new university \"San Jacinto\" to recognize the victory which enabled the Texans to become an independent nation, then before the final vote of the Congress, the petitioners requested the university be named in honor of Judge R. E. B. Baylor.\n[[File:R.E.B. Baylor.jpg|left|thumb|241x241px|Judge R. E. B. Baylor]]\nIn the fall of 1844, the Texas Baptist Education Society petitioned the Congress of the [[Republic of Texas]] to charter a Baptist university. Republic President [[Anson Jones]] signed the Act of Congress on February 1, 1845, officially establishing Baylor University. The founders built the original university campus in [[Independence, Texas]]. Rev. James Huckins, the first Southern Baptist [[missionary]] to Texas, was Baylor's first full-time fundraiser. He is considered the third founding father of the university. Although these three men are credited as being the founders of the university, many others worked to see the first university established in Texas and thus they were awarded Baylor's Founders Medal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baylor.edu/about/index.php?id=48921 |title=Founders Day |publisher=Baylor University |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=April 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127124529/http://www.baylor.edu/about/index.php?id=48921 |archivedate=November 27, 2011 }}</ref> The noted Texas revolutionary war leader and hero [[Sam Houston]] gave the first $5,000 donation to start the university.

The tradition continues today and has been a part of the life of students for over 160 years. In 1849, R.E.B. Baylor and Abner S. Lipscomb of the Texas Supreme Court began teaching classes in the \"science of law,\" making Baylor the first in Texas and the second university west of the Mississippi to teach law. During this time Stephen Decatur Rowe would earn the first degree awarded by Baylor. He would be followed by the first female graduate, Mary Kavanaugh Gentry, in 1855.\n\nIn 1851, Baylor's second president [[Rufus Columbus Burleson]] decided to separate the students by sex, making the Baylor Female College an independent and separate institution. Baylor University became an all-male institution. During this time, Baylor thrived as the only university west of the Mississippi offering instruction in law, mathematics, and medicine. At the time a Baylor education cost around $8\u2013$15 per term for tuition. And many of the early leaders of the Republic of Texas, such as Sam Houston, would later send their children to Baylor to be educated. Some of those early students were [[Temple Lea Houston]], son of President [[Sam Houston]], a famous western gun-fighter and attorney; and [[Lawrence Sullivan \"Sul\" Ross]] famous Confederate General and later President of [[Texas A&M University]].\n\n[[File:Baylor University 1892 front.GIF|thumb|350px|In 1892, Baylor University had two main buildings, Old Main and Burleson Hall]]\n\nFor the first half of the [[American Civil War]], the Baylor president was [[George Washington Baines]], maternal great-grandfather of the future [[President of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. He worked vigorously to sustain the university during the Civil War, when male students left their studies to enlist in the [[Confederate Army]]. Following the war, the city of Independence slowly declined, primarily caused by the rise of neighboring cities being serviced by the [[Santa Fe Railroad]]. Because Independence lacked a railroad line, university fathers began searching for a location to build a new campus.\n\nBeginning in 1885, Baylor University moved to [[Waco, Texas]], a growing town on the railroad line. It merged with a local college called Waco University. At the time, Rufus Burleson, Baylor's second president, was serving as the local college's president. That same year, the Baylor Female College also was moved to a new location, [[Belton, Texas]]. It later became known as the [[University of Mary Hardin-Baylor]]. A Baylor College Park still exists in Independence in memory of the college's history there. Around 1887, Baylor University began readmitting women and became [[coeducational]] again.\n\nIn 1900, three [[physicians]] founded the University of Dallas Medical Department in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], although a university by that name did not exist. In 1903, Baylor University acquired the medical school, which became known as the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], while remaining in Dallas. In 1943, Dallas civic leaders offered to build larger facilities for the university in a new medical center if the College of Medicine would surrender its denominational alliances with the Baptist state convention. The Baylor administration refused the offer and, with funding from the [[The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center|M. D. Anderson Foundation]] and others, moved the College of Medicine to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. In 1969, the Baylor College of Medicine became technically independent from Baylor University. The two institutions still maintain strong links and Baylor still elects around 25 percent of the medical school's regents. They also share academic links and combine in research efforts.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Baylor was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"list-of-v-12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html |title=U.S.

[[John Riley Kane]] also received the Medal of Honor for his service after flying 43 combat missions for a total of 250 combat hours in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Kane's daring operations caused German intelligence reports to dub him \"Killer Kane.\"\n\nIn July 1948, the Air Force and Baylor University partnered in the creation of Air Force ROTC Detachment 810 - one of the first detachments ever created. In 2008, Detachment 810 was awarded the Air Force ROTC Right Of Line Award as the No. 1 large detachment in the nation. The unit was additionally awarded the High Flight Award, recognizing it as one of the top four detachments in America. It has been named best in the AFROTC Southwest Region for 1996, 2003 and 2008.\n\nBaylor runs several postgraduate and professional health sciences programs in partnership with the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] headquartered in [[San Antonio]].

It was established in 1854 as '''Salem Normal School'''. {{As of|2013}}, Salem State enrolled 7,664 undergraduate and 1,637 graduate, full- and part-time students, from 27 states and 57 foreign countries. The university offers [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree]]s in the arts and sciences, [[Master of Business Administration]], and Post Masters Certificates in more than 40 academic disciplines. In addition, the university also offers [[continuing education]] courses for credit and non-credit.\n\n==History==\nSalem State University was founded in 1854 as the Salem Normal School under the guidance of [[Horace Mann]]. The Salem Normal School is the fourth [[normal school]] to open in Massachusetts, and only the tenth to open in the United States. Initially, the school was a 2-year, post-secondary educational institution reserved for women. In 1898, the school became co-educational by enrolling its first group of male students that September.\n\nIn 1896 the school relocated to its current location in South Salem (to the building known today as the Sullivan Building). A few years later the Horace Mann Laboratory School was opened. With the construction of a more formal campus, the school was able to lengthen its curriculum to a 4-year study program in 1921. The first bachelor's degree program was in commercial education. In 1932, the school was renamed Salem Teachers College.\n\nIn 1960, the school was renamed State Teachers' College at Salem, and shortly thereafter in 1968 the school was renamed to Salem State College. Salem State's physical campus, restricted to North Campus at the time, developed quite rapidly during the 1960s under the leadership of President Frederick Meier. Peabody and Bowditch Halls were built on North Campus in 1965. Bowditch hall reflected the trends of multiple-story building construction during the first half of the [[Cold War]], with a [[fallout shelter]] being built under the building with a capacity of 985 people. Meier Hall was also constructed in 1965, and the Ellison Campus Center shortly thereafter in 1966. Throughout the 1970s, the school continued to expand its physical campus by constructing a new library, the O\u2019Keefe Athletic Center, and by purchasing the land for what is today known as South Campus.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the college moved forward with purchasing a 37.5-acre industrial site on Loring Avenue. The site was formerly home to a lightbulb plant owned by the [[GTE|General Telephone & Electronics Corporation]], formerly [[Sylvania Electric Products]]. When GTE decided to exit the electrical equipment market, they sold off their former factory to Salem State. That site, is today known as Central Campus. It houses the Bertolon School of Business and three residence complexes: Viking Hall, Marsh Hall and Atlantic Hall.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]] signed into law a bill that changed the name of institution to Salem State University. The name change became official on October 26, 2010.\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:Salem State University.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Sullivan Building at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue.]]\nSalem State University is divided into six unique campuses totaling a land-mass of 115 acres with approximately thirty-three buildings.<ref name=ff/> The main campus (North Campus) is located about a mile south of downtown Salem at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue. Within short walking distance from north campus is central campus, south campus, the School of Social Work, and the Richard O'Keefe Athletic Center. The university also operates a maritime facility at Cat Cove on the Salem harbor; located a mile north of the main campus.\n\n'''North Campus'''\n[[File:Walkway in Front of Bowditch Hall, Salem State University.jpg|thumb|right|Walkway in front of Bowditch Hall in springtime.]]\nNorth campus is the largest of the five campuses. The majority of the university's arts and science programs are housed within the two academic buildings on north campus; the Edward Sullivan Building and Frederick Meier Hall. A focal point of North campus is the George H. Ellison Campus Center which houses the career and counseling centers as well as a number of student organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/3531.php|title=Campus Center|accessdate=2010-01-10}}</ref> Freshman resident students are housed on north campus in two identical residence halls, Peabody and [[Nathaniel Bowditch|Bowditch]]. Other facilities on North campus include the [[Frederick Berry|Frederick E. Berry]] Library & Learning Commons, North Dining Commons and Sophia Gordon Performing Arts Center. The [[Horace Mann]] Laboratory School stood on North Campus until 2018, when it was moved to the site of the former Nathaniel Bowditch Elementary School in Salem.\n\n'''Central Campus'''\n[[File:Salem State Central Campus Looking Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|Central Campus Looking Northwest from Marsh Hall.]]\nCentral campus is the second largest of the five campuses. The Bertolon School of Business, the music department, and the communications department are all housed in the one academic building on central campus, the Classroom Building. Three residence halls, Marsh, Viking and Atlantic house residents, with all residents having a choice of where they want to live. A focal point of central campus is the university's Enterprise Center (small business center). Other facilities on central campus include the campus bookstore, admissions center, campus police station, recital hall, and the university's baseball field and tennis courts.\n\n'''South Campus'''\n[[File:Alumni Hall, Salem State University.jpg|thumb|left|Alumni Hall on Upper South Campus.]]\nSouth campus houses the university's College of Health and Human Services. The School of Nursing and the criminal justice department are housed in the two academic buildings on south campus; the [[Kevin B. Harrington]] Building and the Academic Building. Junior and senior resident students are housed on south campus in the Bates Residence Complex. Other facilities on south campus included the Alumni House and the Center for International Education.\n\n'''School of Social Work'''\n\nThe Salem State School of Social Work is located at 297 Lafayette St., just a short walk from North Campus. It is a former synagogue purchased by the University in 2014, and houses many of the classes for the School of Social Work.\n\n'''Richard O'Keefe Athletic Center'''\n\nThe O'Keefe Center houses the Sport and Movement Science department and the university's athletic department. Facilities include Twohig Gymnasium, Rockett Ice Arena, Alumni Field, the Gassett Fitness Center, and the swimming pool.\n\n'''Cat Cove Maritime Facility'''\n\nSalem State operates a maritime facility at Cat Cove on the Salem harbor. The facility is used to provide interactive, hands-on educational experience for students majoring in marine biology. In the past, Cat Cove has been used to study local shellfish.\n\n==Athletics==\nSalem State University athletic teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The Vikings are a member of the [[Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference]] (MASCAC).\n\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n'''Men's Athletics'''\n* Baseball \n* Basketball \n* Cross Country\n* Golf \n* Ice Hockey \n* Lacrosse \n* Soccer \n* Tennis\n\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n'''Women's Athletics'''\n* Basketball \n* Cross Country\n* Dance\n* Field Hockey \n* Ice Hockey \n* Lacrosse\n* Soccer \n* Softball \n* Tennis\n* Volleyball\n{{col-end|width 50%}}\n\n==Student life==\nThere are more than seventy student organizations on campus, which are divided into categories: academic affiliated groups, interest groups, performance groups, programming oriented groups, religiously affiliated groups, social and cultural groups, student governing groups, and student media groups. Student organizations are financially supported through a mandatory student fee of $30.00 per semester overseen by the Student Government Association. Undergraduate students are elected to the Student Government Association for one-year terms through an election process during the spring semester. The majority of student organizations are housed in the George H. Ellison Campus Center on North campus.\n\n==Operations==\nThe university is led by an eleven-member board of trustees. The governor appoints nine trustees to five-year terms, renewable once. The Alumni Association elects one trustee for a single five-year term and the student body elects one student trustee for a one-year term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/about/trustees.php|title=Board of Trustees|accessdate=2010-01-10}}</ref> In 2017, the university's trustees selected [[John D.

He began in this position in August 2017, with a formal inauguration in January 2018.<ref>John Laidler, Keenan to be inaugurated as Salem State president, The Boston Globe, January 11, 2018. https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2018/01/11/keenan-inaugurated-salem-state-president/8eFk3MSSNzEQzSVVn3ahXK/story.html</ref>\n\nThe university's annual operating budget for fiscal year 2010 was approximately $130 million; 40% of this coming from state appropriations. The Salem State University Foundation's endowment market value is in excess of $16 million at the end of fiscal year 2010.<ref name=ff>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/about/4349.php|title=Facts & Figures|accessdate=2010-01-10}}</ref> The university has an important economic impact on the city of Salem, being its second largest employer.  The college generated more than $376 million in economic spending in Massachusetts in fiscal year 2006. Salem State University creates jobs for 3,459 Massachusetts residents, including 593 in Salem and 1,978 throughout Essex County.<ref name=ff/>\n\n==Speaker series==\nThe Salem State University Speaker Series was established in 1982 as one of the first high-profile speaker series in the country. Former President of the United States, [[Gerald Ford]] was invited to speak at the university as the series' first guest.<ref>UPI Archives Nov. 5, 1982 https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/05/Former-President-Gerald-R-Ford-told-a-crowd-at/4323405320400/</ref> Since the conception of the Speaker Series, the university has hosted renowned leaders, activists and celebrities to share their stories with Salem residents and the surrounding North Shore community. Past speakers have included former Presidents of the United States, [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George H.W. Bush]]; Congressman [[John F. Tierney]]; television host and comedian, [[Jay Leno]]; head coach of the [[New England Patriots]], [[Bill Belichick]]; quarterback of the [[New England Patriots]], [[Tom Brady]]; baseball legend, [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]; award-winning actor and director, [[Robert Redford]]; and poet, [[Maya Angelou]].\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Salem State University Student Shuttle Vans, 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Student Shuttle Vans parked behind the Stanley Building, November 2018.]]\nSalem State is directly served by the 455 [[MBTA]] bus route, as well as other bus connections and [[commuter rail]] service available at [[Salem station|Salem Station]]. The Salem Ferry also runs from downtown Salem to Boston daily, year round.\n\nThere are two on-campus shuttle services providing transportation between campuses for Salem State students.

It was established in 1854 as '''Salem Normal School'''. {{As of|2013}}, Salem State enrolled 7,664 undergraduate and 1,637 graduate, full- and part-time students, from 27 states and 57 foreign countries. The university offers [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] and [[Masters Degree]]s in the Arts and Sciences, [[Masters of Business Administration]], and Post Masters Certificates in more than 40 academic disciplines. In addition, the university also offers [[Continuing Education]] courses for credit and non-credit.\n\n==History==\nSalem State University was founded in 1854 as the Salem Normal School under the guidance of [[Horace Mann]]. The Salem Normal School is the fourth [[normal school]] to open in Massachusetts, and only the tenth to open in the United States. Initially, the school was a 2-year, post-secondary educational institution reserved for women. In 1898, the school became co-educational by enrolling its first group of male students that September.\n\nIn 1896 the school relocated to its current location in South Salem (to the building known today as the Sullivan Building). A few years later the Horace Mann Laboratory School was opened. With the construction of a more formal campus, the school was able to lengthen its curriculum to a 4-year study program in 1921. The first bachelor's degree program was in commercial education. In 1932, the school was renamed Salem Teachers College.\n\nIn 1960, the school was renamed State Teachers' College at Salem, and shortly thereafter in 1968 the school was renamed to Salem State College. Salem State's physical campus, restricted to North Campus at the time, developed quite rapidly during the 1960s under the leadership of President Frederick Meier. Peabody and Bowditch Halls were built on North Campus in 1965. Bowditch hall reflected the trends of multiple-story building construction during the first half of the [[Cold War]], with a [[fallout shelter]] being built under the building with a capacity of 985 people. Meier Hall was also constructed in 1965, and the Ellison Campus Center shortly thereafter in 1966. Throughout the 1970s, the school continued to expand its physical campus by constructing a new library, the O\u2019Keefe Athletic Center, and by purchasing the land for what is today known as South Campus.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the college moved forward with purchasing a 37.5-acre industrial site on Loring Avenue. The site was formerly home to a lightbulb plant owned by the [[GTE|General Telephone & Electronics Corporation]], formerly [[Sylvania Electric Products]]. When GTE decided to exit the electrical equipment market, they sold off their former factory to Salem State. That site, is today known as Central Campus. It houses the Bertolon School of Business and three residence complexes: Viking Hall, Marsh Hall and Atlantic Hall.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]] signed into law a bill that changed the name of institution to Salem State University. The name change became official on October 26, 2010.\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:Salem State University.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Sullivan Building at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue.]]\nSalem State University is divided into six unique campuses totaling a land-mass of 115 acres with approximately thirty-three buildings.<ref name=ff/> The main campus (North Campus) is located about a mile south of downtown Salem at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue. Within short walking distance from north campus is central campus, south campus, the School of Social Work, and the Richard O'Keefe Athletic Center. The university also operates a maritime facility at Cat Cove on the Salem harbor; located a mile north of the main campus.\n\n'''North Campus'''\n[[File:Walkway in Front of Bowditch Hall, Salem State University.jpg|thumb|right|Walkway in front of Bowditch Hall in springtime.]]\nNorth campus is the largest of the five campuses. The majority of the university's arts and science programs are housed within the two academic buildings on north campus; the Edward Sullivan Building and Frederick Meier Hall. A focal point of North campus is the George H. Ellison Campus Center which houses the career and counseling centers as well as a number of student organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/3531.php|title=Campus Center|accessdate=2010-01-10}}</ref> Freshman resident students are housed on north campus in two identical residence halls, Peabody and [[Nathaniel Bowditch|Bowditch]]. Other facilities on North campus include the [[Frederick Berry|Frederick E. Berry]] Library & Learning Commons, North Dining Commons and Sophia Gordon Performing Arts Center. The [[Horace Mann]] Laboratory School stood on North Campus until 2018, when it was moved to the site of the former Nathaniel Bowditch Elementary School in Salem.\n\n'''Central Campus'''\n[[File:Salem State Central Campus Looking Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|Central Campus Looking Northwest from Marsh Hall.]]\nCentral campus is the second largest of the five campuses. The Bertolon School of Business, the music department, and the communications department are all housed in the one academic building on central campus, the Classroom Building. Three residence halls, Marsh, Viking and Atlantic house residents, with all residents having a choice of where they want to live. A focal point of central campus is the university's Enterprise Center (small business center). Other facilities on central campus include the campus bookstore, admissions center, campus police station, recital hall, and the university's baseball field and tennis courts.\n\n'''South Campus'''\n[[File:Alumni Hall, Salem State University.jpg|thumb|left|Alumni Hall on Upper South Campus.]]\nSouth campus houses the university's College of Health and Human Services. The School of Nursing and the criminal justice department are housed in the two academic buildings on south campus; the [[Kevin B. Harrington]] Building and the Academic Building. Junior and senior resident students are housed on south campus in the Bates Residence Complex. Other facilities on south campus included the Alumni House and the Center for International Education.\n\n'''School of Social Work'''\n\nThe Salem State School of Social Work is located at 297 Lafayette St., just a short walk from North Campus. It is a former synagogue purchased by the University in 2014, and houses many of the classes for the School of Social Work.\n\n'''Richard O'Keefe Athletic Center'''\n\nThe O'Keefe Center houses the Sport and Movement Science department and the university's athletic department. Facilities include Twohig Gymnasium, Rockett Ice Arena, Alumni Field, the Gassett Fitness Center, and the swimming pool.\n\n'''Cat Cove Maritime Facility'''\n\nSalem State operates a maritime facility at Cat Cove on the Salem harbor. The facility is used to provide interactive, hands-on educational experience for students majoring in marine biology. In the past, Cat Cove has been used to study local shellfish.\n\n==Athletics==\nSalem State University athletic teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The Vikings are a member of the [[Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference]] (MASCAC).\n\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n'''Men's Athletics'''\n* Baseball \n* Basketball \n* Cross Country\n* Golf \n* Ice Hockey \n* Lacrosse \n* Soccer \n* Tennis\n\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n'''Women's Athletics'''\n* Basketball \n* Cross Country\n* Dance\n* Field Hockey \n* Ice Hockey \n* Lacrosse\n* Soccer \n* Softball \n* Tennis\n* Volleyball\n{{col-end|width 50%}}\n\n==Student life==\nThere are more than seventy student organizations on campus, which are divided into categories: academic affiliated groups, interest groups, performance groups, programming oriented groups, religiously affiliated groups, social and cultural groups, student governing groups, and student media groups. Student organizations are financially supported through a mandatory student fee of $30.00 per semester overseen by the Student Government Association. Undergraduate students are elected to the Student Government Association for one-year terms through an election process during the spring semester. The majority of student organizations are housed in the George H. Ellison Campus Center on North campus.\n\n==Operations==\nThe university is led by an eleven-member board of trustees. The governor appoints nine trustees to five-year terms, renewable once. The Alumni Association elects one trustee for a single five-year term and the student body elects one student trustee for a one-year term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/about/trustees.php|title=Board of Trustees|accessdate=2010-01-10}}</ref> In 2017, the university's trustees selected [[John D. Keenan]] as the 14th president of the university. He began in this position in August 2017, with a formal inauguration in January 2018.<ref>John Laidler, Keenan to be inaugurated as Salem State president, The Boston Globe, January 11, 2018. https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2018/01/11/keenan-inaugurated-salem-state-president/8eFk3MSSNzEQzSVVn3ahXK/story.html</ref>\n\nThe university's annual operating budget for fiscal year 2010 was approximately $130 million; 40% of this coming from state appropriations. The Salem State University Foundation's endowment market value is in excess of $16 million at the end of fiscal year 2010.<ref name=ff>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/about/4349.php|title=Facts & Figures|accessdate=2010-01-10}}</ref> The university has an important economic impact on the city of Salem, being its second largest employer.  The college generated more than $376 million in economic spending in Massachusetts in fiscal year 2006. Salem State University creates jobs for 3,459 Massachusetts residents, including 593 in Salem and 1,978 throughout Essex County.<ref name=ff/>\n\n==Speaker series==\nThe Salem State University Speaker Series was established in 1982 as one of the first high-profile speaker series in the country. Former President of the United States, [[Gerald Ford]] was invited to speak at the university as the series' first guest.<ref>UPI Archives Nov. 5, 1982 https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/05/Former-President-Gerald-R-Ford-told-a-crowd-at/4323405320400/</ref> Since the conception of the Speaker Series, the university has hosted renowned leaders, activists and celebrities to share their stories with Salem residents and the surrounding North Shore community. Past speakers have included former Presidents of the United States, [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George H.W. Bush]]; Congressman [[John F. Tierney]]; television host and comedian, [[Jay Leno]]; head coach of the [[New England Patriots]], [[Bill Belichick]]; quarterback of the [[New England Patriots]], [[Tom Brady]]; baseball legend, [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]; award-winning actor and director, [[Robert Redford]]; and poet, [[Maya Angelou]].\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Salem State University Student Shuttle Vans, 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Student Shuttle Vans parked behind the Stanley Building, November 2018.]]\nSalem State is directly served by the 455 [[MBTA]] bus route, as well as other bus connections and [[commuter rail]] service available at [[Salem station|Salem Station]]. The Salem Ferry also runs from downtown Salem to Boston daily, year round.\n\nThere are two on-campus shuttle services providing transportation between campuses for Salem State students. The Viking Shuttle, or Cavalier Shuttle as it is sometimes called by students, provides daily scheduled bus service Monday-Friday between North, Central and South Campuses from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM and is a contract service operated by Cavalier Coach Trailways. The Student Shuttle, which is operated by the University Police Department, provides nightly service between North, Central and South Campus and the O'keefe Center, Downtown Salem, Vinnin Square Shopping Center in [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]], the [[Liberty Tree Mall|Liberty Tree]] and North Shore Malls in [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]] and [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], and to [[Market Basket (New England)|Market Basket]] on Highland Avenue on Mondays.

In the U.S. and Canada, the term ''bowling'' usually refers to [[ten-pin bowling]]; in the U.K. and Commonwealth Countries, however, the term bowling could also refer to [[lawn bowls]].\n\nIn pin bowling, the goal is to knock over [[Bowling pin|pins]] at the end of a lane, with either two or three balls per frame allowed to knock down all pins. A [[strike (bowling)|strike]] is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll.\n\nLanes have a wood or synthetic surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in different specified oil patterns that vary ball path trajectories and characteristics. Common types of pin bowling include [[ten-pin bowling|ten-pin]], [[candlepin]], [[duckpin bowling|duckpin]], [[nine-pin bowling|nine-pin]], [[five-pin bowling|five-pin]] and [[Kegel (bowling)|kegel]]. The historical game [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]] is the forerunner of modern pin bowling.\n\nIn target bowling, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a [[Glossary of bowls terms#Mark|mark]] as possible.

Ten-pin balls are large, up to {{convert|27|in|cm}} in circumference and approximately {{convert|8.59|in|cm}} in diameter, and have as many as twelve holes, typically three holes. The balls come in various weights from {{convert|6|to|16|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, with the size and spacing of the finger holes often smaller on lighter balls to accommodate smaller hands. Different kinds of balls are available for different styles of bowling. There are balls for hook shots and balls for bowling straight. The bowling balls meant for hook shots have different core shapes and different chemical covers. There are a few types of chemical covers that allow a bowling ball to hook more. One of these types of covers is a resin cover. This resin cover is designed to move and absorb the oil on the lane to create a path for the bowler where there is less oil, increasing the amount of hook of the bowling ball. Balls for other games vary, e.g., candlepin balls which fit in the palm of the hand need no holes. Unlike most sports, the ball can be different weights based upon the player.\n\n===Pins===\n[[File:20190406 Ten-pin bowling - pin manufacturing stages.jpg|thumb|Ten-pin bowling pins shown at different stages of manufacture.]]\n{{main|Bowling pin}}\nBowling pins are the target of the bowling ball in [[Bowling#Pin bowling|pin bowling variations]]. The size and shape of pins vary but are generally cylindrical and widens where the ball strikes the pin. Ten-pin bowling pins are the largest and heaviest, weighing {{convert|3|lb|6|oz|kg|abbr=on}}. Duckpins are shorter and squatter than standard tenpins and candlepins are the tallest at {{convert|15+3/4|in|cm|abbr=on}}, but only {{convert|2+15/16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|2|lb|8|oz|kg|abbr=on}} in weight.\n\nBowling pins are constructed by gluing blocks of rock [[maple]] wood into the approximate shape, and then turning on a [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]. After the lathe shapes the pin, it is coated with a [[plastic]] material, painted, and covered with a glossy finish. Because of the scarcity of suitable wood, bowling pins can be made from approved synthetics. Currently there are synthetic pins sanctioned for play in five-pin, duckpin, and candlepin. There is one synthetic ten pin model approved by the USBC. When hit by the ball, synthetic pins usually sound different from wooden pins.\n\n===Shoes===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Bowling shoes]] -->\n[[File:2013-365-322 A Bit Much Follow Through (10940028683).jpg|thumb|A pair of rental bowling shoes.]]\nBowling shoes are designed to mimic any style of flat shoe from regular dress shoes to athletic shoes. The sole of the non sliding foot is generally made of rubber to provide traction, while the sliding foot's sole is made of a smooth and flat material that allows a bowler to slide into the release with a rubber heel to allow for braking. Rental shoes are typically leather and rubber on both feet for durability. These shoes can be bought, but most casual players rent the shoes when visiting a facility. Players must be very careful while wearing them that the soft material does not get wet or excessively dirty; if it does get wet or dirty, it will not slide properly, and could damage the approach surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shoes.about.com/od/athleticshoes/bb/bybbowling.htm|title=Using bowling shoes|work=about.com|accessdate=2010-02-15}}</ref>\n \t\nDepending on the bowling center, shoe rental may be included in the cost of bowling or be added as a separate fee.

In the U.S. and Canada, the term ''bowling'' usually refers to [[ten-pin bowling]]; in the U.K. and Commonwealth Countries, however, the term bowling could also refer to [[lawn bowls]].\n\nIn pin bowling, the goal is to knock over [[Bowling pin|pins]] at the end of a lane, with either two or three balls per frame allowed to knock down all pins. A [[strike (bowling)|strike]] is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll.\n\nLanes have a wood or synthetic surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in different specified oil patterns that vary ball path trajectories and characteristics. Common types of pin bowling include [[ten-pin bowling|ten-pin]], [[candlepin]], [[duckpin bowling|duckpin]], [[nine-pin bowling|nine-pin]], [[five-pin bowling|five-pin]] and [[Kegel (bowling)|kegel]]. The historical game [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]] is the forerunner of modern pin bowling.\n\nIn target bowling, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a [[Glossary of bowls terms#Mark|mark]] as possible.  The surface in target bowling may be grass, gravel, or synthetic.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crystal-Mark |title=Laws of the Sport of Bowls| year=2010 |publisher=World Bowls Ltd |ref=harv |page=9}}</ref>  [[Lawn bowls]], [[bocce]], [[Carpet Bowls|carpet bowls]], [[p\u00e9tanque]], and [[boules]] may have both indoor and outdoor varieties.\n\nBowling is played by 100 million people in more than 90 countries (including 70 million in the United States alone),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfmba.com/tidbits.htm|title=Niagara Falls Bowling Association|accessdate=24 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102134931/http://nfmba.com/tidbits.htm|archivedate=2 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and is the subject of many video games.\n\n==Variations==\nBowling games can be distinguished into two general classes, pin bowling and target bowling.\n\n===Pin bowling===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 600\n\n| image1    = 20190107 Bowling balls and pins.png\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = \n| caption1  = Relative sizes of bowling balls and pins for three popular variations of the game. <br /><small>Scale: the horizontal blue lines are {{convert|1|in|cm|spell=in|1}} apart vertically.</small>\n\n| image2    = 20190525 Candlepin ball and pins on lane.png\n| alt2      = \n| width2    = \n| caption2  = Candlepin balls are the smallest of the three, but candlepins are tallest and thinnest\n\n| image3    = 20190510 Duckpin ball and pins on lane.png\n| alt3      = \n| width3    = \n| caption3  = Duckpins are the shortest, and duckpin balls are barely larger than candlepin balls\n\n| image4    = 20181230 Bowling ball at board 17.5 with pins.png\n| alt4      = \n| width4    = \n| caption4  = Ten-pin balls and pins are the heaviest.\n}}\nFive main variations are found in [[North America]], with ten-pin being the most common but others being practiced in the eastern U.S. and in parts of [[Canada]]:<ref name=DailyAdvance_20180918>{{cite news |last1=Hawkins |first1=Mike (bowling columnist) |title=The sport of bowling \u2014 more than 10 pins and two rolls |url=http://www.dailyadvance.com/Sports/2018/09/18/The-sport-of-bowling-more-than-10-pins-and-two-rolls.html |work=The Daily Advance |date=September 18, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508224155/http://www.dailyadvance.com/Sports/2018/09/18/The-sport-of-bowling-more-than-10-pins-and-two-rolls.html |archivedate=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Ten-pin bowling]]: largest and heaviest pins, and bowled with a large ball with three finger holes, and the most popular type in North America\n* [[Nine-pin bowling]]: pins usually attached to strings at the tops, uses a ball without finger holes.\n* [[Candlepin bowling]]: tallest pins (at {{convert|40|cm|in|disp=or|abbr=on}}), thin with matching ends, bowled with the smallest and lightest (at {{convert|1.1|kg|lb|disp=or|abbr=on}}) handheld ball of any bowling sport, and the only form with ''no'' fallen pins removed during a frame.\n* [[Duckpin bowling]]: short, squat, and bowled with a handheld ball.\n* [[Five-pin bowling]]: tall, between duckpins and candlepins in diameter with a rubber girdle, bowled with a handheld ball, mostly found in Canada.\n\n===Target bowling===\n\nAnother form of bowling is usually played outdoors on a lawn.

Ten-pin balls are large, up to {{convert|27|in|cm}} in circumference and approximately {{convert|8.59|in|cm}} in diameter, and have as many as twelve holes, typically three holes. The balls come in various weights from {{convert|6|to|16|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, with the size and spacing of the finger holes often smaller on lighter balls to accommodate smaller hands. Different kinds of balls are available for different styles of bowling. There are balls for hook shots and balls for bowling straight. The bowling balls meant for hook shots have different core shapes and different chemical covers. There are a few types of chemical covers that allow a bowling ball to hook more. One of these types of covers is a resin cover. This resin cover is designed to move and absorb the oil on the lane to create a path for the bowler where there is less oil, increasing the amount of hook of the bowling ball. Balls for other games vary, e.g., candlepin balls which fit in the palm of the hand need no holes. Unlike most sports, the ball can be different weights based upon the player.\n\n===Pins===\n[[File:20190406 Ten-pin bowling - pin manufacturing stages.jpg|thumb|Ten-pin bowling pins shown at different stages of manufacture.]]\n{{main|Bowling pin}}\nBowling pins are the target of the bowling ball in [[Bowling#Pin bowling|pin bowling variations]]. The size and shape of pins vary but are generally cylindrical and widens where the ball strikes the pin. Ten-pin bowling pins are the largest and heaviest, weighing {{convert|3|lb|6|oz|kg|abbr=on}}. Duckpins are shorter and squatter than standard tenpins and candlepins are the tallest at {{convert|15+3/4|in|cm|abbr=on}}, but only {{convert|2+15/16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|2|lb|8|oz|kg|abbr=on}} in weight.\n\nBowling pins are constructed by gluing blocks of rock [[maple]] wood into the approximate shape, and then turning on a [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]. After the lathe shapes the pin, it is coated with a [[plastic]] material, painted, and covered with a glossy finish. Because of the scarcity of suitable wood, bowling pins can be made from approved synthetics. Currently there are synthetic pins sanctioned for play in five-pin, duckpin, and candlepin. There is one synthetic ten pin model approved by the USBC. When hit by the ball, synthetic pins usually sound different from wooden pins.\n\n===Shoes===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Bowling shoes]] -->\n[[File:2013-365-322 A Bit Much Follow Through (10940028683).jpg|thumb|A pair of rental bowling shoes.]]\nBowling shoes are designed to mimic any style of flat shoe from regular dress shoes to athletic shoes. The sole of the non sliding foot is generally made of rubber to provide traction, while the sliding foot's sole is made of a smooth and flat material that allows a bowler to slide into the release with a rubber heel to allow for braking. Rental shoes are typically leather and rubber on both feet for durability. These shoes can be bought, but most casual players rent the shoes when visiting a facility. Players must be very careful while wearing them that the soft material does not get wet or excessively dirty; if it does get wet or dirty, it will not slide properly, and could damage the approach surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shoes.about.com/od/athleticshoes/bb/bybbowling.htm|title=Using bowling shoes|work=about.com|accessdate=2010-02-15}}</ref>\n \t\nDepending on the bowling center, shoe rental may be included in the cost of bowling or be added as a separate fee.

Countries and regions across Europe make their own traditional varieties of salami.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''salami'' in [[English language|English]] comes from the plural form of the [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|[[wikt:salame#Italian|salame]]}}<ref>{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|salami}}</ref> ({{IPA-it|sa\u02c8la\u02d0me|pron}}). It is a singular or plural word in English for cured meats of a European (particularly Italian) style. In Romanian, Bulgarian, and Turkish, the word is ''salam''; in Hungarian, it is ''szal\u00e1mi''; in Czech it is ''sal\u00e1m'' while Polish, French, German, and Dutch have the same word as English.

Minor differences in the formulation of the meat or production techniques give rise to the various kinds of salami across different countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Sausage production italy 02.ogv|thumb|Salami in casing]]\n\n=== Preparation ===\n\nBefore fermentation, raw meat (usually pork or beef depending on the type of salami that is produced) is ground  (usually coarsely) and mixed with other ingredients such as salt, sugar, spices and yeast,{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}} and,  if the particular salami variety requires it, lactic acid [[bacterial]] [[starter culture]].\n\n=== Fermentation ===\nThis mixture is then inserted into casings of the desired size. To achieve the flavor and texture that salami possesses, fermentation, which can also be referred to as a slow acidification process promoting a series of chemical reactions in the meat, has to take place.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Barbut|first1=S.|title=Color Development During Natural Fermentation and Chemical Acidification of Salami-type Products|journal=Journal of Muscle Food|date=June 2010|volume=21|issue=3|pages=499\u2013580|doi=10.1111/j.1745-4573.2009.00198.x}}</ref> Direct acidification of meat was found to be inappropriate for salami production, since it causes protein denaturation and an uneven coagulation, thereby causing an undesirable texture in the salami.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFor a more modern controlled fermentation, makers hang the salami in warm, humid conditions for 1\u20133 days to encourage the fermenting bacteria to grow, then hang it in a cool, humid environment to slowly dry. In a traditional process, the maker skips the fermentation step and immediately hangs the salami in a cool, humid curing environment. Added sugars (usually dextrose) provide a food source for the curing bacteria.\n\nThe bacteria produce [[lactic acid]] as a waste product, which lowers the pH and coagulates the proteins, reducing the meat's water-holding capacity. The bacteria-produced acid makes the meat an inhospitable environment for [[pathogenic]] bacteria and imparts a tangy flavor that distinguishes salami from machine-dried pork. Salami flavor relies as much on how these bacteria are cultivated as it does on the quality and variety of the other ingredients.  Originally, makers introduced wine into the mix, favouring the growth of other beneficial bacteria. Now, they use starter cultures.\n\nThe climate of the curing environment and casing size and style determine the drying and curing process. According to the particular variety of salami, different fermentation methods involving different acids have been explored  to create various colours and flavors.

In Romanian, Bulgarian, and Turkish, the word is ''salam''; in Hungarian, it is ''szal\u00e1mi''; in Czech it is ''sal\u00e1m'' while Polish, French, German, and Dutch have the same word as English.

Also, environmental conditions dictate what food processes are used, as seen in the [[Mediterranean area|Mediterranean]] and southern Europe, where \"meat products are dried to lower [[water activity]] (Aw) values, taking advantage of the long dry and sunny days, while in northern Europe, fermented sausages require smoking for further preservation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Fermented Meat and Poultry|last=Toldra|first=Fidel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-52265-3|location=Chichester, UK|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, the main countries that produce salami are France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Spain, which make several hundred million kilograms per year.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bertolini |first=Massimo |last2=Ferretti |first2=Gino |last3=Grassi |first3=Andrea |last4=Montanari |first4=Roberto |date=December 2006 |title=Seasoning Process Design Optimization for an Ascending Flow Ripening Chamber |journal=Journal of Food Engineering |volume=77 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.06.067 |pmid=|pages=529\u2013538}}</ref>\n\nWorldwide, the many different versions of sausage  each have their own cultural and flavor profiles.

''Salame cotto''\u2014typical of the [[Piedmont]] region in [[Italy]]\u2014is cooked or smoked before or after curing to impart a specific flavor, but not for any benefit of cooking. Before cooking, a ''cotto salame'' is considered raw and not ready to eat.\n\nThree major stages are involved in the production of salami: preparation of raw materials, fermentation, and ripening and drying. Minor differences in the formulation of the meat or production techniques give rise to the various kinds of salami across different countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Sausage production italy 02.ogv|thumb|Salami in casing]]\n\n=== Preparation ===\n\nBefore fermentation, raw meat (usually pork or beef depending on the type of salami that is produced) is ground  (usually coarsely) and mixed with other ingredients such as salt, sugar, spices and yeast,{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}} and,  if the particular salami variety requires it, lactic acid [[bacterial]] [[starter culture]].\n\n=== Fermentation ===\nThis mixture is then inserted into casings of the desired size. To achieve the flavor and texture that salami possesses, fermentation, which can also be referred to as a slow acidification process promoting a series of chemical reactions in the meat, has to take place.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Barbut|first1=S.|title=Color Development During Natural Fermentation and Chemical Acidification of Salami-type Products|journal=Journal of Muscle Food|date=June 2010|volume=21|issue=3|pages=499\u2013580|doi=10.1111/j.1745-4573.2009.00198.x}}</ref> Direct acidification of meat was found to be inappropriate for salami production, since it causes protein denaturation and an uneven coagulation, thereby causing an undesirable texture in the salami.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFor a more modern controlled fermentation, makers hang the salami in warm, humid conditions for 1\u20133 days to encourage the fermenting bacteria to grow, then hang it in a cool, humid environment to slowly dry. In a traditional process, the maker skips the fermentation step and immediately hangs the salami in a cool, humid curing environment. Added sugars (usually dextrose) provide a food source for the curing bacteria.\n\nThe bacteria produce [[lactic acid]] as a waste product, which lowers the pH and coagulates the proteins, reducing the meat's water-holding capacity. The bacteria-produced acid makes the meat an inhospitable environment for [[pathogenic]] bacteria and imparts a tangy flavor that distinguishes salami from machine-dried pork. Salami flavor relies as much on how these bacteria are cultivated as it does on the quality and variety of the other ingredients.  Originally, makers introduced wine into the mix, favouring the growth of other beneficial bacteria. Now, they use starter cultures.\n\nThe climate of the curing environment and casing size and style determine the drying and curing process. According to the particular variety of salami, different fermentation methods involving different acids have been explored  to create various colours and flavors.

Some fungi can create undesirable color and flavor in the contaminated meat and produce toxins. Some fungi that are not harmful to humans, such as those that are formed on the surface of dried salami, are an indication of maturation after ripening.<ref name=\":3\" /> Thus, producers have to eliminate fungi that have potential risks to human health. As natural preservatives are becoming more desirable food additives than artificial preservatives in food industries, some studies about salami have been focusing on the use of essential oils such as oregano and clove oil as preservatives that can be applied to salami production due to their anti-fungal activities.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last2=Ugalde|first2=Mariane Lobo|last3=Steffens|first3=Juliana|last4=Valduga|first4=Eunice|last5=Cansian|first5=Rog\u00e9rio Luis|last6=Toniazzo|first6=Geciane|date=Jan 2015|title=Control of Penicillium sp. on the Surface of Italian Salami Using Essential Oils|journal=Food Technology and Biotechnology|volume=53|issue=3|doi=10.17113/ftb.53.03.15.3877|last1=Cenci|first1=Aline Maria|pages=342\u2013347|pmid=27904367|pmc=5068374}}</ref> Several types of oils including [[rosemary]], clove, [[oregano]] and sage oils were found to have different levels of inhibition effect to various types of fungi that could possibly grow on salami.<ref name=\":2\" /> Since several of these oils contain volatile compounds whose amount can affect the flavor of the food, researchers often perform a sensory test to find the amount of the oil that can best serve as an anti-fungal preservative but have the least effect on the flavor or appearance of the salami.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Salame italiano.jpg|''[[Ferrara]]'' pressed salami\nFile:Finocchiona from Tuscany.JPG|''Finocchiona'', [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] salami sausage with fennel\nFile:Skilandis2.jpg|''[[Skilandis]]'', a Lithuanian sausage\nFile:Salame di Felino.jpg|''[[Felino]]'' salami\nFile:Dominican Salami.jpg|Dominican salami\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Food}}{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bologna sausage]]\n* [[Charcuterie]] (''[[Salumi]]'' in Italian; this term refers to prepared meat products generally.

Haas]] of the Diocese of Grand Rapids searched for land to establish a new church in Indian River for parishioners who were traveling great distances to attend Mass. Mr. James J. Harrington, a resident of [[Tuscarora Township, Michigan#Communities|Burt Lake]], offered to help locate land for the new church which would put in place the first residential priest of [[Cheboygan County, Michigan|Cheboygan County]]. He came across the undeveloped [[Burt Lake State Park]] property and sought to acquire the land, but the [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources|Michigan Department of Conservation]] denied his request.\n\nIn June 1946, Father Charles D. Brophy became the administrator of the future church and wanted to name the church after Blessed [[Kateri Tekakwitha]], a seventeenth century Mohawk Indian who enjoyed making small crosses and placing them in trees in the woods as shrines. However, he was not able to name the church after her because she had not yet been declared a saint.\n\nWithout a church in place yet, the parish held Masses in a town hall. One parishioner, J.J. Harrington, expressed great interest in an outdoor church that he had recently seen. Father Brophy liked the idea of an indoor church for year-round parishioners and an outdoor church for the summer and visitors. The outdoor church could also be seen as a way to attract tourists for the area.\n\nThroughout the summer of 1946, plans for the grounds and the new church were presented, requesting the State Park land. \"In May of 1948, the Commission granted them the land for the price of $1.00 and a box of candy for the secretary.\"<ref name=\"story\">{{cite web| title=About the Shrine| url=http://www.crossinthewoods.com/the-beginning/| publisher=The National Shrine of the Cross in the Woods| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> The original church was built in a \"long house\" style and designed by [[Alden B. Dow]], a student of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], to look upon the wooded area that surrounded it. It was completed by Memorial Day weekend of 1949. Today, this area houses the gift shop, main office and the nun doll museum in the lower level.\n\nAfter discussion with Dow, Father Brophy decided to build the largest wooden [[crucifix]] in the world on Calvary Hill, located north of the Long House Chapel. In July 1952, Bishop Babcock granted them permission to begin the project. The foundation of the Cross required a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} high steel and concrete base which was covered with soil, creating a hill {{convert|150|ft|m}} long, {{convert|15|ft|m}} high, and {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide. In the summer of 1952, redwood timber was custom cut with a chain saw from a lumber yard in [[Oregon]] and shipped on a railroad flat car. It took two days to assemble the Cross. Cranes lifted it to the foundation August 5, 1954, where it was secured.<ref name=\"story\"/> It stands {{convert|55|ft|m}} tall.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fishweb.com/maps/cheboygan/indianriver/shrine/index.html| title=Welcome to the Worlds Largest Crucifixion| publisher=Michigan Interactive| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Marshall Fredericks]], a renowned Michigan sculptor, agreed to create the figure of Christ for the Cross. The process took four years from sketches to plaster mold. The figure was then cast in bronze at the Kristians-Kunst Metalstobori Foundry in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. Weighing seven tons and {{convert|28|ft|m}} tall from head to toe, it was one of the largest castings to ever be shipped across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  Workers raised the sculpture into place August 9, 1959, and attached to the Cross with 13 bolts {{convert|30|in|mm}} long and {{convert|2|in|mm}} in diameter. The formal dedication occurred seven days later.\n\nOriginally called the ''Indian River Catholic Shrine'', the site became ''Cross in the Woods'' in 1983.\n\nIn 1992, because of weather damage, officials decided to clean the figure of Christ. The Jensen Foundation of Art Conservation cleaned, waxed and painted the bronze corpus over a period of several weeks.  It has since been waxed by volunteers every two years.\n\n===The Holy Stairs===\nIn 1956, the shrine added 28 stairs leading up Calvary Hill to the base of the Cross. These stairs represent the 28 stairs that [[Jesus]] climbed to the throne of [[Pontius Pilate]], where he was condemned to death and therefore are named ''[[Scala Sancta|The Holy Stairs]]''.\n\n===The New Church===\nAfter 50 years of praying before the Cross only in good weather and using the Long Chapel, seating 250 people, for all other Masses; the parishioners wished for a larger church that would also give year-round visibility of the Cross. On June 27, 1997, the dream became a reality when the shrine dedicated a new church. It holds 1,000 people and has large windows that allow worshipers to view the Cross while participating in Mass.\n\n===Becoming a National Shrine===\nAfter submitting a petition to become a [[national shrine]], the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops declared The Cross in the Woods as such in 2006.  It is one of two national shrines in Michigan (with [[National Shrine of the Little Flower]] in [[Royal Oak, Michigan|Royal Oak]]) and 120 in the United States.<ref name=\"Shrine\"/>\n\n==Shrines==\nBesides being a shrine itself, the Cross in the Woods also has many other smaller shrines on its grounds. These smaller shrines recognize influential people and important members of the Catholic faith.\n\n*Our Lady of the Highway \u2013 Carved from carrara marble, the statue of Our Lady of the Highway was a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Leo Kuhlman in 1957. She is the patroness of all the travelers who visit the Cross in the Woods.\n*[[Peregrine Laziosi|Saint Peregrine]] \u2013 The patron of those who are suffering from cancer, St. Peregrine's shrine was first built in the 1960s. It was originally located in the entrance to the Shrine, where the Hall of Saints is presently, but now is in a newly built gazebo.\n*[[Kateri Tekakwitha|Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha]] \u2013 The statue of Kateri Tekakwitha is dedicated to Charles D. Brophy, the founder of the Shrine and Parish. It is located in the outdoor sanctuary, looking back towards the Cross. She was an important influence on the building of the Cross because of her habit of placing small crosses in the forest as places to stop and pray.\n*[[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]] \u2013 Added to the Shrine in 1994, the statue of St. Francis of Assisi is specifically placed to the side of the Cross, gazing toward it representing Francis receiving orders from the Cross to repair Christ's church. St. Francis of Assisi is the patron of all those who work for peace and also the patron of the environment.\n*[[Holy Family|The Holy Family]] \u2013 Located in the outdoor sanctuary part of the Shrine, this statue represents family intimacy. It was carved by sculptor, Timothy P. Schmalz and is entitled ''A Quiet Moment''.\n\n==Stations of the Cross==\nThe [[Stations of the Cross]] represent the stages leading up to Jesus' death. They consist of 14 specific events that occurred before Jesus was crucified and later rose from the dead. These 14 events are shown through 14 pictures that represent each moment. They are a way to relive and remember what happened. At the Cross in the Woods Parish, the Stations of the Cross are located outside, incorporated into the pine forest on the Shrine grounds. The main emphasis in this area is a statue of the resurrected Jesus or the fifteenth Station of the Cross.\n\n==Nun Doll Museum==\n\"The Nun Doll Museum has the largest collection of dolls dressed in traditional attire of men and women religious communities in the United States.\"<ref name=\"museum\">''[http://www.crossinthewoods.com/museum.htm Nun Doll Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823143011/http://www.crossinthewoods.com/museum.htm |date=August 23, 2007 }}'' at The National Shrine of the Cross in the Woods.
