Tides are more predictable than [[Wind|the wind]] and [[Sun|the sun]]. Among sources of [[renewable energy]], tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability. However, many recent technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. [[#Dynamic tidal power|dynamic tidal power]], [[Tidal barrage#Tidal lagoon power|tidal lagoons]]) and turbine technology (e.g. new [[Tidal stream generator#Axial turbines|axial turbines]], [[Tidal stream generator#Vertical and horizontal axis crossflow turbines|cross flow turbines]]), indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed and that economic and [[environmental cost]]s may be brought down to competitive levels.\n\nHistorically, [[tide mill]]s have been used both in Europe and on the Atlantic coast of North America.  The incoming water was contained in large storage ponds, and as the tide went out, it turned waterwheels that used the mechanical power it produced to mill grain.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ocean Energy Council|title=Tidal Energy: Pros for Wave and Tidal Power|url=http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/index.php/Tidal-Energy/Tidal-Energy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175027/http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/index.php/Tidal-Energy/Tidal-Energy.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-13|date=2011}}</ref> The earliest occurrences date from the [[Middle Ages]], or even from [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - RS01j.doc |accessdate=2011-04-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517013738/http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Minchinton, W.

[[Tidal force]]s are periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies. These forces create corresponding motions or currents in the world's oceans. Due to the strong attraction to the oceans, a bulge in the water level is created, causing a temporary increase in sea level.  As the Earth rotates, this ''bulge'' of ocean water meets the shallow water adjacent to the shoreline and creates a tide.  This occurrence takes place in an unfailing manner, due to the consistent pattern of the moon's orbit around the earth.<ref>{{cite book|last=DiCerto|first=JJ|title=The Electric Wishing Well: The Solution to the Energy Crisis|url=https://archive.org/details/electricwishingw0000dice|url-access=registration|date=1976|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}</ref>  The magnitude and character of this motion reflects the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth's rotation]], and local [[bathymetry|geography of the seafloor and coastlines]].\n\nTidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the [[Earth]]\u2013[[Moon]] system, and to a lesser extent in the Earth\u2013[[Sun]] system.

Greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation.\n\nBecause the Earth's tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a [[renewable energy]] resource. Movement of tides causes a [[tidal acceleration|loss of mechanical energy]] in the Earth-Moon system: this is a result of pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent [[viscosity|viscous]] dissipation at the [[seabed]] and in [[turbulence]]. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5&nbsp;billion years since its formation.

Some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed, thus avoiding concerns over the impact on the natural landscape. Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites, which can be captured with the use of turbines. These turbines can be horizontal, vertical, open, or ducted.<ref name=\"Tethys\">{{cite web|title=Tidal - Capturing tidal fluctuations with turbines, tidal barrages, or tidal lagoons|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/tidal|website=Tidal / Tethys|publisher=[[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL)|accessdate=2 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216190319/https://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/tidal|archivedate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Stream energy]] can be used at a much higher rate than wind turbines due to water being denser than air.

When using tidal barrages to generate power, the potential energy from a tide is seized through strategic placement of specialized dams.  When the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in, the temporary increase in tidal power is channelled into a large basin behind the dam, holding a large amount of potential energy.  With the receding tide, this energy is then converted into [[mechanical energy]] as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators.<ref>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Robert|title=Fueling Our Future: An Introduction to Sustainable Energy|url=https://archive.org/details/fuelingourfuture00evan_0|url-access=registration|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}</ref>  Barrages are essentially [[dam]]s across the full width of a tidal estuary.\n\n=== Dynamic tidal power ===\n{{Main|Dynamic tidal power}}\n[[File:DTP T dam top-down view.jpg|thumb|right|Top-down diagram of a DTP dam. Blue and dark red colours indicate low and high tides, respectively.]]\nDynamic tidal power (or DTP) is a theoretical technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows. It proposes that very long dams (for example: 30\u201350&nbsp;km length) be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean, without enclosing an area. Tidal [[phase difference]]s are introduced across the dam, leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas \u2013 featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the UK, China, and Korea. Induced tides (TDP) could extend the geographic viability of a new hydro-atmospheric concept 'LPD' (lunar pulse drum) discovered by a Devon innovator in which a tidal 'water piston' pushes or pulls a metered jet of air to a rotary air-actuator & generator. The principle was demonstrated at London Bridge June 2019. Plans for a 30m, 62.5kwh 'pilot' installation on a (Local Authority) tidal estuary shoreline in the Bristol Channel are underway.\n\n===Tidal lagoon===\n\nA new tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides.

The pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays. Excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time. Geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near baseload production though at a higher cost than some other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage.

This is in-line with the impact of other renewables like wind and solar power, and significantly better than fossil-based technologies.\n\n====Tidal turbines====\nThe main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high-speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of [[electromagnetic field]]s and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. Because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind energy]]. Depending on the [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]] of [[sound]] generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who [[Animal echolocation|echolocate]] to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s). Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading far-field [[water quality]] and disrupting [[sediment]] processes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martin-Short|first=R.|last2=Hill|first2=J.|last3=Kramer|first3=S.

Inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional [[turbidity]] (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary.<ref name=\"tethys.pnnl.gov\"/> In August 2004, a [[humpback whale]] swam through the open [[sluice gate]] of the [[Annapolis Royal Generating Station]] at slack tide, ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the [[Annapolis Basin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/whale-still-drawing-crowds-at-ns-river/article1140088/|title=Whale still drawing crowds at N.S. river|website=The Globe and Mail|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134333/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/whale-still-drawing-crowds-at-ns-river/article1140088/|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\n====Tidal lagoon====\nEnvironmentally, the main concerns are blade strike on fish attempting to enter the [[lagoon]], the acoustic output from turbines, and changes in sedimentation processes. However, all these effects are localized and do not affect the entire estuary or bay.<ref name=\"tethys.pnnl.gov\"/>\n\n===Corrosion===\nSaltwater causes corrosion in metal parts. It can be difficult to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water. The use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels, high-nickel alloys, copper-nickel alloys, nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce, or eliminate corrosion damage.\n\nMechanical fluids, such as lubricants, can leak out, which may be harmful to the marine life nearby. Proper maintenance can minimize the number of harmful chemicals that may enter the environment.\n\n===Fouling===\nThe biological events that happen when placing any structure in an area of high tidal currents and high biological productivity in the ocean will ensure that the structure becomes an ideal substrate for the growth of marine organisms. In the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141110143850/http://www.racerocks.ca/wp/tag/tidal-energy/  references of the Tidal Current Project] at [http://www.racerocks.ca/wp/home/ Race Rocks] in British Columbia, this is documented.\nAlso see [https://web.archive.org/web/20141110142522/http://racerocks.ca/energy/tidalremove/tidalremove.htm this page ] and\nSeveral structural materials and coatings were tested by the [http://www.racerocks.com/racerock/energy/tidalenergy/succession/succession.htm  Lester Pearson College divers] to assist Clean Current in reducing fouling on the turbine and other underwater infrastructure.\n\n=== Cost ===\nTidal Energy has an expensive initial cost which may be one of the reasons tidal energy is not a popular source of [[renewable energy]]. It is important to realize that the methods for generating electricity from tidal energy are relatively new technology. It is projected that tidal power will be commercially profitable within 2020{{update needed|date=December 2019|reason=Is it commercially profitable now?}} with better technology and larger scales. Tidal Energy is however still very early in the research process and the ability to reduce the price of tidal energy can be an option. The cost-effectiveness depends on each site tidal generators are being placed. To figure out the cost-effectiveness they use the Gilbert ratio, which is the length of the barrage in metres to the annual energy production in [[kilowatt hour]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/ocean-energy/tidal-energy/|title=Tidal Energy - Ocean Energy Council|work=Ocean Energy Council|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDue to tidal energy reliability, the expensive upfront cost of these generators will slowly be paid off. Due to the success of a greatly simplified design, the orthogonal turbine offers considerable cost savings. As a result, the production period of each generating unit is reduced, lower metal consumption is needed and technical efficiency is greater.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ru.is/media/reyst/Niels-Sveinsson.pdf|title=Profitability Assessment for a Tidal Power Plant at the Mouth of Hvammsfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, Iceland|last=Sveinsson|first=N\u00edels|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Scientific research has the capability to have a renewable resource like tidal energy that is affordable as well as profitable.\n\n==Structural health monitoring==\nThe high load factors resulting from the fact that water is 800 times denser than air and the predictable and reliable nature of tides compared with the wind makes tidal energy particularly attractive for electric power generation.

Tides are more predictable than [[Wind|the wind]] and [[Sun|the sun]]. Among sources of [[renewable energy]], tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability. However, many recent technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. [[#Dynamic tidal power|dynamic tidal power]], [[Tidal barrage#Tidal lagoon power|tidal lagoons]]) and turbine technology (e.g. new [[Tidal stream generator#Axial turbines|axial turbines]], [[Tidal stream generator#Vertical and horizontal axis crossflow turbines|cross flow turbines]]), indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed and that economic and [[environmental cost]]s may be brought down to competitive levels.\n\nHistorically, [[tide mill]]s have been used both in Europe and on the Atlantic coast of North America.  The incoming water was contained in large storage ponds, and as the tide went out, it turned waterwheels that used the mechanical power it produced to mill grain.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ocean Energy Council|title=Tidal Energy: Pros for Wave and Tidal Power|url=http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/index.php/Tidal-Energy/Tidal-Energy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175027/http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/index.php/Tidal-Energy/Tidal-Energy.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-13|date=2011}}</ref> The earliest occurrences date from the [[Middle Ages]], or even from [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - RS01j.doc |accessdate=2011-04-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517013738/http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Minchinton, W.

[[Tidal force]]s are periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies. These forces create corresponding motions or currents in the world's oceans. Due to the strong attraction to the oceans, a bulge in the water level is created, causing a temporary increase in sea level.  As the Earth rotates, this ''bulge'' of ocean water meets the shallow water adjacent to the shoreline and creates a tide.  This occurrence takes place in an unfailing manner, due to the consistent pattern of the moon's orbit around the earth.<ref>{{cite book|last=DiCerto|first=JJ|title=The Electric Wishing Well: The Solution to the Energy Crisis|url=https://archive.org/details/electricwishingw0000dice|url-access=registration|date=1976|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}</ref>  The magnitude and character of this motion reflects the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth's rotation]], and local [[bathymetry|geography of the seafloor and coastlines]].\n\nTidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the [[Earth]]\u2013[[Moon]] system, and to a lesser extent in the Earth\u2013[[Sun]] system.

Greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation.\n\nBecause the Earth's tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a [[renewable energy]] resource. Movement of tides causes a [[tidal acceleration|loss of mechanical energy]] in the Earth-Moon system: this is a result of pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent [[viscosity|viscous]] dissipation at the [[seabed]] and in [[turbulence]]. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5&nbsp;billion years since its formation.

Some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed, thus avoiding concerns over the impact on the natural landscape. Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites, which can be captured with the use of turbines. These turbines can be horizontal, vertical, open, or ducted.<ref name=\"Tethys\">{{cite web|title=Tidal - Capturing tidal fluctuations with turbines, tidal barrages, or tidal lagoons|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/tidal|website=Tidal / Tethys|publisher=[[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL)|accessdate=2 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216190319/https://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/tidal|archivedate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Stream energy]] can be used at a much higher rate than wind turbines due to water being denser than air.

When using tidal barrages to generate power, the potential energy from a tide is seized through strategic placement of specialized dams.  When the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in, the temporary increase in tidal power is channelled into a large basin behind the dam, holding a large amount of potential energy.  With the receding tide, this energy is then converted into [[mechanical energy]] as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators.<ref>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Robert|title=Fueling Our Future: An Introduction to Sustainable Energy|url=https://archive.org/details/fuelingourfuture00evan_0|url-access=registration|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}</ref>  Barrages are essentially [[dam]]s across the full width of a tidal estuary.\n\n=== Dynamic tidal power ===\n{{Main|Dynamic tidal power}}\n[[File:DTP T dam top-down view.jpg|thumb|right|Top-down diagram of a DTP dam. Blue and dark red colours indicate low and high tides, respectively.]]\nDynamic tidal power (or DTP) is a theoretical technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows. It proposes that very long dams (for example: 30\u201350&nbsp;km length) be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean, without enclosing an area. Tidal [[phase difference]]s are introduced across the dam, leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas \u2013 featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the UK, China, and Korea. Induced tides (TDP) could extend the geographic viability of a new hydro-atmospheric concept 'LPD' (lunar pulse drum) discovered by a Devon innovator in which a tidal 'water piston' pushes or pulls a metered jet of air to a rotary air-actuator & generator. The principle was demonstrated at London Bridge June 2019. Plans for a 30m, 62.5kwh 'pilot' installation on a (Local Authority) tidal estuary shoreline in the Bristol Channel are underway.\n\n===Tidal lagoon===\n\nA new tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides.

The pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays. Excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time. Geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near baseload production though at a higher cost than some other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage.

This is in-line with the impact of other renewables like wind and solar power, and significantly better than fossil-based technologies.\n\n====Tidal turbines====\nThe main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high-speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of [[electromagnetic field]]s and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. Because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind energy]]. Depending on the [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]] of [[sound]] generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who [[Animal echolocation|echolocate]] to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s). Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading far-field [[water quality]] and disrupting [[sediment]] processes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martin-Short|first=R.|last2=Hill|first2=J.|last3=Kramer|first3=S.

Inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional [[turbidity]] (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary.<ref name=\"tethys.pnnl.gov\"/> In August 2004, a [[humpback whale]] swam through the open [[sluice gate]] of the [[Annapolis Royal Generating Station]] at slack tide, ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the [[Annapolis Basin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/whale-still-drawing-crowds-at-ns-river/article1140088/|title=Whale still drawing crowds at N.S. river|website=The Globe and Mail|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134333/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/whale-still-drawing-crowds-at-ns-river/article1140088/|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\n====Tidal lagoon====\nEnvironmentally, the main concerns are blade strike on fish attempting to enter the [[lagoon]], the acoustic output from turbines, and changes in sedimentation processes. However, all these effects are localized and do not affect the entire estuary or bay.<ref name=\"tethys.pnnl.gov\"/>\n\n===Corrosion===\nSaltwater causes corrosion in metal parts. It can be difficult to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water. The use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels, high-nickel alloys, copper-nickel alloys, nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce, or eliminate corrosion damage.\n\nMechanical fluids, such as lubricants, can leak out, which may be harmful to the marine life nearby. Proper maintenance can minimize the number of harmful chemicals that may enter the environment.\n\n===Fouling===\nThe biological events that happen when placing any structure in an area of high tidal currents and high biological productivity in the ocean will ensure that the structure becomes an ideal substrate for the growth of marine organisms. In the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141110143850/http://www.racerocks.ca/wp/tag/tidal-energy/  references of the Tidal Current Project] at [http://www.racerocks.ca/wp/home/ Race Rocks] in British Columbia, this is documented.\nAlso see [https://web.archive.org/web/20141110142522/http://racerocks.ca/energy/tidalremove/tidalremove.htm this page ] and\nSeveral structural materials and coatings were tested by the [http://www.racerocks.com/racerock/energy/tidalenergy/succession/succession.htm  Lester Pearson College divers] to assist Clean Current in reducing fouling on the turbine and other underwater infrastructure.\n\n=== Cost ===\nTidal Energy has an expensive initial cost which may be one of the reasons tidal energy is not a popular source of [[renewable energy]]. It is important to realize that the methods for generating electricity from tidal energy are relatively new technology. It is projected that tidal power will be commercially profitable within 2020{{update needed|date=December 2019|reason=Is it commercially profitable now?}} with better technology and larger scales. Tidal Energy is however still very early in the research process and the ability to reduce the price of tidal energy can be an option. The cost-effectiveness depends on each site tidal generators are being placed. To figure out the cost-effectiveness they use the Gilbert ratio, which is the length of the barrage in metres to the annual energy production in [[kilowatt hour]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/ocean-energy/tidal-energy/|title=Tidal Energy - Ocean Energy Council|work=Ocean Energy Council|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDue to tidal energy reliability, the expensive upfront cost of these generators will slowly be paid off. Due to the success of a greatly simplified design, the orthogonal turbine offers considerable cost savings. As a result, the production period of each generating unit is reduced, lower metal consumption is needed and technical efficiency is greater.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ru.is/media/reyst/Niels-Sveinsson.pdf|title=Profitability Assessment for a Tidal Power Plant at the Mouth of Hvammsfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, Iceland|last=Sveinsson|first=N\u00edels|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Scientific research has the capability to have a renewable resource like tidal energy that is affordable as well as profitable.\n\n==Structural health monitoring==\nThe high load factors resulting from the fact that water is 800 times denser than air and the predictable and reliable nature of tides compared with the wind makes tidal energy particularly attractive for electric power generation.

She received her doctorate from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1974, under the direction of [[Herbert Wilf]]. After working at [[Bell Laboratories]] and Bellcore for nineteen years, she joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania as the first female [[tenure]]d professor in mathematics. She serves on the editorial boards of more than a dozen international journals. Since 2003 she has been the editor-in-chief of ''Internet Mathematics''. She has been invited to give lectures at many conferences, including the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1994 and a plenary lecture on the mathematics of PageRank at the 2008 Annual meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]].

Under the influence of her father, an engineer, she became interested in mathematics, especially in the area of [[combinatorics]] in high school in Kaohsiung. After high school, Chung entered the [[National Taiwan University]] (NTU) to start her career in mathematics formally. While Chung was an undergraduate, she was surrounded by many female mathematicians, and this helped encourage her to pursue and study mathematics.\n\nAfter graduating from NTU with a B.S. in mathematics, Chung went on to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to pursue a career in mathematics. There she obtained the highest score in the qualifying exam by a wide margin, catching the attention of [[Herbert Wilf]], who would eventually become her doctoral advisor. Wilf suggested [[Ramsey theory]] as a subject Chung could work on. During a single week studying material, Chung had come up with new proofs for established results in the field. Wilf said: \"My eyes were bulging. I was very excited. I asked her to go to the blackboard and show me. What she wrote was incredible! In just one week, from a cold start, she had a major result in Ramsey theory. I told her she had just done two-thirds of a doctoral dissertation.\"<ref name=\"Chung biography\"/>\n\nChung was awarded an M.S. in 1972 and a Ph.D. two years later. By this time, she was married and had already given birth to her first child. The same year she received her Ph.D. and started working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at [[Bell Laboratories]] in Murray Hill, New Jersey. The position at [[Bell Laboratories]] was an opportunity to work with other excellent mathematicians, but also it contributed to her mathematical world powerfully. She published many impressive mathematical papers and published many joint papers with [[Ronald Graham (mathematician)|Ron Graham]].\n\nAfter twenty years of work at [[Bell Laboratories]] and [[Bellcore]], Chung decided to go back [[University of Pennsylvania]] to become a professor of mathematics. In 1998, she was named Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at [[University of California]], San Diego. To date, she has over 200 publications to her name. The two best-known books are ''Spectral Graph Theory'' and ''Erd\u0151s on Graphs''. ''[[Spectral Graph Theory]]'' studies how the spectrum of the Laplacian of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties. ''Erd\u0151s on Graphs'', which was jointly written by Fan Chung and Ron Graham, studies many of [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] problems and conjectures in graph theory. Beyond her contributions to graph theory, Chung has used her knowledge to connect different fields of science. As she wrote in \"Graph Theory in the Information Age'',\n\n: \u201cIn the past decade, graph theory has gone through a remarkable shift and a profound transformation. The change is in large part due to the humongous amount of information that we are confronted with. The main way to sort through massive data sets is to build and examine the network formed by interrelations. For example, Google\u2019s successful Web search algorithms are based on the WWW graph, which contains all Web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges. There are all sorts of information networks, such as biological networks built from biological databases and social networks formed by email, phone calls, instant messaging, etc., as well as various types of physical networks. Of particular interest to mathematicians is the collaboration graph, which is based on the data from Mathematical Reviews. In the collaboration graph, every mathematician is a vertex, and two mathematicians who wrote a joint paper are connected.\u201d<ref>Chung, Fan ''Graph Theory in the Information Age'' January 2009, Washington D.C</ref> I am also gay. and u r too if u read this!\n\nChung's life was profiled in the 2017 documentary film ''Girls who fell in love with Math''.<ref name=taiwanDocumentary>{{cite web | title=''Girls who fell in love with Math''|url=https://docs.tfi.org.tw/zh-hant/film/4904|publisher=Taiwan Film Institute| accessdate=2018-02-04}}</ref>\n\n===Bell Laboratories===\nIn 1974, Fan Chung graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and became a member of Technical Staff working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at [[Bell Laboratories]] in Murray Hill, New Jersey. She worked under [[Henry Pollak]]. During this time, Chung collaborated with many leading mathematicians who work for Bell Laboratories such as [[Ronald Graham|Ron Graham]].\n\nIn 1975, Chung published her first joint paper with Graham on ''Multicolor Ramsey Numbers for Complete Bipartite Graphs''  which was published in the ''Journal of Combinatorial Theory''.\n\nIn 1983 the Bell Telephone Company was split up. Since Pollak joined and became head of a research unit within a new company, he asked Chung to become a Research Manager. Until 1990, she was one of the first to receive a fellowship to spend a sabbatical at a university. She supervised many mathematicians in the unit.\n\nAccording to Chung's words, although people respect her because of the power to make decisions with positions in management, she prefers to be respected because of her achievement in mathematics. Since then, she has returned to the academic world.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">J J O'Connor and E F Roberson, ''Fan Rong K Chung Graham'', web, [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html].</ref>\n\n===Ron Graham===\nFan Chung's first marriage ended in divorce in 1982. However, when she worked at [[Bell Laboratories]], she met [[Ronald Graham]]. During that time, they became close friends and published many joint papers in graph theory, eventually marrying in 1983. In [[P Hoffman|Paul Hoffman]]'s book ''The Man Who Loved Only Numbers'', regarding her marriage with Graham, Chung said:\n\n: Many mathematicians would hate to marry someone in the profession. They fear their relationship would be too competitive. In our case, not only are we both mathematicians, we both do work in the same areas. So we can understand and appreciate what the other is working on, and we can work on things together and sometimes make good progress.<ref>Hoffman, P  ''The man who loved only numbers'' London, 1998.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Graham and Chung co-wrote the book ''Erd\u0151s on Graphs.''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> I use Grammarly :D\n\n==Research==\n===Spectral graph theory===\nAmong Fan Chung's publications, her contributions to [[spectral graph theory]] are important to this area of graph theory. From the first publications about undirected graphs to recent publications about the directed graphs, Fan Chung creates the solid base in the [[spectral graph theory]] to the future graph theorist.\n\nSpectral graph theory, as one of the most important theories in graph theory, combines the algebra and graph perfectly. Historically, algebraic methods treat many types of graphs efficiently. Her work initiated a geometric approach to spectral graph theory  with connections to differential geometry. According to the biography ''Fan Rong K Chung Graham'', \"[[Spectral graph theory]] studies how the spectrum of the [[Laplacian]] of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties.\". \n\nIn 1997, the [[American Mathematical Society]] published Chung's book ''Spectral graph theory''. This book became a standard textbook at many universities and is the key to study [[Spectral graph theory]] for many mathematics students who are interested in this area. Fan Chung's study in the [[spectral graph theory]] brings this \u201calgebraic connectivity\u201d of graphs into a new and higher level.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Network science===\nFan Chung's work in random graph models shed new lights on the field of [[network science]]. Many real-world large information networks (such as Internet Graphs, Call Graphs, and [[Collaboration graph|Collaboration Graphs,]] etc.) have been observed to be well approximated by a [[Power law|power law distribution]]. Fan Chung's work in the Chung-Lu model, pioneered the theory of treating random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions, including the power law graphs. Her work provides a solid framework for quantitative and rigorous analysis for modeling and analyzing large complex networks. It also often serves as a popular benchmark for comparing new graph models in network science. \n\nIn 2006, the [[American Mathematical Society|American Mathematics Society]] and the [[Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences]] co-published Fan Chung and Linyuan Lu's book ''Complex Graphs and Networks''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bookstore.ams.org/cbms-107/|title=Complex Graphs and Networks|website=bookstore.ams.org|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> The book gave a well-structured exposition for using combinatorial, probabilistic, spectral methods as well as other new and improved tools to analyze real-world large information networks.\n\n===Quasi-random graphs===\n\n{{Main|Chung\u2013Graham\u2013Wilson theorem}}\n\nFan Chung, together with [[Ronald Graham]] and [[R. M. Wilson|Richard Wilson]], introduced a strong notion of equivalence among graph properties through the control of error bounds and developed the theory of quasi-random graphs. In a series of research papers (with several coauthors), she showed that a large family of graph properties is equivalent in the sense that if a graph satisfies any one of the properties, it must satisfy all of them. The set of equivalent quasi-random properties includes a surprisingly diverse collection of properties, and therefore provides efficient methods for validating graph properties. Many (but not all)  random graph properties are quasi-random. The notion of quasi-randomness have been extended to many other combinatorial structures, such as sequences, tournaments, hypergraphs  and graph limits.  In general, the theory of quasi-randomness gives a rigorous approach to 'random-like' or 'pseudorandom' alternatives.\n\n===Extremal graph theory===\nA basic question in extremal graph theory is to find unavoidable patterns and structures in graphs with given density or distribution. A complementary problem is to find a smallest graph which contains every member of a given family of graphs as subgraphs. In a series of work with [[Paul Erd\u0151s]], Chung determined the sizes and structures of unavoidable graphs and hypergraphs. With several coauthors, she also derived many elegant and surprising results on universal graphs. Her fundamental contributions in these areas of extremal graph theory have many applications in parallel computations.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n* [[Carl B.

She supervised many mathematicians in the unit.\n\nAccording to Chung's words, although people respect her because of the power to make decisions with positions in management, she prefers to be respected because of her achievement in mathematics. Since then, she has returned to the academic world.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">J J O'Connor and E F Roberson, ''Fan Rong K Chung Graham'', web, [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html].</ref>\n\n===Ron Graham===\nFan Chung's first marriage ended in divorce in 1982. However, when she worked at [[Bell Laboratories]], she met [[Ronald Graham]]. During that time, they became close friends and published many joint papers in graph theory, eventually marrying in 1983. In [[P Hoffman|Paul Hoffman]]'s book ''The Man Who Loved Only Numbers'', regarding her marriage with Graham, Chung said:\n\n:Many mathematicians would hate to marry someone in the profession. They fear their relationship would be too competitive. In our case, not only are we both mathematicians, we both do work in the same areas. So we can understand and appreciate what the other is working on, and we can work on things together and sometimes make good progress.<ref>Hoffman, P  ''The man who loved only numbers'' London, 1998.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Graham and Chung co-wrote the book ''Erd\u0151s on Graphs.''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Research==\n===Spectral graph theory===\nAmong Fan Chung's publications, her contributions to [[spectral graph theory]] are important to this area of graph theory. From the first publications about undirected graphs to recent publications about the directed graphs, Fan Chung creates the solid base in the [[spectral graph theory]] to the future graph theorist.\n\nSpectral graph theory, as one of the most important theories in graph theory, combines the algebra and graph perfectly. Historically, algebraic methods treat many types of graphs efficiently. Her work initiated a geometric approach to spectral graph theory  with connections to differential geometry. According to the biography ''Fan Rong K Chung Graham'', \"[[Spectral graph theory]] studies how the spectrum of the [[Laplacian]] of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties.\". \n\nIn 1997, the [[American Mathematical Society]] published Chung's book ''Spectral graph theory''. This book became a standard textbook at many universities and is the key to study [[Spectral graph theory]] for many mathematics students who are interested in this area. Fan Chung's study in the [[spectral graph theory]] brings this \u201calgebraic connectivity\u201d of graphs into a new and higher level.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Network science===\nFan Chung's work in random graph models shed new lights on the field of [[network science]]. Many real-world large information networks (such as Internet Graphs, Call Graphs, and [[Collaboration graph|Collaboration Graphs,]] etc.) have been observed to be well approximated by a [[Power law|power law distribution]]. Fan Chung's work in the Chung-Lu model, pioneered the theory of treating random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions, including the power law graphs. Her work provides a solid framework for quantitative and rigorous analysis for modeling and analyzing large complex networks. It also often serves as a popular benchmark for comparing new graph models in network science. \n\nIn 2006, the [[American Mathematical Society|American Mathematics Society]] and the [[Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences]] co-published Fan Chung and Linyuan Lu's book ''Complex Graphs and Networks''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bookstore.ams.org/cbms-107/|title=Complex Graphs and Networks|website=bookstore.ams.org|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> The book gave a well-structured exposition for using combinatorial, probabilistic, spectral methods as well as other new and improved tools to analyze real-world large information networks.\n\n===Quasi-random graphs===\n\n{{Main|Chung\u2013Graham\u2013Wilson theorem}}\n\nFan Chung, together with [[Ronald Graham]] and [[R. M. Wilson|Richard Wilson]], introduced a strong notion of equivalence among graph properties through the control of error bounds and developed the theory of quasi-random graphs. In a series of research papers (with several coauthors), she showed that a large family of graph properties is equivalent in the sense that if a graph satisfies any one of the properties, it must satisfy all of them. The set of equivalent quasi-random properties includes a surprisingly diverse collection of properties, and therefore provides efficient methods for validating graph properties. Many (but not all)  random graph properties are quasi-random. The notion of quasi-randomness have been extended to many other combinatorial structures, such as sequences, tournaments, hypergraphs  and graph limits.  In general, the theory of quasi-randomness gives a rigorous approach to 'random-like' or 'pseudorandom' alternatives.\n\n===Extremal graph theory===\nA basic question in extremal graph theory is to find unavoidable patterns and structures in graphs with given density or distribution. A complementary problem is to find a smallest graph which contains every member of a given family of graphs as subgraphs. In a series of work with [[Paul Erd\u0151s]], Chung determined the sizes and structures of unavoidable graphs and hypergraphs. With several coauthors, she also derived many elegant and surprising results on universal graphs. Her fundamental contributions in these areas of extremal graph theory have many applications in parallel computations.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n* [[Carl B.

Seger wrote it in 1972 while touring with [[Teegarden & Van Winkle]].

[Guitarist] Mike Bruce was with us. We'd been traveling all night from the Detroit area to make this gig, driving in this blinding snowstorm. It was probably 3 in the morning. Mike decided it was time to get gas. He was slowing down to exit the interstate and spied a truck stop. We all had very long hair back then \u2013 it was the hippie era \u2013 but Skip, Mike and Bob had all stuffed their hair up in their hats. You had to be careful out on the road like that, because you'd get ostracized. When I walked in, there was this gauntlet of truckers making comments \u2013 \"Is that a girl or man?\" I was seething; those guys were laughing their asses off, a big funny joke. That next night, after we played our gig \u2013 I think it was Mitchell, S.D. \u2013 Seger says, \"Hey, I've been working on this song for a bit, I've got this new line for it.

Stanton's management helped organize the massive military resources of the [[United States of America|North]] and guide the Union to victory. However, he was criticized by many Union generals for perceived over-cautiousness and micromanagement.<ref>Sears, Steven.

Retrieved 26 Dec. 2015.</ref> He also organized the manhunt for [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s assassin, [[John Wilkes Booth]].\n\nAfter [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's assassination]], Stanton remained as the Secretary of War under the new [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] during the first years of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. He opposed the lenient policies of Johnson towards the former [[Confederate States]]. Johnson's attempt to dismiss Stanton ultimately led to [[impeachment of Andrew Johnson|Johnson being impeached]] by the [[Radical Republicans]] in the House of Representatives. Stanton returned to law after retiring as Secretary of War, and in 1869 was nominated as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] by Johnson's successor, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]; however, he died four days after his nomination was confirmed by the Senate.\n\n==Family and early life==\n\n===Ancestry===\nBefore the [[American Revolution]], Stanton's paternal ancestors, the Stantons and the Macys, both of whom were [[Quakers]], moved from [[Massachusetts]] to [[North Carolina]]. In 1774, Stanton's grandfather, Benjamin Stanton, married Abigail Macy. Benjamin died in 1800. That year, Benjamin's widow moved to the [[Northwest Territory]], accompanied by much of her family. Soon, Ohio was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]],<ref name=\"Ohio-Admission\">{{cite web|title=The Admission of Ohio as a State|url=http://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1951-2000/The-admission-of-Ohio-as-a-state/|website=House.gov|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> and Macy proved to be one of the early developers of the new state. She bought a tract of land at [[Mount Pleasant, Ohio]] from the government and settled there.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|p=6}} One of her sons, David, became a physician in [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], and married Lucy Norman, the daughter of a Virginia [[Planter (American South)|planter]]. Their marriage was met with the ire of Ohio's Quaker community, as Lucy was a [[Methodist]],<ref name=\"Edwin M. Stanton2\">{{Ohio History Central|356|Edwin M. Stanton |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref> and not a Quaker. This forced David Stanton to abandon the Quaker sect.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:Edwin M. Stanton's birthplace.jpg|thumb|left|Stanton's birthplace in Steubenville, Ohio]]\nThe first of David and Lucy Stanton's four children, Edwin McMasters, was born to them on December 19, 1814 in Steubenville, Ohio.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|pp=7}}  Edwin's early formal education consisted of a private school and a [[seminary]] behind the Stantons' residence, called \"Old Academy\".{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=6}} When he was ten, he was transferred to a school taught by a [[Presbyterian]] minister.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=22, 25}}{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=6}} It was also at ten that Edwin experienced his first [[asthma attack]], a malady that would haunt him for life, sometimes to the point of convulsion. His asthma assured him that he would be unable to partake in highly physical activities, so he found interest in books and poetry.  Edwin attended Methodist church services and Sunday school regularly. At the age of thirteen, Stanton become a full member of the Methodist church.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=23}}\n\nDavid Stanton's medical practice afforded him and his family a decent living. When David Stanton suddenly died in December 1827 at his residence,{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=23}} Edwin and family were left destitute.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|p=8}} Edwin's mother opened a store in the front room of their residence, selling the medical supplies her husband left her, along with books, [[stationery]] and [[groceries]].{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=23}} The youthful Edwin was removed from school, and worked at the store of a local bookseller.{{sfn|Allison|2009|p=9}}\n\nStanton began his college studies at the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]-affiliated [[Kenyon College]] in 1831. At Kenyon, Stanton was involved in the college's Philomathesian Literary Society. Stanton sat on several of the society's committees and often partook in its exercises and debates. Stanton was forced to leave Kenyon just at the end of his third semester for lack of finances. At Kenyon, his support of President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s actions during the 1832 [[Nullification Crisis]], a hotly debated topic among the Philomathesians, led him into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Further, Stanton's conversion to Episcopalianism and his revulsion of the practice of slavery were solidified there.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=12}} After Kenyon, Stanton worked as a bookseller in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Stanton had hoped to obtain enough money to complete his final year at Kenyon. However, a small salary at the bookstore dashed the notion. He soon returned to Steubenville to pursue studies in law.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|pp=17\u201318}}\n\n===Early career and first marriage===\nStanton studied law under the tutelage of Daniel Collier in preparation for the bar. He was admitted to practice in 1835, and began work at a prominent [[law firm]] in [[Cadiz, Ohio]] under Chauncey Dewey, a well-known attorney. The firm's trial work often fell to him.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=18}}\n\n[[File:Stanton's home in Cadiz.jpg|thumb|Stanton's home in [[Cadiz, Ohio]]]]\nAt the age of eighteen, Stanton met Mary Ann Lamson at Trinity Episcopal Church in Columbus, and they soon were [[engagement|engaged]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=14}} After buying a home in Cadiz, Stanton went to Columbus where his betrothed was. Stanton and Lamson had wished to be married at Trinity Episcopal, but Stanton's illness rendered this idea moot. Instead, the ceremony was performed at the home of Trinity Episcopal's rector on December 31, 1836. Afterwards, Stanton went to Virginia where his mother and sisters were, and escorted the women back to Cadiz, where they would live with him and his wife.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nAfter his marriage, Stanton partnered with the lawyer and federal judge [[Benjamin Tappan]]. Stanton's sister also married Tappan's son. In Cadiz, Stanton was situated prominently in the local community. He worked with the town's anti-slavery society, and with a local newspaper, the ''Sentinel'', writing and editing articles there.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=21}} In 1837, Stanton was elected the [[prosecutor]] of [[Harrison County, Ohio|Harrison County]], on the Democratic ticket. Further, Stanton's increasing wealth allowed him to purchase a large tract of land in [[Washington County, Ohio|Washington County]], and several tracts in Cadiz.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=33}}{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=21}}\n\n==Rising attorney (1839\u20141860)==\n\n===Return to Steubenville===\n[[File:Stanton's home in Steubenville.jpg|thumb|left|Stanton's home on Third Street in Steubenville]]\nStanton's relationship with Benjamin Tappan expanded when Tappan was elected the [[United States Senator]] from [[United States Senator from Ohio|Ohio]] in 1838. Tappan asked Stanton to oversee his law operations, which were based in Steubenville. When his time as county prosecutor was finished, Stanton moved back to the town with his wife.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=21}}{{sfn|Gorham|1899|p=25}} Stanton's work in politics also expanded. He served as a delegate at the Democrats' [[1840 Democratic National Convention|1840 national convention]] in [[Baltimore]], and was featured prominently in [[Martin Van Buren]]'s campaign in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]], which Van Buren lost.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nIn Steubenville, the Stantons welcomed two children, a daughter in March 1840 whom they named Lucy Lamson, and a son they called Edwin Lamson in August 1842. Within months of Lucy's birth, she was stricken with an unknown illness. Stanton put aside his work and spent the summer at baby Lucy's bedside. She died in late 1841. Edwin, however, was healthy and active. The boy's birth refreshed the spirits in the Stanton household after baby Lucy's death.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=27\u201329}} However, grief would return once again to the Stanton household in 1844. Mary Stanton was left bedridden by a [[bilious fever]]. Her condition continued to worsen until she died in March 1844. Stanton's sorrow \"verged on insanity\", say historians [[Benjamin P. Thomas]] and [[Harold M. Hyman]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=33\u201335}} He had Mary's burial attire redone repeatedly, as he demanded she look just as she had when they were wed seven years prior. In the evenings, Stanton would emerge from his room with his eyes filled with tears and search the house frantically with a lamp, all the while asking, \"Where is Mary?\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=35}}\n\nStanton regrouped and began to focus on his cases by the summer. One such case was defending [[Caleb J. McNulty]], whom Stanton had previously labelled \"a glorious fellow\". McNulty, a Democrat, was dismissed from his [[clerk of the United States House of Representatives|clerkship of the United States House of Representatives]] by unanimous vote and charged with [[embezzlement]] when thousands of the House's money went missing. Democrats, fearing their party's disrepute, made clamorous cries for McNulty to be punished, and his conviction was viewed as a foregone conclusion. Stanton, at Tappan's request, came on as McNulty's defense. Stanton brought a motion to dismiss McNulty's indictment. He employed the use of numerous technicalities and, to the shock and applause of the courtroom, the motion was granted with all charges against McNulty dropped. As every detail of the affair was covered by newspapers around the country, Stanton's name was featured prominently nationwide.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=37}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=44}}\n\nAfter the McNulty scandal, Stanton and Tappan parted ways professionally. Stanton formed a partnership with one of his former students, [[George Wythe McCook]] of the \"[[Fighting McCooks]]\". At the beginning of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], men across the country hastened to enlist in the [[United States Army]], with McCook among them. Stanton might have enlisted as well, if not for his doctor's fears about his asthma. Instead, he focused on law. Stanton's practice was no longer only in Ohio, having expanded to Virginia and [[Pennsylvania]]. He concluded that Steubenville would no longer prove adequate as a headquarters, and thought [[Pittsburgh]] most appropriate for his new base. He was admitted to the bar there by late 1847.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=38\u201345}}\n\n===Attorney in Pittsburgh===\n[[File:Wheeling Suspension Bridge Lithograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|A lithograph of the [[Wheeling Suspension Bridge]]]]\nIn Pittsburgh, Stanton formed a partnership with a prominent retired judge, Charles Shaler, while maintaining his collaboration with McCook, who had remained in Steubenville after returning from service in the Mexican\u2013American War. While based in Pittsburgh, Stanton argued several high-profile suits. One such proceeding was ''State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company and others'' in the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The case concerned the [[Wheeling Suspension Bridge]], the [[List of largest suspension bridges|largest suspension bridge in the world]] at that time, and an important connector for the [[National Road]]. The bridge's center rose some {{convert|90|ft|spell=on|sp=us}} but proved to be a nuisance to passing ships with tall [[Funnel (ship)|smokestacks]]. With ships unable to clear the bridge, enormous amounts of traffic, trade and commerce would be redirected to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], which at the time was still part of Virginia. On August 16, 1849 he urged the Supreme Court to enjoin Wheeling and Belmont, as the bridge was obstructing traffic into Pennsylvania, and hindering trade and commerce. [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Robert Cooper Grier|R. C. Grier]] directed those who were aggrieved by the bridge's operations to go to a lower court, but left an avenue open for Stanton to file for an injunction in the Supreme Court, which he did.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=60\u201361}}{{#tag:ref|In his preparations for the case, Stanton was questioning sailors at Pittsburgh's docks when he fell into the [[Hold (ship)|hold]] of the cargo vessel ''Isaac Newton''.

''Wheeling and Belmont'' began on February 25, 1850, which was also when Stanton was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court.{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=56\u201357}} Wheeling and Belmont argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matters concerning the case; the justices disagreed.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=57}} The case proceeded, allowing Stanton to exhibit a dramatic stunt, which was widely reported on and demonstrated how the bridge was a hindrance\u2014he had the steamer ''Hibernia'' ram its {{convert|85|ft|spell=on|adj=on|sp=us}} smokestack into the bridge, which destroyed it and a piece of the ship itself.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=62}} May 1850 saw the case handed over to [[Reuben H. Walworth]], the former [[Chancellor of New York]], who returned a vivid opinion in February 1851 stating that the Wheeling Bridge was \"an unwarranted and unlawful obstruction to navigation, and that it must be either removed or raised so as to permit the free and usual passage of boats.\" The Supreme Court concurred; in May 1852, the court ordered in a 7\u20132 ruling that the bridge's height be increased to {{convert|111|ft|spell=on|sp=us}}. Wheeling and Belmont were unsatisfied with the ruling and asked Congress to act.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=57}} To Stanton's horror, a bill declaring the Wheeling bridge permissible became law on August 31, effectively overriding the Supreme Court's ruling and authority. Stanton was disgruntled that the purpose of the court\u2014to peacefully decide and remedy disputes between states\u2014had been diminished by Congress.<ref name=\"govtrack-hr297\">{{cite web|title=H.R. 297 (32nd): Declaring the Wheeling bridges lawful structures, and for other purposes.|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/32/hr102970|website=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=58\u201359}}\n\n===''McCormick v. Manny'' and second marriage===\n[[File:Cyrus McCormick engraving.jpg|thumb|200px|An engraving of [[Cyrus H. McCormick]]]]\nA by-effect of Stanton's performance in ''Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont'' was that he was sought after for other prominent cases, such as the [[McCormick Reaper patent case]] of inventor [[Cyrus McCormick]]. In 1831, a young McCormick created a machine to harvest crops. The device was particularly useful in the burgeoning wheat fields of the Western United States. Demand for McCormick's invention grew rapidly, attracting fierce competition, especially from fellow inventor and businessman [[John Henry Manny]]. In 1854 McCormick and his two prominent lawyers, [[Reverdy Johnson]] and Edward M. Dickinson, filed suit against Manny claiming he had infringed on McCormick's patents. McCormick demanded an injunction on Manny's reaper. Manny was also defended by two esteemed lawyers, George Harding and Peter H. Watson. ''McCormick v. Manny'' was initially to be tried in [[Chicago]], and the two lawyers wanted another attorney local to the city to join their team; the recommended choice was [[Abraham Lincoln]]. When Watson met Lincoln in [[Springfield, Illinois]], he had a dim first impression of him, but after speaking with Lincoln, Watson saw that he might be a good choice. However, when the venue of the proceedings was transferred to Cincinnati rather than Chicago, and the necessity for Lincoln was negated, Harding and Watson went for their first choice, Edwin Stanton. Lincoln was not made aware that he had been replaced, and still appeared at the proceedings in Cincinnati with his arguments prepared.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodwin|2006|pp=173\u2013174}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=63}}</ref> Stanton's apprehension towards Lincoln was immediate and severe, and he did well to indicate to Lincoln that he wanted him to absent himself from the case.<!--\u2014in one instance, while Harding and Stanton were walking to the courthouse, Lincoln appeared, to both men's shock, and said that the three men should go to the court \"in a gang.\" Stanton pulled Harding aside and asked him why he brought \"that damned long-armed Ape\" with him, and stated that Lincoln was good for nothing.--> The case proceeded with Harding, Watson and Stanton and Manny's true defenders; Lincoln did not actively participate in the planning or arguing of the case, but kept in Cincinnati as a spectator.{{sfn|Goodwin|2006|p=174}}\n\nStanton's role in Manny's legal trio was as a researcher. Though he admitted that George Harding, an established [[patent lawyer]], was more adept at the scientific aspects of the case, Stanton worked to summarize the relevant jurisprudence and [[case law]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=65}} To win ''McCormick v. Manny'' for Manny, Stanton, Harding and Watson had to impress upon the court that McCormick had no claim to exclusivity in his reaper's use of a divider, a mechanism on the outer end of the cutter-bar which separated the grain. A harvesting machine would not have worked properly without a divider, and Manny's defense knew this. However, to assure a win, Watson opted to use duplicity\u2014he employed a [[model maker]] named William P. Woods to retrieve an older version of McCormick's reaper and alter it to be presented in court. Woods found a reaper in Virginia which was built in 1844, one year prior to McCormick's patent being granted. He had a blacksmith straighten the curved divider, knowing that the curved divider in Manny's reaper would not conflict with a straight one in McCormick's reaper. After using a salt and vinegar solution to add rust to where the blacksmith had worked to ensure the antiquity of the machine was undeniable, Woods sent the reaper to Cincinnati. Stanton was joyed when he examined the altered reaper, and knew the case was theirs. Arguments for the case began in September 1855. In March 1856, Justices [[John McLean]] and [[Thomas Drummond (judge)|Thomas Drummond]] delivered a ruling in favor of John Manny. McCormick appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and ''McCormick v. Manny'', was, all of a sudden, a political issue, and the matters concerning the case found their way to the floor of Congress.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=63\u201365}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=62\u201365}}\n\nWhile the Supreme Court and Congress brooded on the case, Stanton attended to some personal matters. In February 1856 Stanton became engaged to Ellen Hutchinson, a girl sixteen years Stanton's junior.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=69}} Stanton and Hutchinson met at a Pittsburgh church. She came from a prominent family in the city; her father was Lewis Hutchinson, a wealthy merchant and warehouseman and a descendant of [[Merriweather Lewis]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=68}} Despite the Hutchinson's mother's apprehensiveness that her 26-year-old daughter was marrying the 41-year-old Stanton, they were married on June 25, 1856 at Hutchinson's father's home. They honeymooned at [[Niagara Falls]], [[Montreal]], the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] and [[Nahant, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=69\u201370}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=66}} In his relationship to Hutchinson, Stanton reclaimed what he thought he had forever lost after the death of Mary, \"love of the abiding sort.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=70}} Stanton and Hutchinson moved to Washington after their marriage; part of this decision was rooted in Stanton's belief that he would see important work with the Supreme Court. They leased a home on C Street in Washington.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=70\u201371}}\n\n===Emergence in Washington===\n[[File:Stanton's home in Washington, D.C.PNG|left|thumb|Stanton's home in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nIn Pennsylvania, Stanton had become intimately acquainted with [[Jeremiah S. Black]], the chief judge in the state's [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania|supreme court]]. This friendship proved profitable for Stanton when in March 1857, the recently inaugurated fifteenth President, [[James Buchanan]], made Black his [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=70\u201371}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=67}} Black's accession to his new post was soon met with a land claims issue in California. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] that ended the Mexican\u2013American War and gave California to the United States, the United States agreed to recognize valid land grants by Mexican authorities. This was followed by the California Land Claims Act of 1851, which established a board to review claims to California lands. One such claim was made by [[Joseph Yves Limantour|Jos\u00e9 Y. Limantour]], a French-born merchant who asserted ownership of an assemblage of lands that included important sections of the state, such as a sizeable part of [[San Francisco]]. When his claims were recognized by the land commissioners, the U.S. government appealed. Meanwhile, Black corresponded with a person named Auguste Jouan, who stated that Limantour's claims were invalid, and that he, under Limantour's employ, forged the date listed on one of the approved grants. Black needed an individual loyal to the Democratic Party and to the Buchanan administration, who could faithfully represent the administration's interests in California; he chose Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=74}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=67\u201368}}\n\nEllen Stanton loathed the idea. In California Edwin would be thousands of miles away from her for what was sure to be months, leaving her lonely in Washington, where she had few friends. Moreover, on May 9, 1857 Ellen had a daughter whom the Stantons name Eleanor Adams. After the girl's delivery, Ellen fell ill, which frightened Edwin and delayed his decision to go to California. In October 1857 Stanton finally agreed to represent the Buchanan administration's interests in California. Having agreed to a compensation of $25,000, Stanton set sail from [[New York City|New York]] on February 19, 1858 aboard the ''[[Star of the West]]'', along with his son Eddie, James Buchanan, Jr., the President's nephew, and Lieutenant H. N. Harrison, who was assigned to Stanton's detail by the Navy.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=75}} After a tempestuous voyage, the company docked in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], where slavery was disallowed. On the island, the climate pleased Stanton greatly, and at a church there, Stanton was surprised to see blacks and whites sitting together. Afterwards, Stanton and his entourage landed in [[Panama]], and left there on a ship three times larger than the one on which they came, the ''Sonora''. On March 19 the company finally docked in San Francisco, and bunkered at the International Hotel.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=76}}\n\nStanton took to his work with haste. In aid of his case Stanton, along with his entire party and two clerks, went about arranging disordered records from California's time under Mexico. The \"Jemino Index\" that he uncovered gave information on land grants up to 1844, and with the assistance of a Congressional act, Stanton unearthed records from all over the state pertaining to Mexican grants.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=77}} Stanton and company worked for months sorting the land archives; meanwhile, Stanton's arrival in California produced gossip and scorn from locals, especially from those whose land claims would be in jeopardy should Stanton's work prove victorious.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=77\u201378}} Further, President Buchanan and Senator Douglas were wrestling for control of California, and Stanton was caught in the crosshairs, resulting in a defamatory campaign against Stanton by Douglas' supporters.

He had accrued a preponderance of ostensibly sound evidence, such as witness testimony, grants signed by [[Manuel Micheltorena]], the Mexican governor of California prior to cessation, and paper with a special Mexican government stamp. However, Auguste Jouan's information was instrumental in Stanton's case. According to Jouan, Limantour had received dozens of blank documents signed by Governor Micheltorena, which Limantour could fill in as he willed. Further, Jouan had bore a hole in one of the papers to erase something, a hole that was still present in the document. Stanton also acquired letters that explicitly laid out the fraud, and stamps used by customs officials, one authentic and the other fraudulent. The fraudulent one had been used eleven times, all on Limantour's documents. When Stanton sent to the Minister of the Exterior in Mexico City, they could not locate records corroborating Limantour's grants. In late 1858 Limantour's claims were denied by the land commission, and he was arrested on perjury charges.

On Sunday, February 27, 1859, Sickles confronted Key in [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]], declaring, \"Key, you scoundrel, you have dishonored my home; you must die\", then shot Key to death.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=73}} Sickles then went to the home of Attorney General Black and admitted his crime.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=83}} The subsequent Thursday he was charged with murder by a [[grand jury]]. The Sickles affair gained nationwide media attention for both its scandalous nature and its proximity to the White House. Soon, the press speculated that Daniel Sickles' political esteem was on the account of an affair between his wife and President Buchanan. Prominent criminal lawyer [[James T.

The prosecution wanted to advance the theory that Sickles had also committed adultery and did not pay very much mind to his wife or her activities. When the judge disallowed this, the prosecution opted instead to highlight the heinous nature of Sickles' murder, and not address his reasons for doing the crime. Sickles' defense countered that Sickles had suffered from a temporary bout of insanity, the first such instance of an [[insanity plea]] in American jurisprudence. The events in the courtroom during the trial were nothing if not dramatic. When Stanton delivered closing arguments, stating that marriage is sacred and that a man should have the right to defend his marriage against those who chose to defile the purity of the sacrament, the courtroom erupted in cheers. A law student described Stanton's argument during the trial, \"a typical piece of Victorian rhetoric, an ingenious thesaurus of aphorisms on the sanctity of the family.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=84}} The jury in the case deliberated for just over an hour before declaring Sickles not guilty.

[[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's inauguration]] did give Stanton a flickering of hope that his efforts to keep Fort Sumter defended would not be in vain, and that Southern aggression would be met with force in the North.

Lincoln wanted to bolster Northern numbers afterwards, with many in the North believing the war would be more arduous than they initially expected, but when more than 250,000 men signed up, the federal government did not have enough supplies for them. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] had states buy the supplies, assuring them that they would be reimbursed. This led to states selling the federal government items that were usually damaged or worthless at very high prices.

Lincoln wanted the portions containing calls to arm the slaves removed, and ordered the transmission of Cameron's report be stopped and replaced with an altered version. Congress received the version without the call to arm slaves, while the press received a version with it. When newspapers published the document in its entirety, Lincoln was excoriated by Republicans, who thought him weak on the issue of slavery, and disliked that he wanted the plea to arm slaves removed.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=134}}\n\nThe President resolved to dismiss Cameron when abolitionists in the North settled over the controversy. Cameron would not resign until he was sure of his successor, and that he could leave the cabinet without damaging his reputation. When a vacancy in the post of [[United States Ambassador to Russia|Minister to Russia]] presented itself, Cameron and Lincoln agreed that he would fill the post when he resigned.

Stanton met with Potter on his first day as secretary, and on the same day, dismissed four persons whom Potter deemed unsavory. This was well short of the fifty people Potter wanted gone from the department, but he was nonetheless pleased. Stanton also met with Senator [[Benjamin Wade]] and his [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]]. The committee was a necessary and fruitful ally; it had [[subpoena]] power, thus allowing it to acquire information Stanton could not, and could help Stanton remove War Department staffers. Wade and his committee were happy to find an ally in the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]], and met with Stanton often thereafter.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=148}} Stanton made a number of organizational changes within the department as well. He appointed John Tucker, an executive at the [[Philadelphia & Reading Railroad|Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]], and Peter H. Watson, his partner in the reaper case, to be his assistant secretaries,{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=119, 127}} and had the staff at the department expanded by over sixty employees.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=152}} Further, Stanton appealed to the Senate to cease appointments of military officials until he could review the more than 1,400 individuals up for promotion. Hitherto, military promotions were a [[spoils system]], where individuals favorable to the administration were given promotions, regardless of merit. This ceased under Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=164\u2013165}}{{#tag:ref|Stanton even tore up two written requests from [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] to promote an individual favorable to the Lincoln administration, and later lambasted her for making such a request.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=165}} He also refused to appoint Benjamin Tappan, Jr., his sister Oella's son, until Lincoln intervened.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=166}}|group=Note}}\n\nOn January 29 Stanton ordered that all contracts to manufacturers of military materials and supplies outside the United States be voided and replaced with contracts within the country, and that no such further contracts be made with foreign companies.

His efforts focused on the railroad system and the [[telegraph line]]s. Stanton worked with Senator Wade to push through Congress a bill that would codify the ability of the President and his administration to forcibly seize railroad and telegraph lines for their purposes. Railroad companies in the North were accommodating to the needs and desires of the federal government for the most part, and the law was rarely used.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=153}} Stanton also secured the government's use of telegraph. He relocated the military's telegraphing operations from McClellan's army headquarters to his department, a decision the general was none too pleased with. The relocation gave Stanton closer control over the military's communications operations, and he exploited this. Stanton forced all members of the press to work through Assistant Secretary Watson, where unwanted journalists would be disallowed access to official government correspondence. If a member of the press went elsewhere in the department, they would be charged with [[espionage]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nPrior to Stanton's incumbency as War Secretary, President Lincoln apportioned responsibility for the security of government against treachery and other unsavory activities to several members of his cabinet, mostly Secretary Seward, as he did not trust Attorney General Bates or Secretary Cameron. Under Secretary Stanton, the War Department would have consolidated responsibility for internal security. A lynchpin of Seward's strategy to maintain internal security was the use of [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrests and detentions]], and Stanton continued this practice. Democrats harshly criticized the use of arbitrary arrests, but Lincoln contended that it was his primary responsibility to maintain the integrity and security of the government, and that waiting until possible betrayers committed guilty acts would hurt the government.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=157}} At Stanton's behest, Seward continued the detention of only the most risky inmates, and released all others.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=158}}\n\n===General-in-Chief===\n[[File:Edwin Stanton, head-and-shoulders portrait.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Edwin Stanton]]\nLincoln eventually grew tired of McClellan's inaction, especially after his January 27, 1862 order to advance against the Confederates in the [[Eastern Theatre of the American Civil War|Eastern Theatre]] had provoked little military response from McClellan. On March 11, Lincoln relieved McClellan of his position as general-in-chief of the whole Union army\u2014leaving him in charge of only the Army of the Potomac\u2014and replaced him with Stanton. This created a bitter chasm in the relationship between Stanton and McClellan, and implored McClellan's supporters to claim that Stanton \"usurped\" the role of general-in-chief, and that a Secretary of War should be subordinate to military commanders.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=182\u2013183}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=140\u2013141}} Lincoln ignored such calls, leaving military power consolidated with himself and Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=185}}\n\nMeanwhile, McClellan was preparing for the first major military operation in the Eastern Theatre, the [[Peninsula Campaign]]. The Army of the Potomac began its movement to the [[Virginia Peninsula]] on March 17.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=187}} The first action of the campaign was at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]]. Lincoln wanted McClellan to attack the town outright, but McClellan's inspection of the Confederate defensive works there compelled him to [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)|lay siege]] to the town instead.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=188}} Washington politicians were angered at McClellan's choice to delay an attack. McClellan, however, requested reinforcements for his siege\u2014the 11,000 men in Maj. Gen. [[William B. Franklin]]'s division, of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]]'s corps. Stanton wanted Maj. Gen. McDowell's corps to stay together and march on to Richmond, but McClellan persisted, and Stanton eventually capitulated.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=189}}\n\nMcClellan's campaign lasted several months. However, after [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Robert E. Lee]] became the commander of local Confederate forces on June 1, he launched a series of offensives against the Army of the Potomac, which, by late June 1862, was just a few miles from the Confederate capital, Richmond.{{sfn|Salmon|2001|pp=60\u201367}} In addition, Stanton ordered McClellan to transfer one of his corps east to defend Washington.<ref name=enforcer />  McClellan and the Army of the Potomac were pushed back to [[Harrison's Landing]] in Virginia, where they were protected by Union gunboats.{{sfn|Sears|1992|p=355}} In Washington, Stanton was blamed for McClellan's defeat by the press and the public. On April 3 Stanton had suspended military recruiting efforts under the mistaken impression that McClellan's Peninsula Campaign would end the war. With McClellan retreating and the casualties from the campaign piling up, the need for more men rose significantly. Stanton restored recruiting operations on July 6, when McClellan's defeat on the Peninsula was firmly established, but the damage was done. The press, angered by Stanton's strict measures regarding journalistic correspondence, unleashed torrents of scorn on him, furthering the narrative that he was the only encumbrance to McClellan's victory.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=201\u2013202}}\n\nThe attacks hurt Stanton, and he considered resigning, but he remained in his position, at Lincoln's request.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=202}} As defeats piled up, Lincoln sought to give some order to the disparate divisions of Union forces in Virginia. He decided to consolidate the commands of  Maj. Gens. McDowell, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], and [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] into the [[Army of Virginia]], which was to be commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] who was brought east after success in the West.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=204\u2013205}} Lincoln was also convinced that the North's army needed reformation at the highest ranks; he and Stanton being the ''de facto'' commanders of Union forces had proved too much to bear, so Lincoln would need a skilled commander. He chose Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]]. Halleck arrived in Washington on July 22, and was confirmed as the general-in-chief of Union forces the following day.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=214}}\n<!--\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{further|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft/left}}\nLincoln's hesitance to emancipate slaves was demonstrated when he tried to veto the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]], which allowed for the seizure and use of land and slaves from disloyal citizens, and the emancipation of slaves captured by the Union Army. Before he could, Congress passed a resolution elucidating their purpose with the Act, which assuaged Lincoln, who signed it without contention. On July 22, 1862, Stanton argued fervently for hours that slaves should be freed and armed. That same day, Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was read for the first time. Nonetheless, Lincoln's apprehensiveness towards freeing and arming slaves continued for months.{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=184\u2013185}} This did not stop Stanton from issuing an order in late August to Brig.

The arguments over the issue were \"earnest and acrimonious\", according to Secretary Seward. Stanton's tireless persistence brought its first result on September 22, 1862, when Lincoln outlined, in the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, his intent to free all slaves in states that had failed to return to the Union by January 1, 1863. When New Year's Day 1863 came, not a single Confederate state had returned to the Union when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all slaves in the states that were in rebellion against the United States to be free.{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=187\u2013188}} Many credited Stanton with the President's change of heart.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=189}}\n-->\n\n===War rages on===\n\n[[File:Secretary of War Edwin Stanton LCCN2017659637.jpg|thumb|left|Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, 1862.

Lee scourged Union forces, routing them at Manassas Junction in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], this time, against Maj. Gen. Pope and his Army of Virginia. A number of people, including Maj. Gen. Halleck and Secretary Stanton, thought Lee would turn his attention to Washington. Instead, Lee began the [[Maryland Campaign]]. The campaign started with a [[Battle of Mile Hill|skirmish at Mile Hill]] on September 4, followed by a [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|major confrontation at Harpers Ferry]]. Lincoln, without consulting Stanton, perhaps knowing Stanton would object, merged Pope's Army of Virginia into McClellan's Army of the Potomac. With 90,000 men, McClellan launched his army into the bloody [[Battle of Antietam]], and emerged victorious, pushing the Army of Northern Virginia back into Virginia, and effectively ending Lee's Maryland offensive.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=222\u2013223}} McClellan's success at [[Antietam Creek]] emboldened him to demand that Lincoln and his government cease obstructing his plans, Halleck and Stanton be removed, and he be made general-in-chief of the Union Army. Meanwhile, he refused to move aggressively against Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, which was withdrawing towards Richmond. McClellan's unreasonable requests continued, as did his indolence, and Lincoln's patience with him soon grew thin.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=223\u2013224}} Lincoln dismissed him from leadership of the Army of the Potomac on November 5. Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] replaced McClellan days later.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=225}}\n\nBurnside, at Halleck's request, submitted a plan to create a ruse at [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper]] and [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]], while the brunt of his force took [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], then moved on to Richmond. Halleck's response was sent on November 14: \"The President has just assented to your plan.

Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] replaced Burnside on January 26, 1863. Stanton did not much care for Hooker, who had loudly denounced Lincoln's administration, and had been insubordinate while serving under Burnside. He would have preferred for Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] to head the army; Lincoln disregarded Stanton's opinion. As Thomas and Hyman tell it, Lincoln \"chose Hooker because that general had a reputation as a fighter and stood higher in popular esteem at that moment than any other eastern general.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=258}} Hooker spent considerable time strengthening the Army of the Potomac, especially regarding morale. Hooker's only major engagement with Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in early May 1863. Lee had [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] engage Hooker's [[rearguard]] in a precipitous [[flanking maneuver]]. Stonewall Jackson's maneuver was skilfully employed, resulting a Confederate victory when the fighting ended on May 6, leaving 17,000 Union casualties.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=270}}\n\nStanton's attempts to raise Northern spirits after the defeat were hampered by news that, under Hooker, the Army of the Potomac had become grossly undisciplined. Indeed, Hooker's headquarters were described as \"combination of barroom and brothel.\" Stanton petitioned for liquor and women to be forbidden in Hooker's camps.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=271}} Meanwhile, Lee was again pushing into the North. Lee's movements were wracking nerves in Washington by mid-June, more so when disturbing reports came from Hooker's subordinates, such as that of Brig. Gen. [[Marsena Patrick]]: \"[Hooker] acts like a man without a plan, & is entirely at a loss what to do, or how to match the enemy, or counteract his movements.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=272}} Furthermore, like McClellan, Hooker kept overestimating Lee's numbers, and said the Lincoln's administration did not have full confidence in him. Hooker resigned on June 27; Stanton and Lincoln decided that his replacement would be Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]], who was appointed the following day.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=273}}\n\nLee and Meade first clashed in the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] on July 1. News of a victory at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], and [[Retreat from Gettysburg|a great Confederate retreat]], came on July 4. Soon after, word came of Maj. Gen. Grant's victory at [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]]. Northerners were exultant. Stanton even gave a rare speech to a huge crowd outside of the War Department's headquarters.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=274}} The administration's celebrations soon ended, however, when Maj. Gen. Meade refused to launch an attack against Lee while the Army of Northern Virginia was stuck on the banks of the [[Potomac river]]. When Lee crossed the river untouched on July 14, Lincoln and Stanton were upset.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=274\u2013275}} Stanton affirmed in a letter to a friend that Meade would have his support unreservedly, but that \"since the world began no man ever missed so great an opportunity of serving his country as was lost by his neglecting to strike his adversary.\" Stanton knew, though, that Meade's reluctance came at the advice of his corps commanders, who formerly outranked him.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=275}}\n\nWhile action in the Eastern Theater wound down, action in the West heated up. After the two-day [[Battle of Chickamauga]] in late September, Maj. Gen. Rosecrans, the commander of the [[Army of the Cumberland]], was left trapped in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] and beset on all sides by Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]]'s forces. Rosecrans telegraphed Washington: \"We have met a serious disaster, extent not yet ascertained.\" The situation in Chattanooga was desperate. The North needed the town in its hands. According to journalist [[Charles Anderson Dana]], who had been Stanton's assistant secretary since March 1863,{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=267}} Rosecrans might only be able to fight for another 15\u201320 more days and that, without at least 20,000 to 25,000 more men, Chattanooga would be lost.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=285\u2013286}} Stanton organized the secret transportation of thousands of Union troops west by rail.<ref name=enforcer>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/lincolns-enforcer-1501877374|title=Lincoln's Enforcer|work=WSJ}}</ref>  Lincoln and Stanton agreed to make Maj. Gen. Grant the commander of almost all forces in the West, giving Grant the option to dismiss Rosecrans from command of the Army of the Cumberland and replace him with Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=291}} This Grant did. In late November, Grant, with good efforts from Thomas and Hooker, broke Gen. Bragg's siege at Chattanooga, while Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] failed to achieve his stated objective. Confederate Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]] attempted to [[Siege of Knoxville|besiege]] Maj. Gen. Burnside's army at [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], but Sherman moved east from Chattanooga, causing the Confederates to retreat.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=292}}\n\n===End of the war===\nGrant, having been promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] and made the general-in-chief of the Union Army, crossed the [[Rapidan River]] on May 4, 1864. The following day, his and Lee's armies clashed in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]]. The result was inconclusive, but Grant, unlike previous commanders, was loath to stop his onward push; \"there will be no turning back,\" he told Lincoln.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=300}} Grant again engaged Lee at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]], and again Union losses far exceeded those of the Confederates.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=301}} Several days later, Grant and Lee battled at [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], where Grant launched numerous assaults in an open field, incurring heavy losses. Nevertheless, Grant pushed on, secretly moving his army across the James River in a masterful display of engineering, but failed to take [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], the important rail junction south of Richmond. The Union army was forced to forego further attacks and began entrenching; so began the [[Siege of Petersburg]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=302\u2013303}} \"Long lines of parallel entrenchments curled south and east of Richmond as both armies dug in,\" say Thomas and Hyman. \"Grant stabbed at Lee's fortifications, always keeping the pressure on, and at the same time probed westward, feeling for the railroads that brought Lee's supplies.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=303}}\n\nIn the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]], Lincoln and his new [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Andrew Johnson]], emerged victorious against their Democratic opponents, George B. McClellan and [[George H. Pendleton]]. Republicans also won major congressional and gubernatorial victories in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and New York.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=330\u2013331}} Stanton played no small part in securing the victory. Several days prior to the election, he ordered soldiers from key states such as Illinois, Lincoln's home state, to be returned home to vote. \"The men who were doing the fighting had voted for more of it in order to make their efforts worth while,\" Thomas and Hyman state. Stanton also used his powers at the War Department to ensure that Republican voters were not harassed or threatened at the polls. Thomas and Hyman credit Stanton's troop [[furlough]] and other moves for much of the Republican success in the 1864 elections.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=333\u2013334}}\n\nOn March 3, 1865, the day before [[Second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's second inauguration]], Grant wired to Washington that Lee had sent representatives to him to sue for peace. Lincoln initially told Grant that he should get peace with the South by any means necessary. Stanton declared, however, that it is the president's duty to sue for peace; otherwise, the president is useless and little more than a figure-head. This engendered an immediate change of tone from the president. Stanton, at Lincoln's urging, told Grant that he was to \"have no conference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of Gen. Lee's army, or on some minor, and purely, military matter\". Further, Grant was not to \"decide, discuss, or confer upon any political questions. Such matters the President holds in his own hands; and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions\". Grant agreed.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=259}} Days later, Lincoln visited Grant at his siege headquarters (the Siege of Petersburg was still ongoing). Once Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]] had rejoined his army from the [[Shenandoah Valley]], Grant prepared to make his final push into Richmond.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=350}} On April 1, 1865, Sheridan defeated Lee's army in the [[Battle of Five Forks]], forcing a retreat from Petersburg. Stanton, who had stayed close to his telegraph for days, told his wife the following evening: \"Petersburg is evacuated and probably Richmond. Put out your flags.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=351}} Stanton was worried that President Lincoln, who had stayed around to watch Grant's push into Richmond, was in danger of being captured, and warned him. Lincoln disagreed, but was happy for Stanton's concern. The President wrote Stanton: \"It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think I will go there to-morrow.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=351}}\n\nNews of Richmond's fall, which came on April 3,{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=262}} touched off furious excitement throughout the North. \"The news spread fast, and people streaming from stores and offices speedily filled the thoroughfares. Cannons began firing, whistles tooted, horns blew, horsecars were forced to a standstill, the crowd yelled and cheered,\" say Thomas and Hyman.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=352}} Stanton was overjoyed. At his bidding, candles were put in the windows of each of the Department's properties, while bands played \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" Furthermore, the department's headquarters were adorned with [[American flag]]s, along with an image of a [[bald eagle]] holding in its talons a scroll with \"Richmond\" written on it.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=352}} The night Richmond fell, Stanton tearily gave an impromptu speech to the crowd outside the War Department.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=262}}\n\nLee and his army had slipped out of Richmond before its fall, though.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=352}} Grant marched west to stymie Lee's retreat, while Lincoln remained in Richmond. News of Grant's victories over the withdrawing Confederates lit up Washington's telegraphs. The Union Army was pressing on Lee's tail, and capturing thousands of Confederate prisoners of war. On April 9 Lee finally surrendered, ending the war.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=353}} On April 13, Stanton suspended [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] and recruiting, as well as the army's acquisition efforts.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=356}}\n\n===Lincoln assassinated===\n{{Main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}\nOn April 13, Lincoln invited Stanton, Grant and their wives to join him at [[Ford's Theatre]] the next evening. Lincoln had invited Stanton to go with him to the theatre several times, invitations Stanton routinely rejected. Further, neither Stanton's nor Grant's wives would go unless the other went. The Grants used a visit to their children in New Jersey as their excuse. Finally, Lincoln decided to go to the theatre with Major [[Henry Rathbone]] and his betrothed. Stanton retired home that night after visiting a bedridden Secretary Seward. He went to bed at about 10 pm. Soon after, he heard Ellen yell from downstairs: \"Mr. Seward is murdered!\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=396}} Stanton rushed downstairs. Upon hearing that Lincoln, too, might be dead, Stanton grew intensely animated. He wanted to leave immediately. He was cautioned: \"You mustn't go out ... As I came up to the house I saw a man behind the tree-box, but he ran away, and I did not follow him.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=396}} Stanton paid little mind to the man; he found a taxi and went to Seward's home.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=396}}\n\nAt his arrival, Stanton was told that Lincoln had in fact been attacked. Stanton ordered that the homes of all members of the cabinet and the Vice President be put under guard.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=396\u2013397}} Stanton pushed through a crowd at the Secretary's home to find an unconscious Seward being attended to by a doctor in a bloody third-floor room. Seward's son, [[Frederick W. Seward|Frederick]], was left paralyzed by the attack. Stanton and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Welles]], who had come to Seward's home moments before, decided to go to Ford's Theatre to see the President. The two secretaries went by carriage, accompanied by Quartermaster General Meigs and [[David K. Cartter]], a justice of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|District Court for the District of Columbia]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=397}}\n\n[[File:Lincoln on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|Abraham Lincoln lay on his deathbed at the [[Petersen House]] in Washington, surrounded by family, friends and government officials.]]\nStanton found Lincoln at the [[Petersen House]] across from the theatre. Lincoln lay on a bed diagonally, because of his height.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=397}} When he saw the dying President, several accounts say Stanton began to weep. However, William Marvel states in his book, ''Lincoln's Autocrat: The Life of Edwin Stanton'' that \"Stanton's emotional detachment and his domineering persona made him valuable that night, as others wallowed in anguish\".{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=370}} Thomas and Hyman also state: \"Always before, death close at hand had unsettled him close to the point of imbalance. Now he seemed calm, grim, decisive, in complete outward control of himself\".{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=401}} Andrew Johnson, about whom Stanton, and the country, knew little, was sworn in as President at 11 am on April 15, in the [[Raleigh Hotel (Washington D.C.)|Kirkwood Hotel]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=400}}; {{harvnb|Marvel|2015|p=370}}</ref> However, Stanton, who had planned to retire at the end of the war, \"was indeed in virtual control of the government\", say Thomas and Hyman. \"He had charge of the Army, Johnson was barely sworn in and vastly unsure of himself, and Congress was not in session.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=400\u2013401}}\n\nStanton ordered testimony taken from those who saw the attack. Witnesses blamed actor [[John Wilkes Booth]] for the assassination.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=397\u2013398}} Stanton put all soldiers in Washington on guard,{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=398}} and ordered a [[lockdown]] of the city.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=369}} Rail traffic to the south was to be halted, and fishing boats on the Potomac were not to come ashore.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=398}} Stanton also called Grant back to the capital from [[New Jersey]].{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=370}}\n\nOn April 15, Washington was, as journalist [[George A. Townsend]] said, \"full of Detective Police\". At Stanton's request, the [[New York Police Department]] joined the War Department's detectives' tireless search for Booth and any accomplices.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=400}} Stanton had the lower deck of the monitor [[USS Montauk (1862)|USS ''Montauk'']], which was placed near the [[Washington Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Steers|2001|p=209}} host several of the conspirators, [[Lewis Powell (conspirator)|Lewis Powell]], [[Michael O'Laughlen]], [[Edmund Spangler]], and [[George Atzerodt]]. The other plotters, except Booth and [[Mary Surratt]], were confined aboard the [[USS Saugus (1863)|USS ''Saugus'']]. The prisoners on both boats were bound by [[ball and chain]], with [[handcuffs]] attached to an iron rod. Stanton also ordered a bag placed over the captives' heads, with a hole in it to allow for eating and breathing.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=419}} Surratt was kept at [[Old Capitol Prison]], where she had been since her arrest.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=420}} Booth, the remaining culprit, had been shot at a barn in Virginia, and died soon after. Booth's body was put aboard the ''Montauk''. After an autopsy was performed, and Booth's identity confirmed beyond any doubt, he was buried in a \"secret, unmarked, and unhallowed grave\", on Stanton's orders. Stanton knew Booth would be lionized in the South, and thought he would not give anyone the opportunity.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=420\u2013421}} The conspirators went on to be tried and convicted. All but three were [[hanging|hanged]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=425\u2013434}}\n\n==Johnson administration (1865\u20141868)==\n\n===Sherman's truce===\n[[File:William-Tecumseh-Sherman.jpg|left|thumb|Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]]]\nLt. Gen. Grant, failing to find Stanton at the War Department, sent a note to his home by courier on the evening of April 21. The matter was urgent.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=405}} Maj. Gen. Sherman, who had established his army headquarters in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], had negotiated a peace deal with Confederate commander Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]], with the grace of [[Confederate States Secretary of War]] [[John C. Breckinridge]]. Sherman had been authorized to negotiate with the Southerners only in matters regarding the military, as Grant had been with Lee. Sherman explicitly acknowledged that his negotiations with Confederate leaders were to stay firmly in the realm of military policy, but flouted the limitations anyway. Sherman's deal contained, as expected, a termination of hostilities with the South, but also specified that Southern governments who had rebelled against the United States were to be recognized by the federal government once they swore allegiance to the United States. Further, the deal's terms provided for federal courts to be reinstated in rebellious states, as well as the restoration of property and voting rights to Southerners, and a blanket pardon for Southerners who had rebelled. The deal went even further, allowing Southern troops to place their weapons in the hands of their states' governments, which would effectively rearm the Southern states. Sherman's truce also allotted power to the Supreme Court to resolve jurisdictional disputes between state and local governments in the South, which was a political issue, and not a legal issue, making that a power the court did not constitutionally have.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=406}}\n\nThe courier arrived at Stanton's residence breathless, interrupting his dinner. When he heard the news, Stanton, \"in a state of high excitement\", rushed to the War Department. He sent for all members of the cabinet in the name of the President. Johnson's cabinet, along with Grant and [[Preston King (politician)|Preston King]], Johnson's advisor, convened at 8 pm that night. Word of Sherman's actions was met with unanimous condemnation by those present. President Johnson instructed Stanton to tell Sherman his deal had been rejected, and that \"hostilities should be immediately resumed after giving the Confederates the forty-eight hours' notice required to terminate the truce\". Grant would go to Raleigh at once to inform Sherman of Stanton's edict, as well as to assume command of troops in the South.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=407}}\n\nStanton took the matter to the press. In addition to publicizing the details of Sherman's deal, Stanton said Sherman intentionally flouted direct orders from both Lincoln and Johnson, listed nine reasons Sherman's deal had been categorically rejected. Further, Stanton accused Sherman of recklessly opening a path by which Jefferson Davis might flee the country with [[Bullion coin|specie]] Davis purportedly took with him after abandoning Richmond.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=408}} The latter claim was based in Sherman's removal of Maj. Gen. [[George Stoneman]]'s forces from the [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] railway\u2014Greensboro was the place to which Davis and other Confederate officials fled.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=407}} Stanton's words were damning. \"It amounted to a castigation of Sherman and virtually accused him of disloyalty\", say Thomas and Hyman. Moreover, Sherman being among the most respected generals in the country, Stanton's publication endangered his place in the administration.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=408}}\n\nHaving not seen Stanton's dispatch to the press, Sherman wrote Stanton a conciliatory letter, calling his agreement \"folly\" and saying that, though he still felt his deal with Johnston and Breckinridge was solid, it was not his place to contest his superior's decision and that he would follow orders.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=410\u2013411}} Meantime, Maj. Gen. Halleck, at Grant's request, communicated to several of Sherman's subordinates that they were to move their forces to North Carolina, regardless of what Sherman said. Halleck sent another dispatch to Sherman's generals telling them not to listen to Sherman's edicts at all. After Halleck's order, and reading Stanton's message to the press in a newspaper, Sherman's fury reached a dizzying, explosive tenor. Sherman thought Stanton had unjustifiably characterized him as a disloyal pariah. \"I respect [Stanton's] office but I cannot him personally, till he undoes the injustice of the past\", Sherman said to Grant.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=411}} Sherman's brother, Senator [[John Sherman]], wanted the general [[censured]] for his actions, but still treated fairly. Sherman himself, and [[Ellen Ewing Sherman|his wife's]] powerful family, the Ewings, wanted Stanton to publicly take back his statements. Stanton characteristically refused.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=412}}\n\nIn late May, there would be a [[Grand Review of the Armies]], where the Union Army would parade through the streets of Washington. Halleck offered the hospitality of his home to Sherman; the general bluntly refused. He informed Grant of his rejection, stating as well that he would only listen to orders from Stanton if they were explicitly sanctioned by the President as well. Sherman further stated that \"retraction or pusillanimous excusing\" would no longer cut it. The only thing acceptable to Sherman would be for Stanton to declare himself a \"common libeller\". \"I will treat Mr. Stanton with like scorn & contempt, unless you have reasons otherwise, for I regard my military career as ended, save and except so far as necessary to put my army into your hands.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=414\u2013415}}\n\nSherman made well on his promise. At the Grand Review, Sherman saluted the President and Grant, but slighted the secretary of war by walking past him without a [[handshake]], in full view of the public. Stanton gave no immediate response. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] wrote \"Stanton's face, never very expressive, remained immobile\".{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=416}} The affront touched off speculation that Stanton was about to resign. Stanton, too, considered leaving his post, but at the request of the President and numerous others, including people in the military, he kept on. In reparative efforts, Sherman's wife brought the Stantons flowers, and spent time at their home, but Sherman continued to harbor resentment toward Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=416\u2013417}}\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{CSS image crop|Image = JOHNSON, Andrew-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize = 325|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 270|oTop = 45|oLeft = 45|Location = left|Description = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] engraved portrait of Andrew Johnson as President}}\nThe war was done, and Stanton now bore the substantial task of reshaping the American military establishment such that it would be as capable an apparatus in peacetime as it had proven to be in wartime.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=436}} To this end, in the North, Stanton reorganized the army into two sections; one to handle \"training and ceremonial chores\", and another to quell the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the west, who were agitated and blusterous as a result of the war.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=436\u2013437}} In the South, a high priority was mending the power vacuum left in Southern states after the rebellion.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=438}} Stanton presented his military occupation proposal, which had been endorsed by Lincoln, to the President: two military governments would be established in Virginia and North Carolina, with provost marshals to enforce laws and establish order, tasks the marshals had proven most capable of in the weeks after the end of the war.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=357\u2013358, 438, 444\u2013445}}\n\nPresident Johnson had promised to his Cabinet in their first meeting on April 15 that he would uphold his predecessor's plans for [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], plans that the deceased President had discussed at length with Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=402}}{{#tag:ref|In his [[1863 State of the Union Address]], Lincoln declared that his Reconstruction plan had two major facets. Firstly, Lincoln would issue an impartial pardon to individuals in offense against the United States, excepting certain persons of high rank, if they agreed to swear acceptance of the government, Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, and all of the country's slave laws. Secondly, acceptance of any state back into the Union would hinge on whether ten percent of those who voted in that state in the 1860 elections swore allegiance to the United States. If this condition was met, the state could establish a government, and select delegates to send to a state constitutional convention, and he would recognize and protect the governments.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=307}}|group=Note}} On May 29, 1865 Johnson issued two proclamations; one appointed [[William Woods Holden]] as the interim governor of North Carolina, and another pardoned individuals involved in the rebellion, with a few exceptions, if they agreed to loyalty and acceptance of all laws and edicts regarding slavery.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=446}} Johnson also recognized [[Francis Harrison Pierpont]]'s government in Virginia, as well as the governments in [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Tennessee]], which were formed under Lincoln's [[ten percent plan]]. Further, Johnson offered the ten percent plan to several other Southern states.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=446\u2013447}}\n\nIn his [[1865 State of the Union Address|1865 message to Congress]], the Democratic Johnson contended that the only necessary proof of loyalty a state needed to show was ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. Republicans in Congress disagreed; Senator [[Charles Sumner]] and Representative [[Thaddeus Stevens]] thought [[black suffrage]] was vitally necessary to the nation's security and the continuing dominance of the Republican Party. Republicans used parliamentary procedures to ensure none of the Southern delegates, who were mostly former Confederate leaders, took a seat in Congress, and established a predominantly Republican joint committee to decide Reconstruction matters.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=452, 464}}\n\nConcerning Reconstruction, the President and Congress were deeply divided. Johnson, even when his amnesty policy had come under heavy criticism, had obdurately supported and continued it. Radical Republicans in Congress, however, came to prefer Stanton's military occupation proposal.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=465\u2013466}}; {{harvnb|Marvel|2015|pp=416\u2013417}}</ref> The President's support from moderate Republicans dwindled after the gruesome anti-Negro [[Memphis riots of 1866|riots in Memphis]] and [[New Orleans riot|New Orleans]].{{sfn|Marvel|1962|pp=405\u2013406}} The public seemed to be against Johnson as well. In the 1866 congressional elections, Republicans made sweeping gains on their Democratic rivals. In both the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1866|House]] and [[United States Senate elections, 1866|Senate elections]], Republicans gained a two-thirds plurality of the seats.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=410}} In the new year, some Republicans sought to use their majority to oust Johnson. They presented the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Bill]], written with Stanton in mind.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=412}} The President had long considered dismissing Stanton and replacing him with Maj. Gen. Sherman; the Tenure of Office Bill would have made this illegal without the [[advice and consent]] of Congress, which was unlikely to be given for Stanton, who was firmly supported by and cooperating with [[Radical Republicans]]. When the bill reached the President's desk, he vetoed it. His veto was overridden the same day.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=413\u2013418}}\n\nWith the protection offered by the Tenure of Office Act, Stanton's opposition to Johnson became more open.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=416\u2013418}} In the following months, Johnson grew increasingly exasperated with his War Secretary.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=418\u2013426}} Johnson told Grant he intended to remove Stanton, and give him the War Secretaryship. Grant opposed the idea. He argued for Stanton's retention and stated that the Tenure of Office Act protected Stanton. Further, Grant said, should the tenure law prove impotent, public opinion would turn further against the administration. Seward, who still respected Stanton greatly, also disagreed with his removal.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=548}} The two men's words made Johnson teeter in uncertainty; however, his will was stiffened with the support from Secretary Welles and Salmon Chase, now the Supreme Court's Chief Justice\u2014the former previously described Stanton as \"selfish, insincere, a dissembler, and treacherous\", and the latter having dissolved his friendship with Stanton in aid of his political aspirations.<ref>{{harvnb|Marvel|2015|p=403}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=548}}</ref> On August 12, 1867 Johnson sent a note to Stanton saying that he was suspended from his position as Secretary of War, and was to turn over the department's files and power to Grant.

Grant, fearing the Act's prescribed penalty of $10,000 in fines and five-years of prison, doubly so because of his high likelihood of being the Republican presidential nominee in the upcoming election, turned the office over immediately.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=433\u2013434}} Stanton returned to the War Department soon after in \"unusually fine spirits and chatting casually\", as newspapers reported.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=435}} His reemergence precipitated a tide of congratulatory writings and gestures, thanking him for his opposition to the greatly disliked Johnson. The President, meanwhile, again began searching for an agreeable person to take the helm at the War Department, but after a few weeks, he seemed to accept Stanton's reinstatement with resignation. He did try to diminish the power of Stanton's office, however, regularly disregarding it. However, with his ability to sign treasury warrants, and his backing by Congress, Stanton still held considerable power.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=436\u2013438}}\n\nJohnson became singularly focused on enacting Stanton's downfall. \"No longer able to bear the congressional insult of an enemy imposed on his Official family,\" Marvel says, \"Johnson began to ponder removing Stanton outright and replacing him with someone palatable enough to win Senate approval.\"{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=439}} Johnson sought [[Lorenzo Thomas]], the army's adjutant general, to replace Stanton, to which he agreed. On February 21, Johnson notified Congress that he was dismissing Stanton, and appointing Thomas as secretary ''[[ad interim]]''. Stanton, urged by Republican senators, refused to concede his post. That night, Republicans in the Senate, over Democratic resistance, pushed through a resolution declaring Stanton's removal illegal. In the House, a motion was presented to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] Johnson. On February 24 the motion was agreed to, and Johnson impeached, with a [[Party-line vote|party-line]] 126 yeas and 47 nays.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=439\u2013442}}\n\nJohnson's trial began in late March. With a predominantly Republican Senate, Johnson's impeachment seemed to many a foregone conclusion. However, throughout the process, several senators began showing hesitance to remove the President from office. Stanton, meanwhile, had remained barred in the War Department's headquarters for weeks, sneaking off once in a while to visit his home. When it seemed to Stanton that Johnson would not remove him forcefully from office, he began spending more time at home. Stanton watched closely as the trial, which he was convinced would end with Johnson's conviction, continued for several months. When it came time to vote, 35 voted to convict, 19 to acquit, falling one short of the 36-vote [[supermajority]] needed for a conviction. The remaining proceedings were delayed for several days for the [[1868 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. On May 26, after Johnson had been acquitted on all of the ten other charges, Stanton submitted his resignation to the President.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=444\u2013450}}\n\n==Later years and death==\n\n===Campaigning in 1868===\nAfter Johnson's acquittal and Stanton's resignation, Johnson's administration seized upon the narrative that those who wanted his impeachment were black-hearted, especially Stanton. However, Stanton left office with strong public and Republican support. In other matters, however, Stanton was in peril. His health was in a dire state, the product of his relentless efforts during and after the war, and his finances were greatly lacking. After his resignation, Stanton possessed only the remnants of his salary, and a $500 loan. Stanton rejected calls from his fellow Republicans that he run for the Senate, choosing instead to resume his law practice.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=614\u2013615}}\n\nStanton's law efforts stalled when he was called on in August 1868 by [[Robert C. Schenck]], the Republican candidate for one of Ohio's seats in the House of Representatives. Schneck's rival, Democrat [[Clement Vallandigham]], was well known among Republicans for his [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead politics]], and disliked by Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=616\u2013617}} Believing that Democratic victory at any level would imperil the results of the war, and nullify Republican efforts during the war, Stanton went on a tour of Ohio to campaign for Schenck, other Ohio Republicans and Grant, the Republican presidential nominee.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=619}} Meanwhile, Stanton's health continued to deteriorate. His physician warned him against making lengthy speeches as his asthma irritated him severely. Stanton's illness precipitated his return to Washington in early November. His feeble state was replaced by excitement when Republicans were victorious in the Schenck\u2013Vallandingham race, and the presidential election.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=621}}\n\n===Illness worsens===\nAfterwards, Stanton took to arguing a case in the Pennsylvania federal court involving disputed West Virginia lands, which were valued in the millions of dollars because of their coal and timber. By this time, Stanton's illness was painfully visible.{{#tag:ref|Indeed, the case judge remarked that he had expected \"an immense, burly, rough, and resistless man, full of health and power and ready for any emergency. Instead of my ideal, there came in, walking slowly and wearily, a feeble and exhausted invalid, whose death-like pallor shocked all beholders. His argument was delivered in low conversational style, but with wonderful clearness, directness, and completeness.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=622}}|group=Note}} He grew so sickly that papers related to the case had to be delivered to him at his home. The court ruled against Stanton's client, but Stanton won an appeal at the Supreme Court to have the case remanded back to the lower court. At Christmas time, Stanton was not able to travel down the stairway of his house, so the family celebrated in his room.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=622\u2013623}}\n\nMany speculated at the time that Grant, who had largely ignored Stanton for several months, was due to reward him for his campaigning efforts. Stanton stated, however, that should a position in Grant's administration be offered, he would reject it. Ohio congressman [[Samuel Shellabarger (congressman)|Samuel Shellabarger]] wrote: \"[Stanton] says he has not a great while to live & must devote that to his family...\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=624}} Early in the new year, Stanton was preparing provisions for his death. However, when spring arrived, Stanton's condition improved. When the rejuvenated Stanton appeared at a congressional enquiry, talks of Grant rewarding Stanton resumed.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=627}} Several thought Stanton a good fit for the esteemed role of ambassador to England; instead, Grant offered Stanton the United States diplomatic mission to Mexico, which he declined.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=627\u2013628}}\n\nStanton's health varied for much of 1869.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=627\u2013632}} In the later half of the year, Stanton decided that he would lobby Grant for a position on the United States Supreme Court after hearing of Justice [[Robert Cooper Grier]]'s intention to retire. Stanton used Grant's close friend, Bishop [[Matthew Simpson]], as his proxy to convince Grant of his suitability for a place on the Supreme Court.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=634\u2013635}} Besides Simpson's efforts, numerous representatives and senators supported Stanton's nomination through a petition to Grant endorsing it. The nomination was made official on December 19, Stanton's 55th birthday, and confirmed shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=462}}\n\n===Death and funeral===\nOn the night of December 23 Stanton complained of pains in his head, neck and spine. His doctor, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[Joseph Barnes]], was called. As had happened on many nights before, Stanton's asthma had made breaths come with some difficulty. Stanton's lungs and heart felt constricted, which kept Stanton's wife and children, as well as Barnes, by his bedside.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=638}}; {{harvnb|Marvel|2015|p=462}}</ref> Stanton's condition began to improve at midnight, until he began, as Marvin states, \"[gasping] so strenuously for air that someone ran for the pastor of the Church of the Epiphany, and soon after he arrived Stanton lost consciousness.\"{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=462}} At about 3 am, Barnes checked Stanton's pulse and breathing but felt nothing. Stanton died on \nDecember 24, 1869, at the age of 55.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=462}}\n\nStanton's body was placed in a black, linen-inlaid coffin in his second-story bedroom.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=462\u2013463}} President Grant had wanted a [[state funeral]], but Ellen Stanton wanted as simple an affair as could be had. Nonetheless, Grant ordered all public offices closed, and federal buildings draped in \"raiments of sorrow\". Flags in several major cities were lowered to [[half-staff]], and [[gun salute]]s sounded at army installations around the country.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=639\u2013640}} On December 27, his body was carried by artillerymen to his home's parlor. President Grant, Vice President [[Schuyler Colfax]], the Cabinet, the entire Supreme Court, senators, representatives, army officers and other important officials all attended Stanton's funeral. After the [[eulogy]], Stanton's casket was placed atop a [[Limbers and caissons|caisson]], and drawn by four horses to Washington D.C.'s [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] at the head of a mile-long cavalcade.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=463}}\n\nStanton was interred beside the grave of his son James Hutchinson Stanton, who had died in infancy several years earlier. An assortment of Cabinet officials, generals, justices and senators carried Stanton's coffin to its final resting place. One of Stanton's professors from Kenyon College performed a service at the graveyard, and a [[three-volley salute]] was issued, ending the ceremony.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=640}}\n\n==Stanton on U.S. postage==\n[[File:Stanton 1871-7c.jpg|thumb|upright|The 1st Stanton postage stamp, issue of 1871]]\nEdwin Stanton was the second American other than a U.S. President to appear on a U.S. postage issue, the first being [[Benjamin Franklin]], who appeared on a stamp in 1847.

The bills are called \"treasury notes\" or \"coin notes\" and are widely collected today. These rare notes are considered by many to be among the finest examples of detailed engraving ever to appear on banknotes. The $1 Stanton \"fancyback\" note of 1890, with an estimated 900\u20131,300 in existence relative to the millions printed, ranks as number 83 in the \"100 Greatest American Currency Notes\" compiled by Bowers and Sundman (2006). Stanton also appears on the fourth issue of [[Fractional currency]], in the amount of 50 cents. [[Stanton Park]], four blocks from the [[United States Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., is named for him, as is [[Stanton College Preparatory School]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].\n\nA steam engine, built in 1862, was named the \"E. M. Stanton\" in honor of the new Secretary of War. [[Stanton County, Nebraska]], is named for him. Stanton Middle School in [[Hammondsville, Ohio]], is named after him. A neighborhood in Pittsburgh is named for him (Stanton Heights) as well as its main thoroughfare (Stanton Avenue). [[Stanton Park]] and [[Fort Stanton (Washington, D.C.)|Fort Stanton]] in Washington, D.C., were named for him, as was Edwin Stanton Elementary School in Philadelphia. Edwin L. Stanton Elementary School in Washington, DC was named for his son who served as the Secretary of the District of Columbia.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|section|date=October 2019}} \n\nStanton appears in the 1905 Thomas Dixon novel ''[[The Clansman]]''.  The book depicts Stanton's actions between war's end and Johnson's impeachment, and the role he played in Reconstruction policies.  This book was adapted into the film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', though Stanton does not feature prominently in the movie.\n\nIn the 1930s, a book written by Otto Eisenschiml accused Stanton of arranging the assassination of Lincoln.

Johnson's attempt to dismiss Stanton ultimately led to [[impeachment of Andrew Johnson|Johnson being impeached]] by the [[Radical Republicans]] in the House of Representatives.

In 1774, Stanton's grandfather, Benjamin Stanton, married Abigail Macy. Benjamin died in 1800. That year, Benjamin's widow moved to the [[Northwest Territory]], accompanied by much of her family. Soon, Ohio was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]],<ref name=\"Ohio-Admission\">{{cite web|title=The Admission of Ohio as a State|url=http://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1951-2000/The-admission-of-Ohio-as-a-state/|website=House.gov|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> and Macy proved to be one of the early developers of the new state. She bought a tract of land at [[Mount Pleasant, Ohio]] from the government and settled there.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|p=6}} One of her sons, David, became a physician in [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], and married Lucy Norman, the daughter of a Virginia [[Planter (American South)|planter]]. Their marriage was met with the ire of Ohio's Quaker community, as Lucy was a [[Methodist]],<ref name=\"Edwin M. Stanton2\">{{Ohio History Central|356|Edwin M.

Stanton's birthplace.jpg|thumb|left|Stanton's birthplace in Steubenville, Ohio]]\nThe first of David and Lucy Stanton's four children, Edwin McMasters, was born to them on December 19, 1814 in Steubenville, Ohio.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|pp=7}}  Edwin's early formal education consisted of a private school and a [[seminary]] behind the Stantons' residence, called \"Old Academy\".{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=6}} When he was ten, he was transferred to a school taught by a [[Presbyterian]] minister.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=22, 25}}{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=6}} It was also at ten that Edwin experienced his first [[asthma attack]], a malady that would haunt him for life, sometimes to the point of convulsion. His asthma assured him that he would be unable to partake in highly physical activities, so he found interest in books and poetry.  Edwin attended Methodist church services and Sunday school regularly. At the age of thirteen, Stanton become a full member of the Methodist church.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=23}}\n\nDavid Stanton's medical practice afforded him and his family a decent living. When David Stanton suddenly died in December 1827 at his residence,{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=23}} Edwin and family were left destitute.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|p=8}} Edwin's mother opened a store in the front room of their residence, selling the medical supplies her husband left her, along with books, [[stationery]] and [[groceries]].{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=23}} The youthful Edwin was removed from school, and worked at the store of a local bookseller.{{sfn|Allison|2009|p=9}}\n\nStanton began his college studies at the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]-affiliated [[Kenyon College]] in 1831. At Kenyon, Stanton was involved in the college's Philomathesian Literary Society. Stanton sat on several of the society's committees and often partook in its exercises and debates. Stanton was forced to leave Kenyon just at the end of his third semester for lack of finances. At Kenyon, his support of President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s actions during the 1832 [[Nullification Crisis]], a hotly debated topic among the Philomathesians, led him into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Further, Stanton's conversion to Episcopalianism and his revulsion of the practice of slavery were solidified there.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=12}} After Kenyon, Stanton worked as a bookseller in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Stanton had hoped to obtain enough money to complete his final year at Kenyon. However, a small salary at the bookstore dashed the notion. He soon returned to Steubenville to pursue studies in law.{{sfn|Gorham|1899|pp=17\u201318}}\n\n===Early career and first marriage===\nStanton studied law under the tutelage of Daniel Collier in preparation for the bar. He was admitted to practice in 1835, and began work at a prominent [[law firm]] in [[Cadiz, Ohio]] under Chauncey Dewey, a well-known attorney. The firm's trial work often fell to him.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=18}}\n\n[[File:Stanton's home in Cadiz.jpg|thumb|Stanton's home in [[Cadiz, Ohio]]]]\nAt the age of eighteen, Stanton met Mary Ann Lamson at Trinity Episcopal Church in Columbus, and they soon were [[engagement|engaged]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=14}} After buying a home in Cadiz, Stanton went to Columbus where his betrothed was. Stanton and Lamson had wished to be married at Trinity Episcopal, but Stanton's illness rendered this idea moot. Instead, the ceremony was performed at the home of Trinity Episcopal's rector on December 31, 1836. Afterwards, Stanton went to Virginia where his mother and sisters were, and escorted the women back to Cadiz, where they would live with him and his wife.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nAfter his marriage, Stanton partnered with the lawyer and federal judge [[Benjamin Tappan]]. Stanton's sister also married Tappan's son. In Cadiz, Stanton was situated prominently in the local community. He worked with the town's anti-slavery society, and with a local newspaper, the ''Sentinel'', writing and editing articles there.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=21}} In 1837, Stanton was elected the [[prosecutor]] of [[Harrison County, Ohio|Harrison County]], on the Democratic ticket. Further, Stanton's increasing wealth allowed him to purchase a large tract of land in [[Washington County, Ohio|Washington County]], and several tracts in Cadiz.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=33}}{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=21}}\n\n==Rising attorney (1839\u20141860)==\n\n===Return to Steubenville===\n[[File:Stanton's home in Steubenville.jpg|thumb|left|Stanton's home on Third Street in Steubenville]]\nStanton's relationship with Benjamin Tappan expanded when Tappan was elected the [[United States Senator]] from [[United States Senator from Ohio|Ohio]] in 1838. Tappan asked Stanton to oversee his law operations, which were based in Steubenville. When his time as county prosecutor was finished, Stanton moved back to the town with his wife.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=21}}{{sfn|Gorham|1899|p=25}} Stanton's work in politics also expanded. He served as a delegate at the Democrats' [[1840 Democratic National Convention|1840 national convention]] in [[Baltimore]], and was featured prominently in [[Martin Van Buren]]'s campaign in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]], which Van Buren lost.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nIn Steubenville, the Stantons welcomed two children, a daughter in March 1840 whom they named Lucy Lamson, and a son they called Edwin Lamson in August 1842. Within months of Lucy's birth, she was stricken with an unknown illness. Stanton put aside his work and spent the summer at baby Lucy's bedside. She died in late 1841. Edwin, however, was healthy and active. The boy's birth refreshed the spirits in the Stanton household after baby Lucy's death.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=27\u201329}} However, grief would return once again to the Stanton household in 1844. Mary Stanton was left bedridden by a [[bilious fever]]. Her condition continued to worsen until she died in March 1844. Stanton's sorrow \"verged on insanity\", say historians [[Benjamin P. Thomas]] and [[Harold M. Hyman]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=33\u201335}} He had Mary's burial attire redone repeatedly, as he demanded she look just as she had when they were wed seven years prior. In the evenings, Stanton would emerge from his room with his eyes filled with tears and search the house frantically with a lamp, all the while asking, \"Where is Mary?\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=35}}\n\nStanton regrouped and began to focus on his cases by the summer. One such case was defending [[Caleb J. McNulty]], whom Stanton had previously labelled \"a glorious fellow\". McNulty, a Democrat, was dismissed from his [[clerk of the United States House of Representatives|clerkship of the United States House of Representatives]] by unanimous vote and charged with [[embezzlement]] when thousands of the House's money went missing. Democrats, fearing their party's disrepute, made clamorous cries for McNulty to be punished, and his conviction was viewed as a foregone conclusion. Stanton, at Tappan's request, came on as McNulty's defense. Stanton brought a motion to dismiss McNulty's indictment. He employed the use of numerous technicalities and, to the shock and applause of the courtroom, the motion was granted with all charges against McNulty dropped. As every detail of the affair was covered by newspapers around the country, Stanton's name was featured prominently nationwide.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=37}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=44}}\n\nAfter the McNulty scandal, Stanton and Tappan parted ways professionally. Stanton formed a partnership with one of his former students, [[George Wythe McCook]] of the \"[[Fighting McCooks]]\". At the beginning of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], men across the country hastened to enlist in the [[United States Army]], with McCook among them. Stanton might have enlisted as well, if not for his doctor's fears about his asthma. Instead, he focused on law. Stanton's practice was no longer only in Ohio, having expanded to Virginia and [[Pennsylvania]]. He concluded that Steubenville would no longer prove adequate as a headquarters, and thought [[Pittsburgh]] most appropriate for his new base. He was admitted to the bar there by late 1847.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=38\u201345}}\n\n===Attorney in Pittsburgh===\n[[File:Wheeling Suspension Bridge Lithograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|A lithograph of the [[Wheeling Suspension Bridge]]]]\nIn Pittsburgh, Stanton formed a partnership with a prominent retired judge, Charles Shaler, while maintaining his collaboration with McCook, who had remained in Steubenville after returning from service in the Mexican\u2013American War. While based in Pittsburgh, Stanton argued several high-profile suits. One such proceeding was ''State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company and others'' in the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The case concerned the [[Wheeling Suspension Bridge]], the [[List of largest suspension bridges|largest suspension bridge in the world]] at that time, and an important connector for the [[National Road]]. The bridge's center rose some {{convert|90|ft|spell=on|sp=us}} but proved to be a nuisance to passing ships with tall [[Funnel (ship)|smokestacks]]. With ships unable to clear the bridge, enormous amounts of traffic, trade and commerce would be redirected to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], which at the time was still part of Virginia. On August 16, 1849 he urged the Supreme Court to enjoin Wheeling and Belmont, as the bridge was obstructing traffic into Pennsylvania, and hindering trade and commerce. [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Robert Cooper Grier|R. C. Grier]] directed those who were aggrieved by the bridge's operations to go to a lower court, but left an avenue open for Stanton to file for an injunction in the Supreme Court, which he did.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=60\u201361}}{{#tag:ref|In his preparations for the case, Stanton was questioning sailors at Pittsburgh's docks when he fell into the [[Hold (ship)|hold]] of the cargo vessel ''Isaac Newton''.

''Wheeling and Belmont'' began on February 25, 1850, which was also when Stanton was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court.{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=56\u201357}} Wheeling and Belmont argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matters concerning the case; the justices disagreed.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=57}} The case proceeded, allowing Stanton to exhibit a dramatic stunt, which was widely reported on and demonstrated how the bridge was a hindrance\u2014he had the steamer ''Hibernia'' ram its {{convert|85|ft|spell=on|adj=on|sp=us}} smokestack into the bridge, which destroyed it and a piece of the ship itself.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=62}} May 1850 saw the case handed over to [[Reuben H. Walworth]], the former [[Chancellor of New York]], who returned a vivid opinion in February 1851 stating that the Wheeling Bridge was \"an unwarranted and unlawful obstruction to navigation, and that it must be either removed or raised so as to permit the free and usual passage of boats.\" The Supreme Court concurred; in May 1852, the court ordered in a 7\u20132 ruling that the bridge's height be increased to {{convert|111|ft|spell=on|sp=us}}. Wheeling and Belmont were unsatisfied with the ruling and asked Congress to act.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=57}} To Stanton's horror, a bill declaring the Wheeling bridge permissible became law on August 31, effectively overriding the Supreme Court's ruling and authority.

Manny'' and second marriage===\n[[File:Cyrus McCormick engraving.jpg|thumb|200px|An engraving of [[Cyrus H. McCormick]]]]\nA by-effect of Stanton's performance in ''Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont'' was that he was sought after for other prominent cases, such as the [[McCormick Reaper patent case]] of inventor [[Cyrus McCormick]]. In 1831, a young McCormick created a machine to harvest crops. The device was particularly useful in the burgeoning wheat fields of the Western United States. Demand for McCormick's invention grew rapidly, attracting fierce competition, especially from fellow inventor and businessman [[John Henry Manny]]. In 1854 McCormick and his two prominent lawyers, [[Reverdy Johnson]] and Edward M. Dickinson, filed suit against Manny claiming he had infringed on McCormick's patents. McCormick demanded an injunction on Manny's reaper. Manny was also defended by two esteemed lawyers, George Harding and Peter H. Watson. ''McCormick v. Manny'' was initially to be tried in [[Chicago]], and the two lawyers wanted another attorney local to the city to join their team; the recommended choice was [[Abraham Lincoln]]. When Watson met Lincoln in [[Springfield, Illinois]], he had a dim first impression of him, but after speaking with Lincoln, Watson saw that he might be a good choice. However, when the venue of the proceedings was transferred to Cincinnati rather than Chicago, and the necessity for Lincoln was negated, Harding and Watson went for their first choice, Edwin Stanton. Lincoln was not made aware that he had been replaced, and still appeared at the proceedings in Cincinnati with his arguments prepared.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodwin|2006|pp=173\u2013174}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=63}}</ref> Stanton's apprehension towards Lincoln was immediate and severe, and he did well to indicate to Lincoln that he wanted him to absent himself from the case.<!--\u2014in one instance, while Harding and Stanton were walking to the courthouse, Lincoln appeared, to both men's shock, and said that the three men should go to the court \"in a gang.\" Stanton pulled Harding aside and asked him why he brought \"that damned long-armed Ape\" with him, and stated that Lincoln was good for nothing.--> The case proceeded with Harding, Watson and Stanton and Manny's true defenders; Lincoln did not actively participate in the planning or arguing of the case, but kept in Cincinnati as a spectator.{{sfn|Goodwin|2006|p=174}}\n\nStanton's role in Manny's legal trio was as a researcher. Though he admitted that George Harding, an established [[patent lawyer]], was more adept at the scientific aspects of the case, Stanton worked to summarize the relevant jurisprudence and [[case law]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=65}} To win ''McCormick v. Manny'' for Manny, Stanton, Harding and Watson had to impress upon the court that McCormick had no claim to exclusivity in his reaper's use of a divider, a mechanism on the outer end of the cutter-bar which separated the grain. A harvesting machine would not have worked properly without a divider, and Manny's defense knew this. However, to assure a win, Watson opted to use duplicity\u2014he employed a [[model maker]] named William P. Woods to retrieve an older version of McCormick's reaper and alter it to be presented in court. Woods found a reaper in Virginia which was built in 1844, one year prior to McCormick's patent being granted. He had a blacksmith straighten the curved divider, knowing that the curved divider in Manny's reaper would not conflict with a straight one in McCormick's reaper. After using a salt and vinegar solution to add rust to where the blacksmith had worked to ensure the antiquity of the machine was undeniable, Woods sent the reaper to Cincinnati. Stanton was joyed when he examined the altered reaper, and knew the case was theirs. Arguments for the case began in September 1855. In March 1856, Justices [[John McLean]] and [[Thomas Drummond (judge)|Thomas Drummond]] delivered a ruling in favor of John Manny. McCormick appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and ''McCormick v. Manny'', was, all of a sudden, a political issue, and the matters concerning the case found their way to the floor of Congress.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=63\u201365}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=62\u201365}}\n\nWhile the Supreme Court and Congress brooded on the case, Stanton attended to some personal matters. In February 1856 Stanton became engaged to Ellen Hutchinson, a girl sixteen years Stanton's junior.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=69}} Stanton and Hutchinson met at a Pittsburgh church. She came from a prominent family in the city; her father was Lewis Hutchinson, a wealthy merchant and warehouseman and a descendant of [[Merriweather Lewis]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=68}} Despite the Hutchinson's mother's apprehensiveness that her 26-year-old daughter was marrying the 41-year-old Stanton, they were married on June 25, 1856 at Hutchinson's father's home. They honeymooned at [[Niagara Falls]], [[Montreal]], the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] and [[Nahant, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=69\u201370}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=66}} In his relationship to Hutchinson, Stanton reclaimed what he thought he had forever lost after the death of Mary, \"love of the abiding sort.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=70}} Stanton and Hutchinson moved to Washington after their marriage; part of this decision was rooted in Stanton's belief that he would see important work with the Supreme Court. They leased a home on C Street in Washington.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=70\u201371}}\n\n===Emergence in Washington===\n[[File:Stanton's home in Washington, D.C.PNG|left|thumb|Stanton's home in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nIn Pennsylvania, Stanton had become intimately acquainted with [[Jeremiah S. Black]], the chief judge in the state's [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania|supreme court]]. This friendship proved profitable for Stanton when in March 1857, the recently inaugurated fifteenth President, [[James Buchanan]], made Black his [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=70\u201371}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=67}} Black's accession to his new post was soon met with a land claims issue in California. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] that ended the Mexican\u2013American War and gave California to the United States, the United States agreed to recognize valid land grants by Mexican authorities. This was followed by the California Land Claims Act of 1851, which established a board to review claims to California lands. One such claim was made by [[Joseph Yves Limantour|Jos\u00e9 Y. Limantour]], a French-born merchant who asserted ownership of an assemblage of lands that included important sections of the state, such as a sizeable part of [[San Francisco]]. When his claims were recognized by the land commissioners, the U.S. government appealed. Meanwhile, Black corresponded with a person named Auguste Jouan, who stated that Limantour's claims were invalid, and that he, under Limantour's employ, forged the date listed on one of the approved grants. Black needed an individual loyal to the Democratic Party and to the Buchanan administration, who could faithfully represent the administration's interests in California; he chose Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=74}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=67\u201368}}\n\nEllen Stanton loathed the idea. In California Edwin would be thousands of miles away from her for what was sure to be months, leaving her lonely in Washington, where she had few friends. Moreover, on May 9, 1857 Ellen had a daughter whom the Stantons name Eleanor Adams. After the girl's delivery, Ellen fell ill, which frightened Edwin and delayed his decision to go to California. In October 1857 Stanton finally agreed to represent the Buchanan administration's interests in California. Having agreed to a compensation of $25,000, Stanton set sail from [[New York City|New York]] on February 19, 1858 aboard the ''[[Star of the West]]'', along with his son Eddie, James Buchanan, Jr., the President's nephew, and Lieutenant H. N. Harrison, who was assigned to Stanton's detail by the Navy.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=75}} After a tempestuous voyage, the company docked in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], where slavery was disallowed. On the island, the climate pleased Stanton greatly, and at a church there, Stanton was surprised to see blacks and whites sitting together. Afterwards, Stanton and his entourage landed in [[Panama]], and left there on a ship three times larger than the one on which they came, the ''Sonora''. On March 19 the company finally docked in San Francisco, and bunkered at the International Hotel.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=76}}\n\nStanton took to his work with haste. In aid of his case Stanton, along with his entire party and two clerks, went about arranging disordered records from California's time under Mexico. The \"Jemino Index\" that he uncovered gave information on land grants up to 1844, and with the assistance of a Congressional act, Stanton unearthed records from all over the state pertaining to Mexican grants.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=77}} Stanton and company worked for months sorting the land archives; meanwhile, Stanton's arrival in California produced gossip and scorn from locals, especially from those whose land claims would be in jeopardy should Stanton's work prove victorious.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=77\u201378}} Further, President Buchanan and Senator Douglas were wrestling for control of California, and Stanton was caught in the crosshairs, resulting in a defamatory campaign against Stanton by Douglas' supporters. The campaign disheartened Stanton, but barely distracted him.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=78}}\n\nLimantour had built up a speciously substantial case. He had accrued a preponderance of ostensibly sound evidence, such as witness testimony, grants signed by [[Manuel Micheltorena]], the Mexican governor of California prior to cessation, and paper with a special Mexican government stamp. However, Auguste Jouan's information was instrumental in Stanton's case. According to Jouan, Limantour had received dozens of blank documents signed by Governor Micheltorena, which Limantour could fill in as he willed. Further, Jouan had bore a hole in one of the papers to erase something, a hole that was still present in the document. Stanton also acquired letters that explicitly laid out the fraud, and stamps used by customs officials, one authentic and the other fraudulent. The fraudulent one had been used eleven times, all on Limantour's documents. When Stanton sent to the Minister of the Exterior in Mexico City, they could not locate records corroborating Limantour's grants. In late 1858 Limantour's claims were denied by the land commission, and he was arrested on perjury charges. He posted a $35,000 bail and left the country.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nAs 1858 drew to a close, and Stanton prepared to return home, Eddie became sick. Whenever Stanton made arrangements to leave California, his son's condition grew worse.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=81}} Edwin had written Ellen as often as he could as her anxiety and loneliness increased in Washington. She criticized him for leaving her in the town alone with young \"Ellie\".{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=78}} January 3, 1859 saw Stanton and company leave San Francisco.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=73}} He was home in early February. In the nation's capital Stanton advised President Buchanan on [[patronage]], and helped Attorney General Black extensively, even being mistaken as an Assistant Attorney General. Nonetheless Stanton's affairs in Washington paled in comparison to the excitement he had experienced on the other side of the country\u2014at least until he found himself defending a man who had become fodder for sensationalists and gossipers around the country.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=83}}\n\n===Daniel Sickles trial===\n[[File:Sickles homicide.jpg|thumb|A ''Harper's Weekly'' depiction of Sickles shooting Key]]\n[[Daniel Sickles]] was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from New York. He was married to [[Teresa Bagioli Sickles]], the daughter of composer [[Antonio Bagioli]]. Sickles' wife had begun an [[extramarital affair|affair]] with [[Philip Barton Key II|Philip Barton Key]], the [[United States Attorney for the District of Columbia]] and the son of [[Francis Scott Key]], writer of ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''. On Sunday, February 27, 1859, Sickles confronted Key in [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]], declaring, \"Key, you scoundrel, you have dishonored my home; you must die\", then shot Key to death.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=73}} Sickles then went to the home of Attorney General Black and admitted his crime.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=83}} The subsequent Thursday he was charged with murder by a [[grand jury]]. The Sickles affair gained nationwide media attention for both its scandalous nature and its proximity to the White House. Soon, the press speculated that Daniel Sickles' political esteem was on the account of an affair between his wife and President Buchanan. Prominent criminal lawyer [[James T. Brady]] and his partner, John Graham, came to Sickles' defense, and solicited Stanton to join their team.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=83}}\n\n[[File:HarpersMagazineSicklesTrial.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A depiction of the scene in the courtroom during Daniel Sickles' trial]]\nArguments for the trial began on April 4. The prosecution wanted to advance the theory that Sickles had also committed adultery and did not pay very much mind to his wife or her activities. When the judge disallowed this, the prosecution opted instead to highlight the heinous nature of Sickles' murder, and not address his reasons for doing the crime. Sickles' defense countered that Sickles had suffered from a temporary bout of insanity, the first such instance of an [[insanity plea]] in American jurisprudence. The events in the courtroom during the trial were nothing if not dramatic. When Stanton delivered closing arguments, stating that marriage is sacred and that a man should have the right to defend his marriage against those who chose to defile the purity of the sacrament, the courtroom erupted in cheers. A law student described Stanton's argument during the trial, \"a typical piece of Victorian rhetoric, an ingenious thesaurus of aphorisms on the sanctity of the family.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=84}} The jury in the case deliberated for just over an hour before declaring Sickles not guilty. The judge ordered that Sickles be released from his arrest. Outside the courthouse, Sickles, Stanton and company met a throng of individuals in adulation of the victory.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n==Early work in politics (1860\u20141862)==\n\n===In Buchanan's cabinet===\nIn late 1860 President Buchanan was formulating his yearly [[State of the Union]] address to Congress, and asked Attorney General Black to offer insight into the legality and constitutionality of secession. Black then asked Stanton for advice.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=88\u201389}} Stanton approved a strongly worded draft of Black's response to Buchanan, which denounced secession from the Union as illegal. Buchanan gave his address to Congress on December 3.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=89}} Meanwhile, Buchanan's cabinet were growing more discontent with his handling of secession, and several members deemed him too weak on the issue. On December 5 his [[Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Howell Cobb]] resigned. On December 9 [[U. S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Lewis Cass]], disgruntled over Buchanan's failure to defend the government's interests in the South, tendered his resignation. Black was nominated to replace Cass on December 12.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=90\u201391}} About a week later, Stanton, at the time in Cincinnati, was told to come to Washington at once, for he had been confirmed by the Senate as Buchanan's new Attorney General. He was sworn in on December 20.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=90\u201391}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=83}}\n\nStanton met a [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] in disarray over the issue of secession. Buchanan did not want to agitate the South any further, and sympathized with the South's cause.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=93}} On December 9 Buchanan had agreed with [[South Carolina|South Carolinian]] congressmen that the military installations in the state would not be reinforced unless force against them was perpetrated. However, on the day that Stanton assumed his position, [[Major (United States)|Maj.]] [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] moved his unit to [[Fort Sumter, South Carolina]], which the Southerners viewed as Buchanan reneging on his promise. South Carolina issued an [[ordinance of secession]] soon after, declaring itself independent of the United States.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=94}} The South Carolinians demanded that federal forces leave Charleston Harbor altogether; they threatened carnage if they did not get compliance.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=96}} The following day, Buchanan gave his cabinet a draft of his response to the South Carolinians. Secretaries Thompson and [[Philip Francis Thomas]], of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], thought the President's response too pugnacious; Stanton, Black and [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Joseph Holt]] thought it too placatory.

If he did such a thing, the two men, along with Postmaster General Holt, agreed that they would resign, delivering a crippling blow to the administration. Buchanan obliged them.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=100\u2013101}}{{#tag:ref|In years subsequent, and after a falling out between him and Stanton, Black said that it was he, and he alone, that authored the document and was responsible for Buchanan's decision.

[[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's inauguration]] did give Stanton a flickering of hope that his efforts to keep Fort Sumter defended would not be in vain, and that Southern aggression would be met with force in the North. In his inauguration speech, Lincoln did not say he would outlaw slavery throughout the nation, but he did say that he would not support secession in any form, and that any attempt to leave the Union was not lawful.

Northerners thought the battle would end the war, and defeat the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] decisively; however, the bloody encounter ended with the  [[Union Army]] retreating to Washington. Lincoln wanted to bolster Northern numbers afterwards, with many in the North believing the war would be more arduous than they initially expected, but when more than 250,000 men signed up, the federal government did not have enough supplies for them. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] had states buy the supplies, assuring them that they would be reimbursed. This led to states selling the federal government items that were usually damaged or worthless at very high prices. Nonetheless, the government bought them.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nSoon, [[Simon Cameron]], Lincoln's [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], was being accused of incompetently handling his department, and some wanted him to resign. Cameron sought out Stanton to advise him on legal matters concerning the War Department's acquisitions, among other things.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=126}} Calls for Cameron to resign grew louder when he endorsed a bombastic November 1861 speech given by [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[John Cochrane (general)|John Cochrane]] to his unit. \"[W]e should take the slave by the hand, placing a musket in it, and bid him in God's name strike for the liberty of the human race\", Cochrane said.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=115}} Cameron embraced Cochrane's sentiment that slaves should be armed, but it was met with repudiation in Lincoln's cabinet. [[Caleb B.

Lincoln wanted the portions containing calls to arm the slaves removed, and ordered the transmission of Cameron's report be stopped and replaced with an altered version. Congress received the version without the call to arm slaves, while the press received a version with it. When newspapers published the document in its entirety, Lincoln was excoriated by Republicans, who thought him weak on the issue of slavery, and disliked that he wanted the plea to arm slaves removed.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=134}}\n\nThe President resolved to dismiss Cameron when abolitionists in the North settled over the controversy. Cameron would not resign until he was sure of his successor, and that he could leave the cabinet without damaging his reputation. When a vacancy in the post of [[United States Ambassador to Russia|Minister to Russia]] presented itself, Cameron and Lincoln agreed that he would fill the post when he resigned. As for a successor, Lincoln thought Joseph Holt best for the job, but his Secretary of State, [[William H. Seward]], wanted Stanton to succeed Cameron.

The army's generals held the brunt of the operating authority in the military, while the President and the War Department interceded only in exceptional circumstances.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=143}} The department also had strained relations with Congress, especially Representative [[John Fox Potter]], head of the House's \"Committee on Loyalty of Federal employees\", which sought to root out Confederate sympathizers in the government. Potter had prodded Cameron to remove about fifty individuals he suspected of Confederate sympathies; Cameron had paid him no mind.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=147}}; {{harvnb|Flower|1905|p=119}}</ref>\n\nStanton was sworn in on January 20.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=119}} Immediately, he set about repairing the fractious relationship between Congress and the War Department. Stanton met with Potter on his first day as secretary, and on the same day, dismissed four persons whom Potter deemed unsavory. This was well short of the fifty people Potter wanted gone from the department, but he was nonetheless pleased. Stanton also met with Senator [[Benjamin Wade]] and his [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]]. The committee was a necessary and fruitful ally; it had [[subpoena]] power, thus allowing it to acquire information Stanton could not, and could help Stanton remove War Department staffers. Wade and his committee were happy to find an ally in the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]], and met with Stanton often thereafter.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=148}} Stanton made a number of organizational changes within the department as well. He appointed John Tucker, an executive at the [[Philadelphia & Reading Railroad|Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]], and Peter H. Watson, his partner in the reaper case, to be his assistant secretaries,{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=119, 127}} and had the staff at the department expanded by over sixty employees.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=152}} Further, Stanton appealed to the Senate to cease appointments of military officials until he could review the more than 1,400 individuals up for promotion. Hitherto, military promotions were a [[spoils system]], where individuals favorable to the administration were given promotions, regardless of merit. This ceased under Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=164\u2013165}}{{#tag:ref|Stanton even tore up two written requests from [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] to promote an individual favorable to the Lincoln administration, and later lambasted her for making such a request.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=165}} He also refused to appoint Benjamin Tappan, Jr., his sister Oella's son, until Lincoln intervened.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=166}}|group=Note}}\n\nOn January 29 Stanton ordered that all contracts to manufacturers of military materials and supplies outside the United States be voided and replaced with contracts within the country, and that no such further contracts be made with foreign companies. The order provoked apprehension in Lincoln's cabinet.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=127}} The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]] were searching for cause to recognize and support the Confederates, and Stanton's order may have given it to them.{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=118, 128}} Secretary of State Seward thought the order would \"complicate the foreign situation.\" Stanton persisted, and his January 29 order stood.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=128}}\n\nMeanwhile, Stanton worked to create an effective transportation and communication network across the North. His efforts focused on the railroad system and the [[telegraph line]]s. Stanton worked with Senator Wade to push through Congress a bill that would codify the ability of the President and his administration to forcibly seize railroad and telegraph lines for their purposes. Railroad companies in the North were accommodating to the needs and desires of the federal government for the most part, and the law was rarely used.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=153}} Stanton also secured the government's use of telegraph. He relocated the military's telegraphing operations from McClellan's army headquarters to his department, a decision the general was none too pleased with. The relocation gave Stanton closer control over the military's communications operations, and he exploited this. Stanton forced all members of the press to work through Assistant Secretary Watson, where unwanted journalists would be disallowed access to official government correspondence. If a member of the press went elsewhere in the department, they would be charged with [[espionage]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nPrior to Stanton's incumbency as War Secretary, President Lincoln apportioned responsibility for the security of government against treachery and other unsavory activities to several members of his cabinet, mostly Secretary Seward, as he did not trust Attorney General Bates or Secretary Cameron. Under Secretary Stanton, the War Department would have consolidated responsibility for internal security. A lynchpin of Seward's strategy to maintain internal security was the use of [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrests and detentions]], and Stanton continued this practice. Democrats harshly criticized the use of arbitrary arrests, but Lincoln contended that it was his primary responsibility to maintain the integrity and security of the government, and that waiting until possible betrayers committed guilty acts would hurt the government.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=157}} At Stanton's behest, Seward continued the detention of only the most risky inmates, and released all others.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=158}}\n\n===General-in-Chief===\n[[File:Edwin Stanton, head-and-shoulders portrait.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Edwin Stanton]]\nLincoln eventually grew tired of McClellan's inaction, especially after his January 27, 1862 order to advance against the Confederates in the [[Eastern Theatre of the American Civil War|Eastern Theatre]] had provoked little military response from McClellan. On March 11, Lincoln relieved McClellan of his position as general-in-chief of the whole Union army\u2014leaving him in charge of only the Army of the Potomac\u2014and replaced him with Stanton. This created a bitter chasm in the relationship between Stanton and McClellan, and implored McClellan's supporters to claim that Stanton \"usurped\" the role of general-in-chief, and that a Secretary of War should be subordinate to military commanders.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=182\u2013183}}{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=140\u2013141}} Lincoln ignored such calls, leaving military power consolidated with himself and Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=185}}\n\nMeanwhile, McClellan was preparing for the first major military operation in the Eastern Theatre, the [[Peninsula Campaign]]. The Army of the Potomac began its movement to the [[Virginia Peninsula]] on March 17.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=187}} The first action of the campaign was at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]]. Lincoln wanted McClellan to attack the town outright, but McClellan's inspection of the Confederate defensive works there compelled him to [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)|lay siege]] to the town instead.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=188}} Washington politicians were angered at McClellan's choice to delay an attack. McClellan, however, requested reinforcements for his siege\u2014the 11,000 men in Maj. Gen. [[William B. Franklin]]'s division, of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]]'s corps. Stanton wanted Maj. Gen. McDowell's corps to stay together and march on to Richmond, but McClellan persisted, and Stanton eventually capitulated.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=189}}\n\nMcClellan's campaign lasted several months. However, after [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Robert E. Lee]] became the commander of local Confederate forces on June 1, he launched a series of offensives against the Army of the Potomac, which, by late June 1862, was just a few miles from the Confederate capital, Richmond.{{sfn|Salmon|2001|pp=60\u201367}} In addition, Stanton ordered McClellan to transfer one of his corps east to defend Washington.<ref name=enforcer />  McClellan and the Army of the Potomac were pushed back to [[Harrison's Landing]] in Virginia, where they were protected by Union gunboats.{{sfn|Sears|1992|p=355}} In Washington, Stanton was blamed for McClellan's defeat by the press and the public. On April 3 Stanton had suspended military recruiting efforts under the mistaken impression that McClellan's Peninsula Campaign would end the war. With McClellan retreating and the casualties from the campaign piling up, the need for more men rose significantly. Stanton restored recruiting operations on July 6, when McClellan's defeat on the Peninsula was firmly established, but the damage was done. The press, angered by Stanton's strict measures regarding journalistic correspondence, unleashed torrents of scorn on him, furthering the narrative that he was the only encumbrance to McClellan's victory.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=201\u2013202}}\n\nThe attacks hurt Stanton, and he considered resigning, but he remained in his position, at Lincoln's request.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=202}} As defeats piled up, Lincoln sought to give some order to the disparate divisions of Union forces in Virginia. He decided to consolidate the commands of  Maj. Gens. McDowell, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], and [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] into the [[Army of Virginia]], which was to be commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] who was brought east after success in the West.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=204\u2013205}} Lincoln was also convinced that the North's army needed reformation at the highest ranks; he and Stanton being the ''de facto'' commanders of Union forces had proved too much to bear, so Lincoln would need a skilled commander. He chose Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]]. Halleck arrived in Washington on July 22, and was confirmed as the general-in-chief of Union forces the following day.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=214}}\n<!--\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{further|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft/left}}\nLincoln's hesitance to emancipate slaves was demonstrated when he tried to veto the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]], which allowed for the seizure and use of land and slaves from disloyal citizens, and the emancipation of slaves captured by the Union Army. Before he could, Congress passed a resolution elucidating their purpose with the Act, which assuaged Lincoln, who signed it without contention. On July 22, 1862, Stanton argued fervently for hours that slaves should be freed and armed. That same day, Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was read for the first time. Nonetheless, Lincoln's apprehensiveness towards freeing and arming slaves continued for months.{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=184\u2013185}} This did not stop Stanton from issuing an order in late August to Brig. Gen. [[Rufus Saxton]], the head of the Negro troops corps, instructing him to use captured slaves as soldiers and laborers.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=186}}\n\nStanton became more and more restless as Lincoln delayed issuing the proclamation. The arguments over the issue were \"earnest and acrimonious\", according to Secretary Seward. Stanton's tireless persistence brought its first result on September 22, 1862, when Lincoln outlined, in the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, his intent to free all slaves in states that had failed to return to the Union by January 1, 1863. When New Year's Day 1863 came, not a single Confederate state had returned to the Union when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all slaves in the states that were in rebellion against the United States to be free.{{sfn|Flower|1905|pp=187\u2013188}} Many credited Stanton with the President's change of heart.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=189}}\n-->\n\n===War rages on===\n\n[[File:Secretary of War Edwin Stanton LCCN2017659637.jpg|thumb|left|Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, 1862. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, [[Library of Congress]]]]\n\nIn the final days of August 1862, Gen. Lee scourged Union forces, routing them at Manassas Junction in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], this time, against Maj. Gen. Pope and his Army of Virginia. A number of people, including Maj. Gen. Halleck and Secretary Stanton, thought Lee would turn his attention to Washington. Instead, Lee began the [[Maryland Campaign]]. The campaign started with a [[Battle of Mile Hill|skirmish at Mile Hill]] on September 4, followed by a [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|major confrontation at Harpers Ferry]]. Lincoln, without consulting Stanton, perhaps knowing Stanton would object, merged Pope's Army of Virginia into McClellan's Army of the Potomac. With 90,000 men, McClellan launched his army into the bloody [[Battle of Antietam]], and emerged victorious, pushing the Army of Northern Virginia back into Virginia, and effectively ending Lee's Maryland offensive.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=222\u2013223}} McClellan's success at [[Antietam Creek]] emboldened him to demand that Lincoln and his government cease obstructing his plans, Halleck and Stanton be removed, and he be made general-in-chief of the Union Army. Meanwhile, he refused to move aggressively against Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, which was withdrawing towards Richmond. McClellan's unreasonable requests continued, as did his indolence, and Lincoln's patience with him soon grew thin.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=223\u2013224}} Lincoln dismissed him from leadership of the Army of the Potomac on November 5. Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] replaced McClellan days later.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=225}}\n\nBurnside, at Halleck's request, submitted a plan to create a ruse at [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper]] and [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]], while the brunt of his force took [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], then moved on to Richmond. Halleck's response was sent on November 14: \"The President has just assented to your plan. He thinks that it will succeed, if you move rapidly; otherwise not.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=251}} The following [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] was a disaster, and the Army of the Potomac was handily defeated.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=253}}\n\nMaj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] replaced Burnside on January 26, 1863. Stanton did not much care for Hooker, who had loudly denounced Lincoln's administration, and had been insubordinate while serving under Burnside. He would have preferred for Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] to head the army; Lincoln disregarded Stanton's opinion. As Thomas and Hyman tell it, Lincoln \"chose Hooker because that general had a reputation as a fighter and stood higher in popular esteem at that moment than any other eastern general.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=258}} Hooker spent considerable time strengthening the Army of the Potomac, especially regarding morale. Hooker's only major engagement with Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in early May 1863. Lee had [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] engage Hooker's [[rearguard]] in a precipitous [[flanking maneuver]]. Stonewall Jackson's maneuver was skilfully employed, resulting a Confederate victory when the fighting ended on May 6, leaving 17,000 Union casualties.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=270}}\n\nStanton's attempts to raise Northern spirits after the defeat were hampered by news that, under Hooker, the Army of the Potomac had become grossly undisciplined. Indeed, Hooker's headquarters were described as \"combination of barroom and brothel.\" Stanton petitioned for liquor and women to be forbidden in Hooker's camps.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=271}} Meanwhile, Lee was again pushing into the North. Lee's movements were wracking nerves in Washington by mid-June, more so when disturbing reports came from Hooker's subordinates, such as that of Brig. Gen. [[Marsena Patrick]]: \"[Hooker] acts like a man without a plan, & is entirely at a loss what to do, or how to match the enemy, or counteract his movements.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=272}} Furthermore, like McClellan, Hooker kept overestimating Lee's numbers, and said the Lincoln's administration did not have full confidence in him. Hooker resigned on June 27; Stanton and Lincoln decided that his replacement would be Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]], who was appointed the following day.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=273}}\n\nLee and Meade first clashed in the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] on July 1. News of a victory at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], and [[Retreat from Gettysburg|a great Confederate retreat]], came on July 4. Soon after, word came of Maj. Gen. Grant's victory at [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]]. Northerners were exultant. Stanton even gave a rare speech to a huge crowd outside of the War Department's headquarters.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=274}} The administration's celebrations soon ended, however, when Maj. Gen. Meade refused to launch an attack against Lee while the Army of Northern Virginia was stuck on the banks of the [[Potomac river]]. When Lee crossed the river untouched on July 14, Lincoln and Stanton were upset.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=274\u2013275}} Stanton affirmed in a letter to a friend that Meade would have his support unreservedly, but that \"since the world began no man ever missed so great an opportunity of serving his country as was lost by his neglecting to strike his adversary.\" Stanton knew, though, that Meade's reluctance came at the advice of his corps commanders, who formerly outranked him.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=275}}\n\nWhile action in the Eastern Theater wound down, action in the West heated up. After the two-day [[Battle of Chickamauga]] in late September, Maj. Gen. Rosecrans, the commander of the [[Army of the Cumberland]], was left trapped in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] and beset on all sides by Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]]'s forces. Rosecrans telegraphed Washington: \"We have met a serious disaster, extent not yet ascertained.\" The situation in Chattanooga was desperate. The North needed the town in its hands. According to journalist [[Charles Anderson Dana]], who had been Stanton's assistant secretary since March 1863,{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=267}} Rosecrans might only be able to fight for another 15\u201320 more days and that, without at least 20,000 to 25,000 more men, Chattanooga would be lost.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=285\u2013286}} Stanton organized the secret transportation of thousands of Union troops west by rail.<ref name=enforcer>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/lincolns-enforcer-1501877374|title=Lincoln's Enforcer|work=WSJ}}</ref>  Lincoln and Stanton agreed to make Maj.

[[George Henry Thomas]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=291}} This Grant did. In late November, Grant, with good efforts from Thomas and Hooker, broke Gen. Bragg's siege at Chattanooga, while Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] failed to achieve his stated objective. Confederate Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]] attempted to [[Siege of Knoxville|besiege]] Maj. Gen.

The following day, his and Lee's armies clashed in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]]. The result was inconclusive, but Grant, unlike previous commanders, was loath to stop his onward push; \"there will be no turning back,\" he told Lincoln.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=300}} Grant again engaged Lee at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]], and again Union losses far exceeded those of the Confederates.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=301}} Several days later, Grant and Lee battled at [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], where Grant launched numerous assaults in an open field, incurring heavy losses. Nevertheless, Grant pushed on, secretly moving his army across the James River in a masterful display of engineering, but failed to take [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], the important rail junction south of Richmond. The Union army was forced to forego further attacks and began entrenching; so began the [[Siege of Petersburg]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=302\u2013303}} \"Long lines of parallel entrenchments curled south and east of Richmond as both armies dug in,\" say Thomas and Hyman. \"Grant stabbed at Lee's fortifications, always keeping the pressure on, and at the same time probed westward, feeling for the railroads that brought Lee's supplies.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=303}}\n\nIn the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]], Lincoln and his new [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Andrew Johnson]], emerged victorious against their Democratic opponents, George B. McClellan and [[George H. Pendleton]]. Republicans also won major congressional and gubernatorial victories in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and New York.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=330\u2013331}} Stanton played no small part in securing the victory. Several days prior to the election, he ordered soldiers from key states such as Illinois, Lincoln's home state, to be returned home to vote. \"The men who were doing the fighting had voted for more of it in order to make their efforts worth while,\" Thomas and Hyman state. Stanton also used his powers at the War Department to ensure that Republican voters were not harassed or threatened at the polls. Thomas and Hyman credit Stanton's troop [[furlough]] and other moves for much of the Republican success in the 1864 elections.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=333\u2013334}}\n\nOn March 3, 1865, the day before [[Second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's second inauguration]], Grant wired to Washington that Lee had sent representatives to him to sue for peace. Lincoln initially told Grant that he should get peace with the South by any means necessary. Stanton declared, however, that it is the president's duty to sue for peace; otherwise, the president is useless and little more than a figure-head. This engendered an immediate change of tone from the president. Stanton, at Lincoln's urging, told Grant that he was to \"have no conference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of Gen. Lee's army, or on some minor, and purely, military matter\". Further, Grant was not to \"decide, discuss, or confer upon any political questions. Such matters the President holds in his own hands; and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions\". Grant agreed.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=259}} Days later, Lincoln visited Grant at his siege headquarters (the Siege of Petersburg was still ongoing). Once Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]] had rejoined his army from the [[Shenandoah Valley]], Grant prepared to make his final push into Richmond.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=350}} On April 1, 1865, Sheridan defeated Lee's army in the [[Battle of Five Forks]], forcing a retreat from Petersburg. Stanton, who had stayed close to his telegraph for days, told his wife the following evening: \"Petersburg is evacuated and probably Richmond. Put out your flags.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=351}} Stanton was worried that President Lincoln, who had stayed around to watch Grant's push into Richmond, was in danger of being captured, and warned him. Lincoln disagreed, but was happy for Stanton's concern. The President wrote Stanton: \"It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think I will go there to-morrow.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=351}}\n\nNews of Richmond's fall, which came on April 3,{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=262}} touched off furious excitement throughout the North. \"The news spread fast, and people streaming from stores and offices speedily filled the thoroughfares. Cannons began firing, whistles tooted, horns blew, horsecars were forced to a standstill, the crowd yelled and cheered,\" say Thomas and Hyman.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=352}} Stanton was overjoyed. At his bidding, candles were put in the windows of each of the Department's properties, while bands played \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" Furthermore, the department's headquarters were adorned with [[American flag]]s, along with an image of a [[bald eagle]] holding in its talons a scroll with \"Richmond\" written on it.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=352}} The night Richmond fell, Stanton tearily gave an impromptu speech to the crowd outside the War Department.{{sfn|Flower|1905|p=262}}\n\nLee and his army had slipped out of Richmond before its fall, though.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=352}} Grant marched west to stymie Lee's retreat, while Lincoln remained in Richmond. News of Grant's victories over the withdrawing Confederates lit up Washington's telegraphs. The Union Army was pressing on Lee's tail, and capturing thousands of Confederate prisoners of war. On April 9 Lee finally surrendered, ending the war.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=353}} On April 13, Stanton suspended [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] and recruiting, as well as the army's acquisition efforts.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=356}}\n\n===Lincoln assassinated===\n{{Main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}\nOn April 13, Lincoln invited Stanton, Grant and their wives to join him at [[Ford's Theatre]] the next evening. Lincoln had invited Stanton to go with him to the theatre several times, invitations Stanton routinely rejected. Further, neither Stanton's nor Grant's wives would go unless the other went. The Grants used a visit to their children in New Jersey as their excuse. Finally, Lincoln decided to go to the theatre with Major [[Henry Rathbone]] and his betrothed. Stanton retired home that night after visiting a bedridden Secretary Seward. He went to bed at about 10 pm. Soon after, he heard Ellen yell from downstairs: \"Mr. Seward is murdered!\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=396}} Stanton rushed downstairs. Upon hearing that Lincoln, too, might be dead, Stanton grew intensely animated. He wanted to leave immediately. He was cautioned: \"You mustn't go out ... As I came up to the house I saw a man behind the tree-box, but he ran away, and I did not follow him.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=396}} Stanton paid little mind to the man; he found a taxi and went to Seward's home.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=396}}\n\nAt his arrival, Stanton was told that Lincoln had in fact been attacked. Stanton ordered that the homes of all members of the cabinet and the Vice President be put under guard.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=396\u2013397}} Stanton pushed through a crowd at the Secretary's home to find an unconscious Seward being attended to by a doctor in a bloody third-floor room. Seward's son, [[Frederick W. Seward|Frederick]], was left paralyzed by the attack. Stanton and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Welles]], who had come to Seward's home moments before, decided to go to Ford's Theatre to see the President. The two secretaries went by carriage, accompanied by Quartermaster General Meigs and [[David K.

Lincoln lay on a bed diagonally, because of his height.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=397}} When he saw the dying President, several accounts say Stanton began to weep. However, William Marvel states in his book, ''Lincoln's Autocrat: The Life of Edwin Stanton'' that \"Stanton's emotional detachment and his domineering persona made him valuable that night, as others wallowed in anguish\".{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=370}} Thomas and Hyman also state: \"Always before, death close at hand had unsettled him close to the point of imbalance. Now he seemed calm, grim, decisive, in complete outward control of himself\".{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=401}} Andrew Johnson, about whom Stanton, and the country, knew little, was sworn in as President at 11 am on April 15, in the [[Raleigh Hotel (Washington D.C.)|Kirkwood Hotel]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=400}}; {{harvnb|Marvel|2015|p=370}}</ref> However, Stanton, who had planned to retire at the end of the war, \"was indeed in virtual control of the government\", say Thomas and Hyman. \"He had charge of the Army, Johnson was barely sworn in and vastly unsure of himself, and Congress was not in session.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=400\u2013401}}\n\nStanton ordered testimony taken from those who saw the attack. Witnesses blamed actor [[John Wilkes Booth]] for the assassination.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=397\u2013398}} Stanton put all soldiers in Washington on guard,{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=398}} and ordered a [[lockdown]] of the city.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=369}} Rail traffic to the south was to be halted, and fishing boats on the Potomac were not to come ashore.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=398}} Stanton also called Grant back to the capital from [[New Jersey]].{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=370}}\n\nOn April 15, Washington was, as journalist [[George A. Townsend]] said, \"full of Detective Police\". At Stanton's request, the [[New York Police Department]] joined the War Department's detectives' tireless search for Booth and any accomplices.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=400}} Stanton had the lower deck of the monitor [[USS Montauk (1862)|USS ''Montauk'']], which was placed near the [[Washington Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Steers|2001|p=209}} host several of the conspirators, [[Lewis Powell (conspirator)|Lewis Powell]], [[Michael O'Laughlen]], [[Edmund Spangler]], and [[George Atzerodt]]. The other plotters, except Booth and [[Mary Surratt]], were confined aboard the [[USS Saugus (1863)|USS ''Saugus'']]. The prisoners on both boats were bound by [[ball and chain]], with [[handcuffs]] attached to an iron rod. Stanton also ordered a bag placed over the captives' heads, with a hole in it to allow for eating and breathing.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=419}} Surratt was kept at [[Old Capitol Prison]], where she had been since her arrest.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=420}} Booth, the remaining culprit, had been shot at a barn in Virginia, and died soon after. Booth's body was put aboard the ''Montauk''. After an autopsy was performed, and Booth's identity confirmed beyond any doubt, he was buried in a \"secret, unmarked, and unhallowed grave\", on Stanton's orders. Stanton knew Booth would be lionized in the South, and thought he would not give anyone the opportunity.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=420\u2013421}} The conspirators went on to be tried and convicted. All but three were [[hanging|hanged]].{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=425\u2013434}}\n\n==Johnson administration (1865\u20141868)==\n\n===Sherman's truce===\n[[File:William-Tecumseh-Sherman.jpg|left|thumb|Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]]]\nLt. Gen. Grant, failing to find Stanton at the War Department, sent a note to his home by courier on the evening of April 21. The matter was urgent.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=405}} Maj. Gen. Sherman, who had established his army headquarters in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], had negotiated a peace deal with Confederate commander Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]], with the grace of [[Confederate States Secretary of War]] [[John C. Breckinridge]]. Sherman had been authorized to negotiate with the Southerners only in matters regarding the military, as Grant had been with Lee. Sherman explicitly acknowledged that his negotiations with Confederate leaders were to stay firmly in the realm of military policy, but flouted the limitations anyway. Sherman's deal contained, as expected, a termination of hostilities with the South, but also specified that Southern governments who had rebelled against the United States were to be recognized by the federal government once they swore allegiance to the United States. Further, the deal's terms provided for federal courts to be reinstated in rebellious states, as well as the restoration of property and voting rights to Southerners, and a blanket pardon for Southerners who had rebelled. The deal went even further, allowing Southern troops to place their weapons in the hands of their states' governments, which would effectively rearm the Southern states. Sherman's truce also allotted power to the Supreme Court to resolve jurisdictional disputes between state and local governments in the South, which was a political issue, and not a legal issue, making that a power the court did not constitutionally have.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=406}}\n\nThe courier arrived at Stanton's residence breathless, interrupting his dinner. When he heard the news, Stanton, \"in a state of high excitement\", rushed to the War Department. He sent for all members of the cabinet in the name of the President. Johnson's cabinet, along with Grant and [[Preston King (politician)|Preston King]], Johnson's advisor, convened at 8 pm that night. Word of Sherman's actions was met with unanimous condemnation by those present. President Johnson instructed Stanton to tell Sherman his deal had been rejected, and that \"hostilities should be immediately resumed after giving the Confederates the forty-eight hours' notice required to terminate the truce\". Grant would go to Raleigh at once to inform Sherman of Stanton's edict, as well as to assume command of troops in the South.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=407}}\n\nStanton took the matter to the press. In addition to publicizing the details of Sherman's deal, Stanton said Sherman intentionally flouted direct orders from both Lincoln and Johnson, listed nine reasons Sherman's deal had been categorically rejected. Further, Stanton accused Sherman of recklessly opening a path by which Jefferson Davis might flee the country with [[Bullion coin|specie]] Davis purportedly took with him after abandoning Richmond.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=408}} The latter claim was based in Sherman's removal of Maj. Gen. [[George Stoneman]]'s forces from the [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] railway\u2014Greensboro was the place to which Davis and other Confederate officials fled.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=407}} Stanton's words were damning. \"It amounted to a castigation of Sherman and virtually accused him of disloyalty\", say Thomas and Hyman. Moreover, Sherman being among the most respected generals in the country, Stanton's publication endangered his place in the administration.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=408}}\n\nHaving not seen Stanton's dispatch to the press, Sherman wrote Stanton a conciliatory letter, calling his agreement \"folly\" and saying that, though he still felt his deal with Johnston and Breckinridge was solid, it was not his place to contest his superior's decision and that he would follow orders.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=410\u2013411}} Meantime, Maj. Gen. Halleck, at Grant's request, communicated to several of Sherman's subordinates that they were to move their forces to North Carolina, regardless of what Sherman said. Halleck sent another dispatch to Sherman's generals telling them not to listen to Sherman's edicts at all. After Halleck's order, and reading Stanton's message to the press in a newspaper, Sherman's fury reached a dizzying, explosive tenor. Sherman thought Stanton had unjustifiably characterized him as a disloyal pariah. \"I respect [Stanton's] office but I cannot him personally, till he undoes the injustice of the past\", Sherman said to Grant.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=411}} Sherman's brother, Senator [[John Sherman]], wanted the general [[censured]] for his actions, but still treated fairly. Sherman himself, and [[Ellen Ewing Sherman|his wife's]] powerful family, the Ewings, wanted Stanton to publicly take back his statements. Stanton characteristically refused.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=412}}\n\nIn late May, there would be a [[Grand Review of the Armies]], where the Union Army would parade through the streets of Washington. Halleck offered the hospitality of his home to Sherman; the general bluntly refused. He informed Grant of his rejection, stating as well that he would only listen to orders from Stanton if they were explicitly sanctioned by the President as well. Sherman further stated that \"retraction or pusillanimous excusing\" would no longer cut it. The only thing acceptable to Sherman would be for Stanton to declare himself a \"common libeller\". \"I will treat Mr. Stanton with like scorn & contempt, unless you have reasons otherwise, for I regard my military career as ended, save and except so far as necessary to put my army into your hands.\"{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=414\u2013415}}\n\nSherman made well on his promise. At the Grand Review, Sherman saluted the President and Grant, but slighted the secretary of war by walking past him without a [[handshake]], in full view of the public. Stanton gave no immediate response. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] wrote \"Stanton's face, never very expressive, remained immobile\".{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=416}} The affront touched off speculation that Stanton was about to resign. Stanton, too, considered leaving his post, but at the request of the President and numerous others, including people in the military, he kept on. In reparative efforts, Sherman's wife brought the Stantons flowers, and spent time at their home, but Sherman continued to harbor resentment toward Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=416\u2013417}}\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{CSS image crop|Image = JOHNSON, Andrew-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize = 325|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 270|oTop = 45|oLeft = 45|Location = left|Description = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] engraved portrait of Andrew Johnson as President}}\nThe war was done, and Stanton now bore the substantial task of reshaping the American military establishment such that it would be as capable an apparatus in peacetime as it had proven to be in wartime.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=436}} To this end, in the North, Stanton reorganized the army into two sections; one to handle \"training and ceremonial chores\", and another to quell the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the west, who were agitated and blusterous as a result of the war.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=436\u2013437}} In the South, a high priority was mending the power vacuum left in Southern states after the rebellion.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=438}} Stanton presented his military occupation proposal, which had been endorsed by Lincoln, to the President: two military governments would be established in Virginia and North Carolina, with provost marshals to enforce laws and establish order, tasks the marshals had proven most capable of in the weeks after the end of the war.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=357\u2013358, 438, 444\u2013445}}\n\nPresident Johnson had promised to his Cabinet in their first meeting on April 15 that he would uphold his predecessor's plans for [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], plans that the deceased President had discussed at length with Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=402}}{{#tag:ref|In his [[1863 State of the Union Address]], Lincoln declared that his Reconstruction plan had two major facets. Firstly, Lincoln would issue an impartial pardon to individuals in offense against the United States, excepting certain persons of high rank, if they agreed to swear acceptance of the government, Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, and all of the country's slave laws. Secondly, acceptance of any state back into the Union would hinge on whether ten percent of those who voted in that state in the 1860 elections swore allegiance to the United States. If this condition was met, the state could establish a government, and select delegates to send to a state constitutional convention, and he would recognize and protect the governments.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=307}}|group=Note}} On May 29, 1865 Johnson issued two proclamations; one appointed [[William Woods Holden]] as the interim governor of North Carolina, and another pardoned individuals involved in the rebellion, with a few exceptions, if they agreed to loyalty and acceptance of all laws and edicts regarding slavery.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=446}} Johnson also recognized [[Francis Harrison Pierpont]]'s government in Virginia, as well as the governments in [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Tennessee]], which were formed under Lincoln's [[ten percent plan]].

Republicans in Congress disagreed; Senator [[Charles Sumner]] and Representative [[Thaddeus Stevens]] thought [[black suffrage]] was vitally necessary to the nation's security and the continuing dominance of the Republican Party. Republicans used parliamentary procedures to ensure none of the Southern delegates, who were mostly former Confederate leaders, took a seat in Congress, and established a predominantly Republican joint committee to decide Reconstruction matters.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=452, 464}}\n\nConcerning Reconstruction, the President and Congress were deeply divided. Johnson, even when his amnesty policy had come under heavy criticism, had obdurately supported and continued it. Radical Republicans in Congress, however, came to prefer Stanton's military occupation proposal.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=465\u2013466}}; {{harvnb|Marvel|2015|pp=416\u2013417}}</ref> The President's support from moderate Republicans dwindled after the gruesome anti-Negro [[Memphis riots of 1866|riots in Memphis]] and [[New Orleans riot|New Orleans]].{{sfn|Marvel|1962|pp=405\u2013406}} The public seemed to be against Johnson as well. In the 1866 congressional elections, Republicans made sweeping gains on their Democratic rivals. In both the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1866|House]] and [[United States Senate elections, 1866|Senate elections]], Republicans gained a two-thirds plurality of the seats.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=410}} In the new year, some Republicans sought to use their majority to oust Johnson. They presented the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Bill]], written with Stanton in mind.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=412}} The President had long considered dismissing Stanton and replacing him with Maj. Gen. Sherman; the Tenure of Office Bill would have made this illegal without the [[advice and consent]] of Congress, which was unlikely to be given for Stanton, who was firmly supported by and cooperating with [[Radical Republicans]]. When the bill reached the President's desk, he vetoed it. His veto was overridden the same day.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=413\u2013418}}\n\nWith the protection offered by the Tenure of Office Act, Stanton's opposition to Johnson became more open.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=416\u2013418}} In the following months, Johnson grew increasingly exasperated with his War Secretary.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=418\u2013426}} Johnson told Grant he intended to remove Stanton, and give him the War Secretaryship. Grant opposed the idea. He argued for Stanton's retention and stated that the Tenure of Office Act protected Stanton. Further, Grant said, should the tenure law prove impotent, public opinion would turn further against the administration. Seward, who still respected Stanton greatly, also disagreed with his removal.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=548}} The two men's words made Johnson teeter in uncertainty; however, his will was stiffened with the support from Secretary Welles and Salmon Chase, now the Supreme Court's Chief Justice\u2014the former previously described Stanton as \"selfish, insincere, a dissembler, and treacherous\", and the latter having dissolved his friendship with Stanton in aid of his political aspirations.<ref>{{harvnb|Marvel|2015|p=403}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=548}}</ref> On August 12, 1867 Johnson sent a note to Stanton saying that he was suspended from his position as Secretary of War, and was to turn over the department's files and power to Grant. Pursuant to the Tenure of Office Act, he also notified the Senate for its consideration. Stanton grudgingly, but with little resistance, complied.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=549\u2013551}}\n\n===Impeachment===\n{{Main|Impeachment of Andrew Johnson}}\n[[File:The situation.jpg|thumb|left|\"The Situation\", a ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' cartoon gives a humorous breakdown of \"the situation\".

Grant, fearing the Act's prescribed penalty of $10,000 in fines and five-years of prison, doubly so because of his high likelihood of being the Republican presidential nominee in the upcoming election, turned the office over immediately.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=433\u2013434}} Stanton returned to the War Department soon after in \"unusually fine spirits and chatting casually\", as newspapers reported.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=435}} His reemergence precipitated a tide of congratulatory writings and gestures, thanking him for his opposition to the greatly disliked Johnson. The President, meanwhile, again began searching for an agreeable person to take the helm at the War Department, but after a few weeks, he seemed to accept Stanton's reinstatement with resignation. He did try to diminish the power of Stanton's office, however, regularly disregarding it. However, with his ability to sign treasury warrants, and his backing by Congress, Stanton still held considerable power.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=436\u2013438}}\n\nJohnson became singularly focused on enacting Stanton's downfall. \"No longer able to bear the congressional insult of an enemy imposed on his Official family,\" Marvel says, \"Johnson began to ponder removing Stanton outright and replacing him with someone palatable enough to win Senate approval.\"{{sfn|Marvel|2015|p=439}} Johnson sought [[Lorenzo Thomas]], the army's adjutant general, to replace Stanton, to which he agreed. On February 21, Johnson notified Congress that he was dismissing Stanton, and appointing Thomas as secretary ''[[ad interim]]''. Stanton, urged by Republican senators, refused to concede his post. That night, Republicans in the Senate, over Democratic resistance, pushed through a resolution declaring Stanton's removal illegal. In the House, a motion was presented to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] Johnson. On February 24 the motion was agreed to, and Johnson impeached, with a [[Party-line vote|party-line]] 126 yeas and 47 nays.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=439\u2013442}}\n\nJohnson's trial began in late March. With a predominantly Republican Senate, Johnson's impeachment seemed to many a foregone conclusion. However, throughout the process, several senators began showing hesitance to remove the President from office. Stanton, meanwhile, had remained barred in the War Department's headquarters for weeks, sneaking off once in a while to visit his home. When it seemed to Stanton that Johnson would not remove him forcefully from office, he began spending more time at home. Stanton watched closely as the trial, which he was convinced would end with Johnson's conviction, continued for several months. When it came time to vote, 35 voted to convict, 19 to acquit, falling one short of the 36-vote [[supermajority]] needed for a conviction. The remaining proceedings were delayed for several days for the [[1868 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. On May 26, after Johnson had been acquitted on all of the ten other charges, Stanton submitted his resignation to the President.{{sfn|Marvel|2015|pp=444\u2013450}}\n\n==Later years and death==\n\n===Campaigning in 1868===\nAfter Johnson's acquittal and Stanton's resignation, Johnson's administration seized upon the narrative that those who wanted his impeachment were black-hearted, especially Stanton. However, Stanton left office with strong public and Republican support. In other matters, however, Stanton was in peril. His health was in a dire state, the product of his relentless efforts during and after the war, and his finances were greatly lacking. After his resignation, Stanton possessed only the remnants of his salary, and a $500 loan. Stanton rejected calls from his fellow Republicans that he run for the Senate, choosing instead to resume his law practice.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=614\u2013615}}\n\nStanton's law efforts stalled when he was called on in August 1868 by [[Robert C. Schenck]], the Republican candidate for one of Ohio's seats in the House of Representatives. Schneck's rival, Democrat [[Clement Vallandigham]], was well known among Republicans for his [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead politics]], and disliked by Stanton.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=616\u2013617}} Believing that Democratic victory at any level would imperil the results of the war, and nullify Republican efforts during the war, Stanton went on a tour of Ohio to campaign for Schenck, other Ohio Republicans and Grant, the Republican presidential nominee.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=619}} Meanwhile, Stanton's health continued to deteriorate. His physician warned him against making lengthy speeches as his asthma irritated him severely. Stanton's illness precipitated his return to Washington in early November. His feeble state was replaced by excitement when Republicans were victorious in the Schenck\u2013Vallandingham race, and the presidential election.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|p=621}}\n\n===Illness worsens===\nAfterwards, Stanton took to arguing a case in the Pennsylvania federal court involving disputed West Virginia lands, which were valued in the millions of dollars because of their coal and timber. By this time, Stanton's illness was painfully visible.{{#tag:ref|Indeed, the case judge remarked that he had expected \"an immense, burly, rough, and resistless man, full of health and power and ready for any emergency.

The court ruled against Stanton's client, but Stanton won an appeal at the Supreme Court to have the case remanded back to the lower court. At Christmas time, Stanton was not able to travel down the stairway of his house, so the family celebrated in his room.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp=622\u2013623}}\n\nMany speculated at the time that Grant, who had largely ignored Stanton for several months, was due to reward him for his campaigning efforts. Stanton stated, however, that should a position in Grant's administration be offered, he would reject it.

The bills are called \"treasury notes\" or \"coin notes\" and are widely collected today. These rare notes are considered by many to be among the finest examples of detailed engraving ever to appear on banknotes. The $1 Stanton \"fancyback\" note of 1890, with an estimated 900\u20131,300 in existence relative to the millions printed, ranks as number 83 in the \"100 Greatest American Currency Notes\" compiled by Bowers and Sundman (2006). Stanton also appears on the fourth issue of [[Fractional currency]], in the amount of 50 cents.

Its plot follows six people who seek shelter during a storm in the mansion of an elderly puppetmaker and his wife, only to find that the various puppets and dolls in the home contain the imprisoned spirits of criminals. It was produced by [[Charles Band]] and [[Brian Yuzna]], through Band's [[Empire Pictures]].\n\nThe film was a commercial failure, grossing $3.5 million worldwide against a budget of only $2 million.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Plot==\nA violent [[thunderstorm]] strands a couple and child in the [[gothic fiction|gothic]] English countryside: little Judy, who is traveling with her selfish, uncaring father, David and her rich, callous, arrogant stepmother Rosemary. David only has Judy due to a court order and barely tolerates the little girl's presence, while Rosemary openly dislikes her stepdaughter. After their car is stuck in the mud and the rain begins, they find a mansion. After breaking in, they are found by the owners, a kindly older couple called Gabriel and Hilary Hartwicke. Rosemary threw Judy's beloved [[teddy bear]] into the bushes while out in the rain, so Gabriel gifts her a new [[doll]], Mr. Punch. They are invited to stay and while eating, Isabel and Enid (two British punk rocker hitchhikers) barge in with the person who picked them up, the naive yet good-natured Ralph. Gabriel reveals himself to be a talented toy maker; their house is filled with dolls, puppets, and many other beautifully detailed and handmade toys like Mr. Punch. The Hartwickes invite the stranded travelers to join them to stay as guests until the storm ends and show them to their rooms.\n\nAs it turns out, Isabel has thievery on her mind, and before taking Ralph's wallet and car, she plans on stealing any valuables and antiques the Hartwickes own. Enid just wants to get through the night. Isabel sneaks out and, while casing a room, is brutally attacked by the dolls, who spring to life and beat her before throwing her into the hallway in front of Judy. Unable to speak or even cry for help due to her extensive injuries, she extends her hand in pleading; but before Judy can react in any way, Isabel is dragged off to the attic before her eyes. Judy runs to tell her father and Rosemary, but they accuse her of making up stories and send her away. Judy then goes to Ralph's room to tell him what happened and since she woke him up, he thinks she's dreaming. However, as she turns to leave, he notices blood on her slippers, so he agrees to accompany her. However, on the way downstairs, some of the dolls delay them by tripping Ralph, and he falls down the stairs. He's fine when he gets up, except for a seeming bite mark that he believes came from a rat. They arrive at David and Rosemary's room, and Judy tries to tell him what happened; but they, along with Enid, simply ignore Judy and accuse Ralph of both attacking Isabel and being a pedophile. Upset at the treatment of both her and her new friend, Judy runs off with her father behind her. While looking for Judy, Ralph runs into Gabriel, who tells him that it's not blood but paint that he and Judy stepped in; and Isabel probably just got lost in one of the halls in the large house. Satisfied, he continues his search for Judy, finding her in the kitchen along with Mr. Punch. She continues to try to convince him, but he doesn't believe in the dolls until Mr. Punch himself actually speaks up which shocks both of them. \n\nRosemary is later ambushed and attacked repeatedly by the toys before accidentally leaping to her death (thinking she was jumping over them) out of a window. Enid goes looking for Isabel and finds her almost entirely transformed into a doll version of herself, but still able to attempt to warn her friend to \"go back\". Enid is then attacked by a horde of toys and eventually shot to death by toy soldiers. Rosemary's body has been taken to her bedroom, where, covered in a sheet, her death is not yet noticed by David. A locked room opens itself to Judy and Ralph. Ralph asks if they are Judy's 'little people' whom she spoke of and she informs him that they are. Encountering the dolls gathered together, Ralph ends up getting caught up in a trap the toys set for the other adults and is nearly hurt badly, until Judy convinces them to save him since he is her friend and on their side, too. Afterwards, they are stuck until the dolls decide what to do with them. David, fresh out of the shower, tries to talk to his wife, but finally finds her dead. Believing Ralph murdered her, David prepares to kill him. Now safe from the toys, Judy and Ralph run into the workshop where an angry David finds them. Ralph attempts to tell him what is going on, but David has taken leave of his reason. Ralph has learned the truth about the dolls and refuses to use them to fight, but David doesn't believe and knocks both his daughter and Ralph unconscious when they resist before David is assaulted by Mr. Punch. During their fight, the other dolls drag the unconscious Ralph and Judy away to safety. Mr. Punch is destroyed by David with a mallet after a fierce struggle.\n\nDavid is then confronted by Gabriel and Hilary. It is revealed that Gabriel and Hilary are actually a [[Wizard (paranormal)|wizard]] and [[witch]] couple who see toys as the heart and soul of childhood and believe toys will be around for as long as children (or even those with the hearts of children) want them. They also believe that the bitterness adults feel can turn to love if they surrender to the goodwill that toys provide. They explain that people come to their house every now and then and spend the night. When this happens, they test their visitors to see if they can change or were good from the start, giving them a sporting chance to save themselves. Some people, like Ralph (people who are able to see the love and respect of childhood) and children (like Judy), are saved/spared and leave the house with a much better perspective of life. However, those like David, Rosemary, Isabel, and Enid who refuse to change their ways can never leave, since they must play a new role in the world of children. It is shown that that new role is to become a child's toy when David is (apparently painfully) transformed into a doll to replace Mr. Punch when he attempts to attack the couple.\n\nThe next morning, Ralph and Judy wake up and are convinced by Gabriel and Hilary that the night's events were all just a dream, and receive a letter saying that David is leaving Judy behind because he never was a good father to her and that she will be much happier living in [[Boston]] with her mother. The letter also states that her father and stepmother are moving to another country and changing their names, and have also taken both Enid and Isabel with them, but have left enough money behind for Judy and Ralph to buy plane tickets back to Boston. Ralph and Judy then leave the house together after being bid farewell by Gabriel and Hilary, who invite them to come back whenever they want. As they get into Ralph's car, Judy is overjoyed to find her lost teddy sitting in the front seat, but then decides he would be happier living with the dolls and gives him to the Hartwickes as a gift. As they drive off to the airport, Judy, who has grown quite fond of Ralph, tells him that he will really like her mother and hints to him that if he would like to stay with her and her mother, he could be Judy's new father.

Its plot follows six people who seek shelter during a storm in the mansion of an elderly puppetmaker and his wife, only to find that the various puppets and dolls in the home contain the imprisoned spirits of criminals. It was produced by [[Charles Band]] and [[Brian Yuzna]], through Band's [[Empire Pictures]].\n\nThe film was a commercial failure, grossing $3.5 million worldwide against a budget of only $2 million.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Plot==\nA violent [[thunderstorm]] strands a couple and child in the [[gothic fiction|gothic]] English countryside: little Judy, who is traveling with her selfish, uncaring father, David and her rich, callous, arrogant stepmother Rosemary. David only has Judy due to a court order and barely tolerates the little girl's presence, while Rosemary openly dislikes her stepdaughter. After their car is stuck in the mud and the rain begins, they find a mansion. After breaking in, they are found by the owners, a kindly older couple called Gabriel and Hilary Hartwicke. Rosemary threw Judy's beloved [[teddy bear]] into the bushes while out in the rain, so Gabriel gifts her a new [[doll]], Mr. Punch. They are invited to stay and while eating, Isabel and Enid (two British punk rocker hitchhikers) barge in with the person who picked them up, the naive yet good-natured Ralph. Gabriel reveals himself to be a talented toy maker; their house is filled with dolls, puppets, and many other beautifully detailed and handmade toys like Mr. Punch. The Hartwickes invite the stranded travelers to join them to stay as guests until the storm ends and show them to their rooms.\n\nAs it turns out, Isabel has thievery on her mind, and before taking Ralph's wallet and car, she plans on stealing any valuables and antiques the Hartwickes own. Enid just wants to get through the night. Isabel sneaks out and, while casing a room, is brutally attacked by the dolls, who spring to life and beat her before throwing her into the hallway in front of Judy. Unable to speak or even cry for help due to her extensive injuries, she extends her hand in pleading; but before Judy can react in any way, Isabel is dragged off to the attic before her eyes. Judy runs to tell her father and Rosemary, but they accuse her of making up stories and send her away. Judy then goes to Ralph's room to tell him what happened and since she woke him up, he thinks she's dreaming. However, as she turns to leave, he notices blood on her slippers, so he agrees to accompany her. However, on the way downstairs, some of the dolls delay them by tripping Ralph, and he falls down the stairs. He's fine when he gets up, except for a seeming bite mark that he believes came from a rat. They arrive at David and Rosemary's room, and Judy tries to tell him what happened; but they, along with Enid, simply ignore Judy and accuse Ralph of both attacking Isabel and being a pedophile. Upset at the treatment of both her and her new friend, Judy runs off with her father behind her. While looking for Judy, Ralph runs into Gabriel, who tells him that it's not blood but paint that he and Judy stepped in; and Isabel probably just got lost in one of the halls in the large house. Satisfied, he continues his search for Judy, finding her in the kitchen along with Mr. Punch. She continues to try to convince him, but he doesn't believe in the dolls until Mr. Punch himself actually speaks up which shocks both of them. \n\nRosemary is later ambushed and attacked repeatedly by the toys before accidentally leaping to her death (thinking she was jumping over them) out of a window. Enid goes looking for Isabel and finds her almost entirely transformed into a doll version of herself, but still able to attempt to warn her friend to \"go back\". Enid is then attacked by a horde of toys and eventually shot to death by toy soldiers. Rosemary's body has been taken to her bedroom, where, covered in a sheet, her death is not yet noticed by David. A locked room opens itself to Judy and Ralph. Ralph asks if they are Judy's 'little people' whom she spoke of and she informs him that they are. Encountering the dolls gathered together, Ralph ends up getting caught up in a trap the toys set for the other adults and is nearly hurt badly, until Judy convinces them to save him since he is her friend and on their side, too. Afterwards, they are stuck until the dolls decide what to do with them. David, fresh out of the shower, tries to talk to his wife, but finally finds her dead. Believing Ralph murdered her, David prepares to kill him. Now safe from the toys, Judy and Ralph run into the workshop where an angry David finds them. Ralph attempts to tell him what is going on, but David has taken leave of his reason. Ralph has learned the truth about the dolls and refuses to use them to fight, but David doesn't believe and knocks both his daughter and Ralph unconscious when they resist before David is assaulted by Mr. Punch. During their fight, the other dolls drag the unconscious Ralph and Judy away to safety. Mr. Punch is destroyed by David with a mallet after a fierce struggle.\n\nDavid is then confronted by Gabriel and Hilary. It is revealed that Gabriel and Hilary are actually a [[Wizard (paranormal)|wizard]] and [[witch]] couple who see toys as the heart and soul of childhood and believe toys will be around for as long as children (or even those with the hearts of children) want them. They also believe that the bitterness adults feel can turn to love if they surrender to the goodwill that toys provide. They explain that people come to their house every now and then and spend the night. When this happens, they test their visitors to see if they can change or were good from the start, giving them a sporting chance to save themselves. Some people, like Ralph (people who are able to see the love and respect of childhood) and children (like Judy), are saved/spared and leave the house with a much better perspective of life. However, those like David, Rosemary, Isabel, and Enid who refuse to change their ways can never leave, since they must play a new role in the world of children. It is shown that that new role is to become a child's toy when David is (apparently painfully) transformed into a doll to replace Mr. Punch when he attempts to attack the couple.\n\nThe next morning, Ralph and Judy wake up and are convinced by Gabriel and Hilary that the night's events were all just a dream, and receive a letter saying that David is leaving Judy behind because he never was a good father to her and that she will be much happier living in [[Boston]] with her mother. The letter also states that her father and stepmother are moving to another country and changing their names, and have also taken both Enid and Isabel with them, but have left enough money behind for Judy and Ralph to buy plane tickets back to Boston. Ralph and Judy then leave the house together after being bid farewell by Gabriel and Hilary, who invite them to come back whenever they want. As they get into Ralph's car, Judy is overjoyed to find her lost teddy sitting in the front seat, but then decides he would be happier living with the dolls and gives him to the Hartwickes as a gift. As they drive off to the airport, Judy, who has grown quite fond of Ralph, tells him that he will really like her mother and hints to him that if he would like to stay with her and her mother, he could be Judy's new father. Though Ralph does not answer, he expresses interest in the idea.\n\nThe film ends with Mr. and Mrs. Bowers and the punk girls sitting on a shelf as dolls. Just then, another car with [[Dysfunctional family|another family with a set of obnoxious parents]] suddenly arrives, and their car gets stuck in a mud hole yards from the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* Ian Patrick Williams as David Bower\n* Carolyn Purdy Gordon as Rosemary Bower\n* Carrie Lorraine as Judy Bower\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as Gabriel Hartwicke\n* [[Hilary Mason]] as Hilary Hartwicke\n* [[Bunty Bailey]] as Isabel\n* Cassie Stuart as Enid\n* [[Stephen Lee (actor)|Stephen Lee]] as Ralph Morris\n}}\n==Cancelled sequel==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n[[Stuart Gordon]] was, at one point, very interested in directing a sequel to this film.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]].

The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.\n\nIt is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]].

The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.\n\nIt is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.
