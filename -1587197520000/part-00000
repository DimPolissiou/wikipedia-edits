He is a former [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Falcon]] pilot, married, with two children who live with him in a suburban house off-base. His current assignment involves flying armed [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]] drones in foreign air space in support of the U.S. [[War on Terror]]. He is admired by his commanding officer and support staff for his calm demeanor, precise flying, and adaptability. Privately, he is concerned about the assignment, which he took after being informed there was reduced call for and increased competition among fighter pilots in the Air Force. His previous CO informed him that a tour flying [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) would look good on his record and would increase his chances of being posted back to a flying assignment.\n\nAt first, the new assignment seems stressful but relatively benign. He is assigned to attack more clear-cut terrorist cells, vehicles, and facilities in [[Afghanistan]]. He flies these assignments during daylight hours over his targets, which is night-time in Las Vegas, leaving his days free for his sleep period, and to spend time with his wife and children. However, the high-tempo assignment \u2013 he is attacking targets on almost a daily basis \u2013 begins taking its toll. His wife notices the stress he's under and he begins drinking when off-duty.\n\nStill, his performance is excellent and his crew is rated among the highest in the squadron, so, on the orders of his commanding officer, he is assigned to more challenging missions under the direction of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] controllers. Many of these targets are in [[Yemen]] and [[Somalia]], places where the U.S. has no acknowledged military mission. The targets themselves are increasingly morally ambiguous: crowds the CIA controller calls terrorist cells, public buildings the controller says are sleeping spots for high level terrorist leaders or factories for making explosives. [[Collateral damage]] goes from being a rare occurrence to a routine one. On several occasions, the CIA controller orders strikes on obvious civilian targets \u2013 including women and children \u2013 describing these casualties as unfortunate but necessitated by terrorist leaders using them as human shields.\n\nEgan's performance declines and his drinking intensifies. He narrowly avoids being arrested for drunk driving, and starts avoiding home commitments, not wanting to inflict the stress he's under on his wife. He relishes a rare [[overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]] assignment protecting U.S. troops as they sleep, but must break a promise to his wife in order to perform the mission. On another overwatch mission, the troops are killed by an [[improvised explosive device]] that Egan could not protect them from. After a stress-induced violent episode at home, Egan's wife demands to know the details of Egan's work, and Egan tells her. She appears appalled. Soon after, she says she is leaving him and taking the children to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Nevada, blaming his drinking and violent behavior.\n\nFinally, Egan cracks. His CIA controller orders a strike on a small group of civilians responding to an explosion at a building Egan had previously destroyed. Rather than obey the order, Egan simulates a glitch in the UAV control system and the targets escape. His CO has no choice but to demote him away from the attack role into a surveillance one. While on a surveillance mission, Egan notices a man whom he had previously watched rape a woman several times approaching her home. His Mission Intelligence Coordinator had previously described this man as \"a bad guy. But not ''our'' bad guy.\" Egan conspires to send his support staff on a break, then uses the surveillance UAV to attack and kill the rapist. He then leaves the base without orders and is seen driving away from Las Vegas toward Reno.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as [[Major (United States)#Air Force|Major]] Thomas Egan\n* [[January Jones]] as Molly Egan\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Airman first class|A1C]] Vera Suarez\n* [[Jake Abel]] as Mission Intelligence Coordinator (M.I.C.)

Established by the British in the early 20th century, the company shared profits (85% for Britain, and 15% for Iran), but the company withheld their financial records from the Iranian government. By 1951, Iranians supported [[nationalization]] of the AIOC, and Parliament unanimously agreed to nationalize its holding of, what was at the time, the British Empire's largest company. The British retaliated with an embargo on Iranian oil, which was supported by international oil companies. Over the following months, negotiations over control and compensation for the oil were deadlocked, and Iran's economy deteriorated.\n\nU.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] pressed Britain to moderate its position in the negotiations and to not invade Iran. American policies created a feeling in Iran that the United States was on Mossadeq's side and optimism that the oil dispute would soon be settled with \"a series of innovative proposals to settle\" the dispute, giving Iran \"significant amounts of economic aid\". Mossadeq visited Washington, and the American government made \"frequent statements expressing support for him.\"<ref>Gasiorowski writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark J.

Until this point, the Carter Administration was still hoping for normal relationships with Iran, sending its National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n\nThe Islamic revolutionaries wished to extradite and execute the ousted Shah, and Carter refused to give him any further support or help return him to power. The Shah, suffering from terminal cancer, requested entry into the United States for treatment. The American embassy in Tehran opposed the request, as they were intent on stabilizing relations between the new interim revolutionary government of Iran and the United States.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\"/> However, President Carter agreed to let the Shah in, after severe pressure from [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and other pro-Shah political figures. Iranians' suspicion that the Shah was actually trying to conspire against the Iranian Revolution grew; thus, this incident was often used by the Iranian revolutionaries to justify their claims that the former monarch was an American puppet, and this led to the storming of the American embassy by radical students allied with the Khomeini faction.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\"/>\n\n=== The hostage crisis ===\n{{Main|Iran hostage crisis}}\n{{See also|Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United States}}\n[[File:DF-SC-82-06566 Bush hostages Iran.JPEG|thumb|Vice President [[George H.

The 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days. In Iran, the incident was seen by many as a blow against American influence in Iran and the liberal-moderate interim government of Prime Minister [[Mehdi Bazargan]], who opposed the hostage taking, resigned soon after.

The [[Iran-United States Claims Tribunal]] (located in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]) was established for the purpose of handling claims of American nationals against Iran and of Iranian nationals against the United States. American contact with Iran through The Hague covers only legal matters. The crisis led to lasting economic and diplomatic damage.\n\nOn 7 April 1980, Carter severed diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States and they have been frozen ever since.<ref>{{cite news|title=Carter Cuts Ties with Iran|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1980/4/8/carter-cuts-ties-with-iran-ppresident/|work=The Harvard Crimson|date=April 8, 1980}}</ref> Since 21 May 1980, [[Switzerland]] has been the [[protecting power]] for the United States in Iran.

This facilitated the modernization of Iran's infrastructure and industry, with as many as 30,000 American expatriates residing in the country in a technical, consulting, or teaching capacity. Some analysts argue that the transformation may have been too rapid, fueling unrest and discontent among an important part of the population in the country and leading to the Revolution in 1979.\n\nAfter the 1979 seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, the United States [[Executive Order 12170]] froze about $12&nbsp;billion in Iranian assets, including bank deposits, gold and other properties. According to American officials, most of those were released in 1981 as part of the [[Algiers Accords]] to release the hostages. Some assets\u2014Iranian officials say $10&nbsp;billion, but US officials say much less\u2014remain frozen, pending resolution of legal claims arising from the Revolution.\n\nCommercial relations between Iran and the United States are restricted by American [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] and consist mainly of Iranian purchases of food, spare parts, and medical products as well as American purchases of [[carpet]]s and food. Sanctions originally imposed in 1995 by President [[Bill Clinton]] were renewed by President Bush, who cited the \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to American national security posed by Iran. The 1995 executive orders prohibit American companies and their foreign subsidiaries from conducting business with Iran, while banning any \"contract for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran\". In addition, the [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996]] (ILSA) imposed mandatory and discretionary sanctions on non-American companies investing more than $20&nbsp;million annually in the Iranian oil and natural gas sectors.\n\nThe ILSA was renewed for five more years in 2001. [[United States Congress|Congressional]] bills signed in 2006 extended and added provisions to the act; on September 30, 2006, the act was renamed the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), as it no longer applied to Libya, and extended several times.

Established by the British in the early 20th century, the company shared profits (85% for Britain, and 15% for Iran), but the company withheld their financial records from the Iranian government. By 1951, Iranians supported [[nationalization]] of the AIOC, and Parliament unanimously agreed to nationalize its holding of, what was at the time, the British Empire's largest company. The British retaliated with an embargo on Iranian oil, which was supported by international oil companies. Over the following months, negotiations over control and compensation for the oil were deadlocked, and Iran's economy deteriorated.\n\nU.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] pressed Britain to moderate its position in the negotiations and to not invade Iran. American policies created a feeling in Iran that the United States was on Mossadeq's side and optimism that the oil dispute would soon be settled with \"a series of innovative proposals to settle\" the dispute, giving Iran \"significant amounts of economic aid\". Mossadeq visited Washington, and the American government made \"frequent statements expressing support for him.\"<ref>Gasiorowski writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark J.

Iranians' suspicion that the Shah was actually trying to conspire against the Iranian Revolution grew; thus, this incident was often used by the Iranian revolutionaries to justify their claims that the former monarch was an American puppet, and this led to the storming of the American embassy by radical students allied with the Khomeini faction.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\"/>\n\n=== The hostage crisis ===\n{{Main|Iran hostage crisis}}\n{{See also|Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United States}}\n[[File:DF-SC-82-06566 Bush hostages Iran.JPEG|thumb|Vice President [[George H.

This facilitated the modernization of Iran's infrastructure and industry, with as many as 30,000 American expatriates residing in the country in a technical, consulting, or teaching capacity. Some analysts argue that the transformation may have been too rapid, fueling unrest and discontent among an important part of the population in the country and leading to the Revolution in 1979.\n\nAfter the 1979 seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, the United States [[Executive Order 12170]] froze about $12&nbsp;billion in Iranian assets, including bank deposits, gold and other properties. According to American officials, most of those were released in 1981 as part of the [[Algiers Accords]] to release the hostages. Some assets\u2014Iranian officials say $10&nbsp;billion, but US officials say much less\u2014remain frozen, pending resolution of legal claims arising from the Revolution.\n\nCommercial relations between Iran and the United States are restricted by American [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] and consist mainly of Iranian purchases of food, spare parts, and medical products as well as American purchases of [[carpet]]s and food. Sanctions originally imposed in 1995 by President [[Bill Clinton]] were renewed by President Bush, who cited the \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to American national security posed by Iran. The 1995 executive orders prohibit American companies and their foreign subsidiaries from conducting business with Iran, while banning any \"contract for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran\".

Tehran and Washington have been bitter enemies since 1979, when the Iranian Revolution overthrew the pro-American Shah and replaced him with a virulently anti-American Islamist regime. Since then, Iran has been at the vanguard of countries actively challenging the US-led world order. This has led to instability in the Middle East, and Iran's relative isolation in international affairs.

Iran insisted the sanctions were illegal and that it had attached \"no value or credibility\" to the waivers.

The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh.  The musical is based on the low-budget 1960 [[black comedy]] film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.  The music, composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]] and early [[Motown Records|Motown]], includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, \"Skid Row (Downtown)\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", and \"Suddenly, Seymour\".\n\nThe musical premiered [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in 1982 before moving to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] [[Off-Broadway]], where it had a five-year run.  It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with [[community theatre]], school and other amateur groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  The musical was also made into a 1986 [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nAn offstage voice recalls a time when the human race \"suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence\". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban [[skid row]]. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large [[venus flytrap]]. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Orin Scrivello, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Dentistry|dentist]], is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the \"Leader of the pack\" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (\"Dentist!\"). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (\"Mushnik and Son\"). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). \n\nHe sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on [[nitrous oxide]], the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n===Act II===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Suddenly, Seymour - 2003 revival.ogg\n|title=\"Suddenly, Seymour\"\n|description=The beginning of the last chorus of \"Suddenly, Seymour\", performed by Kerry Butler and Hunter Foster on the 2003 Broadway revival cast recording.}}\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his \"sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled [[LIFE magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\"[[Sominex]]/Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the [[solar eclipse]], Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a [[machete]] planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.\n\nCrystal, Ronette, and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Out of the fog, Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that, no matter how persuasive the plants may be, they must not be fed (\"Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants\"). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly (In the original Off-Broadway production, plant tendrils fell all over the audience, as if each audience member were to be pulled into the plant, while in the Broadway production, a monstrously huge Audrey II was projected out over the fifth row and the balcony seats, as if it would eat the audience members).\n\n==Original production==\n===Off-Broadway===\nThe [[musical theater|musical]] had its world premiere [[Off-Off-Broadway]] on May 6, 1982 at the Workshop of the Players Art Foundation (WPA\u00a0Theatre), playing there until June 6, 1982.<ref>[http://howardashman.com/theatre.html \"Theater: ''Little Shop of Horrors''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209054052/http://howardashman.com/theatre.html |date=2015-02-09 }}, Howard Ashman website, accessed April 21, 2014</ref>  It opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on July 27, 1982.

The setting is moved from [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]] to Skid Row in New York. Seymour's [[hypochondriac]]al [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]] is omitted in the musical, and Seymour becomes an orphan in the care of Mushnik. Also dropped is the subplot involving the two investigating police officers.  The characters of Mrs. Siddie Shiva and Burson Fouch are also omitted, although Mrs. Shiva is mentioned as being the shop's biggest funeral account. The gleefully [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient, originally played by [[Jack Nicholson]], is not in the musical but is in the 1986 film, played by [[Bill Murray]].<!-- MURRAY PLAYED THE MASOCHIST.  STEVE MARTIN WAS THE DENTIST.  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS! -->\n\nIn the musical, the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello, is killed by suffocation from [[laughing gas]] instead of being stabbed with a dental instrument as in the film.  His abusive relationship with Audrey is added to the musical to give Seymour a motive to kill him.  In the film, Seymour murders several innocent bystanders, and Mushnik tricks a thief into looking for money inside the plant, which eats the thief.  In the musical, Seymour tricks Mushnik in the same way when Mushnik plans to turn Seymour over to the police.  The two neighborhood girls in the film are replaced in the musical by a chorus of three street urchins: [[The Crystals|Crystal]], [[The Chiffons|Chiffon]] and [[The Ronettes|Ronette]], named after (and reminiscent of) [[girl group]]s of the 1960s.  The plant is named \"Audrey II\" in the musical, rather than the film's \"Audrey Junior\", and instead of being a crossbreed of a [[butterwort]] and a [[Venus Flytrap]], in the musical it is a creature from [[outer space]] intent on taking over the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is the ending.  The musical ends with Orin, Mushnik, Audrey and Seymour all eaten by the plant, and the three girls report that Audrey II's progeny continues to consume people.  In the 1960 film, Mushnik and Audrey survive,  and the plant's carnivorous activities are discovered when its flowers bloom with the faces of its victims, including Seymour, imprinted on them.  The musical references this ending in its finale, in which the Plant's four victims' faces are seen in its blooming flowers. \n\nThe change in ending of the musical contributes to its portrayal of class struggles and moral values. While the 1986 film shows Seymour and Audrey escaping to the dream suburban house, encapsulating ideals of the 1950s [[American Dream]], the musical hints to a metaphorical portrayal of Seymour's greed as the plant.<ref>Jensen, Marc. \"Feed me!: Power struggles and the portrayal of race in ''Little Shop of Horrors''\", ''Cinema Journal'' 48, no. 1 (2008): 51\u201367</ref> Seymour's greed gradually consumes himself and Audrey. The musical engages with ideas relating to human values in the face of capitalist culture, disempowering those who are enveloped with motivations of personal monetary gain and overlook moral values. It serves as a social commentary of commodity fetishism.<ref>Leigh, Mary K., and Kevin K. Durand, eds. Marxism and the Movies: Critical Essays on Class Struggle in the Cinema.

It has a huge, nasty-looking pod that gains a shark-like aspect when open and snapping at food. The creature is played by a series of increasing[ly] large puppets\".<ref name=MTI>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000188|title=\"Little Shop of Horrors\", Casting \u2013 Character Breakdown|accessdate=25 December 2008|author=Music Theatre International}}</ref>\n\nIn productions, the first puppet is a small potted plant \"less than one foot tall\" held by the actor portraying Seymour.<ref name=MTI/>  He manipulates the plant himself with his hand and then sets it down, where it is moved by an unseen hand from beneath a shelf.  The second puppet is slightly larger than the first and is operated by Seymour during the song \"You Never Know\".  A fake arm in a sleeve matching Seymour's jacket is attached to the plant's pot, while the actor's real arm operates the plant.  The third puppet sits on the floor and is large enough to hide a person inside, who moves the plant's mouth in sync with Audrey II's voice, which is supplied by an offstage actor on a microphone.  The puppeteer's legs are clad in green tights with \"leaf\" shoes that serve as part of the plant's tendrils.  In Act II, the largest puppet again hides an actor inside, who manipulates the puppet's mouth and often some of its branches.  By this point, the head is at least six feet long and capable of \"swallowing\" characters.  For the finale, additions can be made to make the plant appear taller and even bigger.<ref name=MTI/> Actors and stage hands are often used to move larger branches and roots, which, in the original off-Broadway production, spilled off the stage and into the audience. In some productions, dangling vines over the house enhance the effect of Audrey II menacing the audience.\n\nAmateur productions of ''Little Shop of Horrors'' receive designs for building the puppets from [[Music Theatre International|MTI]], as part of the rental scripts and scores, based on the original Martin P. Robinson designs.  Some companies who have produced the show in the past and built their own puppets rent them out to other companies to recoup some of their construction costs.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.prattsburgh.wnyric.org/audrey_ii_rental.htm \"Prattsburgh Central School, Audrey II Rental\"]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1986 feature film===\n{{main|Little Shop of Horrors (film)}}\nA [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film version]] of the musical was made in 1986.  Directed by [[Frank Oz]] and noted as the only film written by [[Howard Ashman]], it starred [[Rick Moranis]] as Seymour, [[Ellen Greene]] as Audrey, [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Mr. Mushnik, [[Steve Martin]] as Orin Scrivello, DDS, and the voice of [[Levi Stubbs]] as Audrey II. [[Bill Murray]] played the small comic role of the masochist, Arthur Denton.  The 1986 film follows the plot of the musical closely but omits the songs \"Ya Never Know\" (rewritten as \"Some Fun Now,\" a trio for Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon), \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now (It's Just the Gas)\", \"Sudden Changes,\" \"Closed for Renovation\" and \"Call Back in the Morning\"; the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] ending also omits \"Finale Ultimo (Don't Feed The Plants)\".  Other changes include the removal of Mr. Mushnik's adoption proposition and a new ending, in which Seymour is able to save Audrey from Audrey II and then electrocutes the plant after it has destroyed the shop. Seymour and Audrey marry and move to the tract home of her dreams, but a small Audrey II-type bud is seen in their garden, which portends a possible spread of the alien plants.  An ending more faithful to the stage version was filmed, in which the plant eats Audrey and Seymour and then, having grown to massive size and reproduced, goes on a [[King Kong]]-style rampage through New York City.  It was received poorly by test audiences, and the upbeat alternate ending was used for the theatrical cut. In October 2012, the original ending was restored and released with the film as \"The Director's Cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray. A new song for Audrey II, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song.\n\n===Planned feature film===\nA remake of the musical for feature film is planned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with [[Greg Berlanti]] directing. [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] has been cast as the voice of Audrey II.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/chris-evans-talks-star-little-shop-horrors-1280781 | title = Chris Evans in Talks to Star in Greg Berlanti's 'Little Shop of Horrors' | first = Borys | last = Kit | date = February 24, 2020 | accessdate = February 24, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Ganzl, Kurt.

The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh.  The musical is based on the low-budget 1960 [[black comedy]] film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.  The music, composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]] and early [[Motown Records|Motown]], includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, \"Skid Row (Downtown)\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", and \"Suddenly, Seymour\".\n\nThe musical premiered [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in 1982 before moving to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] [[Off-Broadway]], where it had a five-year run.  It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with [[community theatre]], school and other amateur groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  The musical was also made into a 1986 [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nAn offstage voice recalls a time when the human race \"suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence\". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban [[skid row]]. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large [[venus flytrap]]. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Orin Scrivello, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Dentistry|dentist]], is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the \"Leader of the pack\" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (\"Dentist!\"). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (\"Mushnik and Son\"). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). \n\nHe sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on [[nitrous oxide]], the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n===Act II===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Suddenly, Seymour - 2003 revival.ogg\n|title=\"Suddenly, Seymour\"\n|description=The beginning of the last chorus of \"Suddenly, Seymour\", performed by Kerry Butler and Hunter Foster on the 2003 Broadway revival cast recording.}}\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his \"sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled [[LIFE magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\"[[Sominex]]/Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the [[solar eclipse]], Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a [[machete]] planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.\n\nCrystal, Ronette, and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Out of the fog, Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that, no matter how persuasive the plants may be, they must not be fed (\"Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants\"). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly (In the original Off-Broadway production, plant tendrils fell all over the audience, as if each audience member were to be pulled into the plant, while in the Broadway production, a monstrously huge Audrey II was projected out over the fifth row and the balcony seats, as if it would eat the audience members).\n\n==Original production==\n===Off-Broadway===\nThe [[musical theater|musical]] had its world premiere [[Off-Off-Broadway]] on May 6, 1982 at the Workshop of the Players Art Foundation (WPA\u00a0Theatre), playing there until June 6, 1982.<ref>[http://howardashman.com/theatre.html \"Theater: ''Little Shop of Horrors''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209054052/http://howardashman.com/theatre.html |date=2015-02-09 }}, Howard Ashman website, accessed April 21, 2014</ref>  It opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on July 27, 1982.

The setting is moved from [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]] to Skid Row in New York. Seymour's [[hypochondriac]]al [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]] is omitted in the musical, and Seymour becomes an orphan in the care of Mushnik. Also dropped is the subplot involving the two investigating police officers.  The characters of Mrs. Siddie Shiva and Burson Fouch are also omitted, although Mrs. Shiva is mentioned as being the shop's biggest funeral account. The gleefully [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient, originally played by [[Jack Nicholson]], is not in the musical but is in the 1986 film, played by [[Bill Murray]].<!-- MURRAY PLAYED THE MASOCHIST.  STEVE MARTIN WAS THE DENTIST.  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS! -->\n\nIn the musical, the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello, is killed by suffocation from [[laughing gas]] instead of being stabbed with a dental instrument as in the film.  His abusive relationship with Audrey is added to the musical to give Seymour a motive to kill him.  In the film, Seymour murders several innocent bystanders, and Mushnik tricks a thief into looking for money inside the plant, which eats the thief.  In the musical, Seymour tricks Mushnik in the same way when Mushnik plans to turn Seymour over to the police.  The two neighborhood girls in the film are replaced in the musical by a chorus of three street urchins: [[The Crystals|Crystal]], [[The Chiffons|Chiffon]] and [[The Ronettes|Ronette]], named after (and reminiscent of) [[girl group]]s of the 1960s.  The plant is named \"Audrey II\" in the musical, rather than the film's \"Audrey Junior\", and instead of being a crossbreed of a [[butterwort]] and a [[Venus Flytrap]], in the musical it is a creature from [[outer space]] intent on taking over the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is the ending.  The musical ends with Orin, Mushnik, Audrey and Seymour all eaten by the plant, and the three girls report that Audrey II's progeny continues to consume people.  In the 1960 film, Mushnik and Audrey survive,  and the plant's carnivorous activities are discovered when its flowers bloom with the faces of its victims, including Seymour, imprinted on them.  The musical references this ending in its finale, in which the Plant's four victims' faces are seen in its blooming flowers. \n\nThe change in ending of the musical contributes to its portrayal of class struggles and moral values. While the 1986 film shows Seymour and Audrey escaping to the dream suburban house, encapsulating ideals of the 1950s [[American Dream]], the musical hints to a metaphorical portrayal of Seymour's greed as the plant.<ref>Jensen, Marc. \"Feed me!: Power struggles and the portrayal of race in ''Little Shop of Horrors''\", ''Cinema Journal'' 48, no. 1 (2008): 51\u201367</ref> Seymour's greed gradually consumes himself and Audrey. The musical engages with ideas relating to human values in the face of capitalist culture, disempowering those who are enveloped with motivations of personal monetary gain and overlook moral values. It serves as a social commentary of commodity fetishism.<ref>Leigh, Mary K., and Kevin K. Durand, eds. Marxism and the Movies: Critical Essays on Class Struggle in the Cinema.

The second puppet is slightly larger than the first and is operated by Seymour during the song \"You Never Know\".  A fake arm in a sleeve matching Seymour's jacket is attached to the plant's pot, while the actor's real arm operates the plant.  The third puppet sits on the floor and is large enough to hide a person inside, who moves the plant's mouth in sync with Audrey II's voice, which is supplied by an offstage actor on a microphone.  The puppeteer's legs are clad in green tights with \"leaf\" shoes that serve as part of the plant's tendrils.  In Act II, the largest puppet again hides an actor inside, who manipulates the puppet's mouth and often some of its branches.  By this point, the head is at least six feet long and capable of \"swallowing\" characters.  For the finale, additions can be made to make the plant appear taller and even bigger.<ref name=MTI/> Actors and stage hands are often used to move larger branches and roots, which, in the original off-Broadway production, spilled off the stage and into the audience.

Directed by [[Frank Oz]] and noted as the only film written by [[Howard Ashman]], it starred [[Rick Moranis]] as Seymour, [[Ellen Greene]] as Audrey, [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Mr. Mushnik, [[Steve Martin]] as Orin Scrivello, DDS, and the voice of [[Levi Stubbs]] as Audrey II. [[Bill Murray]] played the small comic role of the masochist, Arthur Denton.  The 1986 film follows the plot of the musical closely but omits the songs \"Ya Never Know\" (rewritten as \"Some Fun Now,\" a trio for Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon), \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now (It's Just the Gas)\", \"Sudden Changes,\" \"Closed for Renovation\" and \"Call Back in the Morning\"; the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] ending also omits \"Finale Ultimo (Don't Feed The Plants)\".  Other changes include the removal of Mr. Mushnik's adoption proposition and a new ending, in which Seymour is able to save Audrey from Audrey II and then electrocutes the plant after it has destroyed the shop. Seymour and Audrey marry and move to the tract home of her dreams, but a small Audrey II-type bud is seen in their garden, which portends a possible spread of the alien plants.  An ending more faithful to the stage version was filmed, in which the plant eats Audrey and Seymour and then, having grown to massive size and reproduced, goes on a [[King Kong]]-style rampage through New York City.  It was received poorly by test audiences, and the upbeat alternate ending was used for the theatrical cut. In October 2012, the original ending was restored and released with the film as \"The Director's Cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray. A new song for Audrey II, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song.\n\n===Planned feature film===\nA remake of the musical for feature film is planned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with [[Greg Berlanti]] directing. [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] has been cast as the voice of Audrey II.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/chris-evans-talks-star-little-shop-horrors-1280781 | title = Chris Evans in Talks to Star in Greg Berlanti's 'Little Shop of Horrors' | first = Borys | last = Kit | date = February 24, 2020 | accessdate = February 24, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Ganzl, Kurt.

Another duty is to promote friendly relations among the member national associations and to operate in an organized manner for the good order of the [[sport]].<ref>International Ice Hockey Federation. [https://www.iihf.com/en/static/5009/mission \"IIHF Mission\"] 2019-05-08.</ref>\nThe federation may take the necessary measures in order to conduct itself and its affairs in accordance with its [[statute]]s, [[bylaw]]s and regulations as well as in holding a clear [[jurisdiction]] with regards to ice hockey and in-line hockey at the international level. The IIHF is the body responsible with arranging the [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]], license rights, [[advertising]] and [[merchandising]] in connection with all IIHF competitions.\n\nAnother purpose of the federation is to provide aid in the young players' development and in the development of [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]] and [[Official (ice hockey)|game officials]]. On the other hand, all the events of IIHF are organized by the federation along with establishing and maintaining contact with any other sport federations or sport groups. The IIHF is responsible for processing the international players' transfers. It is also the body that presides over [[ice hockey at the Olympic Games]] as well as over all levels of the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]].<ref>International Hockey online portal. [http://www.internationalhockey.net/articlelisting/7/ \"International hockey and the olympics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410183800/http://www.internationalhockey.net/articlelisting/7/ |date=10 April 2010 }} 2010-02-18.</ref> The federation works in collaboration with local [[committee]]s when organizing its 25 World Championships, at five different categories.\n\nEven though the IIHF runs the world championships, it is also responsible for the organization of several European club competitions such as the [[Champions Hockey League]] or the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]].\n\nThe federation is governed by the legislative body of the IIHF which is the General Congress along with the executive body, which is the Council. The Congress is entitled to make decisions with regard to the game's rules, the statutes and bylaws in the name of the federation. It is also the body that elects the president and the council or otherwise known as board.<ref>International Ice Hockey Federation. [https://www.iihf.com/en/static/5024/statutes-bylaws \"IIHF Statutes and Bylaws\"] 2019-05-08.</ref> The president of the IIHF is basically the representative of the federation. He represents the federation's interests in all external matters and he is also responsible that the decisions are made according to the federation's statutes and regulations. The president is assisted by the General Secretary, who is also the highest ranked employee of the IIHF.\n\n==History==\n===1908\u20131913===\n[[File:Iihf statutes.jpg|thumb|Foundation document of the LIHG.]]\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation was founded on 15 May 1908 at 34 [[Rue de Provence]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], as Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG).<ref>[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4808/history-of-ice-hockey It all Started in Paris, 1908] International Ice Hockey Federation. Retrieved on 2019-05-07</ref> The founders of the federation were representatives from [[Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and [[Switzerland]]. [[Louis Magnus]], the French representative, was the fifth member to sign the founding document and also the first president of the LIHG.\n\nThe second congress was held from 22\u201325 January 1909 in [[Chamonix]], [[France]]. Playing and competitions rules were established, and an agreement was reached for an annual European Championship to be contested, beginning in 1910. The [[1909 Coupe de Chamonix]] was contested during the congress. It was won by [[Princes Ice Hockey Club]], representing Great Britain. Germany became the sixth LIHG member on 19 September 1909.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4857/1908-1913 IIHF 1908-1913]</ref>\n\nThe third LIHG Congress was held on 9 January 1910 in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]]. Louis Magnus was re-elected president and [[Peter Patton]] took on the position of vice-president. The first European Championship began in [[Les Avants]] a day after the conclusion of the congress. It was won by Great Britain.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/>\n\nRussia was added as the seventh LIHG member and [[Herman Kleeberg]] replaced Peter Patton as vice president at the fourth LIHG Congress, which was held in [[Berlin]] from 16\u201317 February 1911, in conjunction with the 1911 European Championship.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/> On 14 March 1911, the LIHG adopted Canadian rules of ice hockey.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}}\n\nThe fifth LIHG Congress took place from 22\u201323 March 1912, in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Unlike the two previous conferences, it was not held in conjunction with the European Championships, which had been staged in [[Prague]] in early February. A verdict was reached regarding the fate of the past month's European Championship, which had been the subject of a protest by Germany. It was decided that the tournament would be annulled as Austria was not yet an LIHG member at the time of its playing. Austria, along with Sweden and Luxembourg, were accepted as LIHG members at the congress. [[Henri van den Bulcke]] succeeded Louis Magnus as LIHG president, and [[Max Sillig]] replaced Herman Kleeberg as vice-president. The first [[LIHG Championships|LIHG Championship]] was contested in Brussels from 20\u201324 March. It was held annually until 1914.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/>\n\nAt the 1913 congress in [[St. Moritz]], Max Sillig resigned his position as vice-president and was replaced by Peter Patton, who had previously served in the position from 1910\u20131911.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/> In February 1913, LIHG arranged the first [[European Bandy Championships|European Bandy Championship]] tournament in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bandynet.ru/node/22115 |script-title= ru:\u0427\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u044b 1913 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 |publisher= Bandynet.ru |date= 30 September 2011 |language= Russian |accessdate= 6 January 2014 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140106132926/http://bandynet.ru/node/22115 |archivedate= 6 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===1914\u20131945===\nThe 1914 congress was held in Berlin, the location of that year's European Championship. Louis Magnus replaced Van den Bulcke as president, but he resigned immediately as the other delegates did not follow his program. Peter Patton, vice-president at the time, then became president and had new elections staged. Van den Bulcke was again elected as president (a position he would hold until 1920), and Patton was returned to his prior role of vice-president.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4856/1914-1933 IIHF 1914-1933]</ref>\n\n[[World War I]] interrupted all activities of the federation between 1914 and 1920. The LIHG expelled Austria and Germany from its ranks following the war in 1920. Bohemia's membership was transferred to the new country of [[Czechoslovakia]] the same year.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] were the first to integrate hockey into their program. Canada and the United States made their debut on the international scene at the tournament. Their level of play was vastly superior to that of the [[Europe]]ans and Canada took home the gold while the US won the silver medal. On 26 April 1920, at the LIHG Congress which was held during the Olympic tournament, both countries became members of the federation. Also at the congress, Max Sillig became president, and [[Paul Loicq]] and [[Frank Fellowes]] were elected as vice presidents.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nPaul Loicq was elected as president in 1922. [[Karel Hartmann]] and Haddock were chosen as the new vice-presidents.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAt the 1923 congress it was decided to consider the 1924 Olympic Games as the World Championship as well as to organize a parallel European Championship. Romania, Spain, and Italy were admitted to the LIHG the same year.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAustria was re-admitted to the LIHG in 1924, while the Swedish proposal to re-admit Germany was declined. The Swedes protested by leaving the LIHG. They returned in 1926 following the re-admission of Germany.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928 Winter Olympics]], which also served as the World and European Championship for the year, saw a record 11 countries participate as Canada claimed their third gold medal.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAt the 1929 congress, the LIHG decided to organize a stand-alone World Championship, beginning in 1930. The first World Championship began in [[Chamonix]], but had to be concluded in [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]] as the natural ice in Chamonix melted toward the end of the tournament. Canada was considered so dominant that it received a bye to the final, where it easily dispatched Germany to win the gold medal. Japan, which had joined the LIHG just days prior to the start of the tournament, entered a team consisting of medical students.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1932 Winter Olympics|1932 Winter Olympics]], held in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], consisted of only four teams due to the global financial crisis. Germany and Poland were the only European nations present as Canada won their fourth Olympic gold medal. The [[Ice Hockey European Championship 1932|1932 European Championship]] was contested as the last stand-alone European Championship. Nine countries participated and Sweden won their third European title.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n \nThe LIHG celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1933. Since its foundation in 1908, 18 European Championships, six World Championships, and four Olympic Games tournaments had been contested. The [[1933 World Ice Hockey Championships|1933 World Championship]] marked the first time that Canada failed to emerge victorious in a World Championship or Olympic tournament. They were defeated by the United States, 2-1 in overtime.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe Netherlands and Norway became LIHG members in 1935. The three Baltic states, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania joined the LIHG in 1931, 1935, and 1938 respectively. South Africa was accepted into the LIHG in 1937.<ref name=\"IIHF1934\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4836/1934-1945 IIHF 1934-1945]</ref>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936 Winter Olympics]]  set a new record with 15 participants.

The IOC initially declared that neither team would be allowed to participate, which led the LIHG to threaten a boycott of the entire ice hockey tournament. The IOC then conceded and allowed the AHAUS team to participate in the tournament and the AAU team to march in the opening ceremony. The AHAUS team was excluded from the final rankings of the Olympic tournament, but not from the World Championship, where they officially finished in fourth place.<ref name=\"IIHF1946\"/>\n\n[[W. G.

While the B Pool had been played as early as 1951, it was not held every year due to a frequent shortage of teams, and no promotion-and-relegation took place between it and the top division.<ref name=\"IIHF1957\"/>\n\nFor the 1965\u201366 season, the IIHF created the [[IIHF European Champions Cup|European Cup]], a tournament consisting of the top club teams from around Europe. The competition was originated by [[G\u00fcnther Sabetzki]], based on the [[Association football]] European Cup (now [[UEFA Champions League]]). In 1968 the IIHF organized the [[IIHF European Junior Championships|European U19 Championship]], a junior competition for players aged 19 and under. The age limit was later reduced to 18 in 1977.<ref name=\"IIHF1957\"/>\n\nThe IIHF saw three different presidents take office between 1957 and 1974. [[Bunny Ahearne|John F. \"Bunny\" Ahearne]] was elected to three separate terms (the first from 1957\u20131960, the second from 1963\u20131966, and the third spanning from 1969\u20131975). [[Robert Lebel (ice hockey)|Robert Lebel]] served in office from 1960\u20131963, while [[William Thayer Tutt]] was president from 1966\u20131969.<ref name=\"IIHF1957\"/>\n\n===1975\u20131989===\nIn 1975, Dr. [[G\u00fcnther Sabetzki]] was elected president of the IIHF. He replaced Bunny Ahearne, whose heavy-handed regime had caused him to grow increasingly unpopular toward the end of his presidency. Sabetzki would remain in office for nearly two decades, which were considered up to that point the most successful period for international ice hockey on all fronts.<ref name=\"IIHF1975\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4830/1975-1989 IIHF 1975-1989]</ref>\n\nSabetzki's greatest achievement was ending the Canadian boycott of the World Championships and Olympic Games. The Canadians had boycotted these tournaments between 1970 and 1976 after the IIHF had refused to allow them to roster professional players at the World Championships from NHL teams that had not qualified for the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. President Sabetzki managed to find a compromise that resulted in the return of Canada to international events beginning in 1977. The pro players whose teams had been eliminated from the playoffs were allowed to compete and in exchange, Canada agreed to participate in the World Championships. They also waived their right to host any World Championships. The creation of the [[Canada Cup]] (a competition organized by the NHL in Canada every four years) was also part of the new agreement between the IIHF and North American professional hockey.<ref name=\"IIHF1975\"/>\n\n[[Walter Wasservogel]] became the first full-time general secretary of the IIHF in 1978, serving in the role until 1986.<ref name=\"Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/IZone/izone.member.info.do?mem=57|title=2.57 Walter Wasservogel|website=Legends of Hockey|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>\n\nThe first official [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Championships]] for players under 20 years of age was held in 1977. Unofficial tournaments, which were not IIHF-sanctioned and teams were eligible to participate by invitation only, had been contested between 1974 and 1976. It began as a relatively obscure tournament, but soon grew in popularity, particularly in Canada. The most infamous WJC event was the [[Punch-up in Piestany]] in [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1987]], where a bench-clearing brawl between Canada and the Soviet Union resulted in the expulsion of both countries from the tournament.<ref name=\"Timeline\">[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/the-iihf/timeline.html IIHF Timeline]</ref>\n\nTwo new tournaments were introduced by the IIHF during the 1980s. The [[IIHF Asian Oceanic U18 Championships|Asian Oceanic U18 Championship]], which was held annually until 2002, was played for the first time in 1984. The first [[IIHF European Women Championships|Women's European Championship]] was contested in 1989.

The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] saw its membership transferred to [[Russia]], and the addition of four ex-[[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]; [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Ukraine]] to the federation. In addition, the memberships of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] - all of which had initially joined the IIHF in the 1930s but were expelled following their annexation by the Soviet Union - were renewed. The breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] also resulted in an increase in membership. [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] joined as new members, while the membership of the old Yugoslavia was transferred to [[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]] (which later became known as Serbia and Montenegro and still later dissolved into the independent republics of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]). When [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia broke up]], its membership rights were transferred to the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] was admitted as a new member. The influx of new members resulted in the IIHF increasing the size of the Group A tournament. It expanded from 8 teams to 12 in 1992 and from 12 to 16 in 1998.<ref name=\"IIHF1990\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4839/1990-today IIHF 1990-today]</ref>\n\nThe other new members to join the IIHF during the 1980s and 1990s were: [[Chinese Taipei]] (1983), [[Hong Kong]] (1983), [[Brazil]] (1984), [[Kuwait]] (1985), [[Mexico]] (1985), [[Greece]] (1987), [[India]] (1989), [[Thailand]] (1989), [[Israel]] (1991), [[Turkey]] (1991), [[Iceland]] (1992), [[Andorra]] (1995), [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (1996), [[Singapore]] (1996), [[Argentina]] (1998), [[Namibia]] (1998; withdrew from an IIHF membership and was removed entirely in 2017), [[Armenia]] (1999), [[Mongolia]] (1999), and [[Portugal]] (1999).<ref name=\"IIHF1990\"/>\n\nIn June 1994, [[Ren\u00e9 Fasel]] was elected the President of the IIHF, succeeding G\u00fcnther Sabetzki. He has served five consecutive terms as president. His most recent started in 2012 after he was re-elected at the IIHF General Congress in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. In March 1995, he helped negotiate an agreement so that NHL players could compete at the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], [[Japan]].<ref>[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/council/rene-fasel.html IIHF Council]</ref>\n\nThe first [[IIHF World Women's Championships|Women's World Championship]] was contested in 1990 in the Canadian capital of [[Ottawa]]. Canada and the United States have dominated the event, winning all 19 tournaments (10 by the Canadians and nine by the U.S.) since its inception. The [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|1998 Winter Olympics]] were the first to feature women's ice hockey as part of its program.<ref name=\"Timeline\"/>\n\nNumerous other tournaments have been created by the IIHF during the 1990s and 2000s.

Another duty is to promote friendly relations among the member national associations and to operate in an organized manner for the good order of the [[sport]].<ref>International Ice Hockey Federation. [https://www.iihf.com/en/static/5009/mission \"IIHF Mission\"] 2019-05-08.</ref>\nThe federation may take the necessary measures in order to conduct itself and its affairs in accordance with its [[statute]]s, [[bylaw]]s and regulations as well as in holding a clear [[jurisdiction]] with regards to ice hockey and in-line hockey at the international level. The IIHF is the body responsible with arranging the [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]], license rights, [[advertising]] and [[merchandising]] in connection with all IIHF competitions.\n\nAnother purpose of the federation is to provide aid in the young players' development and in the development of [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]] and [[Official (ice hockey)|game officials]]. On the other hand, all the events of IIHF are organized by the federation along with establishing and maintaining contact with any other sport federations or sport groups. The IIHF is responsible for processing the international players' transfers. It is also the body that presides over [[ice hockey at the Olympic Games]] as well as over all levels of the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]].<ref>International Hockey online portal. [http://www.internationalhockey.net/articlelisting/7/ \"International hockey and the olympics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410183800/http://www.internationalhockey.net/articlelisting/7/ |date=10 April 2010 }} 2010-02-18.</ref> The federation works in collaboration with local [[committee]]s when organizing its 25 World Championships, at five different categories.\n\nEven though the IIHF runs the world championships, it is also responsible for the organization of several European club competitions such as the [[Champions Hockey League]] or the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]].\n\nThe federation is governed by the legislative body of the IIHF which is the General Congress along with the executive body, which is the Council. The Congress is entitled to make decisions with regard to the game's rules, the statutes and bylaws in the name of the federation. It is also the body that elects the president and the council or otherwise known as board.<ref>International Ice Hockey Federation. [https://www.iihf.com/en/static/5024/statutes-bylaws \"IIHF Statutes and Bylaws\"] 2019-05-08.</ref> The president of the IIHF is basically the representative of the federation. He represents the federation's interests in all external matters and he is also responsible that the decisions are made according to the federation's statutes and regulations. The president is assisted by the General Secretary, who is also the highest ranked employee of the IIHF.\n\n==History==\n===1908\u20131913===\n[[File:Iihf statutes.jpg|thumb|Foundation document of the LIHG.]]\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation was founded on 15 May 1908 at 34 [[Rue de Provence]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], as Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG).<ref>[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4808/history-of-ice-hockey It all Started in Paris, 1908] International Ice Hockey Federation. Retrieved on 2019-05-07</ref> The founders of the federation were representatives from [[Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and [[Switzerland]]. [[Louis Magnus]], the French representative, was the fifth member to sign the founding document and also the first president of the LIHG.\n\nThe second congress was held from 22\u201325 January 1909 in [[Chamonix]], [[France]]. Playing and competitions rules were established, and an agreement was reached for an annual European Championship to be contested, beginning in 1910. The [[1909 Coupe de Chamonix]] was contested during the congress. It was won by [[Princes Ice Hockey Club]], representing Great Britain. Germany became the sixth LIHG member on 19 September 1909.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4857/1908-1913 IIHF 1908-1913]</ref>\n\nThe third LIHG Congress was held on 9 January 1910 in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]]. Louis Magnus was re-elected president and [[Peter Patton]] took on the position of vice-president. The first European Championship began in [[Les Avants]] a day after the conclusion of the congress. It was won by Great Britain.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/>\n\nRussia was added as the seventh LIHG member and [[Herman Kleeberg]] replaced Peter Patton as vice president at the fourth LIHG Congress, which was held in [[Berlin]] from 16\u201317 February 1911, in conjunction with the 1911 European Championship.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/> On 14 March 1911, the LIHG adopted Canadian rules of ice hockey.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}}\n\nThe fifth LIHG Congress took place from 22\u201323 March 1912, in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Unlike the two previous conferences, it was not held in conjunction with the European Championships, which had been staged in [[Prague]] in early February. A verdict was reached regarding the fate of the past month's European Championship, which had been the subject of a protest by Germany. It was decided that the tournament would be annulled as Austria was not yet an LIHG member at the time of its playing. Austria, along with Sweden and Luxembourg, were accepted as LIHG members at the congress. [[Henri van den Bulcke]] succeeded Louis Magnus as LIHG president, and [[Max Sillig]] replaced Herman Kleeberg as vice-president. The first [[LIHG Championships|LIHG Championship]] was contested in Brussels from 20\u201324 March. It was held annually until 1914.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/>\n\nAt the 1913 congress in [[St. Moritz]], Max Sillig resigned his position as vice-president and was replaced by Peter Patton, who had previously served in the position from 1910\u20131911.<ref name=\"IIHF1908\"/> In February 1913, LIHG arranged the first [[European Bandy Championships|European Bandy Championship]] tournament in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bandynet.ru/node/22115 |script-title= ru:\u0427\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u044b 1913 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 |publisher= Bandynet.ru |date= 30 September 2011 |language= Russian |accessdate= 6 January 2014 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140106132926/http://bandynet.ru/node/22115 |archivedate= 6 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===1914\u20131945===\nThe 1914 congress was held in Berlin, the location of that year's European Championship. Louis Magnus replaced Van den Bulcke as president, but he resigned immediately as the other delegates did not follow his program. Peter Patton, vice-president at the time, then became president and had new elections staged. Van den Bulcke was again elected as president (a position he would hold until 1920), and Patton was returned to his prior role of vice-president.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\">[https://www.iihf.com/en/statichub/4856/1914-1933 IIHF 1914-1933]</ref>\n\n[[World War I]] interrupted all activities of the federation between 1914 and 1920. The LIHG expelled Austria and Germany from its ranks following the war in 1920. Bohemia's membership was transferred to the new country of [[Czechoslovakia]] the same year.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] were the first to integrate hockey into their program. Canada and the United States made their debut on the international scene at the tournament. Their level of play was vastly superior to that of the [[Europe]]ans and Canada took home the gold while the US won the silver medal. On 26 April 1920, at the LIHG Congress which was held during the Olympic tournament, both countries became members of the federation. Also at the congress, Max Sillig became president, and [[Paul Loicq]] and [[Frank Fellowes]] were elected as vice presidents.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nPaul Loicq was elected as president in 1922. [[Karel Hartmann|Dr. Karel Hartmann]] and Haddock were chosen as the new vice-presidents.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAt the 1923 congress it was decided to consider the 1924 Olympic Games as the World Championship as well as to organize a parallel European Championship. Romania, Spain, and Italy were admitted to the LIHG the same year.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAustria was re-admitted to the LIHG in 1924, while the Swedish proposal to re-admit Germany was declined. The Swedes protested by leaving the LIHG. They returned in 1926 following the re-admission of Germany.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nThe [[Ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928 Winter Olympics]], which also served as the World and European Championship for the year, saw a record 11 countries participate as Canada claimed their third gold medal.<ref name=\"IIHF1914\"/>\n\nAt the 1929 congress, the LIHG decided to organize a stand-alone World Championship, beginning in 1930. The first World Championship began in [[Chamonix]], but had to be concluded in [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]] as the natural ice in Chamonix melted toward the end of the tournament. Canada was considered so dominant that it received a bye to the final, where it easily dispatched Germany to win the gold medal.

He was replaced by [[Fritz Kraatz|Dr. Fritz Kraatz]].<ref name=\"IIHF1946\"/> During the 1947 championships, the LIHG agreed to a merger with the International Ice Hockey Association.

The IOC initially declared that neither team would be allowed to participate, which led the LIHG to threaten a boycott of the entire ice hockey tournament. The IOC then conceded and allowed the AHAUS team to participate in the tournament and the AAU team to march in the opening ceremony. The AHAUS team was excluded from the final rankings of the Olympic tournament, but not from the World Championship, where they officially finished in fourth place.<ref name=\"IIHF1946\"/>\n\n[[W. G.

The game was awarded to East Germany, 5-0, by virtue of a forfeit. Two years later, at the [[1963 World Ice Hockey Championships|1963 World Championship]] in [[Stockholm]], the East Germans took payback on West Germany.

While the B Pool had been played as early as 1951, it was not held every year due to a frequent shortage of teams, and no promotion-and-relegation took place between it and the top division.<ref name=\"IIHF1957\"/>\n\nFor the 1965\u201366 season, the IIHF created the [[IIHF European Champions Cup|European Cup]], a tournament consisting of the top club teams from around Europe. The competition was originated by [[G\u00fcnther Sabetzki]], based on the [[Association football]] European Cup (now [[UEFA Champions League]]). In 1968 the IIHF organized the [[IIHF European Junior Championships|European U19 Championship]], a junior competition for players aged 19 and under. The age limit was later reduced to 18 in 1977.<ref name=\"IIHF1957\"/>\n\nThe IIHF saw three different presidents take office between 1957 and 1974.

The Canadians had boycotted these tournaments between 1970 and 1976 after the IIHF had refused to allow them to roster professional players at the World Championships from NHL teams that had not qualified for the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. President Sabetzki managed to find a compromise that resulted in the return of Canada to international events beginning in 1977. The pro players whose teams had been eliminated from the playoffs were allowed to compete and in exchange, Canada agreed to participate in the World Championships. They also waived their right to host any World Championships. The creation of the [[Canada Cup]] (a competition organized by the NHL in Canada every four years) was also part of the new agreement between the IIHF and North American professional hockey.<ref name=\"IIHF1975\"/>\n\n[[Walter Wasservogel]] became the first full-time general secretary of the IIHF in 1978, serving in the role until 1986.<ref name=\"Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/IZone/izone.member.info.do?mem=57|title=2.57 Walter Wasservogel|website=Legends of Hockey|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>\n\nThe first official [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Championships]] for players under 20 years of age was held in 1977. Unofficial tournaments, which were not IIHF-sanctioned and teams were eligible to participate by invitation only, had been contested between 1974 and 1976. It began as a relatively obscure tournament, but soon grew in popularity, particularly in Canada.

In addition, the memberships of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] - all of which had initially joined the IIHF in the 1930s but were expelled following their annexation by the Soviet Union - were renewed. The breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] also resulted in an increase in membership. [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] joined as new members, while the membership of the old Yugoslavia was transferred to [[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]] (which later became known as Serbia and Montenegro and still later dissolved into the independent republics of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]). When [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia broke up]], its membership rights were transferred to the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] was admitted as a new member. The influx of new members resulted in the IIHF increasing the size of the Group A tournament.

This material has long been a puzzle for Mozart scholarship. Some scholars try to understand it in terms of its role in Mozart's family, his society and his times; others attempt to understand it as a result of an \"impressive list\"<ref name=Kammer/> of psychiatric conditions from which Mozart is claimed to have suffered.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:MariaAnnaTheklaMozart.PNG|thumb|upright|Self-portrait in pencil of Maria Anna Thekla Mozart, from 1777 or 1778]]\nA letter of 5. November 1777<ref>''Mozarts B\u00e4sle-Briefe'', [[:File:Baesle Briefe 109.jpg|p. 109]], [[:File:Baesle Briefe 110.jpg|p. 110]]</ref> to Mozart's cousin [[Maria Anna Thekla Mozart]] is an example of Mozart's use of scatology. The German original<ref>\"lezt w\u00fcnsch ich eine gute nacht/scheissen sie ins bett dass es kracht/schlafens gesund/reckens den arsch zum mund\"; Dundes (1984:66)</ref> is in rhymed verse.\n\n{{quote|<poem>Well, I wish you good night\nBut first shit in your bed and make it burst.\nSleep soundly, my love\nInto your mouth your arse you'll shove.<ref>Text and translation from Dundes (1984:66)</ref></poem>}}\n\nMozart's [[canon (music)|canon]] \"[[Leck mich im Arsch]]\" [[K\u00f6chel catalogue|K.]] 231 (K<sup>6</sup> 382c) includes the lyrics:\n\n{{quote|{{lang|de|Leck mich im A[rsch] g'schwindi, g'schwindi!}}}}\n\nThis would be translated into English as \"lick me in the arse/ass,<ref>\"Arse\" is British English, \"ass\" is American.</ref> quickly, quickly!\"\n\n\"Leck mich im Arsch\" is a standard vulgarism in German, euphemistically called the [[Swabian salute]] ({{lang-de| schw\u00e4bische Gru\u00df}}).<ref>Dundes (1984:42\u201348)</ref> The closest English counterpart is \"Kiss my arse/ass\".\n\n==Context==\nDavid Schroeder writes:\n<blockquote>The passage of time has created an almost unbridgeable gulf between ourselves and Mozart's time, forcing us to misread his scatological letters even more drastically than his other letters. Very simply, these letters embarrass us, and we have tried to suppress them, trivialize them, or explain them out of the epistolary canon with pathological excuses.<ref>Schroeder (1999:133)</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor example, when [[Margaret Thatcher]] was apprised of Mozart's scatology during a visit to the theatre to see [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'', director [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]] relates:\n<blockquote>She was not pleased. In her best headmistress style, she gave me a severe wigging for putting on a play that depicted Mozart as a scatological imp with a love of four-letter words. It was inconceivable, she said, that a man who wrote such exquisite and elegant music could be so foul-mouthed. I said that Mozart's letters proved he was just that: he had an extraordinarily infantile sense of humour ... \"I don't think you heard what I said\", replied the Prime Minister. \"He couldn't have been like that\". I offered (and sent) a copy of Mozart's letters to [[10 Downing Street|Number Ten]] the next day; I was even thanked by the appropriate Private Secretary. But it was useless: the Prime Minister said I was wrong, so wrong I was.<ref>Shaffer, Peter. (1985) Preface. ''Amadeus: A Play''. Penguin Books.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Letters===\nBenjamin Simkin, an [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]],<ref name=Byways>Simkin, Benjamin. [http://www.danielpublishing.com/books/suppl/simkin.html Medical and Musical Byways of Mozartiana.] Fithian Press. Retrieved on 28 October 2006.</ref> estimates that 39 of Mozart's letters include scatological passages. Almost all of these are directed to Mozart's own family, specifically his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]], his mother [[Anna Maria Mozart|Anna Maria]], his sister [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]], and his cousin [[Maria Anna Thekla Mozart]]. According to Simkin, Leopold, Anna Maria and Nannerl also included scatological humour in their own letters.<ref>Simkin (1992, 1563) lists one letter containing scatological humor from each of Leopold and Nannerl; and from Anna Maria, one, and another which appears in Anderson (1938:425).</ref> Thus, Anna Maria wrote to her husband (26 September 1777; original is in rhyme):\n\n{{quote|<poem>Are you ready my love.\nStay strong and healthy for the fateful day,\nthe day that I rupture your insides.\nInto your mouth your arse you'll shove.\nI wish you good night, my dear,\nBut first, shit in your bed and make it burst.<ref>Translation from Anderson (1938, 404). The German original reads: \"adio ben mio, leb gesund / Reck den arsch zum mund. / Ich winsch ein guete nacht / Scheiss ins beth das Kracht.\"</ref></poem>}}\n\nEven the relatively straitlaced Leopold used a scatological expression in one letter.<ref>This was \"to shit oranges\", meaning approximately \"to get upset\", using in a letter written from Italy in 1770; Mieder (2003:45)</ref>\n\nSeveral of Mozart's scatological letters were written to his cousin (and probable love interest, according to [[Maynard Solomon|Solomon]])<ref>For a discussion of the evidence that Mozart and his cousin were in love, see Solomon (1996:161\u2013166).</ref> [[Maria Anna Thekla Mozart]]; these are often called the \"B\u00e4sle letters\", after the German word ''B\u00e4sle'', a [[diminutive]] form meaning \"little cousin\". In these letters, written after Mozart had spent a pleasant two weeks with his cousin in her native [[Augsburg]],<ref>Schroeder (1999:87\u201389)</ref> the scatology is combined with word play and sexual references. Robert Spaethling's rendered translation of part of a letter Mozart sent from [[Mannheim]] November 5, 1777:\n\n{{quote|\nDeares cozz buzz!\n\nI have received reprieved your highly esteemed writing biting, and I have noted doted thy my uncle garfuncle, my aunt slant, and you too, are all well mell. We, too thank god, are in good fettle kettle ...

Eh bien, I shall mail fail it for sure. Oui, by the love of my skin, I shit on your nose, so it runs down your chin...<ref>Spaethling (2000:87). The original reads \"Ich habe dero mir so werthes schreiben richtig erhalten falten, und daraus ersehen drehen, da\u00df der H: vetter retter, die fr: baa\u00df has, und sie wie, recht wohl auf sind hind; wir sind auch gott lob und danck recht gesund hund. ... sie schreiben noch ferners, ja, sie lassen sich heraus, sie geben sich blos, sie lassen sich verlauten, sie machen mir zu wissen, sie erkl\u00e4ren sich, sie de\u00fcten mir an, sie benachrichtigen mir, sie machen mir kund, sie geben de\u00fctlich am tage, sie verlangen, sie begehren, sie w\u00fcnschen, sie wollen, sie m\u00f6gen, sie befehlen, da\u00df ich ihnen auch mein Portrait schicken soll schroll. Eh bien, ich werde es ihnen gewis schicken schlicken. Oui, par ma la foi, ich scheiss dir auf d'nasen, so, rinds dir auf d'koi.\"</ref>}}\n\nOne of the letters Mozart wrote to his father while visiting Augsburg reports an encounter Mozart and his cousin had with a priest named Father Emilian:\n{{quote|[He was] an arrogant ass and a simple-minded little wit of his profession ... finally when he was a little drunk, which happened soon, he started on about music. He sang a canon, and said: I have never in my life heard anything more beautiful ... He started. I took the third voice, but I slipped in an entirely different text: 'P[ater] E: o du schwanz, leck mich im arsch' [\"Father Emilian, oh you prick, lick me in the ass\"]. ''[[Sotto voce]]'', to my cousin. Then we laughed together for another half hour.<ref>Translation from Schroeder (1999:135)</ref>}}\n\n===Music===\nMozart's scatological music was most likely recreational and shared among a closed group of inebriated friends. All of it takes the form of [[canon (music)|canon]]s (rounds), in which each voice enters with the same words and music following a delay after the previous voice. Musicologist [[David J. Buch]] writes: {{quote|It may seem strange that Mozart made fair copies, entered these items into his personal works catalogue (in which he tended to omit ephemeral works) and allowed them to be copied. The reason he favored these small and crude pieces in ways similar to his more serious and important works remains a mystery.|Buch (2016), \"Mozart's bawdy canons, vulgarity and debauchery at the Wiednertheater\", ''Eighteenth Century Music''<ref name=\"Buch2016\"/>}}\n\n===Reactions of family and friends===\nIn 1798, Constanze sent her late husband's B\u00e4sle letters to the publishers [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]], who at the time were gathering material in hopes of preparing a Mozart biography.<ref>Solomon (1996:500)</ref> In the accompanying letter she wrote \"Although in dubious taste, the letters to his cousin are full of wit and deserve mentioning, although they cannot of course be published in their entirety.\"<ref>Abert (2008:1360)</ref>\n\n===In the 18th century===\n[[File:Gottfried Prehauser.jpg|thumb|upright|Gottfried Prehauser, an actor of 18th-century Vienna, playing Hanswurst]]\nSchroeder (1999) suggests that in the 18th century scatological humour was far more public and \"mainstream\". The German-language popular theater of Mozart's time was influenced by the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] and emphasized the stock character of [[Hanswurst]], a coarse and robust character who would entertain his audience by pretending to eat large and unlikely objects (for instance, a whole calf), then defecating them.<ref>Schroeder (1999:128)</ref>\n\nSchroeder suggests a political underlay to the scatology in popular theater: its viewers lived under a system of hereditary aristocracy that excluded them from political participation. The vulgarity of scatological popular theater was a counterpoint to the refined culture imposed from above.<ref>Schroeder (1999:127\u2013130)</ref> One of Mozart's own letters describes aristocrats in scatological terms; he identified the aristocrats present at a concert in Augsburg (1777) as \"the Duchess Smackarse, the Countess Pleasurepisser, the Princess Stinkmess, and the two Princes Potbelly von Pigdick\".<ref>English rendering from Schroeder (1999:135). The original German reads \"Duche\u00dfe arschb\u00f6merl, die gr\u00e4fin brunzgern, die f\u00fcrstin richzumtreck, und die 2 Princzen Mu\u00dfbauch von Sauschwanz\".</ref>\n\n===In German culture===\nThe folklorist and cultural anthropologist [[Alan Dundes]] suggested that interest in or tolerance for scatological matters is a specific trait of German national culture, one which is retained to this day:<ref>Mozart's nationality was, strictly speaking, that of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg]]. His letters indicate he felt his nationality to be German (see e.g. his letter to his father of 17 August 1782; Mersman (1972:204)); this was natural in a time when the territory comprising modern Austria and Germany was a patchwork of mostly small nation-states.</ref>\n{{quote|In German folklore, one finds an inordinate number of texts concerned with anality. Schei\u00dfe (shit), Dreck (dirt), Mist (manure), Arsch (ass), and other locutions are commonplace. Folksongs, folktales, proverbs, folk speech\u2014all attest to the Germans' longstanding special interest in this area of human activity. I am not claiming that other peoples of the world do not express a healthy concern for this area, but rather that the Germans appear to be preoccupied with such themes. It is thus not so much a matter of difference as it is of degree.<ref>Dundes (1984:9)</ref>}}\n\nDundes (1984) provides ample coverage of scatological humor in Mozart, but also cites scatological texts from [[Martin Luther]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Heinrich Heine]], and other luminaries of German culture. Karhausen (1993) asserts that \"scatology was common in Mitteleuropa [central Europe]\", noting for instance that Mozart's Salzburg colleague [[Michael Haydn]] also wrote a scatological canon.<ref>Karhausen (1993). Haydn's canon was entitled \"Schei\u00df nieder, armer S\u00fcnder\", which Karhausen renders as \"Shit fast, poor sinner\".</ref>\n\nSome of the phrases used by Mozart in his scatological material were not original with him but were part of the folklore and culture of his day: Mieder (2003) describes the B\u00e4sle letters as involving \"Mozart's intentional play with what is for the most part preformulated folk speech\".<ref>Mieder (2003:50)</ref> An example given by Robert Spaethling is the folkloric origin of a phrase seen above, \"Gute Nacht, schei\u00df ins Bett dass' Kracht\", claimed by Spaethling to be a \"children's rhyme that is still current in south German language areas today\".<ref>Spaethling (2000:18). As Spaethling notes, the rhyme also appears in Mozart's canon \"[[Bona nox]]\", and in an Italian translation (\"cacate nel letto che egli f\u00e0 fracasso\") is found a 1770 letter to his mother and sister written in Italy.</ref> Likewise, when Mozart sang to [[Aloysia Weber]] the words \"Leck mich das Mensch im Arsch, das mich nicht will\" (\"Whoever doesn't want me can kiss my ass\") on the occasion of being romantically rejected by her, he was evidently singing an existing folk tune, not a song of his own invention.<ref>See Solomon (1996:169, 552), citing Bl\u00fcmml.</ref>\n\n==Medical accounts==\n{{See also|Societal and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome#Speculation about notable individuals}}\n\nAn early 20th-century observer who suspected that Mozart's scatological materials could be interpreted by psychological pathologies was the Austrian writer [[Stefan Zweig]], who amassed a large collection of musical manuscripts. His collection included the B\u00e4sle letters (at the time, unpublished) as well as the autographs of Mozart's scatological canons \"[[Difficile lectu]]\" and \"[[O du eselhafter Peierl]]\".<ref>Searle (1986)</ref> Zweig sent copies of the B\u00e4sle letters to the celebrated psychiatrist [[Sigmund Freud]] with the following suggestion:\n\n{{quote|These nine letters ... throw a psychologically very remarkable light on his erotic nature, which, more so than any other important man, has elements of [[Psychosexual development|infantilism]] and [[coprophilia]]. It would actually be a very interesting study for one of your pupils.<ref>Quoted from Schroeder (1999:127)</ref>}}\n\nFreud apparently declined Zweig's suggestion. As Schroeder notes, later psychobiographers seized on the letters as evidence for psychopathological tendencies in Mozart.<ref>Schroeder (1999:127)</ref>\n\nSome authors in the 1990s interpreted the material as evidence that Mozart had [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS).<ref>Gunne, L.M.

The German original<ref>\"lezt w\u00fcnsch ich eine gute nacht/scheissen sie ins bett dass es kracht/schlafens gesund/reckens den arsch zum mund\"; Dundes (1984:66)</ref> is in rhymed verse.\n\n{{quote|<poem>Well, I wish you good night\nBut first shit in your bed and make it burst.\nSleep soundly, my love\nInto your mouth your arse you'll shove.<ref>Text and translation from Dundes (1984:66)</ref></poem>}}\n\nMozart's [[canon (music)|canon]] \"[[Leck mich im Arsch]]\" [[K\u00f6chel catalogue|K.]] 231 (K<sup>6</sup> 382c) includes the lyrics:\n\n{{quote|{{lang|de|Leck mich im A[rsch] g'schwindi, g'schwindi!}}}}\n\nThis would be translated into English as \"lick me in the arse/ass,<ref>\"Arse\" is British English, \"ass\" is American.</ref> quickly, quickly!\"\n\n\"Leck mich im Arsch\" is a standard vulgarism in German, euphemistically called the [[Swabian salute]] ({{lang-de| schw\u00e4bische Gru\u00df}}).<ref>Dundes (1984:42\u201348)</ref> The closest English counterpart is \"Kiss my arse/ass\".\n\n==Context==\nDavid Schroeder writes:\n<blockquote>The passage of time has created an almost unbridgeable gulf between ourselves and Mozart's time, forcing us to misread his scatological letters even more drastically than his other letters. Very simply, these letters embarrass us, and we have tried to suppress them, trivialize them, or explain them out of the epistolary canon with pathological excuses.<ref>Schroeder (1999:133)</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor example, when [[Margaret Thatcher]] was apprised of Mozart's scatology during a visit to the theatre to see [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'', director [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]] relates:\n<blockquote>She was not pleased. In her best headmistress style, she gave me a severe wigging for putting on a play that depicted Mozart as a scatological imp with a love of four-letter words. It was inconceivable, she said, that a man who wrote such exquisite and elegant music could be so foul-mouthed. I said that Mozart's letters proved he was just that: he had an extraordinarily infantile sense of humour ... \"I don't think you heard what I said\", replied the Prime Minister. \"He couldn't have been like that\". I offered (and sent) a copy of Mozart's letters to [[10 Downing Street|Number Ten]] the next day; I was even thanked by the appropriate Private Secretary. But it was useless: the Prime Minister said I was wrong, so wrong I was.<ref>Shaffer, Peter. (1985) Preface. ''Amadeus: A Play''.

[http://www.danielpublishing.com/books/suppl/simkin.html Medical and Musical Byways of Mozartiana.] Fithian Press. Retrieved on 28 October 2006.</ref> estimates that 39 of Mozart's letters include scatological passages. Almost all of these are directed to Mozart's own family, specifically his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]], his mother [[Anna Maria Mozart|Anna Maria]], his sister [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]], and his cousin [[Maria Anna Thekla Mozart]]. According to Simkin, Leopold, Anna Maria and Nannerl also included scatological humour in their own letters.<ref>Simkin (1992, 1563) lists one letter containing scatological humor from each of Leopold and Nannerl; and from Anna Maria, one, and another which appears in Anderson (1938:425).</ref> Thus, Anna Maria wrote to her husband (26 September 1777; original is in rhyme):\n\n{{quote|<poem>Are you ready my love.\nStay strong and healthy for the fateful day,\nthe day that I rupture your insides.\nInto your mouth your arse you'll shove.\nI wish you good night, my dear,\nBut first, shit in your bed and make it burst.<ref>Translation from Anderson (1938, 404). The German original reads: \"adio ben mio, leb gesund / Reck den arsch zum mund. / Ich winsch ein guete nacht / Scheiss ins beth das Kracht.\"</ref></poem>}}\n\nEven the relatively straitlaced Leopold used a scatological expression in one letter.<ref>This was \"to shit oranges\", meaning approximately \"to get upset\", using in a letter written from Italy in 1770; Mieder (2003:45)</ref>\n\nSeveral of Mozart's scatological letters were written to his cousin (and probable love interest, according to [[Maynard Solomon|Solomon]])<ref>For a discussion of the evidence that Mozart and his cousin were in love, see Solomon (1996:161\u2013166).</ref> [[Maria Anna Thekla Mozart]]; these are often called the \"B\u00e4sle letters\", after the German word ''B\u00e4sle'', a [[diminutive]] form meaning \"little cousin\". In these letters, written after Mozart had spent a pleasant two weeks with his cousin in her native [[Augsburg]],<ref>Schroeder (1999:87\u201389)</ref> the scatology is combined with word play and sexual references. Robert Spaethling's rendered translation of part of a letter Mozart sent from [[Mannheim]] November 5, 1777:\n\n{{quote|\nDeares cozz buzz!\n\nI have received reprieved your highly esteemed writing biting, and I have noted doted thy my uncle garfuncle, my aunt slant, and you too, are all well mell.

I took the third voice, but I slipped in an entirely different text: 'P[ater] E: o du schwanz, leck mich im arsch' [\"Father Emilian, oh you prick, lick me in the ass\"]. ''[[Sotto voce]]'', to my cousin. Then we laughed together for another half hour.<ref>Translation from Schroeder (1999:135)</ref>}}\n\n===Music===\nMozart's scatological music was most likely recreational and shared among a closed group of inebriated friends. All of it takes the form of [[canon (music)|canon]]s (rounds), in which each voice enters with the same words and music following a delay after the previous voice. Musicologist [[David J. Buch]] writes: {{quote|It may seem strange that Mozart made fair copies, entered these items into his personal works catalogue (in which he tended to omit ephemeral works) and allowed them to be copied. The reason he favored these small and crude pieces in ways similar to his more serious and important works remains a mystery.|Buch (2016), \"Mozart's bawdy canons, vulgarity and debauchery at the Wiednertheater\", ''Eighteenth Century Music''<ref name=\"Buch2016\"/>}}\n\n===Reactions of family and friends===\nIn 1798, Constanze sent her late husband's B\u00e4sle letters to the publishers [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]], who at the time were gathering material in hopes of preparing a Mozart biography.<ref>Solomon (1996:500)</ref> In the accompanying letter she wrote \"Although in dubious taste, the letters to his cousin are full of wit and deserve mentioning, although they cannot of course be published in their entirety.\"<ref>Abert (2008:1360)</ref>\n\n===In the 18th century===\n[[File:Gottfried Prehauser.jpg|thumb|upright|Gottfried Prehauser, an actor of 18th-century Vienna, playing Hanswurst]]\nSchroeder (1999) suggests that in the 18th century scatological humour was far more public and \"mainstream\". The German-language popular theater of Mozart's time was influenced by the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] and emphasized the stock character of [[Hanswurst]], a coarse and robust character who would entertain his audience by pretending to eat large and unlikely objects (for instance, a whole calf), then defecating them.<ref>Schroeder (1999:128)</ref>\n\nSchroeder suggests a political underlay to the scatology in popular theater: its viewers lived under a system of hereditary aristocracy that excluded them from political participation. The vulgarity of scatological popular theater was a counterpoint to the refined culture imposed from above.<ref>Schroeder (1999:127\u2013130)</ref> One of Mozart's own letters describes aristocrats in scatological terms; he identified the aristocrats present at a concert in Augsburg (1777) as \"the Duchess Smackarse, the Countess Pleasurepisser, the Princess Stinkmess, and the two Princes Potbelly von Pigdick\".<ref>English rendering from Schroeder (1999:135). The original German reads \"Duche\u00dfe arschb\u00f6merl, die gr\u00e4fin brunzgern, die f\u00fcrstin richzumtreck, und die 2 Princzen Mu\u00dfbauch von Sauschwanz\".</ref>\n\n===In German culture===\nThe folklorist and cultural anthropologist [[Alan Dundes]] suggested that interest in or tolerance for scatological matters is a specific trait of German national culture, one which is retained to this day:<ref>Mozart's nationality was, strictly speaking, that of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg]]. His letters indicate he felt his nationality to be German (see e.g. his letter to his father of 17 August 1782; Mersman (1972:204)); this was natural in a time when the territory comprising modern Austria and Germany was a patchwork of mostly small nation-states.</ref>\n{{quote|In German folklore, one finds an inordinate number of texts concerned with anality. Schei\u00dfe (shit), Dreck (dirt), Mist (manure), Arsch (ass), and other locutions are commonplace. Folksongs, folktales, proverbs, folk speech\u2014all attest to the Germans' longstanding special interest in this area of human activity. I am not claiming that other peoples of the world do not express a healthy concern for this area, but rather that the Germans appear to be preoccupied with such themes. It is thus not so much a matter of difference as it is of degree.<ref>Dundes (1984:9)</ref>}}\n\nDundes (1984) provides ample coverage of scatological humor in Mozart, but also cites scatological texts from [[Martin Luther]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Heinrich Heine]], and other luminaries of German culture. Karhausen (1993) asserts that \"scatology was common in Mitteleuropa [central Europe]\", noting for instance that Mozart's Salzburg colleague [[Michael Haydn]] also wrote a scatological canon.<ref>Karhausen (1993). Haydn's canon was entitled \"Schei\u00df nieder, armer S\u00fcnder\", which Karhausen renders as \"Shit fast, poor sinner\".</ref>\n\nSome of the phrases used by Mozart in his scatological material were not original with him but were part of the folklore and culture of his day: Mieder (2003) describes the B\u00e4sle letters as involving \"Mozart's intentional play with what is for the most part preformulated folk speech\".<ref>Mieder (2003:50)</ref> An example given by Robert Spaethling is the folkloric origin of a phrase seen above, \"Gute Nacht, schei\u00df ins Bett dass' Kracht\", claimed by Spaethling to be a \"children's rhyme that is still current in south German language areas today\".<ref>Spaethling (2000:18). As Spaethling notes, the rhyme also appears in Mozart's canon \"[[Bona nox]]\", and in an Italian translation (\"cacate nel letto che egli f\u00e0 fracasso\") is found a 1770 letter to his mother and sister written in Italy.</ref> Likewise, when Mozart sang to [[Aloysia Weber]] the words \"Leck mich das Mensch im Arsch, das mich nicht will\" (\"Whoever doesn't want me can kiss my ass\") on the occasion of being romantically rejected by her, he was evidently singing an existing folk tune, not a song of his own invention.<ref>See Solomon (1996:169, 552), citing Bl\u00fcmml.</ref>\n\n==Medical accounts==\n{{See also|Societal and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome#Speculation about notable individuals}}\n\nAn early 20th-century observer who suspected that Mozart's scatological materials could be interpreted by psychological pathologies was the Austrian writer [[Stefan Zweig]], who amassed a large collection of musical manuscripts. His collection included the B\u00e4sle letters (at the time, unpublished) as well as the autographs of Mozart's scatological canons \"[[Difficile lectu]]\" and \"[[O du eselhafter Peierl]]\".<ref>Searle (1986)</ref> Zweig sent copies of the B\u00e4sle letters to the celebrated psychiatrist [[Sigmund Freud]] with the following suggestion:\n\n{{quote|These nine letters ... throw a psychologically very remarkable light on his erotic nature, which, more so than any other important man, has elements of [[Psychosexual development|infantilism]] and [[coprophilia]]. It would actually be a very interesting study for one of your pupils.<ref>Quoted from Schroeder (1999:127)</ref>}}\n\nFreud apparently declined Zweig's suggestion. As Schroeder notes, later psychobiographers seized on the letters as evidence for psychopathological tendencies in Mozart.<ref>Schroeder (1999:127)</ref>\n\nSome authors in the 1990s interpreted the material as evidence that Mozart had [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS).<ref>Gunne, L.M.

He specialises in Romanticism and the poetry of [[John Keats]], surveillance studies and ecocriticism. He is professor of English Literature at [[Aberystwyth University]], and between 2013 and 2018 was that institution's Professor of Engagement with the Public Imagination. \n\n==Life==\nMarggraf Turley was born in the [[Forest of Dean]]. He moved to Wales at the age of seven, was educated at [[King Henry VIII School, Abergavenny]], and read English at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]].\n\n== Writer ==\nHe is author of three poetry collections: ''The Fossil Box'' (2007), concerned with the urgency of place and origins; ''Whiteout'' (2006), co-authored with Damian Walford Davies; and ''Wan-Hu's Flying Chair'' (2009), which won the 2010 [[Wales Book of the Year]] 'People's Choice' prize.\n\nIn 2007, he won first prize in the tenth-anniversary [[Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry]].

Out of concern for his safety, the man is not fully identified in the film and is credited only as \"anonymous,\" as are many of the film's crew positions. Some shots consist of the man watching (what seems to be) extra footage from ''The Act of Killing'', which includes video of the men who killed his brother. He visits some of the killers and their collaborators\u2014including his uncle\u2014under the pretense of an eye exam. Although none of the killers expresses any remorse, the daughter of one of them is clearly shaken when she hears, apparently for the first time, the details of the killings.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was screened in the official competition at the [[71st Venice International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Venice\">{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/71st-festival/line-up/off-sel/venezia71/ |title=International competition of feature films |accessdate=24 July 2014 |work=Venice |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083927/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/71st-festival/line-up/off-sel/venezia71/ |archivedate=6 October 2014  }}</ref><ref name=\"Deadline\">{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/07/venice-film-festival-lineup-2014-movie-list/ |title=Venice Film Festival Lineup Announced |accessdate=24 July 2014 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> where it won the Grand Jury Prize, the International Film Critics Award ([[FIPRESCI]]), the Italian online critics award (Mouse d'Oro), the [[European Film Critics Award]] (FEDEORA), as well as the Human Rights Nights Award.<ref name=\"BBCAwards\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29098103 |title=Roy Andersson film scoops Venice Golden Lion award |date=7 September 2014 |accessdate=7 September 2014 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Since then, it has gone on to win multiple awards, including Best World Documentary (Cinephile Prize) at the [[Busan International Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/busan-festival-announces-vision-awards-1201326583/|title=Busan Festival Announces Vision Awards|author=Patrick Frater|work=Variety}}</ref> the Grand Prize (DOX Award) at [[CPH:DOX]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/filmogtv/ECE2454846/joshua-oppenheimer-vinder-hovedprisen-paa-cphdox/|title=Joshua Oppenheimer vinder hovedprisen p\u00e5 CPH:DOX|work=politiken.dk}}</ref> the prize for Best Documentary at the Starz Denver Film Festival,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodintoto.com/viva-la-liberta-capturing-grace-starz-denver-film-festival-winners/|title='Viva la Liberta,' 'Capturing Grace' Win SDFF Awards|work=Hollywood in Toto}}</ref> a [[Danish Arts Council]] Award for outstanding achievement in filmmaking,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kunst.dk/kunstomraader/film/nyheder/tre-af-aarets-danske-film-udvalgt-af-statens-kunstfond/|title=Tre af \u00e5rets danske film udvalgt af Statens Kunstfond|work=kunst.dk}}</ref> and the Best Film Award at the [[One World human rights documentary film festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://oneworld.cz/2015/awarded-films|title = Awarded Films|date =11 March 2015|accessdate =12 March 2015|website = One World 2015 international human rights documentary film festival|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the film has screened at the [[Telluride Film Festival]], [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[New York Film Festival]], [[Zurich Film Festival]], IDFA ([[International Documentary Festival Amsterdam]]), and MIFF ([[Melbourne International Film Festival]]).\n\nOn 10 November 2014, 2,000 people came to the official and public premiere of the film in Jakarta.

After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.&nbsp; Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to \"chaos,\" elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the ''Diamond Princess''. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into \"breeding grounds\" of COVID-19.<ref name=\"nippon1\">[https://www.nippon.com/en/news/l00269/coronavirus-basic-policy-impacts-japan%e2%80%99s-health-education-systems.html?cx_recs_click=true \"Coronavirus Basic Policy Impacts Japan\u2019s Health, Education Systems\"]. Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a \"second wave\" of the disease in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000608425.pdf|title=Views on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control (Summary Version)|last=The Government of Japan, Expert Meeting on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (in English)|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000606000.pdf|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u898b\u89e3|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70|language=ja|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.

Initial debate focused on constitutional reform due to the task force's apprehension that the Japanese Constitution may restrict the government's ability to enact such compulsory measures as quarantines on the grounds that it violated human rights.  After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties \u2013 including the [[Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan]], and [[Democratic Party for the People]] \u2013 voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/05/national/japan-lawmakers-coronavirus-crisis-state-of-emergency-clause-rights/#.XmFZMpNKgUE \"Lawmakers slammed for using coronavirus to justify emergency clause for Japan's Constitution, curbing rights\"].

After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.&nbsp; Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to \"chaos,\" elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the ''Diamond Princess''. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into \"breeding grounds\" of COVID-19.<ref name=\"nippon1\">[https://www.nippon.com/en/news/l00269/coronavirus-basic-policy-impacts-japan%e2%80%99s-health-education-systems.html?cx_recs_click=true \"Coronavirus Basic Policy Impacts Japan\u2019s Health, Education Systems\"]. Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a \"second wave\" of the disease in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000608425.pdf|title=Views on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control (Summary Version)|last=The Government of Japan, Expert Meeting on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (in English)|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000606000.pdf|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u898b\u89e3|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70|language=ja|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.

Initial debate focused on constitutional reform due to the task force's apprehension that the Japanese Constitution may restrict the government's ability to enact such compulsory measures as quarantines on the grounds that it violated human rights.  After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties \u2013 including the [[Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan]], and [[Democratic Party for the People]] \u2013 voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/05/national/japan-lawmakers-coronavirus-crisis-state-of-emergency-clause-rights/#.XmFZMpNKgUE \"Lawmakers slammed for using coronavirus to justify emergency clause for Japan's Constitution, curbing rights\"].
