Trains are usually powered by the [[Norfolk and Western]] #620, however, at times the Southern #6133 or Southern #2601 is used. These two engines also assist in special events where two or more trains are operating. Though the museum has no operating steam locomotives of its own, but occasionally has visiting steam locomotives such as [[Lehigh Valley]] Coal 0-6-0T #126, Flag Coal Company 0-4-0T #75, and Jeddo Coal Company 0-4-0T #85, all owned by the Gramling Locomotive Works of Ashley, IN. \n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the [[Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum]]'s [[Southern Railway 630|Southern 2-8-0 #630]] visited the museum offering employee and public excursions to [[Barber, NC]] and [[Winston-Salem, NC]]. From 2014 to 2015, the [[Norfolk and Western 611]] (owned by the [[Virginia Museum of Transportation]]) was restored to operating condition at the museum, and ran public excursions departing from Spencer in 2016 and 2017. Destinations included [[Lynchburg, VA]], [[Asheville, NC]], [[Charlotte, NC]], and [[Greensboro, NC]]. The #611 has also been used on site for \"At The Throttle\" and \"Be The Fireman\" sessions, Cab Rides, Caboose Rides, and it has pulled the Museum's Passenger Train. \n\nAlso in 2015, the American 4-4-0 \"Leviathan\" locomotive visited the museum for the Lincoln Funeral Train event, commemorating 150 years since that event took place.

In 2014, the museum hosted Streamliners at Spencer, with notable 1930s - 1950s era locomotives gathered around the Bob Julian Roundhouse turntable for a four-day event. Streamliners at Spencer included the Class J 611 Steam Passenger locomotive, visiting from the Virginia Museum of Transportation. This notable locomotive remained in Spencer for repair and restoration work to allow it to once again pull passenger excursions across the southeast.<ref name=MovesYou/>\n\nAnnual events include Day Out With Thomas, the Polar Express, Fire Truck Show, Automobile shows, A Tractor Show, the Harvest Festival, the Easter Bunny Express, Valentine Wine and Dine trains, and the new Brew and Choo Beer Train.

These include: several [[Model T]]s, a Model A, and even a [[Ford Model N|Ford Model R]] (the 1907 predecessor to the Model T). A Highway Patrol car from 1935, a [[Divco]] Milk Truck, a Lincoln Continental and others are also part of the museum's collection.<ref name=RDRR/>\n\nIn 2005, the museum's Back Shop underwent a massive renovation, which included repairs to the roof, re-pointing of the brick, and a stabilization of the building's floor. This building, where the full overhaul of steam locomotives once took place, is most notable for its size. It is two football fields long and nearly three stories tall.<ref name=2FootballFields> {{cite web |url=http://www.nctrans.org/Media/Press-Kit/Museum-Information.aspx |title=Museum Information |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= N.C.

In 2009, the museum opened the Back Shop to the public for the first time, with an access ramp on the south end. In 2017 the backshop was opened completely, allowing more exhibits.\n\n==Heritage railroad==\n[[File:Southern Railway 6133.jpg|alt=Southern 6133|thumb|The Southern Railway #6133 FP7 Diesel Locomotive]]\nThe museum has a [[heritage railway|heritage railroad]], which operates [[passenger]] [[excursion]] [[trains]] on a seasonal schedule. Trains are usually powered by the [[Norfolk and Western]] #620, however, at times the Southern #6133 or Southern #2601 is used. These two engines also assist in special events where two or more trains are operating. Though the museum has no operating steam locomotives of its own, but occasionally has visiting steam locomotives such as [[Lehigh Valley]] Coal 0-6-0T #126, Flag Coal Company 0-4-0T #75, and Jeddo Coal Company 0-4-0T #85, all owned by the Gramling Locomotive Works of Ashley, IN. \n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the [[Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum]]'s [[Southern Railway 630|Southern 2-8-0 #630]] visited the museum offering employee and public excursions to [[Barber, NC]] and [[Winston-Salem, NC]]. From 2014 to 2015, the [[Norfolk and Western 611]] (owned by the [[Virginia Museum of Transportation]]) was restored to operating condition at the museum, and ran public excursions departing from Spencer in 2016 and 2017. Destinations included [[Lynchburg, VA]], [[Asheville, NC]], [[Charlotte, NC]], and [[Greensboro, NC]]. The #611 has also been used on site for \"At The Throttle\" and \"Be The Fireman\" sessions, Cab Rides, Caboose Rides, and it has pulled the Museum's Passenger Train. \n\nAlso in 2015, the American 4-4-0 \"Leviathan\" locomotive visited the museum for the Lincoln Funeral Train event, commemorating 150 years since that event took place.

In 2012, the Bob Julian Roundhouse was the stage for all 20 of Norfolk Southern's Heritage locomotives during a two-day photographic event. In 2014, the museum hosted Streamliners at Spencer, with notable 1930s - 1950s era locomotives gathered around the Bob Julian Roundhouse turntable for a four-day event. Streamliners at Spencer included the Class J 611 Steam Passenger locomotive, visiting from the Virginia Museum of Transportation. This notable locomotive remained in Spencer for repair and restoration work to allow it to once again pull passenger excursions across the southeast.<ref name=MovesYou/>\n\nAnnual events include Day Out With Thomas, the Polar Express, Fire Truck Show, Automobile shows, A Tractor Show, the Harvest Festival, the Easter Bunny Express, Valentine Wine and Dine trains, and the new Brew and Choo Beer Train. The NCTM is also host to Boy Scout Rail Camp, which allows for Boy Scouts and Leaders to camp out on the historic facility and earn the railroading merit badge. It is the largest railroad related scouting event in the nation.<ref name=MovesYou/>\n\n==Collection==\n{{stack|\n[[File:Seaboard_544.jpg|thumb|right|Seaboard Air Line #544, one of over 200 undelivered [[Russian locomotive class Ye|Russian Decapods]].]]\n[[File:Southern Railway E8 6900 (2970097499).jpg|thumb|Southern E-Unit # 6900.]]\n}}\n\nThe museum contains steam and diesel locomotives.\n\n===Steam===\n*Graham County Railroad Company [[Shay locomotive|3-truck shay]] #1925\n*[[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] 4-6-0 #1031\n*[[Southern Railway 542|Southern 2-8-0 #542]]\n*[[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] 2-10-0 #544\n*[[Carolina Power & Light Company]] 0-4-0F #3\n*Duke Power Company 0-4-0ST #111\n*W.R.
