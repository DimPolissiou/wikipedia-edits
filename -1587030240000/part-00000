In 1972, Patterson turned face again, after feuding with [[Lawrence Heinemi|Lars Anderson]], who was managed by Dr. Ken Ramey.  Later that year, he teamed with [[Rocky Johnson]] and won the tag team championship. In 1975 and 1981, Patterson won the [[Cow Palace]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]] in San Francisco.\n\n=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1977) ===\nIn 1977, Patterson wrestled for [[Eddie Graham]]'s [[Tampa]], [[Florida]]-based [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] promotion. During his run, he won the [[NWA Florida Television Championship]] and the [[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]], as well as briefly serving as [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]].<ref name=\"Oliver2007\">{{cite book|author=Greg Oliver|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-6DoPuiRkEC&pg=PA275|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-284-2|pages=275}}</ref><ref name=\"Lentz\"/>\n\n=== American Wrestling Association (1978\u20131983) ===\nIn 1978, Patterson joined [[Verne Gagne]]'s [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]-based [[American Wrestling Association]]. He reformed The Blond Bombers with Ray Stevens, with the duo winning the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] later that year. Patterson performed intermittently for the AWA until 1983.<ref name=\"LapradeHebert2013\"/>\n\n=== New Japan Pro Wrestling (1979) ===\nIn 1979, Patterson toured Japan with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\n=== Lutte Internationale (1980\u20131983) ===\nPatterson made his professional return to Quebec in 1980, wrestling a number of bouts for the Montreal, Quebec-based [[Lutte Internationale]] promotion. He held the [[Canadian International Tag Team Championship]] on five occasions between 1980 and 1983.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE ===\n\n==== North American Champion (1979) ====\nIn 1979, Patterson debuted in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]  (WWF), working as a [[Heel (wrestling)|heel]], under the tutelage of manager [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]]. As a villain, Patterson's primary feuds were with then [[WWF North American Championship|WWF North American Champion]] [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]]. During a television taping on June 19 in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], Patterson defeated DiBiase for the WWF North American Championship by using a pair of brass knuckles to knock out DiBiase. Patterson was unsuccessful, however, in winning the WWF Heavyweight Championship from Backlund.\n\n==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and retirement (1979\u20131984) ====\nIn September 1979, the WWE would introduce the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]],  a secondary championship for its midcard wrestlers. Patterson was crowned the company's first Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion after an alleged tournament held in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. While Patterson's tournament \"victory\" is widely listed in wrestling title and match histories, the tournament itself never actually took place. Patterson's apocryphal title victory would later become something of an inside joke during Patterson's on-screen tenure as one of [[Vince McMahon]]'s \"stooges\". The fictional tournament was also later profiled in-depth on WWE.com as an [[April Fool's]] joke. On November 8, Patterson dropped the North American title to [[Seiji Sakaguchi]].\n\nIt was during Patterson's reign as champion that he turned face, after a botched attempt by the Grand Wizard to \"sell\" Patterson's contract to [[Lou Albano|\"Captain\" Lou Albano]] for $100,000; Albano's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, the Wild Samoans, attacked Patterson after he cut a promo insulting Albano. Patterson held the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship until April 21, 1980 when he was defeated by [[Ken Patera]] in [[New York City|New York City, New York]]. The match ended in controversial fashion after Patterson placed his right leg on the ropes just before the three count was made. On May 4, 1981, Patterson's feud with [[Sgt. Slaughter]] culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Bootcamp match]] in [[Madison Square Garden]]. The match was voted [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]] by the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''.<ref name=\"LapradeHebert2013\"/>\n\n==== Backstage roles (1984\u20131997) ====\nPatterson began doing color commentary in 1980 with Vince McMahon, calling ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling]]'' from 1980-84. While Patterson was a face commentator when partnered with [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Vince McMahon]], he hosted a heel interview segment for French WWF broadcasts known as \"Le [[brunch]] de Pat\", where he would politely ask questions in [[English language|English]] but furtively mock his face guests in [[French language|French]]. Patterson was on commentary with Monsoon when [[Hulk Hogan]] defeated [[The Iron Sheik]] for the world heavyweight championship, as well as for when Sheik defeated [[Bob Backlund]]. Patterson was also calling the action when [[Jimmy Snuka]] jumped off the steel cage and splashed [[Don Muraco]] in [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1983.\n\nPatterson retired from wrestling in 1984.  Although retired, Patterson continued to occasionally wrestle. On January 26, 1985 he wrestled Nikolai Volkoff in a losing effort in a house show in Cincinnati, OH.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm</ref> The following month he teamed with Andre the Giant at a pair of house shows in Canada and defeated Ken Patera and Big John Studd. He took the spot of Mad Dog Vachon on the WWF skit show Le brunch on WWF Superstars in Canada till late summer 1987, then several wrestlers like the Rougeau Bros and Dino Bravo replace him, and then Frenchie Martin hosted LE Studio as a replacement of Le Brunch. Before that he made another appearance, this time in a battle royal in Montreal on February 24, 1987. He also appeared in a battle royal at a house show in Buffalo, NY on December 27. Patterson made a handful of additional appearances in Montreal in 1987, wrestling as a heel (while remaining a face or neutral backstage official in the United States and elsewhere in Canada). His most notable appearance was a win over the up-and-coming [[Brutus Beefcake]] on August 10 <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm</ref> His final match would come three weeks later in Montreal as he fell in defeat to Beefcake. and he got a haircut.\n\nHe began working backstage as a [[Road Agent (Wrestling)|road agent]] and right-hand man to WWF promoter Vince McMahon, and is credited with inventing and [[Booker (professional wrestling)|booking]] the Royal Rumble match. In the late 1990s, he also worked in the talent-relations department.<ref name=\"MolinaroMeltzer2002\">{{cite book|author1=John F.

He was selected as the in-ring referee for the main event at the first ever [[WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] on [[WrestleMania I|March 31, 1985]], a well as the main event of [[WrestleMania XI]].\n\nIn 1992, Patterson was accused of [[sexual harassment]] by former [[ring announcer]] Murray Hodgson.<ref>{{cite book|author=Irv Muchnick|title=Wrestling Babylon: Piledriving Tales of Drugs, Sex, Death, and Scandal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVg5JWqh3YC&pg=PA66|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-286-6|page=66}}</ref> He was briefly released from the company until the charges were dropped, when he was promptly rehired.\n\n==== \"Stooge\" (1997\u20132000) ====\n{{see also|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The McMahon-Helmsley Faction}}\nIn 1997, Patterson, along with [[Gerald Brisco]], became comedy heels as the on-screen [[Stooge (comedian)|stooges]] of Vince McMahon, assisting their boss in his rivalries with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]. Patterson and Brisco were among the founding members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. In order to mock [[Hulk Hogan]], they used \"Real American\" as their [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] and parodied Hogan's flexing routine as they approached the ring. on the May 18, 1998 episode of Raw, Patterson and Brisco competed in a 2 on 1 Street Fight against Stone Cold that ended in a no contest when Vince Mcmahon and [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] attacked Stone Cold.\n\nLater in 1999, the two became entangled with the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]]. On the December 16, 1999 episode of ''SmackDown'', Patterson and Brisco helped [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], who had been injured by [[D-Generation X]]. [[Triple H]] and [[Stephanie McMahon]] then forced Patterson and Brisco to compete for  the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] against [[The New Age Outlaws]] or be fired. Patterson and Brisco lost the match. In 2000, Patterson and Brisco joined Triple and Stephanie. On the May 8 episode of Raw, Patterson, [[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] faced [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] in a 3 on 1 handicap match and were disqualified after Patterson hit Rikishi with a chair. Afterwards, Patterson lowered his drawers to deliver a [[Stink Face]] to Rikishi with stained [[underwear]], which commentator [[Jim Ross]] described as a \"tractor-sized skidmark\". On June 12, 2000, when the Faction unmasked [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], Patterson photographed Kane's \"hideously scarred\" face, and threatened to \"expose him to the world\" if he did not comply. Kane was forced to wrestle [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (then his ally) in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No disqualification match|No Holds Barred match]]. When Patterson's [[Photographic film|film]] did not develop properly, Kane turned on the Faction.\n\nOn June 19, 2000 Patterson helped Brisco win the perpetually contested [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]] from [[Crash Holly]] but during the victory celebration turned on his ally, blinding him with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] and then breaking a second bottle over Brisco's head, and pinning the (kayfabe) unconscious champion. Brisco pursued Patterson into the women's locker room, where Patterson was hiding in drag. Subsequently, Vince McMahon scheduled them to fight over Hardcore Championship in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Evening Gown match|Evening Gown match]] at [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring 2000]]; in the course of the match, [[Crash Holly]] attacked both men and pinned Patterson to become Hardcore Champion.<ref name=\"DixonFurious2014\">{{cite book|author1=James Dixon|author2=Arnold Furious|author3=Lee Maughan|author4=Bob Dahlstrom|author5=Rick Ashley|title=The Complete WWF Video Guide Volume V|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZqdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA90|date=April 3, 2014|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-291-81693-8|pages=90}}{{self-published source|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTH}}{{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}<ref name=\"Undelson\">{{cite book|author=Ben Undelson|title=Fiction.

In 1972, Patterson turned face again, after feuding with [[Lawrence Heinemi|Lars Anderson]], who was managed by Dr. Ken Ramey.  Later that year, he teamed with [[Rocky Johnson]] and won the tag team championship.

He held the [[Canadian International Tag Team Championship]] on five occasions between 1980 and 1983.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE ===\n\n==== North American Champion (1979) ====\nIn 1979, Patterson debuted in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]  (WWF), working as a [[Heel (wrestling)|heel]], under the tutelage of manager [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]]. As a villain, Patterson's primary feuds were with then [[WWF North American Championship|WWF North American Champion]] [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]]. During a television taping on June 19 in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], Patterson defeated DiBiase for the WWF North American Championship by using a pair of brass knuckles to knock out DiBiase. Patterson was unsuccessful, however, in winning the WWF Heavyweight Championship from Backlund.\n\n==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and retirement (1979\u20131984) ====\nIn September 1979, the WWE would introduce the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]],  a secondary championship for its midcard wrestlers. Patterson was crowned the company's first Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion after an alleged tournament held in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. While Patterson's tournament \"victory\" is widely listed in wrestling title and match histories, the tournament itself never actually took place. Patterson's apocryphal title victory would later become something of an inside joke during Patterson's on-screen tenure as one of [[Vince McMahon]]'s \"stooges\". The fictional tournament was also later profiled in-depth on WWE.com as an [[April Fool's]] joke. On November 8, Patterson dropped the North American title to [[Seiji Sakaguchi]].\n\nIt was during Patterson's reign as champion that he turned face, after a botched attempt by the Grand Wizard to \"sell\" Patterson's contract to [[Lou Albano|\"Captain\" Lou Albano]] for $100,000; Albano's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, the Wild Samoans, attacked Patterson after he cut a promo insulting Albano. Patterson held the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship until April 21, 1980 when he was defeated by [[Ken Patera]] in [[New York City|New York City, New York]]. The match ended in controversial fashion after Patterson placed his right leg on the ropes just before the three count was made. On May 4, 1981, Patterson's feud with [[Sgt. Slaughter]] culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Bootcamp match]] in [[Madison Square Garden]]. The match was voted [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]] by the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''.<ref name=\"LapradeHebert2013\"/>\n\n==== Backstage roles (1984\u20131997) ====\nPatterson began doing color commentary in 1980 with Vince McMahon, calling ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling]]'' from 1980-84. While Patterson was a face commentator when partnered with [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Vince McMahon]], he hosted a heel interview segment for French WWF broadcasts known as \"Le [[brunch]] de Pat\", where he would politely ask questions in [[English language|English]] but furtively mock his face guests in [[French language|French]]. Patterson was on commentary with Monsoon when [[Hulk Hogan]] defeated [[The Iron Sheik]] for the world heavyweight championship, as well as for when Sheik defeated [[Bob Backlund]]. Patterson was also calling the action when [[Jimmy Snuka]] jumped off the steel cage and splashed [[Don Muraco]] in [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1983.\n\nPatterson retired from wrestling in 1984.  Although retired, Patterson continued to occasionally wrestle. On January 26, 1985 he wrestled Nikolai Volkoff in a losing effort in a house show in Cincinnati, OH.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm</ref> The following month he teamed with Andre the Giant at a pair of house shows in Canada and defeated Ken Patera and Big John Studd. He took the spot of Mad Dog Vachon on the WWF skit show Le brunch on WWF Superstars in Canada till late summer 1987, then several wrestlers like the Rougeau Bros and Dino Bravo replace him, and then Frenchie Martin hosted LE Studio as a replacement of Le Brunch. Before that he made another appearance, this time in a battle royal in Montreal on February 24, 1987. He also appeared in a battle royal at a house show in Buffalo, NY on December 27. Patterson made a handful of additional appearances in Montreal in 1987, wrestling as a heel (while remaining a face or neutral backstage official in the United States and elsewhere in Canada). His most notable appearance was a win over the up-and-coming [[Brutus Beefcake]] on August 10 <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm</ref> His final match would come three weeks later in Montreal as he fell in defeat to Beefcake. and he got a haircut.\n\nHe began working backstage as a [[Road Agent (Wrestling)|road agent]] and right-hand man to WWF promoter Vince McMahon, and is credited with inventing and [[Booker (professional wrestling)|booking]] the Royal Rumble match. In the late 1990s, he also worked in the talent-relations department.<ref name=\"MolinaroMeltzer2002\">{{cite book|author1=John F.

He was selected as the in-ring referee for the main event at the first ever [[WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] on [[WrestleMania I|March 31, 1985]], a well as the main event of [[WrestleMania XI]].\n\nIn 1992, Patterson was accused of [[sexual harassment]] by former [[ring announcer]] Murray Hodgson.<ref>{{cite book|author=Irv Muchnick|title=Wrestling Babylon: Piledriving Tales of Drugs, Sex, Death, and Scandal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVg5JWqh3YC&pg=PA66|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-286-6|page=66}}</ref> He was briefly released from the company until the charges were dropped, when he was promptly rehired.\n\n==== \"Stooge\" (1997\u20132000) ====\n{{see also|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The McMahon-Helmsley Faction}}\nIn 1997, Patterson, along with [[Gerald Brisco]], became comedy heels as the on-screen [[Stooge (comedian)|stooges]] of Vince McMahon, assisting their boss in his rivalries with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]. Patterson and Brisco were among the founding members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. In order to mock [[Hulk Hogan]], they used \"Real American\" as their [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] and parodied Hogan's flexing routine as they approached the ring. on the May 18, 1998 episode of Raw, Patterson and Brisco competed in a 2 on 1 Street Fight against Stone Cold that ended in a no contest when Vince Mcmahon and [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] attacked Stone Cold.\n\nLater in 1999, the two became entangled with the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]]. On the December 16, 1999 episode of ''SmackDown'', Patterson and Brisco helped [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], who had been injured by [[D-Generation X]]. [[Triple H]] and [[Stephanie McMahon]] then forced Patterson and Brisco to compete for  the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] against [[The New Age Outlaws]] or be fired. Patterson and Brisco lost the match. In 2000, Patterson and Brisco joined Triple and Stephanie. On the May 8 episode of Raw, Patterson, [[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] faced [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] in a 3 on 1 handicap match and were disqualified after Patterson hit Rikishi with a chair. Afterwards, Patterson lowered his drawers to deliver a [[Stink Face]] to Rikishi with stained [[underwear]], which commentator [[Jim Ross]] described as a \"tractor-sized skidmark\". On June 12, 2000, when the Faction unmasked [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], Patterson photographed Kane's \"hideously scarred\" face, and threatened to \"expose him to the world\" if he did not comply. Kane was forced to wrestle [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (then his ally) in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No disqualification match|No Holds Barred match]]. When Patterson's [[Photographic film|film]] did not develop properly, Kane turned on the Faction.\n\nOn June 19, 2000 Patterson helped Brisco win the perpetually contested [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]] from [[Crash Holly]] but during the victory celebration turned on his ally, blinding him with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] and then breaking a second bottle over Brisco's head, and pinning the (kayfabe) unconscious champion. Brisco pursued Patterson into the women's locker room, where Patterson was hiding in drag. Subsequently, Vince McMahon scheduled them to fight over Hardcore Championship in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Evening Gown match|Evening Gown match]] at [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring 2000]]; in the course of the match, [[Crash Holly]] attacked both men and pinned Patterson to become Hardcore Champion.<ref name=\"DixonFurious2014\">{{cite book|author1=James Dixon|author2=Arnold Furious|author3=Lee Maughan|author4=Bob Dahlstrom|author5=Rick Ashley|title=The Complete WWF Video Guide Volume V|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZqdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA90|date=April 3, 2014|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-291-81693-8|pages=90}}{{self-published source|date={{subst:CURRENTMONTH}}{{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}<ref name=\"Undelson\">{{cite book|author=Ben Undelson|title=Fiction.

Patterson, as the first ever Intercontinental Champion, was at ringside to present the belt to the victor. [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] eliminated [[Christian Cage|Christian]] for the win, but the referee was unconscious. As Patterson attempted to give the championship belt to Booker T, Christian attacked him, stole the Intercontinental Championship belt and used it to knock out Booker T. The referee then recovered and awarded the match to Christian.\n\nIn October 2004, Patterson retired from World Wrestling Entertainment. Patterson returned to WWE in a limited capacity in May 2005. While he is now retired as a producer for WWE, he still acts as a creative consultant.<ref name=\"Almanac\"/> At [[WWE Breaking Point|Breaking Point]], Patterson made an appearance in his hometown of Montreal in an in-ring segment with [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nPatterson was a regular cast member on the [[WWE Network]] original reality show ''[[WWE Legends' House|Legends' House]]''.\n\nOn July 22, 2019, during the ''[[List of WWE Raw special episodes|Raw Reunion]]'' episode, Patterson won the [[WWE 24/7 Championship]] by pinning [[Drake Maverick]] backstage. He would lose the title to [[Gerald Brisco]] off-screen later that same night. At 78 years old, he became the oldest person ever to win a title in WWE history, beating [[The Fabulous Moolah|The Fabulous Moolah's]] fourth reign with the original [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] at 76 years old. It was also Patterson's first title reign since June 19, 2000, with the similarly introduced [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]], which also uses the \"[[WWE Hardcore Championship#24/7 rule|24/7 rule]]\".

Jojo is an innocent boy but heavily indoctrinated with the Nazi ideals (manifested in his [[imaginary friend]], Adolf, a supportive and buffoonish version of [[Adolf Hitler]]). On the day of his first [[Hitler Youth]] training camp run by Captain Klezendorf, he is given the derisive nickname \"Jojo Rabbit\" by the other children after refusing to kill a rabbit to prove his killer instinct. Pepped up by Adolf, he returns to prove his bravery, stealing a ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'' and throwing it without supervision. The grenade explodes at his feet, leaving him scarred and limping. Jojo's mother Rosie coerces Klenzendorf into ensuring that Jojo is included and given responsibilities. Jojo is given small tasks such as spreading [[propaganda]] leaflets throughout the town, and collecting [[scrap]] for the war effort. \n\nAlone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr, a teenage Jewish girl and his late sister's former classmate, hiding upstairs. Jojo is both terrified and aggressive towards Elsa, who easily outwits and overpowers the young boy's attempts at guile and aggression. The two are left in a stalemate as the revelation that Rosie is hiding Elsa would lead to Rosie's and Jojo's executions, and neither is willing to tell Rosie that they know for fear of what would happen next. Jojo continues to speak to Elsa, doing his best to uncover her \"[[Antisemitic canard|Jew secrets]]\" so he can write a book about Jews for Klenzendorf. Elsa is both saddened and amused by the doctrine that Jojo believes. When she tells Jojo about her fianc\u00e9 Nathan, Jojo forges a letter from Nathan claiming to have found someone else. When he sees her hurt by this, he quickly puts together a retraction.\n\nJojo begins acting out with his mother, angry at her seeming lack of patriotism. Rosie opposes the war and the Nazi doctrine, openly mourns the public hangings of those who resist the Nazis, and she espouses her belief that positivity and optimism are the best ways to be free of oppression. Rosie also tells Elsa that Jojo is still innocent and laments the doctrine that he believes, which makes it impossible for her to reveal Elsa to him. Meanwhile, Jojo, who is warming up to Elsa, argues with an increasingly hostile Adolf about his patriotism. Jojo spots his mother leaving a \"free Germany\" message in town.\n\nJojo and Elsa are alone in the house when the Gestapo stop by for a surprise inspection with Klenzendorf in tow. The Gestapo are suspicious when Elsa poses as Jojo's late sister and produces Inge's papers. Klenzendorf inspects them and quizzes Elsa on her birthday, confirming its authenticity. After the Gestapo leave, a shaken Elsa reveals that she got the date wrong and that Klenzendorf had covered for her. Elsa is convinced that the Gestapo are aware of the deception. Later on, Jojo finds Rosie hanged in the public square. He returns home and tries to stab Elsa, but breaks down in tears.\n\nWith the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] closing in, the civilian population (including the Hitler Youth) are armed to defend the city. Jojo runs into his friend Yorki, who tells him [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler has committed suicide]]. Despondent, Jojo hides until the battle is won, with the Americans and Soviets occupying the city. As he wanders the city, he is seized by the Soviets who imprison him, and Klenzendorf. A wounded Klenzendorf tells Jojo to look after his sister, then tears off Jojo\u2019s Hitler Youth coat and denounces him as a Jew. The Soviets expel Jojo as they drag Klenzendorf towards the firing squad. \n\nJojo runs home and, to stop Elsa from leaving, tells her Germany won the war. Recognising her despair, he recites a new letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that Nathan died of [[tuberculosis]] the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him like a \"younger brother\". A disheveled Adolf angrily confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, and Jojo kicks him out the window. Outside, Elsa sees American soldiers and realizes the Allies have won the war. She slaps Jojo in the face for lying, and then they dance in the street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roman Griffin Davis]] as Jojo, a young German boy who is a member of ''[[Hitler Youth|Hitlerjugend]]''\n* [[Thomasin McKenzie]] as Elsa, a Jewish girl whom Rosie hides in her home\n* [[Taika Waititi]] as Adolf, Jojo's imaginary friend version of [[Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as kiss my bum, a brutish instructor in the Hitler Youth camp\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Deertz, a [[Gestapo]] agent\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as Finkel, the second-in-command to Captain Klenzendorf\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Captain Klenzendorf, an [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|army]] officer who runs a Hitler Youth camp\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Rosie, Jojo's mother who is secretly [[German resistance to Nazism|anti-Nazi]]\n* [[Archie Yates]] as Yorki, Jojo's best friend and a member of ''Hitlerjugend''\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2018, it was revealed that [[Taika Waititi]] would direct, write, co-produce, and co-star in the film, as an imaginary [[Adolf Hitler]].

Jojo is an innocent boy but heavily indoctrinated with the Nazi ideals (manifested in his [[imaginary friend]], Adolf, a supportive and buffoonish version of [[Adolf Hitler]]). On the day of his first [[Hitler Youth]] training camp run by Captain Klezendorf, he is given the derisive nickname \"Jojo Rabbit\" by the other children after refusing to kill a rabbit to prove his killer instinct. Pepped up by Adolf, he returns to prove his bravery, stealing a ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'' and throwing it without supervision. The grenade explodes at his feet, leaving him scarred and limping. Jojo's mother Rosie coerces Klenzendorf into ensuring that Jojo is included and given responsibilities. Jojo is given small tasks such as spreading [[propaganda]] leaflets throughout the town, and collecting [[scrap]] for the war effort. \n\nAlone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr, a teenage Jewish girl and his late sister's former classmate, hiding upstairs. Jojo is both terrified and aggressive towards Elsa, who easily outwits and overpowers the young boy's attempts at guile and aggression. The two are left in a stalemate as the revelation that Rosie is hiding Elsa would lead to Rosie's and Jojo's executions, and neither is willing to tell Rosie that they know for fear of what would happen next. Jojo continues to speak to Elsa, doing his best to uncover her \"[[Antisemitic canard|Jew secrets]]\" so he can write a book about Jews for Klenzendorf. Elsa is both saddened and amused by the doctrine that Jojo believes. When she tells Jojo about her fianc\u00e9 Nathan, Jojo forges a letter from Nathan claiming to have found someone else. When he sees her hurt by this, he quickly puts together a retraction.\n\nJojo begins acting out with his mother, angry at her seeming lack of patriotism. Rosie opposes the war and the Nazi doctrine, openly mourns the public hangings of those who resist the Nazis, and she espouses her belief that positivity and optimism are the best ways to be free of oppression. Rosie also tells Elsa that Jojo is still innocent and laments the doctrine that he believes, which makes it impossible for her to reveal Elsa to him. Meanwhile, Jojo, who is warming up to Elsa, argues with an increasingly hostile Adolf about his patriotism. Jojo spots his mother leaving a \"free Germany\" message in town.\n\nJojo and Elsa are alone in the house when the Gestapo stop by for a surprise inspection with Klenzendorf in tow. The Gestapo are suspicious when Elsa poses as Jojo's late sister and produces Inge's papers. Klenzendorf inspects them and quizzes Elsa on her birthday, confirming its authenticity. After the Gestapo leave, a shaken Elsa reveals that she got the date wrong and that Klenzendorf had covered for her. Elsa is convinced that the Gestapo are aware of the deception. Later on, Jojo finds Rosie hanged in the public square. He returns home and tries to stab Elsa, but breaks down in tears.\n\nWith the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] closing in, the civilian population (including the Hitler Youth) are armed to defend the city. Jojo runs into his friend Yorki, who tells him [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler has committed suicide]]. Despondent, Jojo hides until the battle is won, with the Americans and Soviets occupying the city. As he wanders the city, he is seized by the Soviets who imprison him, and Klenzendorf. A wounded Klenzendorf tells Jojo to look after his sister, then tears off Jojo\u2019s Hitler Youth coat and denounces him as a Jew. The Soviets expel Jojo as they drag Klenzendorf towards the firing squad. \n\nJojo runs home and, to stop Elsa from leaving, tells her Germany won the war. Recognising her despair, he recites a new letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that Nathan died of [[tuberculosis]] the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him like a \"younger brother\". A disheveled Adolf angrily confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, and Jojo kicks him out the window. Outside, Elsa sees American soldiers and realizes the Allies have won the war. She slaps Jojo in the face for lying, and then they dance in the street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roman Griffin Davis]] as Jojo, a young German boy who is a member of ''[[Hitler Youth|Hitlerjugend]]''\n* [[Thomasin McKenzie]] as Elsa, a Jewish girl whom Rosie hides in her home\n* [[Taika Waititi]] as Adolf, Jojo's imaginary friend version of [[Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Fr\u00e4ulein Rahm, a brutish instructor in the Hitler Youth camp\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Deertz, a [[Gestapo]] agent\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as Finkel, the second-in-command to Captain Klenzendorf\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Captain Klenzendorf, an [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|army]] officer who runs a Hitler Youth camp\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Rosie, Jojo's mother who is secretly [[German resistance to Nazism|anti-Nazi]]\n* [[Archie Yates]] as Yorki, Jojo's best friend and a member of ''Hitlerjugend''\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2018, it was revealed that [[Taika Waititi]] would direct, write, co-produce, and co-star in the film, as an imaginary [[Adolf Hitler]].

majority of women participated in this tradition of conformity, but often ended up facing ridicule whether or not they were successful at shrinking their waistline. The practice of tight-lacing proved to have many negative health risks, and was also extremely uncomfortable for women who partook. Women were mocked for their egotism if they were not able to shrink their waistline, and they were criticized for too small a waistline if they were successful. This instilled a feeling of defeat in women during these times, as nothing they did seemed to satisfy their male counterparts. As part of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, women also fought for their right to dress in pants.<ref name=\":0\" /> Acceptance of all body types \u2013 regardless of waist measurements \u2013 was the major theme of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, and this was the first movement of its kind.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===First wave===\nIn 1967, New York radio host [[Steve Post]] held a \"fat-in\" in Central Park.

through use of corsets and [[tightlacing]] in order to fit the societal standard of tiny waistlines.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite

majority of women participated in this tradition of conformity, but often ended up facing ridicule whether or not they were successful at shrinking their waistline. The practice of tight-lacing proved to have many negative health risks, and was also extremely uncomfortable for women who partook. Women were mocked for their egotism if they were not able to shrink their waistline, and they were criticized for too small a waistline if they were successful. This instilled a feeling of defeat in women during these times, as nothing they did seemed to satisfy their male counterparts. As part of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, women also fought for their right to dress in pants.<ref name=\":0\" /> Acceptance of all body types \u2013 regardless of waist measurements \u2013 was the major theme of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, and this was the first movement of its kind.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===First wave===\nIn 1967, New York radio host [[Steve Post]] held a \"fat-in\" in Central Park.

The front radiator was moved behind the front axle on the 12 metre version, or in front of the second axle for the 10.6 metre version (due to its shorter wheelbase). In order to lower the chassis further, the assisted steering function of the middle axle was cancelled. The suspension system has also been largely modified so that it is electronically controlled instead of moving passively. One special feature is that after turning, the suspension unit does not return to normal, remaining tilted to either the left or right, until the bus becomes stationary.\n\nAn option for 11.3 metre length of Super Olympian was also available, but no orders were received. The Super Olympian was powered by the Volvo D10A285 (Euro II or Euro III), with a maximum power of {{convert|285|hp|abbr=on}}. Its somewhat insufficient engine power has earned some mildly derisive nicknames in Hong Kong. The most common are \"\u8c6c\" (pig), \"\u6252\" (meat cutlet) and \"\u8c6c\u6252\" (pork chop, derived from the pronunciation of the word \"Super\").\n\nInitially, the Super Olympian chassis were built in Volvo's factory in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], Scotland. After the closure of the factory in mid-2000, production was moved to [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland.\n\n==Hong Kong==\n[[File:LP563.jpg|thumb|[[Kowloon Motor Bus]] Wright-bodied Volvo Super Olympian in August 2005]]\n[[File:B10TL_bus_with_voglren_body.jpg|thumb|[[Kowloon Motor Bus]] [[Volgren]]-bodied Volvo Super Olympian in March 2007]]\n\n===Kowloon Motor Bus===\n\n====12m version====\n[[Kowloon Motor Bus]] ordered the first batch of 61 (3ASV1-61) [[Alexander ALX500]] bodied B10TL Super Olympians with [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 4HP590 transmission, and roller shuttle route displays in 1998. These entered service in 1998/99. All except the prototype 3ASV3 had narrow 2+2 seats on the upper deck. The first buses were retired in November 2017.\n\nA further 80 Super Olympians (3ASV62-141) entered service in 2000/01. These buses have electronic route displays and ZF 5HP590 transmission. 3ASV78 was the 3,000th [[Walter Alexander Coachbuilders|Alexander]] bodied bus supplied to KMB, and 3ASV141 was the first KMB bus to meet Euro III emission standards.\n\nThe last 351 Super Olympians (3ASV142-492), including 21 which were fitted with Australian [[Volgren]] CR223LD bodywork, entered service in 2001/02. All of these buses had their chassis built in Poland. Their D10A285 engines were built to meet Euro III emission standards and had [[aluminium alloy]] front wheels supplied by [[Alcoa]]. 3ASV297 was coated with special metallic paint, which shows different colours (mainly green and purple), depending on the angle of light reflection.\n\n====10.6m version====\nKowloon Motor Bus was the only buyer of 10.6 metre Super Olympians. The first 49 (ASV1-49) 10.6m Alexander ALX500 bodied Super Olympians were introduced in 2001. They are equipped with D10A285 Euro II engines and had Alcoa front wheels.\n\nASV50, which was put into service in 2002, is a prototype short-wheelbase Super Olympian (chassis built in 1999), and also the only short-wheelbase Super Olympian built in Scotland. It is equipped with a Euro III D10A285 engine and ZF 4HP590 transmission rather than the previous 5HP590 as fitted to older ASVs.\n\nASV51-100 were also equipped with the Euro III D10A285 engines. They are almost identical with ASV1-49, except for minor interior differences. Only the first 24 were put into service in 2003. The remaining 26 were stored for more than a year, and they were put into service between September 2004 and March 2005.\n\n====12m wider version====\nIn January 2003, Kowloon Motor Bus received the first [[Wrightbus|Wright]]-bodied Super Olympian with a 2.55 metre-wide body (once known as the ''Wright Explorer''). Like the [[Alexander Dennis Enviro500]], it featured a straight staircase and plug exit door. It was numbered AVW1 and was registered on 20 March 2003.\n\nThe next 49 buses (AVW2-50) with a slightly different design followed shortly after AVW1, they entered service in 2003/04. The last 50 buses (AVW51-100), which are almost identical, entered service in 2004/05, These were the last batch of Volvo Super Olympian ordered by KMB.\n\n===New World First Bus===\n[[File:Volvo_Super_Olympian_12m_NWFB_5083.jpg|thumb|[[New World First Bus]] [[Alexander ALX500]] bodied Volvo Super Olympian in June 2008]]\n[[New World First Bus]] bought 103 Super Olympians in five batches, all are 12 metres long and were fitted with Alexander ALX500 bodies.\n\nThe first 40 (5001-5040), fitted with electronic route displays, were introduced in 1999. The next 20 (5041-5060), with their side route number boxes moved to a lower position, entered service in 2000/01. The chassis of 5060 was the first to be built in Poland. New World First Bus began de-registering the buses on 21 November 2017.\n\nThe next 19 Super Olympians (5061-5079), with Euro III D10A285 engines and Alcoa front wheels, entered service in 2001. To mark the occasion of meeting the Euro III emission standard, New World First Bus designed a full body advertisement for one of them (fleet number 5070) to state that they were environmentally friendly. They were followed by 10 similar examples (5080-5089) later that year. Among these buses, 5080-5086 had their registration numbers originated from ex [[China Motor Bus]] buses and service cars.\n\nThe last batch of 14 Super Olympians (5090-5103), entered service in 2002, had their rear electronic route number displays raised above the emergency window to form a box, the design being unique among all similar vehicles in Hong Kong. These were all withdrawn and were either sold to Citybus, converted to a training bus or headed to the scrapyard.\n\nThe last three buses in the fleet (5072, 5076, 5079) had been retired on 27 August 2019. These were the last buses to have no headrest in franchised service.\n\n==Singapore==\n[[File:SBS9806J on 21.jpg|thumb|[[SBS Transit]] [[Volgren]]-bodied Volvo Super Olympian]]\n\nIn late 1999, Volvo delivered one [[Volgren]] CR222LD-bodied Super Olympian to [[SBS Transit|Singapore Bus Service]] for trial purposes. It was Singapore's first low floor \"Superbus\", and had advanced specifications at time of introduction. Originally deployed on routes serving the then new Sengkang New Town, it was transferred to Ang Mo Kio bus depot in 2004. This bus was burnt in a depot fire in 2010, and was subsequently written off.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.landtransportguru.net/volvo-b10tl/|publisher=Land Transport Guru|title=Volvo B10TL|date=1 January 2018|accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nSatisfied with the trial, SBS purchased 51 Volvo Super Olympians in 2000. These buses were the last to be ordered by SBS prior to their rebranding to SBS Transit. 50 were bodied with an updated Volgren CR222LD bodywork, with one entering service in April 2002 and the remaining buses entering service in early 2003. They were also the first buses to be registered with the SBS Transit livery. One bus was built completely by Volgren in Australia, and hence equipped with a Transit Media electronic destination signage (EDS). The rest, which were assembled locally, debuted with plastic destination signages initially and were retrofitted with LECIP electronic destination signages in 2012. All buses of this batch had served out of [[Ang Mo Kio]], [[Toa Payoh]] and [[Bedok]] North depots. These buses are also the last non-wheelchair accessible double deck buses in Singapore. All these buses have been retired as of 8 April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.landtransportguru.net/volvo-b10tl-volgren/|publisher=Land Transport Guru|title=Volvo B10TL (Volgren)|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2005, the last Volvo Super Olympian, debuted with a prototype ComfortDelGro Engineering (CDGE) bodywork, which will then form the basis of the subsequent first batch of Volvo B9TLs debuting in the following year. Originally deployed to [[Bukit Batok]] depot, it was transferred to [[Toa Payoh]] depot in 2012, where it was refurbished with yellow seats and its original Transit Media EDS replaced with a LECIP EDS.\n\n==Replacement==\nProduction of Volvo Super Olympian ended in 2004 and 2005 after completion of the last order from [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] and [[SBS Transit]].
