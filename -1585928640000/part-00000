When the children finally open up, In-ho faces the shocking and ugly truth about the school and what the students have been enduring in secret: the children are being physically and sexually abused by their teachers. When he decides to fight for the children's rights and expose the crimes being committed at the school, In-ho teams up with human rights activist Seo Yoo-jin, but he and Yoo-jin soon realize the school's principal and teachers, and even the police, prosecutors and churches in the community are actually trying to cover up the truth.<ref>[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/495639.html Real life case of child abuse explored in ''The Crucible''] ''The Hankyoreh''. 9 September 2011.

Using their last night of freedom to go out partying, the Lee brothers are last seen laughing that the judge was so easy to pay off for a light sentence. As Park leaves the party and walks home, he bumps into Min-su along the way. Attempting to force the boy to come to his home to be raped once more, Park is shocked when Min-su stabs him in the side with a knife, having fallen into despair at his grandmother giving away his chance to put Park away for good. Park, brushing off the stabbing, smacks Min-su to the ground, where he begins viciously beating and kicking the boy, proclaiming that before he goes to prison, he's going to beat Min-su to death. As he prepares to finish Min-su off, Park is overpowered by the boy, who flings the both off them onto a nearby railroad track. As a coming train barrels toward them, Park begins screaming at Min-su, but, using Park's knife wound, keeps Park held down. Ultimately, the train runs over both the screaming Park and Min-su, the latter refusing to let the rapist get away with his acts, and they are both killed by the train.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gong Yoo]] - Kang In-ho\n* [[Jung Yu-mi (actress born 1983)|Jung Yu-mi]] - Seo Yoo-jin\n* [[Kim Hyun-soo (actress)|Kim Hyun-soo]] - Yeon-doo\n* Jung In-seo - Yoo-ri\n* [[Baek Seung-hwan]] - Min-su\n* [[Kim Ji-young (actress born 1938)|Kim Ji-young]] - In-ho's mother\n* [[Jang Gwang]] - headmaster twin brothers\n* Im Hyeon-seong - Young-hoon\n* Kim Joo-ryung - Yoon Ja-ae\n* [[Um Hyo-sup]] - police officer Jang\n* Jeon Kuk-hwan - Attorney Hwang\n* Choi Jin-ho - prosecutor\n* Kwon Yoo-jin - judge\n* Park Hye-jin - headmaster's wife\n* [[Kim Ji-young (actress born 2005)|Kim Ji-young]] - Sol-yi\n* Eom Ji-seong - Young-soo\n* Lee Sang-hee - auto repair shop owner\n* Nam Myung-ryul - Professor Kim Jung-woo\n* Jang So-yeon - courtroom sign language interpreter\n* Hong Suk-youn - school custodian/guard\n\n==Impact==\nThe film sparked public outcry over lenient court rulings, prompting police to reopen the case and lawmakers to introduce bills for the human rights of the vulnerable.<ref>[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2011/09/29/77/0302000000AEN20110929002900315F.HTML \"Sexual abuse of disabled, vulnerable, or Dead people on the rise\"] ''Yonhap News''. 29 September 2011.

When he decides to fight for the children's rights and expose the crimes being committed at the school, In-ho teams up with human rights activist Seo Yoo-jin, but he and Yoo-jin soon realize the school's principal and teachers, and even the police, prosecutors and churches in the community are actually trying to cover up the truth.<ref>[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/495639.html Real life case of child abuse explored in ''The Crucible''] ''The Hankyoreh''. 9 September 2011.

As Park leaves the party and walks home, he bumps into Min-su along the way. Attempting to force the boy to come to his home to be raped once more, Park is shocked when Min-su stabs him in the side with a knife, having fallen into despair at his grandmother giving away his chance to put Park away for good. Park, brushing off the stabbing, smacks Min-su to the ground, where he begins viciously beating and kicking the boy, proclaiming that before he goes to prison, he's going to beat Min-su to death. As he prepares to finish Min-su off, Park is overpowered by the boy, who flings the both off them onto a nearby railroad track. As a coming train barrels toward them, Park begins screaming at Min-su, but, using Park's knife wound, keeps Park held down.

The origins of Enosis date back to 1821, the year when the [[Greek War of Independence]] commenced, and the archbishop of Cyprus, his archdeacon, and three bishops were beheaded, amongst other atrocities. In 1828, Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the first governor of Greece, asked for the union of Cyprus with Greece, while small-scale uprisings also occurred.{{sfn|Mallinson|Mallinson|2005|p=5}} In 1878, when British general Wolsely came to Cyprus to formally establish British rule, he was met by the archbishop of [[Kition]] who, after welcoming him, requested that Britain cede Cyprus to Greece.{{sfn|Mallinson|Mallinson|2005|p=5}} Initially, the Greek Cypriots welcomed British rule because they were aware that the British had returned the [[Ionian Islands]] to Greece in 1864, and they were also hoping for British investment in Cyprus.{{sfn|Emerick|2014|p=117-18}} In 1912 the British government offered Greece to exchange Cyprus for a naval base in [[Argostoli]], [[Kefalonia]], in order to gain control of the [[Ionian sea]], an offer which was repeated in 1913. In 1915, the British offered several times Cyprus to Greece, in exchange for Greece's participation in World War I. But while Greece was undecided whether it should enter the War, the British government withdrew its offer.{{sfn|Richter|2007|loc= chapter First World War|p=157-194}} By 1915, the Greek Cypriots seeing that neither the British investment, nor Enosis, had materialised, increased their opposition to British rule.{{sfn|Emerick|2014|p=117-18}} In the beginning, the Enosis movement had only few supporters mainly from the upper classes.{{sfnm|1a1=Lange|1y=2011|1p=93|2a1=Bellingeri|2a2=Kappler|2y=2005|2p=21|3a1=Isachenko|3y=2012|3p=37|4a1=Richter|4y=2007|4pp=114-15}} But that was about to change as two groups of disappointed with the new ruler began to form: the Church and the Usurers. In the following years a growing number of Cypriots were studying in Greece, and upon their return, they became strong advocates of Enosis.{{sfnm|1a1=Richter|1y=2007|1p=114-15|2a1=French|2y=2015|2p=17|2ps=: French writes: \"''But Greek Cypriot teachers and parents insisted that education should follow a\nclassical curriculum that promoted a Greek ethnic identity and preserved the Greek character of the island, a curriculum that also instilled into pupils a sense of historical awareness that supported their claims for Enosis.27''\"}} On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriot community started to develop its own nationalism in the early 20th century, as news arrived in the island about the persecutions faced by Muslims in the countries that formed after the collapse of Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|\u039a\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2|2013|p=80}}<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kizilyurek|2011|p=198 - 199|ps=:[[Niyazi K\u0131z\u0131ly\u00fcrek|Kizilyurek]] clearly states: \"''The Turkish Cypriot nationalism mainly developed in reaction to the Greek Cypriot national desire for union with Greece.''\"}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, EOKA was established with the specific aim of mounting a military campaign to end the status of Cyprus as a British crown [[colony]] and achieving the island's unification with Greece.  The leadership of [[AKEL]] at the time, the island's [[communist]] party, opposed EOKA's military action, advocating a \"[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhiesque]] approach\" of [[civil disobedience]], such as [[workers' strike]]s and demonstrations.{{sfn|Mallinson|Mallinson|2005|p=19}}\n\nInitially, the struggle was political, as opposed to military.

EOKA\u2019s right-wing ideology made it the exception to the rule of post-Second World War insurgencies. Such movements were most often led by communists who aimed at establishing new Marxist societies. This was the case in China, Malaya, Vietnam, and Cuba. As a nationalist and anti-communist movement, EOKA had far more in common with the Irgun and Stern Gang in late-1940s Palestine.}}\n\nGrivas and Archbishop of Cyprus, [[Makarios III]], disagreed about the way to rid the island of British rule. Grivas rejected Makarios' attempt to limit the campaign to acts of sabotage, avoiding loss of life. Nevertheless, he shared Makarios' view that victory would be won by diplomatic means.<ref name=\"Newsinger96\">Newsinger, 2016, p. 96</ref> Grivas' goal was to subject the British to continued relentless harassment, making it clear to them that occupation carried a price, while keeping Enosis on the international diplomatic agenda.<ref name=\"Newsinger97\">Newsinger, 2016, p. 97</ref> The British response to the EOKA campaign was crucial in this regard: repression would on the one hand alienate the Greek Cypriot population from British rule, and on the other hand provide Makarios and the Greek government with a stick to beat the British with before the United Nations. EOKA would ensure that there was a Cyprus problem and demonstrate to the world that the British could not resolve it.<ref name=\"Newsinger97\" />\n\n===Preparations===\nGrivas carried out a first reconnaissance in Cyprus as early as July 1951.<ref name=\"Newsinger93\">Newsinger, 2016, p. 93</ref>\nMakarios was certainly skeptical, telling Grivas on one occasion that he would not find supporters for an armed struggle. The British shared the same view. Grivas finally arrived on the island in early November 1954 and set about establishing his underground network.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\">Newsinger, 2016, p. 94</ref> He recruited from the Cyprus Farmers' Union (PEK) in the villages and from the two main youth movements, the Church-controlled Christian Youth Movement (OHEN) and the nationalist Pancyprian Youth Movement (PEON) in the towns.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\" />{{sfn|French|2015|p=64-65}} Grivas intended to turn the youth of Cyprus 'into the seedbed of EOKA'.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\" /> The backbone of EOKA were the mountain groups, a conventional guerrilla force living in hidden camps in the forests, and the town groups, often continuing their civilian job or schooling.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\" /> Supporting this armed wing was the much broader National Front of Cyprus (EMAK), which provided EOKA with intelligence, supplies, weapons, medicines, recruits and safe houses, confronted the British on the streets with demonstrations and riots and conducted the propaganda offensive.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\" />\n\n==Armed campaign==\n[[File:Street riot in Nicosia 1956.jpg|thumb|Street riot in [[Nicosia]] during the [[Battle at Nicosia Hospital]] in 1956]]\n\n=== From April 1955 to the dismissal of governor Armitage  (October) ===\nThe armed struggle started on the night of March 29-April, 1955. A total of 18 bomb attacks occurred in various locations across the island. Most notable incidents were those of Nicosia by the group of [[Markos Drakos (EOKA fighter)|Markos Drakos]] as well as the demolition of the Cyprus Broadcasting Station's transmitter.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=95}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=71}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=250}} The attacks were accompanied by a revolutionary proclamation signed by \"The leader, Digenes\". Grivas decided to keep his involvement secret at the moment and used the name of a Byzantine general who had defended Cyprus in the medieval era.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=95}} The British, not expecting this turn of events, reinforced their local military bases (Dhekelia and Akrotiri) by transferring troops from Egypt.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=250}}\n\nAt the end of April EOKA attacks temporarily paused, giving time to Grivas to organize the youth.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=254|ps=: ANE (Valiant Youth of EOKA), a pupil's group was created, ANE had a branch in every school.}} A second offensive was launched on June 19 with coordinated bomb and grenade attacks against police stations, military installations and the homes of army officers and senior officials.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=257-8}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=72}} One of those bombings demolished the building of the Famagusta Police headquarters.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} Those attacks were usually followed by sporadic incidents: shootings, bombings and increased public disorder.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} This second wave of EOKA attacks lasted until the end of June, totaling 204 attacks since the beginning of the armed resistance.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=259}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=76}}\n\nIn August, two Special Branch members were assassinated in separate incidents. The raising of the Greek flag during demonstrations usually led to clashes with the colonial authorities, the latter removing it by force if necessary.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} Another major EOKA success was the escape from Kyrenia castle prison of 16 EOKA members including a number of key figures, such as Markos Drakos and [[Grigoris Afxentiou]].{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}}\n\n==== British reactions ====\nThe situation seemed to be deteriorating out of control and the British authorities attempted to safeguard their position in Cyprus by diplomatic maneuvering and a counterinsurgency offensive. The first involved playing the Greek and Turkish governments off against each other. Eden saw Turkey as \"the key protecting British interests\" in Cyprus.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} By the end of September, as the crisis was escalating, the British Government decided to replace [[Robert Perceval Armitage|governor Armitage]].{{sfn|French|2015|p=82}}\n\nIn Turkey, the public opinion was un-eased. Rumors were spreading in Turkish media that a slaughter of the Turkish Cypriot community was likely to occur. Though they were unfounded they led to nationalist reactions in the country and the government-sponsored anti-Greek [[Istanbul pogrom]] of September 1955.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=315-321}}. At the same time, during the London Trilateral Conference between Britain, Turkey and Greece, an agreement failed to materialize due to Turkish intransigence.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=299 & 313}}{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=73}}\n\nIn this fashion, British policy also aimed at the dramatic increase in recruitment of Turkish Cypriots. By the start of 1956, they had come to dominate the police force numbering 4,000 compared to less than 1,000 Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots were very much in the front line against EOKA. Inevitably, the use of Turkish Cypriot policemen against the Greek Cypriot community exacerbated relations between the two communities.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\n=== From October 1955 to March 1956 (Operation Forward Victory, phase I) ===\n\nThe new British governor [[John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton|John Harding]] arrived at October 3.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=83-84}} Harding sought to meet [[Makarios III|Archbishop Makarios]], and both agreed on commencing what became known as ''Harding-Makarios negotiations''.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=84-85}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=370}} Increased security and stepping up military might was of Harding's priorities.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=370-72}} On November 26, Harding declared stated of Emergency- that meant among other, implementation of the death penalty for non-fatality crimes. {{sfn|Richter|2011|p=373}} Repressive legislation and troop reinforcements did not succeed. The Greek Cypriot population was hostile and the Special Branch was neutered.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}} The British response was large-scale cordon and search operations which rarely resulted in arrests or the discovery of arms caches, but which invariably alienated those whose houses were searched or who were roughed up and dragged off to be screened. Collective punishments, far from undermining support for EOKA, only succeeded in making the Greek Cypriots more hostile to British rule.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}} Moreover, Harding viewed Cyprus very much as a pawn in the [[Cold War]] global situation: on December 13 he banned AKEL and detained 128 of its leading members, effectively crippling the only political party in Cyprus that opposed EOKA.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}}\n\nThe inevitable result was to increase sympathy for EOKA and to assist its recruitment efforts. The problem was that the Greek Cypriot community was overwhelmingly in favour of Enosis. Far from moderates emerging with whom Britain could do a deal.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}} It was this popular support, enabling Grivas and his small band of guerrillas to take on the growing security apparatus that Harding was marshaling against him, that sustained the armed struggle.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}} It became clear that EOKA did have an effective intelligence apparatus and that the guerrillas were often forewarned of security intentions. Schoolchildren, domestic servants, civilian personnel on the military bases, the police, all were enlisted by Grivas in the intelligence war while the security forces were operating in the dark.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}}\n\nOperation \"Forward to Victory\" (Greek name) was launched on November 18 and was accompanied by several bomb attacks.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=377|ps=: According to Richter, there were 50 bomb attacks that day.}} In the urban areas schoolchildren had a prominent role in the EOKA struggle. The ''Battle of Flags'', escalated during the Autumn of 1955 and peaked in January and February 1956- that kept British forces busy away from chasing down EOKA.{{sfn|French|2015|p=86}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=376}} Schoolboys were not only participating in riots and stone-throwing against the police, but some of them were also trained to throw bombs and carry assassinations.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=383}} Bombs by guerrillas and youngsters were thrown at British personnel houses, police stations and army camps.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=481-82}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=86-88}} In some cases, EOKA members managed to steal some weaponry.{{sfn|French|2015|p=87}} The British were never to succeed completely eliminating EOKA agents from the police force.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\nThe struggle continued in the mountains as the guerrillas expanded their network in the Troodos mountains. However, due to harsh winter conditions in addition to certain British military pressure, the activity of EOKA temporarily eased.{{sfn|French|2015|p=88-89}} By the end of February 1956 the British were involved in suppressing a veritable schoolchildren revolt that left one boy shot dead and the island's school system almost completely closed down.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\n=== March 1956 to March 1957 (operation Victory, phase II) ===\n\nAfter the failure of Makarios-Harding negotiations the British government abruptly exiled Makarios to [[Seychelles]] on March 9, 1956.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=416-422}} This triggered a week long general strike followed by a dramatic increase in EOKA activity: 246 attacks until March 31 including an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Harding. The offensive continued into April and May and the British casualties averaged two killed every week.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=102}} While Harding's forces were making ground up in the mountains,{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=501-512|ps=: In the sub-chapter \"The British counter-attack\"}} EOKA guerrillas and youth were trying to assassinate members of the security forces at their leisure time or alleged traitors.{{Sfn|Richter|2011|p=496}}\n\nEOKA focused its activity to urban areas during this period. House bombings and riots, mostly by schoolboys, forced army to keep forces away from the mountains where EOKA's main fighters where hiding. Apart from individual citizens or soldiers in their leisure time, army and police facilities where attacked totaling 104 house bombings, 53 riots, 136 acts of Sabotage, 403 ambushes, 35 attacks on police, 38 attacks on soldiers and 43 raids on police stations.{{efn|Some of the attacks of the attacks against civilians drew world attention and were used for propaganda purposes by the British authorities.

On 16 June 1956, the bombing of a restaurant by EOKA led to the death of William P. Boteler, a [[CIA]] officer working under [[State Department|diplomatic]] cover. Grivas immediately issued a statement denying a deliberate attempt to target American citizens.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=496}}}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=109}} But as the pressure of Harding mounted, Grivas began targeting Turkish Cypriot policemen effectively sparking inter-communal riots and a series of strikes{{sfn|French|2015|p=152}}<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Richter|2011|pp=491-492}}</ref>\n\nHarding escalated his fight against EOKA organizing a series of operations in April-July{{efn|These operations have been a) Operation \u2018Kennett\u2019b) Operation \u2018Pepperpot\u2019, c) Operation \u2018Lucky Alphonse\u2019 and d)Operation \u2018Spread Eagle\u2019. 21 soldiers died at a forest fire during Lucky Alphonse{{sfn|French|2015|p=135}}}} Harding also upgraded his intelligence network including the creation of the notorious X-platoon.{{sfn|French|2015|p=145-46}} On May 10 the first two EOKA prisoners were hanged and Grivas responded with the execution of two British soldiers.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=102}} The British were concerned to counter EOKA's mountain units. Large scale operations were launched however Grivas managed to escape.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=103}} He decided to move to Limassol where he established his new headquarters. Although Grivas escaped, the Troodos operations had some success for the British: 20 guerrillas and 50 weapons were captured. However, they ended up with a disaster: at least 7 British soldiers were killed and additionally 21 were burned to death by accident. The last incident overshadowed the first real success against the EOKA guerrilla forces.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=103}}\n\nOn August 9 the British authorities hanged three more EOKA prisoners; however, Grivas did not retaliate this time. Widespread strikes were held in protest.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=104}} On November 1956 due to the [[Suez Crisis]] large numbers of British troops were transferred off Cyprus allowing Grivas to launch a new offensive. EOKA launched a wave of attacks in what would became for the British \"Black November\" with a total of 416 attacks, 39 killed 21 of them British. After the Suez debacle the British military strength was increased to 20,000 and Harding managed to direct a new offensive.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=104}}\n\nAlthough EOKA activity was severely suppressed in the mountains its armed struggle continued in the urban areas while the British forces were apparently impotent.{{sfn|French|2015|p=136}}{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=103}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=651}} Grivas declared truce on the 14th of March 1957 which lasted nearly one year.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=651}}\n\n=== From March 1957 to November 1957 ===\nHarding continued to pressure EOKA despite the unilateral truce imposing security measures on villagers.

According to Heinz Richter, while police or army was generally lawful, the British turned a blind eye to interrogators many of whom were deliberately under-educated Turkish Cypriot who were against ''Enosis''. Another aspect that Richter highlights is that many claims of torture were made as the alleged victims were afraid for their lives as it was punished by death to speak to the British.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=666-668}} David French on the other hand views that most - but not all- claims of torture were a propaganda tool of EOKA.{{sfn|French|2015|p=222-24}} In general Harding failed to win over the Greek Cypriot population especially when his security forces resorted to this kind of measures.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=107}}\n\n====Campaign against Greek Cypriot groups ====\nInitially, EOKA was intimidating the population not to co-operate with the security forces, but steadily the definition of traitor broadened as the security forces had some successes EOKA at the end of 1956.{{sfn|French|2015|p=158-59}} EOKA members who had spoken to the security forces under interrogation were also considered as traitors and Grivas was in favour of the death penalty in such case. Incidences happened where EOKA guerrillas killed others by their own initiative and not solely based on accusations for treason. The killings took place in public.{{sfn|French|2015|p=163-64}}{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=148|ps=:According to Holland \"In early August [1956] EOKA had unleashed a series of urban assassinations in which twenty-one Greek 'traitors' had been killed\u2014the victims often sought out in cafes to accentuate the public ritual of the horror\"}} Such activity peaked especially during summer-autumn 1956.{{sfn|French|2015|p=163}} The Greek Cypriot Left and in particular the communist party ([[AKEL]]) were also targeted. The later aimed at a political role in the Greek Cypriot community challenging EOKA's claim that Makarios was the sole leader of the community. As AKEL was growing in numbers it was practically denying Makarios' role. The British delicately fueled this hostility and in August 1957 a second wave of intra-Greek violence broke out.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=203}} Due to intimidation methods and targeting civilians towards local population a number of scholars characterized EOKA as a terrorist organisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Abrahms|1a2=Lula|1y=2012 |1pp=46-62|2a1=Crenshaw||2a2=Pimlott|2y=2015|2loc= Chapter Terrorism in Cyprus|3a1=Cronin|3y=2009|3p=73-93|4a1=Edwards|4y=2018|4loc=Abstract}} Another similar wave broke out in April- October 1958 when a peace agreement was imminent.{{sfn|French|2015|p=166-67}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=710-212|ps=: in the subchapter \"Grivas unleash attack against the Left}} AKEL held massive demonstrations and sought the help of Makarios which he granted.{{sfn|French|2015|p=166-67}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=710-712b|ps=: in the subchapter \"Grivas unleash attack against the Left\". Richter also notes that AKEL approached Makarios who was antithetical to Grivas tactics. That was the beginning of a relationship that would last to time}}\n\n====End of truce====\nDuring this period the British were openly tolerating the Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organisations. The British had deliberately set out to use the Turkish Cypriot community on the island and the Turks government as a means of blocking the demand for Enosis.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=109}} They had effectively allied themselves with the Turkish minority and turned them as the overwhelming majority in the police force. This had now got out of control as far as the British were concerned, but nevertheless they still managed to exploit the situation.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=109}}\n\nThe truce against the collonial authorities lasted until the 28th of October 1957 ([[Ohi Day]], Greek national holiday) when Harold Macmillan, British minister of foreign affairs, declined a proposal by Makarios.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=106}}\n\n===December 1957\u2013August 1958 (Foot governorship and intercommunal violence) ===\n\nSir Hugh Foot arrived in Cyprus in December 1956, when it was obvious that a military victory for the British was not imminent.{{sfn|French|2015|p=241}}{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=213}} Grivas at that time was planning a gradual escalation of EOKA's attacks on the British forces but in mid-December, he called for a truce to give space for negotiations to take place. The truce broke on 4th March 1958 when a new wave of attacks was unleashed but this time, Grivas ordered his guerillas not to attack Turkish Cypriots to avoid [[Cypriot intercommunal violence|intercommunal violence]] that could lead to partition.{{sfn|French|2015|p=246-47}}\n\n==== EOKA and Turkish Cypriots ====\n\nThe Turkish Cypriot community objected to Enosis long before the 1950s from fear that unification with Greece would lead to their persecution and expulsion, a fear based on the fate of [[Cretan Turks]] after Crete's union with Greece.

Wagner NYWTS cropped.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Makarios III (here in 1962) was the political leader of EOKA.]]\n\nBritish authorities were unable to suppress EOKA activity, so the British government was trying to reach a solution that wouldn't embarrass Britain. [[MacMillan Plan(Cyprus)|MacMillan Plan]] put an effort in this direction. Greeks rejected the plan as they saw it as an open door leading to the partition of the island and Grivas cancelled the truce on September 7th.{{sfn|French|2015|p=270-73}} As such a new armed campaign was launched and the targets differed significantly from the previous periods. Grivas ordered guerillas to \"''strike indiscriminately at every English person wherever they can be found''\" resulting in the death of 8 British citizens in 104 incidents attacks in the following two months.{{sfn|French|2015|p=274-75}} But while the military force of EOKA was growing, Greek Cypriots were getting frustrated from the intercommunal violence and the struggle against the British. Makarios hinted in an interview that he was ready to shift his stance and accept an independent Cyprus. This development infuriated Grivas but was backed by influential members of the Greek Cypriot Community. EOKA was losing its broad support base. {{sfn|French|2015|p=283-85}}\n\nDuring the last months of 1958, all parties had reasons to favour a compromise. Greek Cypriot side was afraid that partition was becoming more and more imminent, Greece was anxious that the ongoing situation could lead to a war with Turkey, Turkey had to manage the ongoing crises at its eastern borders and the British didn't want to see NATO destabilizing because of Greek-Turkish war. On 5 December, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey acknowledged the situation and a series of meetings were arranged that resulted in [[London-Z\u00fcrich Agreements]]. This was a compromise solution in which Cyprus would become an independent and sovereign country.{{sfn|French|2015|p=289}} Both Makarios and Grivas accepted the agreements with a heavy heart, instead, Turkish-Cypriot leadership was enthusiastic about the compromise. On 9th of March 1959, Grivas issued a leaflet declaring his acceptance to London agreements.{{sfn|French|2015|p=290-92}}\n\nAccording to historian [[Heinz A.

The origins of Enosis date back to 1821, the year when the [[Greek War of Independence]] commenced, and the archbishop of Cyprus, his archdeacon, and three bishops were beheaded, amongst other atrocities.

The first involved playing the Greek and Turkish governments off against each other. Eden saw Turkey as \"the key protecting British interests\" in Cyprus.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} By the end of September, as the crisis was escalating, the British Government decided to replace [[Robert Perceval Armitage|governor Armitage]].{{sfn|French|2015|p=82}}\n\nIn Turkey, the public opinion was un-eased. Rumors were spreading in Turkish media that a slaughter of the Turkish Cypriot community was likely to occur. Though they were unfounded they led to nationalist reactions in the country and the government-sponsored anti-Greek [[Istanbul pogrom]] of September 1955.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=315-321}}. At the same time, during the London Trilateral Conference between Britain, Turkey and Greece, an agreement failed to materialize due to Turkish intransigence.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=299 & 313}}{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=73}}\n\nIn this fashion, British policy also aimed at the dramatic increase in recruitment of Turkish Cypriots. By the start of 1956, they had come to dominate the police force numbering 4,000 compared to less than 1,000 Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots were very much in the front line against EOKA. Inevitably, the use of Turkish Cypriot policemen against the Greek Cypriot community exacerbated relations between the two communities.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\n=== From October 1955 to March 1956 (Operation Forward Victory, phase I) ===\n\nThe new British governor [[John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton|John Harding]] arrived at October 3.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=83-84}} Harding sought to meet [[Makarios III|Archbishop Makarios]], and both agreed on commencing what became known as ''Harding-Makarios negotiations''.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=84-85}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=370}} Increased security and stepping up military might was of Harding's priorities.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=370-72}} On November 26, Harding declared stated of Emergency- that meant among other, implementation of the death penalty for non-fatality crimes. {{sfn|Richter|2011|p=373}} Repressive legislation and troop reinforcements did not succeed. The Greek Cypriot population was hostile and the Special Branch was neutered.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}} The British response was large-scale cordon and search operations which rarely resulted in arrests or the discovery of arms caches, but which invariably alienated those whose houses were searched or who were roughed up and dragged off to be screened. Collective punishments, far from undermining support for EOKA, only succeeded in making the Greek Cypriots more hostile to British rule.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}} Moreover, Harding viewed Cyprus very much as a pawn in the [[Cold War]] global situation: on December 13 he banned AKEL and detained 128 of its leading members, effectively crippling the only political party in Cyprus that opposed EOKA.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}}\n\nThe inevitable result was to increase sympathy for EOKA and to assist its recruitment efforts. The problem was that the Greek Cypriot community was overwhelmingly in favour of Enosis. Far from moderates emerging with whom Britain could do a deal.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}} It was this popular support, enabling Grivas and his small band of guerrillas to take on the growing security apparatus that Harding was marshaling against him, that sustained the armed struggle.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}} It became clear that EOKA did have an effective intelligence apparatus and that the guerrillas were often forewarned of security intentions. Schoolchildren, domestic servants, civilian personnel on the military bases, the police, all were enlisted by Grivas in the intelligence war while the security forces were operating in the dark.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}}\n\nOperation \"Forward to Victory\" (Greek name) was launched on November 18 and was accompanied by several bomb attacks.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=377|ps=: According to Richter, there were 50 bomb attacks that day.}} In the urban areas schoolchildren had a prominent role in the EOKA struggle.

However, due to harsh winter conditions in addition to certain British military pressure, the activity of EOKA temporarily eased.{{sfn|French|2015|p=88-89}} By the end of February 1956 the British were involved in suppressing a veritable schoolchildren revolt that left one boy shot dead and the island's school system almost completely closed down.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\n=== March 1956 to March 1957 (operation Victory, phase II) ===\n\nAfter the failure of Makarios-Harding negotiations the British government abruptly exiled Makarios to [[Seychelles]] on March 9, 1956.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=416-422}} This triggered a week long general strike followed by a dramatic increase in EOKA activity: 246 attacks until March 31 including an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Harding.

The last incident overshadowed the first real success against the EOKA guerrilla forces.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=103}}\n\nOn August 9 the British authorities hanged three more EOKA prisoners; however, Grivas did not retaliate this time. Widespread strikes were held in protest.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=104}} On November 1956 due to the [[Suez Crisis]] large numbers of British troops were transferred off Cyprus allowing Grivas to launch a new offensive.

According to Heinz Richter, while police or army was generally lawful, the British turned a blind eye to interrogators many of whom were deliberately under-educated Turkish Cypriot who were against ''Enosis''. Another aspect that Richter highlights is that many claims of torture were made as the alleged victims were afraid for their lives as it was punished by death to speak to the British.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=666-668}} David French on the other hand views that most - but not all- claims of torture were a propaganda tool of EOKA.{{sfn|French|2015|p=222-24}} In general Harding failed to win over the Greek Cypriot population especially when his security forces resorted to this kind of measures.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=107}}\n\n====Campaign against Greek Cypriot groups ====\nInitially, EOKA was intimidating the population not to co-operate with the security forces, but steadily the definition of traitor broadened as the security forces had some successes EOKA at the end of 1956.{{sfn|French|2015|p=158-59}} EOKA members who had spoken to the security forces under interrogation were also considered as traitors and Grivas was in favour of the death penalty in such case.

[[MacMillan Plan(Cyprus)|MacMillan Plan]] put an effort in this direction. Greeks rejected the plan as they saw it as an open door leading to the partition of the island and Grivas cancelled the truce on September 7th.{{sfn|French|2015|p=270-73}} As such a new armed campaign was launched and the targets differed significantly from the previous periods.

Makarios hinted in an interview that he was ready to shift his stance and accept an independent Cyprus. This development infuriated Grivas but was backed by influential members of the Greek Cypriot Community. EOKA was losing its broad support base. {{sfn|French|2015|p=283-85}}\n\nDuring the last months of 1958, all parties had reasons to favour a compromise. Greek Cypriot side was afraid that partition was becoming more and more imminent, Greece was anxious that the ongoing situation could lead to a war with Turkey, Turkey had to manage the ongoing crises at its eastern borders and the British didn't want to see NATO destabilizing because of Greek-Turkish war. On 5 December, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey acknowledged the situation and a series of meetings were arranged that resulted in [[London-Z\u00fcrich Agreements]]. This was a compromise solution in which Cyprus would become an independent and sovereign country.{{sfn|French|2015|p=289}} Both Makarios and Grivas accepted the agreements with a heavy heart, instead, Turkish-Cypriot leadership was enthusiastic about the compromise. On 9th of March 1959, Grivas issued a leaflet declaring his acceptance to London agreements.{{sfn|French|2015|p=290-92}}\n\nAccording to historian [[Heinz A.

As a two-year-old, he was initially overshadowed by his stable companion [[Raise a Native]] before emerging as one of the year's leading juveniles with a win in the [[Champagne Stakes (United States)|Champagne Stakes]]. As a three-year-old, he was highly tried, running twenty times and winning six races including the [[Jersey Derby]] and the [[American Derby]]. He was also placed second in the [[Belmont Stakes]] and the [[Jockey Club Gold Cup]]. He reached his peak as a four-year-old in 1965 when he was voted [[American Horse of the Year]] in a poll conducted by the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]''.\n\n==Background==\nRoman Brother was a bay gelding bred by the [[Ocala]] Stud Farm in [[Marion County, Florida|Marion County]] [[Florida]]. He was sired by Third Brother, who won the [[Long Island Handicap]] for his owner-breeder [[Christopher Chenery]] in 1956. Third Brother showed some promise as a stallion before his death in 1963: in addition to Roman Brother, he sired Exceedingly, who defeated [[Damascus]] in the William Dupont Jr. Handicap. Roman Brother's dam, Roman Zephyr, won four races and was a descendant of the influential broodmare [[Plucky Liege]]. In January 1963, Roman Brother was sent to the Florida Breeders' sale, where he sold for $23,500 (the second highest price at the sale) to Farnsworth Farm.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ivwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EwUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4030,5612602&dq=roman-brother&hl=en |title=Ocala horse brings record price at Florida Breeders' sale |publisher=Ocala Star-Banner |date=January 29, 1963 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n\nHe entered into the ownership of [[Louis Wolfson|Louis Wolfson's]] Harbor View Farm and was trained by future [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Burley Parke]].

As a two-year-old, he was initially overshadowed by his stable companion [[Raise a Native]] before emerging as one of the year's leading juveniles with a win in the [[Champagne Stakes (United States)|Champagne Stakes]]. As a three-year-old, he was highly tried, running twenty times and winning six races including the [[Jersey Derby]] and the [[American Derby]]. He was also placed second in the [[Belmont Stakes]] and the [[Jockey Club Gold Cup]]. He reached his peak as a four-year-old in 1965 when he was voted [[American Horse of the Year]] in a poll conducted by the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]''.\n\n==Background==\nRoman Brother was a bay gelding bred by the [[Ocala]] Stud Farm in [[Marion County, Florida|Marion County]] [[Florida]]. He was sired by Third Brother, who won the [[Long Island Handicap]] for his owner-breeder [[Christopher Chenery]] in 1956. Third Brother showed some promise as a stallion before his death in 1963: in addition to Roman Brother, he sired Exceedingly, who defeated [[Damascus]] in the William Dupont Jr. Handicap. Roman Brother's dam, Roman Zephyr, won four races and was a descendant of the influential broodmare [[Plucky Liege]]. In January 1963, Roman Brother was sent to the Florida Breeders' sale, where he sold for $23,500 (the second highest price at the sale) to Farnsworth Farm.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ivwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EwUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4030,5612602&dq=roman-brother&hl=en |title=Ocala horse brings record price at Florida Breeders' sale |publisher=Ocala Star-Banner |date=January 29, 1963 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n\nHe entered into the ownership of [[Louis Wolfson|Louis Wolfson's]] Harbor View Farm and was trained by future [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Burley Parke]].

The two had been one of the only known close rivals ever to have the same foaling date and to die within four months of each other due to the same illness.\n\nThe Roman Brother Handicap, a race restricted to Florida-breds and run at Hialeah, was named in the gelding's honor.\n\n==Pedigree==\n\n{{Pedigree \n| name = Roman Brother (USA) bay gelding 1961<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equineline.com/Free-5X-Pedigree.cfm?page_state=ORDER_AND_CONFIRM&reference_number=421621&registry=T&horse_name=Roman%20Brother&dam_name=Roman%20Zephyr&foaling_year=1961&nicking_stats_indicator=Y |title=Roman Brother pedigree |publisher=equineline.com |date=2012-05-08 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n| f = Third Brother (USA)<br />1953\n| m = Roman Zephyr (USA)<br />1947\n| ff = [[Princequillo]] (USA)<br />1940\n| fm = Hildene (USA)<br />1938\n| mf = [[Roman (horse)|Roman]] (USA)<br />1937\n| mm = Blois (USA) <br />1940\n| fff = [[Prince Rose]]\n| ffm = Cosquilla\n| fmf = [[Bubbling Over (horse)|Bubbling Over]]\n| fmm = Fancy Racket\n| mff = [[Sir Gallahad III|Sir Gallahad]]\n| mfm = Buckup\n| mmf = [[Man o' War]]\n| mmm = Mademoiselle de Valo\n| ffff = [[Rose Prince (horse)|Rose Prince]]\n| fffm = Indolence\n| ffmf = [[Papyrus (horse)|Papyrus]]\n| ffmm = Quick Thought\n| fmff = North Star\n| fmfm = Beaming Beauty\n| fmmf = Wrack\n| fmmm = Ultimate Fancy\n| mfff = [[Teddy (horse)|Teddy]]\n| mffm = [[Plucky Liege]]\n| mfmf = [[Buchan (horse)|Buchan]]\n| mfmm = Look Up\n| mmff = [[Fair Play (horse)|Fair Play]]\n| mmfm = Mahubah\n| mmmf = [[Sardanapale (horse)|Sardanapale]]\n| mmmm = Marguerite de Valois (Family: 16-a)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Families/Family16a.htm |title=Miss Agnes - Family 16-a |publisher=Bloodlines.net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n|}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n[[Category:1961 racehorse births]]\n[[Category:1991 racehorse deaths]]\n[[Category:Thoroughbred family 16-a]]\n[[Category:Racehorses bred in Florida]]\n[[Category:Racehorses trained in the United States]]\n[[Category:American Thoroughbred Horse of the Year]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRetirement and Death:replaced: November 16, 1990 \u2192 November 16, 1990,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Brother"}
