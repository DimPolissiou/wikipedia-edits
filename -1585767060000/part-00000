Of all the sons, Joseph was preferred by his father, who gave him a \"long [[coat of many colors]]\".<ref>Another possible translation is \"coat with long sleeves\" - see \"A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature\", 1903. {{ISBN|1-932443-20-7}}</ref> When Joseph was seventeen years old he had two dreams that made his brothers plot his demise. In the first dream, Joseph and his brothers gathered bundles of grain, of which those his brothers gathered, bowed to his own. In the second dream, the sun (father), the moon (mother), and eleven stars (brothers) bowed to Joseph himself. These dreams, implying his supremacy, angered his brothers.

The cup-bearer's dream was about a vine with three branches that was budding. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out and they produced grapes. The cup-bearer took those grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand. Joseph interpreted this dream as the cup-bearer being restored as cup-bearer to the Pharaoh within three days. The baker's dream was about three baskets full of bread for the Pharaoh, and birds were eating the bread out of those baskets. Joseph interpreted this dream as the baker being hanged within three days and having his flesh eaten by birds.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:5-22|HE}}</ref> Joseph requested that the cup-bearer mention him to Pharaoh to secure his release from prison,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:14-15|HE}}</ref> but the cup-bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:23|HE}}</ref> After two more years, the Pharaoh dreamt of seven lean cows which devoured seven fat cows; and of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears. When the Pharaoh's advisers failed to interpret these dreams, the cup-bearer remembered Joseph. Joseph was then summoned. He interpreted the dream as seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine, and advised the Pharaoh to store a surplus grain.\n\n===Vizier of Egypt===\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Toulouse \u2013 Le triomphe de Joseph Hilaire-Pader.jpg|thumb|left|''The triumph of Joseph'' (1657), [[Toulouse Cathedral]] ]]\n\nFollowing the prediction, Joseph became [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|Vizier]], under the name of [[Zaphnath-Paaneah]],<ref>Josephus refers to the name [[Zaphnath-Paaneah]] as ''Psothom Phanech'' meaning \u201cthe revealer of secrets\u201d \u2013 Josephus.

''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book II, 6.1.91</ref> to be his wife. During the seven years of abundance, Joseph ensured that the storehouses were full and that all produce was weighed. In the sixth year, Asenath bore two children to Joseph: [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] and [[Ephraim]]. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations came to Egypt to buy bread. The narrative also indicates that they went straight to Joseph or were directed to him, even by the Pharaoh himself. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:37-57|HE}}) As a last resort, all of the inhabitants of Egypt, less the Egyptian priestly class, sold their properties and later themselves (as slaves) to Joseph for seed; wherefore Joseph set a mandate that, because the people would be sowing and harvesting seed on government property, a fifth of the produce should go to the Pharaoh. This mandate lasted until the days of [[Moses]].

After they mentioned a younger brother at home, the Vizier (Joseph) demanded that he be brought to Egypt as a demonstration of their veracity. This was Joseph's full brother, [[Benjamin]]. Joseph placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion. When he returned, the Vizier took [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Simeon]] and bound him as a hostage.<ref>[[William Whiston]] comments that Simeon was chosen as a pledge for the sons of Israel\u2019s return to Egypt because of all the brothers that hated Joseph the most, was Simeon, according to the [[Testament of Simeon]] and the [[Testament of Zebulon]]. \u2013 Whiston.

Unbeknownst to them, Joseph had also returned their money to their money sacks.

They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men. Jacob became greatly distressed feeling that they treated him badly. After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Jacob told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah's persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|42:29-43:15|HE}})\n\n[[File:The Phillip Medhurst Picture Torah 222. Joseph\u2019s cup found in Benjamin\u2019s sack. Genesis cap 44 v 12. Mortier\u2019s Bible.jpg|thumb|Joseph's cup found in Benjamin's sack, illustration by Philip De Vere]]\nUpon their return to Egypt, the brothers were received by the steward of the house of Joseph. When they were brought to Joseph's house, they were apprehensive about the returned money in their money sacks. They thought that the missed transaction would somehow be used against them as way to induct them as slaves and confiscate their possessions. So they immediately informed the steward of what had transpired to get a feel of the situation. The steward put them at ease, telling them not to worry about the money, and brought out their brother Simeon. Then he brought the brothers into the house of Joseph and received them hospitably. When the Vizier (Joseph) appeared, they gave him gifts from their father. Joseph saw and inquired of Benjamin and was overcome by emotion but did not show it. He withdrew to his chambers and wept. When he regained control of himself, he returned and ordered a meal to be served. The Egyptians would not dine with Hebrews at the same table, as doing so was considered loathsome, so the sons of Israel were served at a separate table. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|43:16-44:34|HE}})\n\nThat night, Joseph ordered his steward to load the brothers' donkeys with food and all their money. The money they brought was double what they had from the first trip. Deceptively, Joseph also ordered that his silver cup be put in Benjamin's sack. The following morning the brothers began their journey back to Canaan. Joseph ordered the steward to go after the brothers and question them about the \"missing\" silver cup. When the steward caught up with the brothers, he seized them and searched their sacks. The steward found the cup in Benjamin's sack just as he had planted it the night before. This caused a stir amongst the brothers. However, they agreed to be escorted back to Egypt. When the Vizier (Joseph) confronted them about the silver cup, he demanded that the one who possessed the cup in his bag become his slave. In response, Judah pleaded with the Vizier that Benjamin be allowed to return to his father, and he himself be kept in Benjamin's place as a slave. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|44|HE}})\n\n===Family reunited===\n\n{{see also|Jacob#Jacob in Egypt|l1=Jacob in Egypt}}\n[[File:Joseph weeps.JPG|thumb|left|Joseph [[weep]]s]]\nJudah appealed to the Vizier begging that Benjamin be released and that he be enslaved in his stead, because of the silver cup found in Benjamin's sack. The Vizier broke down into tears. He could not control himself any longer and so he sent the Egyptian men out of the house. Then he revealed to the Hebrews that he was in fact their brother, Joseph. He wept so loudly that even the Egyptian household heard it outside. The brothers were frozen and could not utter a word. He brought them closer and relayed to them the events that had happened and told them  not to fear, that what they had meant for evil God had meant for good. Then he commanded them to go and bring their father and his entire household into Egypt to live in the province of [[Land of Goshen|Goshen]], because there were five more years of famine left. So Joseph supplied them Egyptian transport wagons, new garments, silver money, and twenty additional donkeys carrying provisions for the journey. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|45:1-28|HE}})\n\nThus, Jacob (also known as Israel) and his entire house of seventy,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|46:27|HE}}</ref> gathered up with all their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. As they approached Egyptian territory, Judah went ahead to ask Joseph where the caravan should unload. They were directed into the province of Goshen and Joseph readied his chariot to meet his father there.<ref>Josephus has Joseph meeting his father Jacob in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], a store-city with [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Raamses]], all located in the Egyptian country of Goshen. - Josephus. ''The Antiquities of the Jews''. Book II, 7.5.184</ref> It had been over twenty years since Joseph had last seen his father. When they met, they embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. His father then remarked, \u201cNow let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.\u201d ({{bibleverse||Genesis|46:1-34|HE}})\n\nAfterward, Joseph's family personally met the [[List of Pharaohs|Pharaoh]] of Egypt. The Pharaoh honored their stay and even proposed that if there were any qualified men in their house, then they may elect a chief herdsman to oversee Egyptian livestock. Because the Pharaoh had such a high regard for Joseph, practically making him his equal,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44:18|HE}}</ref> it had been an honor to meet his father. Thus, Israel was able to bless the Pharaoh. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|47:1-47:12|HE}}) The family was then settled in Goshen.\n\n===Father\u2019s blessing and passing===\n\n{{main|Blessing of Jacob}}\n\nThe house of Israel acquired many possessions and multiplied exceedingly during the course of seventeen years, even through the worst of the seven-year famine. At this time, Joseph's father was 147 years old and bedridden. He had fallen ill and lost most of his vision. Joseph was called into his father's house and Israel pleaded with his son that he not be buried in Egypt. Rather, he requested to be carried to the land of Canaan to be buried with his forefathers. Joseph was sworn to do as his father asked of him. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|47:27-31|HE}})\n\nLater, Joseph came to visit his father having with him his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Israel declared that they would be heirs to the inheritance of the house of Israel, as if they were his own children, just as Reuben and Simeon were. Then Israel laid his left hand on the eldest Mannasseh's head and his right hand on the youngest Ephraim's head and blessed Joseph. However, Joseph was displeased that his father's right hand was not on the head of his firstborn, so he switched his father's hands. But Israel refused saying, \u201cbut truly his younger brother shall be greater than he.\u201d A declaration he made just as Israel himself was to his firstborn brother Esau. To Joseph, he gave a portion more of Canaanite property than he had to his other sons; land that he fought for against the [[Amorite]]s. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|48:1-22|HE}})\n\nThen Israel called all of his sons in and prophesied their blessings or curses to all twelve of them in order of their ages. To Joseph he declared:\n\n:\"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty God of Jacob (From thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel), Even by the God of your father who shall help thee; and by the Almighty who shall bless thee With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lieth under, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills. They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\u201d - {{bibleref2|Genesis|49:22-26|KJV|Genesis 49:22-26 KJV}}\n\nAfter relaying his prophecies, Israel died. The family, including the Egyptians, mourned him seventy days. Joseph had his father [[embalm]]ed, a process that took forty days. Then he prepared a great ceremonial journey to Canaan leading the servants of the Pharaoh, and the elders of the houses Israel and Egypt beyond the [[Jordan River]]. They stopped at [[Atad]] where they observed seven days of mourning. Here, their lamentation was so great that it caught the attention of surrounding Canaanites who remarked \u201cThis is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.\u201d So they named this spot [[Abel Mizraim]]. Then Joseph buried Israel in the cave of [[Machpelah]], the property of [[Abraham]] when he bought it from the [[biblical Hittites|Hittites]]. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|49:33-50:14|HE}})\n\nAfter their father died, the brothers of Joseph feared retribution for being responsible for Joseph's deliverance into Egypt as a slave. Joseph wept as they spoke and told them that what had happened was God's purpose to save lives and the lives of his family. He comforted them and their ties were reconciled. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|50:15-21|HE}})\n\n===Joseph's burial===\n[[File:Holman Burying the Body of Joseph.jpg|thumb|''Burying the Body of Joseph'' (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible)]]\n\nJoseph lived to the age of 110, living to see his great-grandchildren. Before he died, he made the [[Israelites|children of Israel]] swear that when they left the land of Egypt they would take his bones with them, and on his death his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.

The favoritism Israel showed Joseph and the plot against him by his brothers were divine means of getting him into Egypt.<ref>Scharfstein, S. ''Torah and Commentary: The Five Books of Moses'' ({{ISBN|1602800200}}, {{ISBN|978-1-60280-020-5}}), 2008, p.124</ref> [[Maimonides]] comments that even the villager in Shechem, about whom Joseph inquired his brother's whereabouts, was a \"divine messenger\" working behind the scene.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, p. 120</ref>\n\nA [[midrash]] asked, ''How many times was Joseph sold?'' In analyzing {{bibleref2|Genesis|37|KJV|Genesis Chapter 37}}, there are five different Hebrew names used to describe five different groups of people involved in the transaction of selling Joseph, according to [[Judah ben Ilai|Rabbi Judah]] and [[Rav Huna]]. The first group identified, are Joseph's brothers when Judah brings up the idea of selling Joseph in verses 26 and 27. The first mention of Ishmaelites (Yishma'el\u00eem) is in verse 25. Then the Hebrew phrase ''\u0149\u0101sh\u00eem midyan\u00eem s\u014d\u0125r\u00eem'' in verse 28 describes Midianite traders. A fourth group in verse 36 is named in Hebrew as ''m\u2018dan\u00eem'' that is properly identified as [[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medanites]]. The final group, where a transaction is made, is among the Egyptians in the same verse.\n\nAfter identifying the Hebrew names, Rabbi Judah claims that Joseph was sold four times: First his brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites (Yishma'el\u00eem), then the Ishmaelites sold him to the Midianite traders (\u0149\u0101sh\u00eem midyan\u00eem s\u014d\u0125r\u00eem), the Midianite traders to the Medanites (m\u2018dan\u00eem), and the Medanites into Egypt. [[Rav Huna]] adds one more sale by concluding that after the Medanites sold him to the Egyptians, a fifth sale occurred when the Egyptians sold him to [[Potiphar]]. ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 84:22)\n\n===Potiphar\u2019s wife===\nJoseph had good reasons not to have an affair with Potiphar's wife: he did not want to abuse his master's trust; he believed in the sanctity of marriage; and it went against his ethical, moral and religious principles taught to him by his father Jacob.  According to the [[Midrash]], Joseph would have been immediately executed by the sexual assault charge against him by Potiphar's wife. [[Abravanel]] explains that she had accused other servants of the same crime in the past.  Potiphar believed that Joseph was incapable of such an act and petitioned Pharaoh to spare his life.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 125\u201326</ref> However, punishment could not have been avoided because of her class status and limited public knowledge of her scheme.\n\nAccording to ''[[Legend of the Jews]]'', the name of Potiphar\u2019s wife is [[Zuleikha (tradition)|Zuleikha]] and when she was enticing Joseph to give up to her sinful passion, God appeared unto him, holding the foundation of earth (''Eben Shetiyah''), that He would destroy the world If Joseph touched her.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Legends of the Jews|url= https://archive.org/details/legendsjewsfrom00cohegoog|last= Ginzberg|first= Louis|year= 1909|publisher= Jewish Publication Society|location= Philadelphia|isbn= |pages= |quote =Then the Lord appeared unto him, holding the Eben Shetiyah in His hand, and said to him: \"If thou touchest her, I will cast away this stone upon which the earth is founded, and the world will fall to ruin.\".}}</ref>\n\n===Silver cup for divination===\n[[File:Joseph Overseer of the Pharaohs Granaries.jpg|thumb|''Joseph Overseer of the Pharaoh's Granaries'', oil on canvas, by [[Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], 1874]]\nJewish tradition holds that Joseph had his steward plant his personal silver cup in Benjamin's sack to test his brothers. He wanted to know if they would be willing to risk danger in order to save their half brother Benjamin. Since Joseph and Benjamin were born from Rachel, this test was necessary to reveal if they would betray Benjamin as they did with Joseph when he was seventeen. Because ''Joseph the Dreamer'' predicts the future by analyzing dreams, alternative Jewish tradition claims that he practiced divination using this silver cup as the steward charged<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44:15|HE}}</ref> and as Joseph himself claimed in {{bibleverse||Genesis|44:15|HE}}.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 138\u201339</ref>\n\n===Raising Joseph===\nIn one [[Talmud]]ic story, Joseph was buried in the [[Nile river]], as there was some dispute as to which province should be honored by having his tomb within its boundaries. [[Moses]], led there by an ancient holy woman named [[Serach]], was able by a miracle to raise the [[sarcophagus]] and to take it with him at the time of [[the Exodus]].\n\n== Christian tradition ==\nJoseph is mentioned in the [[New Testament]] as an example of faith ({{bibleref2|Hebrews|11:22|9}}).\n\nJoseph is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on 26 July. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], he is known as \"Joseph the all-comely\", a reference not only to his physical appearance, but more importantly to the beauty of his spiritual life. They commemorate him on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before [[Christmas]]) and on [[Holy and Great Monday]] (Monday of [[Holy Week]]). In [[icon]]s, he is sometimes depicted wearing the [[nemes]] headdress of an [[Egyptian vizier]]. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] commemorates him as a patriarch on 31 March.\n\n=== Typological interpretation ===\n\nIn addition to honoring him, there was a strong tendency in the [[patristics|patristic]] period to view his life as a [[Typology (theology)|typological]] precursor to Christ.<ref>{{citation|last=Smith|first=Kathryn|year=1993|title=History, Typology and Homily: The Joseph Cycle in the Queen Mary Psalter|journal=Gesta|volume=32|issue=2|pages=147\u201359|issn=0016-920X|jstor=767172|doi=10.2307/767172}}</ref> This tendency is represented in [[John Chrysostom]] who said that Joseph's suffering was \"a type of things to come\",<ref>{{citation|last=Chrysostom|first=John|authorlink=John Chrysostom|title=Homilies on Genesis, 46-47|year=1992|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington DC|page=191|others=trans.

The cup-bearer's dream was about a vine with three branches that was budding. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out and they produced grapes. The cup-bearer took those grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand. Joseph interpreted this dream as the cup-bearer being restored as cup-bearer to the Pharaoh within three days. The baker's dream was about three baskets full of bread for the Pharaoh, and birds were eating the bread out of those baskets. Joseph interpreted this dream as the baker being hanged within three days and having his flesh eaten by birds.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:5-22|HE}}</ref> Joseph requested that the cup-bearer mention him to Pharaoh to secure his release from prison,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:14-15|HE}}</ref> but the cup-bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:23|HE}}</ref> After two more years, the Pharaoh dreamt of seven lean cows which devoured seven fat cows; and of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears. When the Pharaoh's advisers failed to interpret these dreams, the cup-bearer remembered Joseph. Joseph was then summoned.

In the sixth year, Asenath bore two children to Joseph: [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] and [[Ephraim]]. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations came to Egypt to buy bread. The narrative also indicates that they went straight to Joseph or were directed to him, even by the Pharaoh himself. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:37-57|HE}}) As a last resort, all of the inhabitants of Egypt, less the Egyptian priestly class, sold their properties and later themselves (as slaves) to Joseph for seed; wherefore Joseph set a mandate that, because the people would be sowing and harvesting seed on government property, a fifth of the produce should go to the Pharaoh.

Joseph placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion.

They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men. Jacob became greatly distressed feeling that they treated him badly. After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Jacob told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah's persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|42:29-43:15|HE}})\n\n[[File:The Phillip Medhurst Picture Torah 222. Joseph\u2019s cup found in Benjamin\u2019s sack. Genesis cap 44 v 12. Mortier\u2019s Bible.jpg|thumb|Joseph's cup found in Benjamin's sack, illustration by Philip De Vere]]\nUpon their return to Egypt, the brothers were received by the steward of the house of Joseph. When they were brought to Joseph's house, they were apprehensive about the returned money in their money sacks. They thought that the missed transaction would somehow be used against them as way to induct them as slaves and confiscate their possessions. So they immediately informed the steward of what had transpired to get a feel of the situation. The steward put them at ease, telling them not to worry about the money, and brought out their brother Simeon. Then he brought the brothers into the house of Joseph and received them hospitably. When the Vizier (Joseph) appeared, they gave him gifts from their father. Joseph saw and inquired of Benjamin and was overcome by emotion but did not show it. He withdrew to his chambers and wept. When he regained control of himself, he returned and ordered a meal to be served. The Egyptians would not dine with Hebrews at the same table, as doing so was considered loathsome, so the sons of Israel were served at a separate table. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|43:16-44:34|HE}})\n\nThat night, Joseph ordered his steward to load the brothers' donkeys with food and all their money. The money they brought was double what they had from the first trip. Deceptively, Joseph also ordered that his silver cup be put in Benjamin's sack. The following morning the brothers began their journey back to Canaan. Joseph ordered the steward to go after the brothers and question them about the \"missing\" silver cup. When the steward caught up with the brothers, he seized them and searched their sacks. The steward found the cup in Benjamin's sack just as he had planted it the night before. This caused a stir amongst the brothers. However, they agreed to be escorted back to Egypt. When the Vizier (Joseph) confronted them about the silver cup, he demanded that the one who possessed the cup in his bag become his slave. In response, Judah pleaded with the Vizier that Benjamin be allowed to return to his father, and he himself be kept in Benjamin's place as a slave. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|44|HE}})\n\n===Family reunited===\n\n{{see also|Jacob#Jacob in Egypt|l1=Jacob in Egypt}}\n[[File:Joseph weeps.JPG|thumb|left|Joseph [[weep]]s]]\nJudah appealed to the Vizier begging that Benjamin be released and that he be enslaved in his stead, because of the silver cup found in Benjamin's sack. The Vizier broke down into tears. He could not control himself any longer and so he sent the Egyptian men out of the house. Then he revealed to the Hebrews that he was in fact their brother, Joseph. He wept so loudly that even the Egyptian household heard it outside. The brothers were frozen and could not utter a word. He brought them closer and relayed to them the events that had happened and told them  not to fear, that what they had meant for evil God had meant for good. Then he commanded them to go and bring their father and his entire household into Egypt to live in the province of [[Land of Goshen|Goshen]], because there were five more years of famine left. So Joseph supplied them Egyptian transport wagons, new garments, silver money, and twenty additional donkeys carrying provisions for the journey. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|45:1-28|HE}})\n\nThus, Jacob (also known as Israel) and his entire house of seventy,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|46:27|HE}}</ref> gathered up with all their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. As they approached Egyptian territory, Judah went ahead to ask Joseph where the caravan should unload. They were directed into the province of Goshen and Joseph readied his chariot to meet his father there.<ref>Josephus has Joseph meeting his father Jacob in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], a store-city with [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Raamses]], all located in the Egyptian country of Goshen. - Josephus. ''The Antiquities of the Jews''. Book II, 7.5.184</ref> It had been over twenty years since Joseph had last seen his father. When they met, they embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. His father then remarked, \u201cNow let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.\u201d ({{bibleverse||Genesis|46:1-34|HE}})\n\nAfterward, Joseph's family personally met the [[List of Pharaohs|Pharaoh]] of Egypt. The Pharaoh honored their stay and even proposed that if there were any qualified men in their house, then they may elect a chief herdsman to oversee Egyptian livestock. Because the Pharaoh had such a high regard for Joseph, practically making him his equal,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44:18|HE}}</ref> it had been an honor to meet his father. Thus, Israel was able to bless the Pharaoh. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|47:1-47:12|HE}}) The family was then settled in Goshen.\n\n===Father\u2019s blessing and passing===\n\n{{main|Blessing of Jacob}}\n\nThe house of Israel acquired many possessions and multiplied exceedingly during the course of seventeen years, even through the worst of the seven-year famine. At this time, Joseph's father was 147 years old and bedridden. He had fallen ill and lost most of his vision. Joseph was called into his father's house and Israel pleaded with his son that he not be buried in Egypt. Rather, he requested to be carried to the land of Canaan to be buried with his forefathers. Joseph was sworn to do as his father asked of him. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|47:27-31|HE}})\n\nLater, Joseph came to visit his father having with him his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Israel declared that they would be heirs to the inheritance of the house of Israel, as if they were his own children, just as Reuben and Simeon were. Then Israel laid his left hand on the eldest Mannasseh's head and his right hand on the youngest Ephraim's head and blessed Joseph. However, Joseph was displeased that his father's right hand was not on the head of his firstborn, so he switched his father's hands. But Israel refused saying, \u201cbut truly his younger brother shall be greater than he.\u201d A declaration he made just as Israel himself was to his firstborn brother Esau. To Joseph, he gave a portion more of Canaanite property than he had to his other sons; land that he fought for against the [[Amorite]]s. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|48:1-22|HE}})\n\nThen Israel called all of his sons in and prophesied their blessings or curses to all twelve of them in order of their ages. To Joseph he declared:\n\n:\"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty God of Jacob (From thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel), Even by the God of your father who shall help thee; and by the Almighty who shall bless thee With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lieth under, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills. They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\u201d - {{bibleref2|Genesis|49:22-26|KJV|Genesis 49:22-26 KJV}}\n\nAfter relaying his prophecies, Israel died. The family, including the Egyptians, mourned him seventy days. Joseph had his father [[embalm]]ed, a process that took forty days. Then he prepared a great ceremonial journey to Canaan leading the servants of the Pharaoh, and the elders of the houses Israel and Egypt beyond the [[Jordan River]]. They stopped at [[Atad]] where they observed seven days of mourning. Here, their lamentation was so great that it caught the attention of surrounding Canaanites who remarked \u201cThis is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.\u201d So they named this spot [[Abel Mizraim]]. Then Joseph buried Israel in the cave of [[Machpelah]], the property of [[Abraham]] when he bought it from the [[biblical Hittites|Hittites]]. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|49:33-50:14|HE}})\n\nAfter their father died, the brothers of Joseph feared retribution for being responsible for Joseph's deliverance into Egypt as a slave. Joseph wept as they spoke and told them that what had happened was God's purpose to save lives and the lives of his family. He comforted them and their ties were reconciled. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|50:15-21|HE}})\n\n===Joseph's burial===\n[[File:Holman Burying the Body of Joseph.jpg|thumb|''Burying the Body of Joseph'' (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible)]]\n\nJoseph lived to the age of 110, living to see his great-grandchildren. Before he died, he made the [[Israelites|children of Israel]] swear that when they left the land of Egypt they would take his bones with them, and on his death his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|50:22-26|HE}})\n\nThe [[Israelites|children of Israel]] remembered their oath, and when they left Egypt during [[the Exodus]], [[Moses]] took Joseph's bones with him. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|13:19|HE}}) The bones were buried at [[Shechem]], in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of [[Hamor]] ({{bibleverse||Joshua|24:32|HE}}), which has traditionally been identified with site of [[Joseph's Tomb]], before Jacob and all his family moved to Egypt.

The favoritism Israel showed Joseph and the plot against him by his brothers were divine means of getting him into Egypt.<ref>Scharfstein, S. ''Torah and Commentary: The Five Books of Moses'' ({{ISBN|1602800200}}, {{ISBN|978-1-60280-020-5}}), 2008, p.124</ref> [[Maimonides]] comments that even the villager in Shechem, about whom Joseph inquired his brother's whereabouts, was a \"divine messenger\" working behind the scene.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, p. 120</ref>\n\nA [[midrash]] asked, ''How many times was Joseph sold?'' In analyzing {{bibleref2|Genesis|37|KJV|Genesis Chapter 37}}, there are five different Hebrew names used to describe five different groups of people involved in the transaction of selling Joseph, according to [[Judah ben Ilai|Rabbi Judah]] and [[Rav Huna]]. The first group identified, are Joseph's brothers when Judah brings up the idea of selling Joseph in verses 26 and 27. The first mention of Ishmaelites (Yishma'el\u00eem) is in verse 25. Then the Hebrew phrase ''\u0149\u0101sh\u00eem midyan\u00eem s\u014d\u0125r\u00eem'' in verse 28 describes Midianite traders. A fourth group in verse 36 is named in Hebrew as ''m\u2018dan\u00eem'' that is properly identified as [[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medanites]]. The final group, where a transaction is made, is among the Egyptians in the same verse.\n\nAfter identifying the Hebrew names, Rabbi Judah claims that Joseph was sold four times: First his brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites (Yishma'el\u00eem), then the Ishmaelites sold him to the Midianite traders (\u0149\u0101sh\u00eem midyan\u00eem s\u014d\u0125r\u00eem), the Midianite traders to the Medanites (m\u2018dan\u00eem), and the Medanites into Egypt. [[Rav Huna]] adds one more sale by concluding that after the Medanites sold him to the Egyptians, a fifth sale occurred when the Egyptians sold him to [[Potiphar]]. ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 84:22)\n\n===Potiphar\u2019s wife===\nJoseph had good reasons not to have an affair with Potiphar's wife: he did not want to abuse his master's trust; he believed in the sanctity of marriage; and it went against his ethical, moral and religious principles taught to him by his father Jacob.  According to the [[Midrash]], Joseph would have been immediately executed by the sexual assault charge against him by Potiphar's wife. [[Abravanel]] explains that she had accused other servants of the same crime in the past.  Potiphar believed that Joseph was incapable of such an act and petitioned Pharaoh to spare his life.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 125\u201326</ref> However, punishment could not have been avoided because of her class status and limited public knowledge of her scheme.\n\nAccording to ''[[Legend of the Jews]]'', the name of Potiphar\u2019s wife is [[Zuleikha (tradition)|Zuleikha]] and when she was enticing Joseph to give up to her sinful passion, God appeared unto him, holding the foundation of earth (''Eben Shetiyah''), that He would destroy the world If Joseph touched her.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Legends of the Jews|url= https://archive.org/details/legendsjewsfrom00cohegoog|last= Ginzberg|first= Louis|year= 1909|publisher= Jewish Publication Society|location= Philadelphia|isbn= |pages= |quote =Then the Lord appeared unto him, holding the Eben Shetiyah in His hand, and said to him: \"If thou touchest her, I will cast away this stone upon which the earth is founded, and the world will fall to ruin.\".}}</ref>\n\n===Silver cup for divination===\n[[File:Joseph Overseer of the Pharaohs Granaries.jpg|thumb|''Joseph Overseer of the Pharaoh's Granaries'', oil on canvas, by [[Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], 1874]]\nJewish tradition holds that Joseph had his steward plant his personal silver cup in Benjamin's sack to test his brothers. He wanted to know if they would be willing to risk danger in order to save their half brother Benjamin. Since Joseph and Benjamin were born from Rachel, this test was necessary to reveal if they would betray Benjamin as they did with Joseph when he was seventeen. Because ''Joseph the Dreamer'' predicts the future by analyzing dreams, alternative Jewish tradition claims that he practiced divination using this silver cup as the steward charged<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44:15|HE}}</ref> and as Joseph himself claimed in {{bibleverse||Genesis|44:15|HE}}.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 138\u201339</ref>\n\n===Raising Joseph===\nIn one [[Talmud]]ic story, Joseph was buried in the [[Nile river]], as there was some dispute as to which province should be honored by having his tomb within its boundaries. [[Moses]], led there by an ancient holy woman named [[Serach]], was able by a miracle to raise the [[sarcophagus]] and to take it with him at the time of [[the Exodus]].\n\n== Christian tradition ==\nJoseph is mentioned in the [[New Testament]] as an example of faith ({{bibleref2|Hebrews|11:22|9}}).\n\nJoseph is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on 26 July. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], he is known as \"Joseph the all-comely\", a reference not only to his physical appearance, but more importantly to the beauty of his spiritual life. They commemorate him on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before [[Christmas]]) and on [[Holy and Great Monday]] (Monday of [[Holy Week]]). In [[icon]]s, he is sometimes depicted wearing the [[nemes]] headdress of an [[Egyptian vizier]]. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] commemorates him as a patriarch on 31 March.\n\n=== Typological interpretation ===\n\nIn addition to honoring him, there was a strong tendency in the [[patristics|patristic]] period to view his life as a [[Typology (theology)|typological]] precursor to Christ.<ref>{{citation|last=Smith|first=Kathryn|year=1993|title=History, Typology and Homily: The Joseph Cycle in the Queen Mary Psalter|journal=Gesta|volume=32|issue=2|pages=147\u201359|issn=0016-920X|jstor=767172|doi=10.2307/767172}}</ref> This tendency is represented in [[John Chrysostom]] who said that Joseph's suffering was \"a type of things to come\",<ref>{{citation|last=Chrysostom|first=John|authorlink=John Chrysostom|title=Homilies on Genesis, 46-47|year=1992|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington DC|page=191|others=trans.

Tottenham Hotspur shrugged off a disappointing Champions League campaign to push Chelsea close for the title, though they ultimately missed out. However, they finished the season with statistically both the best attack and defence, with striker [[Harry Kane]] once again claiming the Golden Boot. Furthermore, the season marked the end of Tottenham's 118-year stay at the White Hart Lane stadium, temporarily using Wembley for the subsequent season, before a new stadium move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.bt.com/football/premier-league-facts-2016-17-S11364181838117|title=Premier League facts 2016-17|last=|first=|date=21 May 2017|website=BT Sport|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> Manchester City finished one spot better than the previous season in [[Pep Guardiola]]'s first season in charge, though ended the season trophy-less, despite recording the third-best attack and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Liverpool made the Champions League for the first time in three years in [[J\u00fcrgen Klopp]]'s first full season, though they were prevented from finishing any higher than fourth by an inconsistent start to 2017, a consequence of both losing their \u00a335&nbsp;million signing [[Sadio Man\u00e9]] to international duty in January and February as well as suffering from several dropped points against bottom-half teams.\n\nDespite winning seven of their final eight games, Arsenal finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1997, as fan pressure on both manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] and majority-shareholder [[Stan Kroenke]] grew. While they did win the FA Cup for the third time in four seasons, making Wenger the most successful manager in the competition's history, they endured yet another disappointing Champions League run, eliminated at the round of 16 for a seventh successive year. Manchester United finished sixth, one lower than the previous season, in [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]'s first season in charge, with their failure to turn any one of their 15 draws \u2013 with 12 earned amidst the season-record 25 matches unbeaten run \u2013 into victories proving problematic. They did at least win the EFL Cup and won the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League final]]. The latter was the first Europa League title in their history, not only securing a place in the Champions League but also made them only the fifth club to [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|have won all three major European trophies]].\n\nIn only their second-ever top-flight season, AFC Bournemouth built on the success of the previous season as they secured a ninth-place finish and scored 55 goals, defying the critics who had tipped them to struggle from second-season syndrome. Much as Chelsea had the previous season, Leicester City made a poor defence of their title, despite having what turned out to be the best Champions League run of any English club this season. They were beaten by Hull City in the first match, the first time this has happened to a reigning Premier League champion. With the club struggling, manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] was sacked in February and replaced by coach [[Craig Shakespeare]], who steered the club to 12th. It broke the record of the lowest finish for Premier League title holders, previously set by Chelsea, but comfortably clear of relegation.\n\nSwansea City had looked dead and buried after early struggles under [[Francesco Guidolin]] and then a disastrous spell with [[Bob Bradley]] as manager, but were saved by a late improvement under [[Paul Clement (football manager)|Paul Clement]]'s management. Burnley fared the best of the promoted clubs, with only atrocious away form preventing them finishing higher as they made their home-ground of Turf Moor one of the hardest places to get a point from \u2013 and secured a second successive top-flight season for the first time in 40 years. Watford, in their first successive top-flight campaign for 30 years, successfully ensured a third consecutive Premier League season \u2013 however, as a result of poor away form, a disastrous end to the season and several spells of indifferent form throughout the campaign, the Hornets were unable to really build on the previous season despite recording their first league victories over Manchester United and at Arsenal since the 1980s.\n\nAfter several successive escapes from relegation, Sunderland's resilience finally broke and they dropped into the Championship after a decade, having spent virtually the entire season rooted to the bottom of the table. Middlesbrough also struggled through their first top-flight season in eight years, with a poor end to the season, the weakest goal-scoring record in the division and an inability to turn one of their 13 draws into victories dooming them. Hull City were the final relegated side, never quite recovering from a disastrous pre-season which saw manager [[Steve Bruce]] quit and next to no new players signed. Despite encouraging early season form under [[Mike Phelan]], a dismal run in the winter saw him sacked and replaced by [[Marco Silva]], who steered the club to a much better second half of the season, but it ultimately proved to be a case of too little, too late.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Burnley and Hull City returned to the top flight after a season's absence while Middlesbrough returned after a seven-year absence. They replaced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], ending their top flight spells of six, one and twenty-eight years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2016\u201317 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long= -0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.735232 |long=-1.838287 |label_size=80|label=[[A.F.C.

Tottenham Hotspur shrugged off a disappointing Champions League campaign to push Chelsea close for the title, though they ultimately missed out. However, they finished the season with statistically both the best attack and defence, with striker [[Harry Kane]] once again claiming the Golden Boot. Furthermore, the season marked the end of Tottenham's 118 year stay at the White Hart Lane stadium, temporarily using Wembley for the subsequent season, before a new stadium move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.bt.com/football/premier-league-facts-2016-17-S11364181838117|title=Premier League facts 2016-17|last=|first=|date=21 May 2017|website=BT Sport|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> Manchester City finished one spot better than the previous season in [[Pep Guardiola]]'s first season in charge, though ended the season trophy-less, despite recording the third-best attack and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Liverpool made the Champions League for the first time in three years in [[J\u00fcrgen Klopp]]'s first full season, though they were prevented from finishing any higher than fourth by an inconsistent start to 2017, a consequence of both losing their \u00a335&nbsp;million signing [[Sadio Man\u00e9]] to international duty in January and February as well as suffering from several dropped points against bottom-half teams.\n\nDespite winning seven of their final eight games, Arsenal finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1997, as fan pressure on both manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] and majority-shareholder [[Stan Kroenke]] grew. While they did win the FA Cup for the third time in four seasons, making Wenger the most successful manager in the competition's history, they endured yet another disappointing Champions League run, eliminated at the round of 16 for a seventh successive year. Manchester United finished sixth, one lower than the previous season, in [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]'s first season in charge, with their failure to turn any one of their 15 draws \u2013 with 12 earned amidst the season-record 25 matches unbeaten run \u2013 into victories proving problematic. They did at least win the EFL Cup and won the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League final]]. The latter was the first Europa League title in their history, not only securing a place in the Champions League but also made them only the fifth club to [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|have won all three major European trophies]].\n\nIn only their second-ever top-flight season, AFC Bournemouth built on the success of the previous season as they secured a ninth-place finish and scored 55 goals, defying the critics who had tipped them to struggle from second-season syndrome. Much as Chelsea had the previous season, Leicester City made a poor defence of their title, despite having what turned out to be the best Champions League run of any English club this season. They were beaten by Hull City in the first match, the first time this has happened to a reigning Premier League champion. With the club struggling, manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] was sacked in February and replaced by coach [[Craig Shakespeare]], who steered the club to 12th. It broke the record of the lowest finish for Premier League title holders, previously set by Chelsea, but comfortably clear of relegation.\n\nSwansea City had looked dead and buried after early struggles under [[Francesco Guidolin]] and then a disastrous spell with [[Bob Bradley]] as manager, but were saved by a late improvement under [[Paul Clement (football manager)|Paul Clement]]'s management. Burnley fared the best of the promoted clubs, with only atrocious away form preventing them finishing higher as they made their home-ground of Turf Moor one of the hardest places to get a point from \u2013 and secured a second successive top-flight season for the first time in 40 years. Watford, in their first successive top-flight campaign for 30 years, successfully ensured a third consecutive Premier League season \u2013 however, as a result of poor away form, a disastrous end to the season and several spells of indifferent form throughout the campaign, the Hornets were unable to really build on the previous season despite recording their first league victories over Manchester United and at Arsenal since the 1980s.\n\nAfter several successive escapes from relegation, Sunderland's resilience finally broke and they dropped into the Championship after a decade, having spent virtually the entire season rooted to the bottom of the table. Middlesbrough also struggled through their first top-flight season in eight years, with a poor end to the season, the weakest goal-scoring record in the division and an inability to turn one of their 13 draws into victories dooming them. Hull City were the final relegated side, never quite recovering from a disastrous pre-season which saw manager [[Steve Bruce]] quit and next to no new players signed. Despite encouraging early season form under [[Mike Phelan]], a dismal run in the winter saw him sacked and replaced by [[Marco Silva]], who steered the club to a much better second half of the season, but it ultimately proved to be a case of too little, too late.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Burnley and Hull City returned to the top flight after a season's absence while Middlesbrough returned after a seven-year absence. They replaced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], ending their top flight spells of six, one and twenty-eight years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2016\u201317 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long= -0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.735232 |long=-1.838287 |label_size=80|label=[[A.F.C.
