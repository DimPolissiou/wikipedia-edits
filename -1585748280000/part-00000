This is because the luminance (which is essentially \"brightness\" in visible light) of a heated [[black body]] (closely approximated by the photosphere) at these temperatures varies extremely with temperature\u2014considerably more so than the (temperature to the fourth power) variation in the total [[black-body radiation]] at all wavelengths (see [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]). Isolated from the surrounding photosphere a sunspot would be brighter than the [[Moon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/sunspot.html|title=Sunspots|publisher=NASA|date=1 April 1998|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nSunspots have two parts: the central [[wikt:umbra|umbra]], which is the darkest part, where the magnetic field is approximately vertical ([[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the Sun's surface) and the surrounding [[wikt:penumbra|penumbra]], which is lighter, where the magnetic field is more inclined.\n\n=== Lifecycle ===\n\nAny given appearance of a sunspot may last anywhere from a few days to a few months, though groups of sunspots and their active regions tend to last weeks or months, but all do eventually decay and disappear. Sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the Sun, with diameters ranging from {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us|abbr=on}} to {{convert|160000|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us|abbr=on}}.\n\nAlthough the details of sunspot generation are still a matter of research, it appears that sunspots are the visible counterparts of [[Flux tube|magnetic flux tube]]s in the Sun's [[Convection zone|convective zone]] that get \"wound up\" by [[differential rotation]]. If the stress on the tubes reaches a certain limit, they curl up and puncture the Sun's surface. Convection is inhibited at the puncture points; the energy flux from the Sun's interior decreases, and with it, surface temperature.\n\nThe [[Wilson effect]] implies that sunspots are depressions on the Sun's surface. Observations using the [[Zeeman effect]] show that prototypical sunspots come in pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. From cycle to cycle, the polarities of leading and trailing (with respect to the solar rotation) sunspots change from north/south to south/north and back. Sunspots usually appear in groups.\n\n[[Magnetic pressure]] should tend to remove field concentrations, causing the sunspots to disperse, but sunspot lifetimes are measured in days to weeks. In 2001, observations from the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) using sound waves traveling below the photosphere (local [[helioseismology]]) were used to develop a three-dimensional image of the internal structure below sunspots; these observations show that a powerful downdraft underneath each sunspot, forms a rotating [[vortex]] that sustains the concentrated magnetic field.<ref>{{cite news|title=SOHO reveals how sunspots take stranglehold on the Sun|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0111/06sunspots/|newspaper=SpaceFlight Now|date=6 November 2001|author=NASA News Release}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar cycle ===\n{{main|Solar cycle}}\n[[Image:Sunspot butterfly graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Butterfly diagram showing paired [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]] behavior|alt=Point chart showing sunspot area as percent of the total area at various latitudes, above grouped bar chart showing average daily sunspot area as % of visible hemisphere.]]\n\nSunspot activity cycles are about every eleven years, with some variation in length. Over the solar cycle, sunspot populations rise quickly and then fall more slowly.  The point of highest sunspot activity during a cycle is known as solar maximum, and the point of lowest activity as solar minimum.  This period is also observed in most other [[Solar phenomena|solar activity]] and is linked to a variation in the solar magnetic field that changes polarity with this period.\n\nEarly in the cycle, sunspots appear in the higher latitudes and then move towards the equator as the cycle approaches maximum, following [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]]. Spots from two adjacent cycles can co-exist for some time. Spots from adjacent cycles can be distinguished by direction of their magnetic field.\n\n[[Wolf number|The Wolf number]] sunspot index counts the average number of sunspots and groups of sunspots during specific intervals. The 11-year solar cycles are numbered sequentially, starting with the observations made in the 1750s.<ref name=\"testtest1\">{{cite book\n| author=Tribble, A.  |date=2003\n| title=The Space Environment, Implications for Spacecraft Design\n| publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=15\u201318}}</ref>\n\n[[George Ellery Hale]] first linked magnetic fields and sunspots in 1908.<ref name=\"doi10.1086/141602\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hale | first1 = G.

[[Horace W. Babcock]] later proposed a qualitative model for the dynamics of the solar outer layers. The [[Babcock Model]] explains that magnetic fields cause the behavior described by Sp\u00f6rer's law, as well as other effects, which are twisted by the Sun's rotation.\n\n=== Longer-period trends ===\n{{main|Solar cycle}}\n\nSunspot number also changes over long periods.

A telescope [[eyepiece]] can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose [[H-alpha#Filter|hydrogen-alpha]] narrow bandpass filters and [[vacuum deposition|aluminum-coated]] glass [[attenuation]] filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high [[optical density]]) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.\n\n== Application ==\n\nDue to its link to other kinds of [[solar variation|solar activity]], sunspot occurrence can be used to help predict [[space weather]], the state of the [[ionosphere]], and hence the conditions of [[short-wave]] [[radio propagation]] or [[satellite communication]]s. High sunspot activity is celebrated by members of the amateur radio community as a harbinger of excellent ionospheric propagation conditions that greatly increase radio range in the [[High Frequency|HF]] bands. During sunspot peaks, worldwide radio communication can be possible on frequencies as high as the [[6-meter band|6-meter VHF band]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hamradioschool.com/sunspots-and-propagation/|title=Sunspots and Propagation|author=Stu Turner|publisher=Ham Radio School.com|access-date=5 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626024320/http://www.hamradioschool.com/sunspots-and-propagation/|archive-date=26 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Solar activity and climate|Solar activity]] (and the solar cycle) have been implicated in [[global warming]], originally the role of the [[Maunder Minimum]] of sunspot occurrence in the [[Little Ice Age]] in European winter climate.<ref name=\"MM_PAPER\">{{cite journal |author=Eddy J.A. |title=The Maunder Minimum |journal=Science |volume=192 |issue=4245 |pages=1189\u20131202 |date=June 1976 |pmid=17771739 |doi=10.1126/science.192.4245.1189 |bibcode=1976Sci...192.1189E }} [http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182h/Climate/Solar/Maunder%20Minimum.pdf PDF Copy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216030712/http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182h/Climate/Solar/Maunder%20Minimum.pdf |date=16 February 2010 }}</ref> Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on solar flux<ref>{{Cite web\n| author=Hudson H |date=2008 \n| title=Solar activity |publisher=Scholarpedia \n| url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Solar_activity |accessdate=2011-01-27\n}}</ref> however the total solar flux increases as \"At solar maximum the Sun is some 0.1% brighter than its solar-minimum level\".

This is because the luminance (which is essentially \"brightness\" in visible light) of a heated [[black body]] (closely approximated by the photosphere) at these temperatures varies extremely with temperature\u2014considerably more so than the (temperature to the fourth power) variation in the total [[black-body radiation]] at all wavelengths (see [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]). Isolated from the surrounding photosphere a sunspot would be brighter than the [[Moon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/sunspot.html|title=Sunspots|publisher=NASA|date=1 April 1998|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nSunspots have two parts: the central [[wikt:umbra|umbra]], which is the darkest part, where the magnetic field is approximately vertical ([[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the Sun's surface) and the surrounding [[wikt:penumbra|penumbra]], which is lighter, where the magnetic field is more inclined.\n\n=== Lifecycle ===\n\nAny given appearance of a sunspot may last anywhere from a few days to a few months, though groups of sunspots and their active regions tend to last weeks or months, but all do eventually decay and disappear. Sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the Sun, with diameters ranging from {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us|abbr=on}} to {{convert|160000|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us|abbr=on}}.\n\nAlthough the details of sunspot generation are still a matter of research, it appears that sunspots are the visible counterparts of [[Flux tube|magnetic flux tube]]s in the Sun's [[Convection zone|convective zone]] that get \"wound up\" by [[differential rotation]]. If the stress on the tubes reaches a certain limit, they curl up and puncture the Sun's surface. Convection is inhibited at the puncture points; the energy flux from the Sun's interior decreases, and with it, surface temperature.\n\nThe [[Wilson effect]] implies that sunspots are depressions on the Sun's surface. Observations using the [[Zeeman effect]] show that prototypical sunspots come in pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. From cycle to cycle, the polarities of leading and trailing (with respect to the solar rotation) sunspots change from north/south to south/north and back. Sunspots usually appear in groups.\n\n[[Magnetic pressure]] should tend to remove field concentrations, causing the sunspots to disperse, but sunspot lifetimes are measured in days to weeks. In 2001, observations from the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) using sound waves traveling below the photosphere (local [[helioseismology]]) were used to develop a three-dimensional image of the internal structure below sunspots; these observations show that a powerful downdraft underneath each sunspot, forms a rotating [[vortex]] that sustains the concentrated magnetic field.<ref>{{cite news|title=SOHO reveals how sunspots take stranglehold on the Sun|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0111/06sunspots/|newspaper=SpaceFlight Now|date=6 November 2001|author=NASA News Release}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar cycle ===\n{{main|Solar cycle}}\n[[Image:Sunspot butterfly graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Butterfly diagram showing paired [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]] behavior|alt=Point chart showing sunspot area as percent of the total area at various latitudes, above grouped bar chart showing average daily sunspot area as % of visible hemisphere.]]\n\nSunspot activity cycles are about every eleven years, with some variation in length. Over the solar cycle, sunspot populations rise quickly and then fall more slowly.  The point of highest sunspot activity during a cycle is known as solar maximum, and the point of lowest activity as solar minimum.  This period is also observed in most other [[Solar phenomena|solar activity]] and is linked to a variation in the solar magnetic field that changes polarity with this period.\n\nEarly in the cycle, sunspots appear in the higher latitudes and then move towards the equator as the cycle approaches maximum, following [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]]. Spots from two adjacent cycles can co-exist for some time.

These telescopes use filtration and projection techniques for direct observation, in addition to various types of filtered cameras. Specialized tools such as [[spectroscope]]s and [[spectrohelioscope]]s are used to examine sunspots and sunspot areas. Artificial eclipses allow viewing of the circumference of the Sun as sunspots rotate through the horizon.\n\n[[File:ALMA observes a giant sunspot (1.25 millimetres).jpg|left|thumb|[[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] observes a giant sunspot at 1.25 mm wavelength<ref>{{cite web|title=ALMA Starts Observing the Sun|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1703/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nSince looking directly at the Sun with the [[naked eye]] permanently damages [[human vision]], amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective [[astronomical filter|filters]]. Small sections of very dark [[optical filter|filter glass]], such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope [[eyepiece]] can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose [[H-alpha#Filter|hydrogen-alpha]] narrow bandpass filters and [[vacuum deposition|aluminum-coated]] glass [[attenuation]] filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high [[optical density]]) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.\n\n== Application ==\n\nDue to its link to other kinds of [[solar variation|solar activity]], sunspot occurrence can be used to help predict [[space weather]], the state of the [[ionosphere]], and hence the conditions of [[short-wave]] [[radio propagation]] or [[satellite communication]]s. High sunspot activity is celebrated by memebers of the amateur radio community as a harbinger of excellent ionospheric propogation conditions that greatly increase radio range in the [[High Frequency|HF]] bands. During sunspot peaks, worldwide radio communication can be possible on frequencies as high as the [[6-meter band|6-meter VHF band]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hamradioschool.com/sunspots-and-propagation/|title=Sunspots and Propagation|author=Stu Turner|publisher=Ham Radio School.com|access-date=5 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626024320/http://www.hamradioschool.com/sunspots-and-propagation/|archive-date=26 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Solar activity and climate|Solar activity]] (and the solar cycle) have been implicated in [[global warming]], originally the role of the [[Maunder Minimum]] of sunspot occurrence in the [[Little Ice Age]] in European winter climate.<ref name=\"MM_PAPER\">{{cite journal |author=Eddy J.A. |title=The Maunder Minimum |journal=Science |volume=192 |issue=4245 |pages=1189\u20131202 |date=June 1976 |pmid=17771739 |doi=10.1126/science.192.4245.1189 |bibcode=1976Sci...192.1189E }} [http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182h/Climate/Solar/Maunder%20Minimum.pdf PDF Copy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216030712/http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182h/Climate/Solar/Maunder%20Minimum.pdf |date=16 February 2010 }}</ref> Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on solar flux<ref>{{Cite web\n| author=Hudson H |date=2008 \n| title=Solar activity |publisher=Scholarpedia \n| url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Solar_activity |accessdate=2011-01-27\n}}</ref> however the total solar flux increases as \"At solar maximum the Sun is some 0.1% brighter than its solar-minimum level\".

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he previously served as [[speaker of the Florida House of Representatives]]. Rubio unsuccessfully sought the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican nomination for president of the United States in 2016]], winning presidential primaries in the State of Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nRubio is a [[Cuban American]] from [[Miami]], Florida. After serving as a [[City commission government|city commissioner]] for [[West Miami]] in the 1990s, he was elected to represent the 111th district in the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 2000. Subsequently, he was elected [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the Florida House, and was Speaker for two years beginning in November 2006.

He suspended his campaign for president on March 15, 2016, after losing the Florida [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican primary]] to the eventual winner of the presidential election, [[Donald Trump]].

the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States Senate|United States senator]] from [[Florida]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he previously served as [[speaker of the Florida House of Representatives]]. Rubio unsuccessfully sought the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican nomination for president of the United States in 2016]], winning presidential primaries in the State of Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nRubio is a [[Cuban American]] from [[Miami]], Florida. After serving as a [[City commission government|city commissioner]] for [[West Miami]] in the 1990s, he was elected to represent the 111th district in the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 2000. Subsequently, he was elected [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the Florida House, and was Speaker for two years beginning in November 2006. Upon leaving the Florida legislature in 2008 due to term limits, Rubio taught at [[Florida International University]].\n\nRubio successfully [[2010 United States Senate election in Florida|ran for the United States Senate]] in 2010. In April 2015, he announced that he would not seek re-election to the Senate, instead choosing to [[Marco Rubio 2016 presidential campaign|run for president]]. He suspended his campaign for president on March 15, 2016, after losing the Florida [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican primary]] to the eventual winner of the presidential election, [[Donald Trump]]. He then decided to [[2016 United States Senate election in Florida|run for re-election to the Senate]], winning a second term later that year.

Although many countries that do not celebrate Christmas have become participants at the competition, the timing has remained the same. In most recent years, the nine preliminary rounds of the tournament have been held over three days from 29\u201331 December, with the elimination rounds being held on 2 January and the Grand Final on 3 January.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://wudc.yaledebate.org/wudctemp/?page_id=114|title=About the World Universities Debating Championship|last=|first=|date=|website=World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926120735/http://wudc.yaledebate.org/wudctemp/?page_id=114|archive-date=Sep 26, 2018|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the championship has varied from about 150 to 400 teams, depending on the capacity of the host institution. With judges and organisers, this involves 500 to 1,000 participants in all.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe competition involves nine preliminary rounds, which become \"power-paired\" as the tournament progresses, matching the strongest-performing teams against each other. Two teams form the \"government\" (\"proposition\" in the UK and North America) and two the \"opposition\" in each debate room. The process of scoring and pairing these teams is known as \"tabbing\". The scoring of teams is done by judges, most of whom are students or former students from the competing institutions, who return \"ballots\" with their scores to the adjudication team, led by a Chief Adjudicator who is assisted by one or more deputies. The deputies are not members of the host institution.\n\nThe nine preliminary rounds are followed by a \"break\" at which the teams proceeding to elimination rounds are announced. This is traditionally done on [[New Year's Eve]], although this is subject to the timing of the tournament. In the current tournament format, the top 16 teams from the preliminary rounds proceed to the octofinal round. The teams ranked 17-48 also break into a partial double octofinal round, and the winning teams from this round join the teams ranked 1-16 in the octo-finals. While preliminary rounds are usually judged by three to five judges, the break rounds are judged by panels of five, semifinal judged by panels of seven and the finals by panels of nine.\n\nSeparate breaks are announced for the English-as-a-second language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) team competitions, for the individual [[public speaking]] competition, and the \"World Masters\" tournament which is participated in by judges (most of whom are no longer students) representing the countries where they studied or of which they are citizens. In addition, a comedy competition is also open to all participants in Worlds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about The World Universities Debating Championship 2020|last=|first=|date=2019|website=The 40th World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822052538/http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|archive-date=Aug 22, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe World Universities Debating Council consists of representatives of every country that competes at the World Universities Debating Championship. Each country selects one council delegate (the national debating association president, or selected from the participants at Worlds). The Council is responsible for setting the rules and awarding the right to host the championships.\n\nA Worlds Committee is elected to discuss issues during the year as Council only meets at the championships itself.  This Committee consists of a mix of elected officers and regional representatives from [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Continental [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[British Isles]] (referred to in debating as [[Islands of the North Atlantic]] thought more [[Political Correctness|politically acceptable]] than [[British Isles]]).\n\nThe Council formerly operated not unlike the [[United Nations Security Council]], with seven nations holding \"[[charter|charter member]] status\" \u2013 the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.  A two-thirds majority of these countries was required for changes to the championship's [[constitution]], irrespective of how the general vote was tallied. However, as the number of non-charter nations attending grew, many fielding far more teams than some of the upper tier, and the championship began being hosted outside the Charter nations, pressure grew for the distinction to be eliminated.\n\nThe modern championship grants voting strength of between one and four votes per country, based on numbers of institutions attending recent championships. To allow for fluctuations in participation due to the financial difference in attending championships nearer or further in succeeding years, nations lose or gain their voting strength gradually.\n\n== Notable controversies ==\n\n=== Thailand WUDC 2020 ===\nThere was concern over the public debate of Hong Kong in the Open Grand Final motion. This lead to walk-outs during the debate. After the live-stream, all recordings of the debate were deleted and the motion was erased from the tabulation software. Many participants had names removed from the public record retroactively once the competition was over. The organising committee claims this was done to respect participants' privacy and denies pressure from any national body or representative.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cape Town WUDC 2019 ===\nAccusations of racism were made against members of the organising committee over treatment of participants. On the last day of the competition and just before the Open Grand Final was to begin, an organised protest took place and disrupted the event. Rather than delay the Open Grand Final, speakers and judges were relocated to an undisclosed room and the debate took place in private. This action was the subject of further controversy due to perceived undermining of an anti-racist cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|title='Racism' mars world university debate championships at UCT|last=|first=|date=Jan 9, 2019|website=Independent Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605055307/https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|archive-date=Jun 5, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Chennai Worlds 2014|Chennai WUDC 2014]] ===\nThis tournament is notable for several controversies.

The tournament is colloquially referred to as \"Worlds\" and the winners of the open competition acknowledged as the \"world champions\".

The university with the most world championships is the University of Sydney with 8 victories. The 2020 edition which was the 40th edition was hosted in [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University]].\n\n==History==\n===Predecessor Tournaments===\nThe Trans-Atlantic University Speech Association held tournaments in London (1976 and 1978) and at [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]], in 1977. [[University of Chicago|Chicago]] was to hold a tournament in 1979 but this was postponed and then abandoned. A \"World Debating Festival\", sponsored by [[Honeywell]] was held in Sydney in 1978. The TAUSA event attracted mostly [[Northern Hemisphere]] tournaments, the Honeywell was largely [[Southern Hemisphere]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wudc.info/the-championships/history/narrative-history|title=Narrative History|last=|first=|date=|website=World Universities Debating Championships|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103181553/http://www.wudc.info/the-championships/history/narrative-history|archive-date=Nov 3, 2016|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nThe championship is usually held in the days following the 25th of December, since many of the institutions attending from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where the championship originated take vacations at this time. Although many countries that do not celebrate Christmas have become participants at the competition, the timing has remained the same. In most recent years, the nine preliminary rounds of the tournament have been held over three days from 29\u201331 December, with the elimination rounds being held on 2 January and the Grand Final on 3 January.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://wudc.yaledebate.org/wudctemp/?page_id=114|title=About the World Universities Debating Championship|last=|first=|date=|website=World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926120735/http://wudc.yaledebate.org/wudctemp/?page_id=114|archive-date=Sep 26, 2018|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the championship has varied from about 150 to 400 teams, depending on the capacity of the host institution. With judges and organisers, this involves 500 to 1,000 participants in all.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe competition involves nine preliminary rounds, which become \"power-paired\" as the tournament progresses, matching the strongest-performing teams against each other. Two teams form the \"government\" (\"proposition\" in the UK and North America) and two the \"opposition\" in each debate room. The process of scoring and pairing these teams is known as \"tabbing\". The scoring of teams is done by judges, most of whom are students or former students from the competing institutions, who return \"ballots\" with their scores to the adjudication team, led by a Chief Adjudicator who is assisted by one or more deputies. The deputies are not members of the host institution.\n\nThe nine preliminary rounds are followed by a \"break\" at which the teams proceeding to elimination rounds are announced. This is traditionally done on [[New Year's Eve]], although this is subject to the timing of the tournament. In the current tournament format, the top 16 teams from the preliminary rounds proceed to the octofinal round. The teams ranked 17-48 also break into a partial double octofinal round, and the winning teams from this round join the teams ranked 1-16 in the octo-finals. While preliminary rounds are usually judged by three to five judges, the break rounds are judged by panels of five, semifinal judged by panels of seven and the finals by panels of nine.\n\nSeparate breaks are announced for the English-as-a-second language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) team competitions, for the individual [[public speaking]] competition, and the \"World Masters\" tournament which is participated in by judges (most of whom are no longer students) representing the countries where they studied or of which they are citizens. In addition, a comedy competition is also open to all participants in Worlds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about The World Universities Debating Championship 2020|last=|first=|date=2019|website=The 40th World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822052538/http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|archive-date=Aug 22, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe World Universities Debating Council consists of representatives of every country that competes at the World Universities Debating Championship. Each country selects one council delegate (the national debating association president, or selected from the participants at Worlds). The Council is responsible for setting the rules and awarding the right to host the championships.\n\nA Worlds Committee is elected to discuss issues during the year as Council only meets at the championships itself.  This Committee consists of a mix of elected officers and regional representatives from [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Continental [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[British Isles]] (referred to in debating as [[Islands of the North Atlantic]] thought more [[Political Correctness|politically acceptable]] than [[British Isles]]).\n\nThe Council formerly operated not unlike the [[United Nations Security Council]], with seven nations holding \"[[charter|charter member]] status\" \u2013 the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.  A two-thirds majority of these countries was required for changes to the championship's [[constitution]], irrespective of how the general vote was tallied. However, as the number of non-charter nations attending grew, many fielding far more teams than some of the upper tier, and the championship began being hosted outside the Charter nations, pressure grew for the distinction to be eliminated.\n\nThe modern championship grants voting strength of between one and four votes per country, based on numbers of institutions attending recent championships. To allow for fluctuations in participation due to the financial difference in attending championships nearer or further in succeeding years, nations lose or gain their voting strength gradually.\n\n== Notable controversies ==\n\n=== Thailand WUDC 2020 ===\nThere was concern over the public debate of Hong Kong in the Open Grand Final motion. This lead to walk-outs during the debate. After the live-stream, all recordings of the debate were deleted and the motion was erased from the tabulation software. Many participants had names removed from the public record retroactively once the competition was over. The organising committee claims this was done to respect participants' privacy and denies pressure from any national body or representative.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cape Town WUDC 2019 ===\nAccusations of racism were made against members of the organising committee over treatment of participants. On the last day of the competition and just before the Open Grand Final was to begin, an organised protest took place and disrupted the event. Rather than delay the Open Grand Final, speakers and judges were relocated to an undisclosed room and the debate took place in private. This action was the subject of further controversy due to perceived undermining of an anti-racist cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|title='Racism' mars world university debate championships at UCT|last=|first=|date=Jan 9, 2019|website=Independent Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605055307/https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|archive-date=Jun 5, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Chennai Worlds 2014|Chennai WUDC 2014]] ===\nThis tournament is notable for several controversies.
