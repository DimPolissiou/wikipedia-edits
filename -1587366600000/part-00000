She lost to [[John Nunziata]], who was running as an independent, by 4,431 votes. In 1999 she won a by-election in York West to replace [[Sergio Marchi (politician)|Sergio Marchi]] who had accepted an ambassadorial position to the [[World Trade Organization]]. She has since been re-elected by substantial pluralities.\n\nIn 2001, she was named chairperson of the Prime Minister's \"Caucus Task Force on Urban Issues\". In 2003 her group released an interim report recommending increased Federal support to recognize their economic and social value.<ref name=judy1/> From December 12, 2003 to January 13, 2005 Sgro served as [[Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Canada)|Minister of Citizenship and Immigration]] in the government of [[Paul Martin]].\n\n====Political favouritism issues====\nIn November 2004, controversy began to surround Sgro as questions arose surrounding her activities during the June election earlier that year. Several members of her ministerial staff had filed expense claims to travel to and work in her [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] throughout the campaign ending on election day. More serious claims were also raised when [[parliamentary opposition|Opposition]] [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] MPs claimed she had given a special immigration permit to a campaign supporter \u2013 specifically Alina Balaican, a Romanian who had initially been admitted to the country to work as a [[stripper]]. [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] MP [[Pat Martin]] also accused Sgro's aides of making threats to deny ministerial permits to his constituents if he criticized her on the stripper controversy.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sgro aide tried to silence critics by withholding permits, MPs allege |first=Robert |last=Fife |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=December 27, 2004 |page=A9}}</ref> The press dubbed the issue \"Strippergate\".\n\nOn January 14, 2005, Sgro resigned from cabinet after further allegations that she had offered to intervene in the immigration hearing of Harjit Singh, a [[Brampton]] pizzeria owner, in exchange for free pizza for her campaign staff.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sgro quits cabinet to fight allegations |url=http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1105686456318_27?hub=topstories |publisher=CTV News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322102200/http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1105686456318_27?hub=topstories |archivedate=March 22, 2007 }}</ref> The following day, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' revealed that Singh had previously committed [[credit card fraud]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sgro's accuser trying to avoid deportation |url=http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1105799384658_3?hub=topstories |publisher=CTV News |date=January 15, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721224037/http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1105799384658_3?hub=topstories |archivedate=July 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 31, 2005, Sgro filed a [[lawsuit]] against Singh for [[Canadian dollar|$]]750,000 in damages.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sgro sues Singh for slander, libel; 3 others named in $750,000 lawsuit: Accusations led to minister resigning |work=Toronto Star |first=Gordon |last=Sean |date=February 1, 2005 |page=A6}}</ref> On May 10, 2005, the Federal ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro cleared Sgro of all wrongdoing from the ''Strippergate'' debacle when it was found that Sgro didn't know that two staffers had put her in a position of conflict of interest.

Shapiro said to Sgro, \"It appears you acted appropriately.\" Also the same day, Singh retracted his allegations and apologized to Sgro. He said, \"I now admit I did not have a meeting with Judy Sgro and at no time did she request any campaign assistance from me.

There was some speculation in the media that fellow minister [[Joe Volpe]] helped to engineer her resignation given that they had a cool relationship.<ref name=judy2/>\n\n====Expenses issue====\nIn June 2010 it was revealed that Sgro had been claiming expenses for rent on an Ottawa luxury highrise condominium owned by her adult children, violating rules for such expenses set by the [[Board of Internal Economy]] of the House of Commons. Sgro had paid $138,000 to purchase the condo in 2001, and then transferred the title on the property to her children in 2006; she then paid her children $22,000 a year in rent to live in the apartment, violating rules forbidding MPs from claiming expenses on goods or services contracted from family members.<ref name=McGregor2010>{{cite news|author1=Glen McGregor|author2=Stephen Maher|title=Toronto MP uses taxpayers' money to rent condo owned by her children|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/archives/story.html?id=db6f3f1e-e844-49aa-9d92-a2f46632c63c|accessdate=June 22, 2014|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=June 7, 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAsked about this controversy in 2013 by a reporter from [[Qu\u00e9becor M\u00e9dia]], Sgro replied, \"The issue was dealt with, an issue was pointed out...

{"title_page": "Melchior de Polignac", "text_new": "[[File:Rosalba Carriera - Cardinal Melchior de Polignac - WGA4488.jpg|thumb|right|Melchior de Polignac]]\n'''Melchior Cardinal de Polignac''' (October 11, 1661 \u2013 November 20, 1742) was a [[France|French]] diplomat, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] and [[New Latin|neo-Latin]] poet.\n\nSecond son of [[Armand XVI, marquis de Polignac]] and Marquis Chalancon, Governor of Puy; and Jacqueline de Beauvoir -Grimoard-de Roure (his third wife), Melchior de Polignac was born at Chateau de la Ronte, near Puy en V\u00e9lay, [[Lavo\u00fbte-sur-Loire]], [[Haute-Loire]], [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]].\n\n==Education and early career==\n\nA precocious child, he was taken by his uncle to Paris,<ref>Faucher, I, p. 6.</ref> and installed in the [[Jesuit]] Coll\u00e8ge de Clermont (later named the Coll\u00e8ge de Louis le Grand). At the appropriate time, he passed to the Coll\u00e8ge de Harcourt, where thanks to the misdirected efforts of a teacher who was an enthusiast for Aristotle, Polignac adopted the opposite view and became a [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]]. His thesis in Theology at the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] (1683) discussed the Kings of Judah who had destroyed the \"high places\". He was either prescient, or aware of discussion around Louis XIV which led in two years to the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1685) and the removal of the [[Huguenot]] \"high places\". He had somehow attracted the patronage of the [[Cardinal de Bouillon|Cardinal Emmanuel de la Tour d'Auvergne de Bouillon]], who took Polignac with him when he went to Rome for the Conclave following the death of Pope [[Innocent XI]] on August 12, 1689. Bouillon chose Polignac as one of his Conclavists.<ref>''Bullarium Romanum'' (Turin 1870) vol. 20, p. 4; Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni,  ''Vite degli Arcadi illustri''  V (Roma 1750), 206</ref> When the new Pope, [[Alexander VIII]] (Ottoboni) was elected, he assisted Cardinal de Bouillon and the French Ambassador, the Duc de Chaulnes, in attempting to improve relations between Louis XIV and the Holy See. Polignac was sent back to France to report to Louis, who immediately sent him back to Rome with further instructions. He was still in Rome when Alexander VIII died after less than sixteen months on the throne, and was again Conclavist of Cardinal de Bouillon in the Conclave of 1691 that elected [[Innocent XII]] (Pignatelli).<ref>''Bullarium Romanum'' Vol. 20 (Turin edition 1870), p. 170.</ref>\n\nAt an early age he achieved recognition as a diplomat. In 1693 he was sent as ambassador to [[Poland]], where he worked with Cardinal [[Michal Stefan Radziejowski|Augustyn Michal Stefan Radziejowski]], the [[Primate of Poland]] and nephew of King John III Sobieski, to bring about the election of [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis de Bourbon, prince de Conti]] as successor to [[John Sobieski]] (1697).

In whatever belonged to his own, that is, learning and the ecclesiastical calling, he was rather less versed. \u2026 In other respects he was wholly occupied with his own ambition, without friendship, without gratitude, without any feeling except for himself; false, lax, indifferent to the means of success; without restraint from God or man, but always with a cloak of delicacy which gave him dupes; above all, a libertine, more from facility, coquetry, ambition, than from natural debauchery; so that while the heart was false and the soul not upright, his judgment was nil, his actions erroneous, his mind inaccurate, which, in spite of the most gracious and deceptive exterior, caused the failure in his hands of every enterprise intrusted to him.\n\n\"With a face and talents so fitted to impress others, he was aided by his birth, to which, however, his property did not respond; but that fact dispelled all envy and conciliated favour and good will.

At the appropriate time, he passed to the Coll\u00e8ge de Harcourt, where thanks to the misdirected efforts of a teacher who was an enthusiast for Aristotle, Polignac adopted the opposite view and became a [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]]. His thesis in Theology at the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] (1683) discussed the Kings of Judah who had destroyed the \"high places\". He was either prescient, or aware of discussion around Louis XIV which led in two years to the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1685) and the removal of the [[Huguenot]] \"high places\". He had somehow attracted the patronage of the [[Cardinal de Bouillon|Cardinal Emmanuel de la Tour d'Auvergne de Bouillon]], who took Polignac with him when he went to Rome for the Conclave following the death of Pope [[Innocent XI]] on August 12, 1689. Bouillon chose Polignac as one of his Conclavists.<ref>''Bullarium Romanum'' (Turin 1870) vol. 20, p. 4; Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni,  ''Vite degli Arcadi illustri''  V (Roma 1750), 206</ref> When the new Pope, [[Alexander VIII]] (Ottoboni) was elected, he assisted Cardinal de Bouillon and the French Ambassador, the Duc de Chaulnes, in attempting to improve relations between Louis XIV and the Holy See. Polignac was sent back to France to report to Louis, who immediately sent him back to Rome with further instructions. He was still in Rome when Alexander VIII died after less than sixteen months on the throne, and was again Conclavist of Cardinal de Bouillon in the Conclave of 1691 that elected [[Innocent XII]] (Pignatelli).<ref>''Bullarium Romanum'' Vol. 20 (Turin edition 1870), p. 170.</ref>\n\nAt an early age he achieved recognition as a diplomat. In 1693 he was sent as ambassador to [[Poland]], where he worked with Cardinal [[Michal Stefan Radziejowski|Augustyn Michal Stefan Radziejowski]], the [[Primate of Poland]] and nephew of King John III Sobieski, to bring about the election of [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis de Bourbon, prince de Conti]] as successor to [[John Sobieski]] (1697).

Adams)]</ref> He did not, at the age of 78, travel to Rome for the Conclave of 1740.\n\n==His position in French society==\n\nDuring the last years of Louis XIV, Abb\u00e9 de Polignac enjoyed the position of Master of the King's Chapel (1713-1716).<ref>\"Eloge\", '' Histoire de l' Acad\u00e9mie des sciences'' (1744), p. 189.</ref> But during the Regency Polignac became involved in the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]], which attempted to dislodge Philippe d'Orleans from the Regency, and replace him with [[Philip V of Spain]], uncle of the young King Louis XV. Polignac was relegated to [[Flanders]] and confined to his Abbey d'Anchin for three years.<ref>E. A. Escallier,  ''L' Abbaye d' Anchin, 1079-1792'' (Lille 1852), pp. 488-489.</ref> As soon as Louis XV attained his majority, however, he had Polignac rehabilitated and restored to his positions. In 1726, he received the [[Archdiocese of Auch|Archbishopric of Auch]].<ref>L.-C. de Brugules, ''Chroniques ecclesiastiques du diocese d' Auch'' (Toulouse 1746), pp. 174-175.</ref>  He was consecrated in Rome by Pope Benedict XIII. In 1728 he was granted the Collar of the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]].\n\n==Death==\n\nHe died at his home in what is now 80-88 [[rue Bonaparte]] in the 6th Arondissement in [[Paris]] (also known as the ''H\u00f4tel Polignac''), on November 20, 1742, at the age of 80, of \"hydropsie\". He was buried in the Church of S. Sulpice in Paris.<ref>Guarnacci, p. 253.</ref>  At the time of his death, he was also Abbot of Begars, Mouron, and Corbie; and Prior of Montdidier, Voute-sur-Loire, and Nagent le Rotron.<ref>L.-C. de Brugules, ''Chroniques ecclesiastiques du diocese d' Auch'' (Toulouse 1746), p. 174.</ref>  After his death [[Frederick the Great]] bought his acclaimed collection of marble statues, which he had collected through his archaeological work in Rome.<ref>A.
