Everything has to be in place and now it is. I know it's late notice, we were trying to keep the date but got wrapped up making this album perfect for y\u2019all. However, for making you guys wait a little longer we will release \u2018Brake\u2018 & \u2018Teleport 2 Me\u2018 on iTunes on the previously said date.

Music]] label and Universal Republic.<ref>http://hiphopwired.com/2013/04/04/kid-cudi-focusing-on-wicked-awesome-label-after-leaving-g-o-o-d-music-listen/</ref><ref>http://theversed.com/2013/04/04/kid-cudi-planning-to-focus-on-his-wicked-awesome-record-label-following-g-o-o-d-music-departure/</ref><ref>http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/502560/kid-cudi-on-wzrd-chart-success-im-not-out-here-taking-crazy-pills</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n\n=== Recording and production ===\nAt a private listening session in [[Los Angeles]], Dot da Genius acknowledged that he originally wanted to record the album in the best possible studio they could be in, but Cudi interjected saying he believed the album needed a raw and gritty feel which led to recording on the [[tour bus]] and at his home. \"I could have spent tons of money hiring the best people to do everything, but that's not what I\u2019m about\". The album features no [[profanity]], however Kid Cudi didn't originally intend to record the album in that manner: \"I didn\u2019t write this album with the goal of not cursing. It just happened. When you have important things to say you don\u2019t need to swear,\" Cudi informed the crowd. Although the album will not receive an explicit warning, [[Best Buy]] posed a challenge as they did try to claim it contained cursing because of the word \u201c[[Pussy|pussies]]\u201d in the song \"Upper Room\". \"Pussies is a word used when talking about multiple cats,\u201d Cudi told the crowd, \u201cMy daughter watches [[Puss in Boots]], it\u2019s not a swear word\". Cudi said he had [[writer's block]] for almost 5 months because of his new [[sobriety]], something that had never happened to him for such an extended period of time.<ref name=\"listeningsession\"/> Sean F. Martin, formerly of [[Hatebreed]], was the guitarist on \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\".<ref>https://twitter.com/wizardcud/status/174962357775245313</ref>\n\n=== Music and lyrics ===\nThe album begins with \"The Arrival\", an [[instrumental]] track, where Cudi and Dot da Genius showcase their skills. \"Dream Time Machine\" features supporting vocals from Australian indie-rock band [[Empire of the Sun (band)|Empire of the Sun]], as Cudi previously announced they were to be featured on the album. \"Teleport 2 Me, Jamie\", an ode to Cudi's then-girlfriend, features a sample from American [[synthpop]] act [[Desire (band)|Desire]]'s \"Under Your Spell\" (previously included on the soundtrack to the 2011 film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]''), serves as the album's [[lead single]] and was released via digital distribution on January 31, 2012. The album's eighth track \"[[Where Did You Sleep Last Night?]]\", is a [[Cover version|cover]] of the same titled song by American rock band and [[grunge]] pioneers [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], who in turn were inspired by blues guitar legend [[Lead Belly]]'s rendition of the [[Traditional music|traditional]] [[folk music|folk]] song. Completing the album is \"Upper Room\", said to be the most uplifting track on the album.<ref name=\"listeningsession\"/> The last song added to the track list however, was \"Dr. Pill\", where Cudi touched on [[antidepressants]]: \"I took a trip on antidepressant lane for a little bit. After the WZRD song \u201cDr. Pill\u201d everyone thought I was talking about [[MDMA|molly]] or [[MDMA#Purity and dosage of \"ecstasy\"|ecstasy]]. But I'm talking about [[Prescription drug|prescription meds]]. I had just gotten a [[Mental health professional|shrink]]. I was having an [[emotional breakdown]] with this breakup. I kept trying different pills for five months. It fucked me up. They weren't working. It was every side effect on the bottle.

The album features no [[profanity]], however Kid Cudi didn't originally intend to record the album in that manner: \"I didn\u2019t write this album with the goal of not cursing. It just happened. When you have important things to say you don\u2019t need to swear,\" Cudi informed the crowd. Although the album will not receive an explicit warning, [[Best Buy]] posed a challenge as they did try to claim it contained cursing because of the word \u201c[[Pussy|pussies]]\u201d in the song \"Upper Room\". \"Pussies is a word used when talking about multiple cats,\u201d Cudi told the crowd, \u201cMy daughter watches [[Puss in Boots]], it\u2019s not a swear word\". Cudi said he had [[writer's block]] for almost 5 months because of his new [[sobriety]], something that had never happened to him for such an extended period of time.<ref name=\"listeningsession\"/> Sean F. Martin, formerly of [[Hatebreed]], was the guitarist on \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\".<ref>https://twitter.com/wizardcud/status/174962357775245313</ref>\n\n=== Music and lyrics ===\nThe album begins with \"The Arrival\", an [[instrumental]] track, where Cudi and Dot da Genius showcase their skills. \"Dream Time Machine\" features supporting vocals from Australian indie-rock band [[Empire of the Sun (band)|Empire of the Sun]], as Cudi previously announced they were to be featured on the album. \"Teleport 2 Me, Jamie\", an ode to Cudi's then-girlfriend, features a sample from American [[synthpop]] act [[Desire (band)|Desire]]'s \"Under Your Spell\" (previously included on the soundtrack to the 2011 film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]''), serves as the album's [[lead single]] and was released via digital distribution on January 31, 2012. The album's eighth track \"[[Where Did You Sleep Last Night?]]\", is a [[Cover version|cover]] of the same titled song by American rock band and [[grunge]] pioneers [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], who in turn were inspired by blues guitar legend [[Lead Belly]]'s rendition of the [[Traditional music|traditional]] [[folk music|folk]] song. Completing the album is \"Upper Room\", said to be the most uplifting track on the album.<ref name=\"listeningsession\"/> The last song added to the track list however, was \"Dr. Pill\", where Cudi touched on [[antidepressants]]: \"I took a trip on antidepressant lane for a little bit. After the WZRD song \u201cDr. Pill\u201d everyone thought I was talking about [[MDMA|molly]] or [[MDMA#Purity and dosage of \"ecstasy\"|ecstasy]]. But I\u2019m talking about [[Prescription drug|prescription meds]]. I had just gotten a [[Mental health professional|shrink]]. I was having an [[emotional breakdown]] with this breakup.

In humans, usually only [[puberty|pubescent]] or [[man|adult males]] are able to grow beards. Some women with [[hirsutism]], a hormonal condition of excessive hairiness, may develop a beard.\n\nThroughout the course of history, societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on factors such as prevailing cultural-religious traditions and the current era's [[fashion]] trends. Some religions (such as [[Islam]], Traditional Christianity, Orthodox Judaism and [[Sikhism]]) have considered a full beard to be absolutely essential for all males able to grow one and mandate it as part of their official [[dogma]]. Other cultures, even while not officially mandating it, view a beard as central to a man's [[virility]], exemplifying such virtues as [[wisdom]], [[Physical strength|strength]], sexual prowess and high [[social status]]. In cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards may be associated with poor hygiene or an uncivilized, dangerous demeanor. In countries with colder climates, beards help protect the wearer's face from the elements.\n\n==Biology==\nThe beard develops during [[puberty]]. Beard growth is linked to stimulation of hair follicles in the area by [[dihydrotestosterone]], which continues to affect beard growth after puberty. Dihydrotestosterone also promotes balding. Dihydrotestosterone is produced from [[testosterone]], the levels of which vary with season. Beard growth rate is also genetic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Randall VA |title=Androgens and hair growth |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=314\u201328 |year=2008 |pmid=18844710 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00214.x}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n[[File:Baerte ohne text.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Different types of beards : 1) Incipient 2) Moustache 3) Goatee or Mandarin 4) Spanish-style 5) Long sideburns 6) Sideburn joined by his moustache 7) Style Van Dyke 8) Full beard.]]\nBiologists characterize beards as a [[secondary sexual characteristic]] because they are unique to one sex, yet do not play a direct role in reproduction.

Where the beard has mostly a strong resemblance to that affected by the Assyrians, and familiar to us from their sculptures. It is arranged in three, four, or five rows of small tight curls, and extends from ear to ear around the cheeks and chin. Sometimes, however, in lieu of the many rows, we find one row only, the beard falling in tresses, which are curled at the extremity. There is no indication of the Phoenicians having cultivated mustachios.<ref>{{citation-attribution|{{cite book|last1=Rawlinson |first1=George |title=History of Phoenicia |url=https://archive.org/details/historyphoenici01rawlgoog |year=1889 |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co }}}}</ref>\n\n====Mesopotamia====\n[[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations (Sumerian, Assyrians, Babylonians, Chaldeans and Medians) devoted great care to oiling and dressing their beards, using tongs and curling irons to create elaborate ringlets and tiered patterns.\n\n====Egypt====\nThe highest ranking [[Ancient Egypt]]ians grew hair on their chins which was often dyed or [[henna]]ed (reddish brown) and sometimes plaited with interwoven gold thread. A metal false beard, or [[postiche]], which was a sign of sovereignty, was worn by queens and kings. This was held in place by a ribbon tied over the head and attached to a gold chin strap, a fashion existing from about 3000 to 1580 BC.\n\n====Indian subcontinent====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nIndian warriors (Sattagydian, Gandharan, Hindush) circa 480 BCE in the Naqsh-e Roastam reliefs of Xerxes I.jpg|[[Ancient India]]n warriors with various types of beards, circa 480 BCE. \nShivaji Rijksmuseum.jpg|[[Chhatrapati]] [[Shivaji]] of the [[Maratha Empire]] with a trimmed beard. \nMaharaj Ranjit Singh.jpg|[[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] of the [[Sikh Empire]] with a long beard.\nKunvar singh.jpg|Indian warrior [[Kunwar Singh]] of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] with a standard beard.\n</gallery>\nIn ancient India, the beard was allowed to grow long, a symbol of dignity and of wisdom (cf. [[sadhu]]). The nations in the east generally treated their beards with great care and veneration, and the punishment for licentiousness and adultery was to have the beard of the offending parties publicly cut off. They had such a sacred regard for the preservation of their beards that a man might pledge it for the payment of a debt.\n\n[[File:Ming emperor with beard.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Tang-xuanzong.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuan Zong]] of Tang. He has the specific east asian facial hair growth pattern in which hair only grows above and below the lips and on the chin. The cheeks and jaw are unshaved as no hair grows there.]]\n\n====China====\n[[Confucius]] held that the human body was a gift from one's parents to which no alterations should be made. Aside from abstaining from body modifications such as tattoos, Confucians were also discouraged from cutting their hair, fingernails or beards. To what extent people could actually comply with this ideal depended on their profession; farmers or soldiers could probably not grow long beards as it would have interfered with their work.\n\nOnly a certain percentage of [[East Asia|east asian]] men are capable of growing a full beard. Another proportion of east asian men are capable of growing facial hair but only in a very specific growth pattern in which hair only grows above the lip, below the lip and on the chin, with no hair growth on the cheeks or jaw. Another proportion of east asian men are capable of growing facial hair in some combination of the two.\n\nThis growth pattern can be seen on the clay soldiers in the [[Terracotta Army]].\n\n====Iran====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Detail - Sculpture at the Hall of All Nations (4676223447).jpg|Close-up of one of the [[Lamassu]] beard [[relief]] in [[Gate of All Nations]] in [[Perspolis]] (south of [[Iran]]).\nFile:Mihr Ali 1813.jpg|[[Fath-Ali Shah]], the second [[Qajar]] Shah of Persia had a long beard.\n</gallery>\nThe [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] were fond of long beards, and almost all the [[List of monarchs of Persia|Iranian kings]] had a beard. In Travels by [[Adam Olearius]], a King of Iran commands his steward's head to be cut off, and on its being brought to him, remarks, \"what a pity it was, that a man possessing such fine mustachios, should have been executed.\" Men in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid era]] wore long beards, with warriors adorning theirs with jewelry. Men also commonly wore beards during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar eras]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Greece====\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aristotle]] with a beard.]]\nThe [[ancient Greeks]] regarded the beard as a badge or sign of virility; in the [[Homeric epics]] it had almost sanctified significance, so that a common form of entreaty was to touch the beard of the person addressed.<ref>See, for example, Homer ''Iliad'' 1:500-1</ref> It was only shaven as a sign of mourning, though in this case it was instead often left untrimmed.

From the earliest times, however, the shaving of the upper lip was not uncommon. Greek beards were also frequently curled with tongs.\n\n====Macedon====\nIn the time of [[Alexander the Great]] the custom of smooth shaving was introduced.<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Chrysippus ap. Athen. xiii. 565 a</ref> Alexander strongly promoted shaving during his reign because he believed it looked tidier.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria|title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History (Google eBook)|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=dangerous+beard-grabbing+in+combat&source=bl&ots=YK49BZkanc&sig=Xxk_hP1Z-qE6NEZs6nhOPIcIsmk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9yBIUZfKJY-02AXki4CIBg&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dangerous%20beard-grabbing%20in%20combat&f=false}}</ref> Reportedly, Alexander ordered his soldiers to be clean-shaven, fearing that their beards would serve as handles for their enemies to grab and to hold the soldier as he was killed. The practice of shaving spread from the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose kings are represented on coins, etc. with smooth faces, throughout the whole known world of the Macedonian Empire. Laws were passed against it, without effect, at [[Rhodes]] and [[Byzantium]]; and even [[Aristotle]] conformed to the new custom,<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Diog. Laert.v. 1</ref> unlike the other [[philosopher]]s, who retained the beard as a badge of their profession. A man with a beard after the Macedonian period implied a philosopher,<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites cf. Pers.iv. 1, magister [[barbatus (disambiguation)|barbatus]] of Socrates</ref> and there are many allusions to this custom of the later philosophers in such proverbs as: [[Barba non facit philosophum|\"The beard does not make the sage.\"]]<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites {{lang-grc|\u03c0\u03c9\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6}}. De Is. et Osir. 3</ref>\n\n====Rome====\nShaving seems to have not been known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] during their early history (under the kings of Rome and the early Republic). Pliny tells us that P. Ticinius was the first who brought a [[barber]] to Rome, which was in the 454th year from the founding of the city (that is, around 299 BC). [[Scipio Africanus]] (236\u2013183 BC) was apparently the first among the Romans who shaved his beard. However, after that point, shaving seems to have caught on very quickly, and soon almost all Roman men were clean-shaven; being clean-shaven became a sign of being Roman and not Greek. Only in the later times of the Republic did the Roman youth begin shaving their beards only partially, trimming it into an ornamental form; prepubescent boys oiled their chins in hopes of forcing premature growth of a beard.<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Petron. 75, 10</ref>\n\nStill, beards remained rare among the Romans throughout the Late Republic and the early Principate. In a general way, in Rome at this time, a long beard was considered a mark of slovenliness and squalor. The censors [[L. Veturius]] and [[P. Licinius]] compelled [[M. Livius]], who had been banished, on his restoration to the city, to be shaved, to lay aside his dirty appearance, and then, but not until then, to come into the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Liv.xxvii. 34</ref> The first occasion of shaving was regarded as the beginning of [[manhood]], and the day on which this took place was celebrated as a festival.<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Juv.iii. 186</ref> Usually, this was done when the young Roman assumed the ''[[toga virilis]]''. [[Augustus]] did it in his twenty-fourth year, [[Caligula]] in his twentieth. The hair cut off on such occasions was consecrated to a god. Thus [[Nero]] put his into a golden box set with pearls, and dedicated it to [[Jupiter Capitolinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Suet. Ner.12</ref> The Romans, unlike the Greeks, let their beards grow in time of mourning; so did Augustus for the death of [[Julius Caesar]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Dio Cass. xlviii. 34</ref> Other occasions of mourning on which the beard was allowed to grow were, appearance as a ''reus'', condemnation, or some public calamity. On the other hand, men of the country areas around Rome in the time of [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] seem not to have shaved except when they came to market every eighth day, so that their usual appearance was most likely a short [[Shaving|stubble]].<ref>Varro asked rhetorically how often the tradesmen of the country shaved between market days, implying (in chronologist E. J. Bickerman's opinion) that this did not happen at all: \"quoties priscus homo ac rusticus Romanus inter nundinum barbam radebat?\",[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/dict?name=ls&lang=la&word=nundinus&filter=CUTF8 Varr. ap. Non. 214, 30; 32]: see also E J Bickerman, ''Chronology of the Ancient World'', London (Thames & Hudson) 1968, at p.59.</ref>\n\nIn the second century AD the Emperor [[Hadrian]], according to [[Dio Cassius]], was the first of all the Caesars to grow a full beard; [[Plutarch]] says that he did it to hide scars on his face. This was a period in Rome of widespread imitation of Greek culture, and many other men grew beards in imitation of Hadrian and the Greek fashion. Until the time of [[Constantine the Great]] the emperors appear in busts and coins with beards; but Constantine and his successors until the reign of [[Phocas]], with the exception of [[Julian the Apostate]], are represented as beardless.\n\n====Celts and Germanic tribes====\nLate Hellenistic sculptures of [[Celts]]<ref>Examples (both in Roman copies): ''[[Dying Gaul]]'', ''[[Ludovisi Gaul]]''</ref> portray them with long hair and mustaches but beardless. [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] reported the [[British people|Britons]] wore no beard except upon the upper lip.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] on arrival in [[Great Britain|Britain]] wore beards and continued to do so for a considerable time after.<ref>''The National Cyclopedia of Useful Knowledge'', Vol III, (1847) Charles Knight, London, p.46.</ref>\n\nAmong the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Celts of [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], men typically let their facial hair grow into a full beard, and it was often seen as dishonourable for a Gaelic man to have no facial hair.<ref name=\"Connolly-prologue\">{{cite book |title=Contested island: Ireland 1460-1630 |last=Connolly |first=Sean J |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=7 |chapter=Prologue}}</ref><ref name=\"Gerald\">[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/topography_ireland.pdf ''The Topography of Ireland'' by Giraldus Cambrensis] (English translation)</ref><ref>Macleod, John, ''Highlanders: A History of the Gaels'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1997) p43</ref>\n\n[[Tacitus]] states that among the Catti, a [[Germanic people|Germanic]] tribe (perhaps the [[Chatten]]), a young man was not allowed to shave or cut his hair until he had slain an enemy. The [[Lombards]] derived their name from the great length of their beards (Longobards \u2013 Long Beards). When [[Otto the Great]] said anything serious, he swore by his beard, which covered his breast.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Charles IV-John Ocko votive picture-fragment.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]\nIn the [[Middle Ages|Middle-Age Europe]], a beard displayed a [[knight]]'s virility and [[honour]].\nThe Castilian knight [[El Cid]] is described in ''[[The Lay of the Cid]]'' as \"the one with the flowery beard\".\nHolding somebody else's beard was a serious offence that had to be righted in a [[duel]].\n\nWhile most noblemen and knights were bearded, the Catholic clergy were generally required to be clean-shaven. This was understood as a symbol of their [[celibacy]].\n\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia men would apparently keep mustaches but shave the hair on their chins{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. The prophet Muhammad encouraged his followers to do the opposite, long chin hair but trimmed mustaches, to signify their break with the old religion. This style of beard subsequently spread along with Islam during the Muslim expansion in the Middle Ages.\n\n===From the Renaissance to the present day===\n{{Original research section|date=June 2009}}\n{{Globalize|section|date=April 2014}}\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Friedrich Engels portrait (cropped).jpg|[[Friedrich Engels]] exhibiting a full moustache and beard that was a common style among Europeans of the 19th century.\nFile:Johann Strauss II (3).jpg|[[Johann Strauss II]] with a large beard, moustache, and [[sideburns]].\nFile:Thomas Swann of Maryland - photo portrait seated.jpg|Maryland Governor [[Thomas Swann]] with a long [[goatee]].

Some beards of this time were the Spanish spade beard, the English square cut beard, the forked beard, and the stiletto beard. In 1587 [[Francis Drake]] claimed, in a [[figure of speech]], to have [[singed the King of Spain's beard]].\n\nDuring the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911), the ruling [[Manchu]] minority were either clean-shaven or at most wore mustaches, in contrast to the [[Han Chinese|Han]] majority who still wore beards in keeping with the Confucian ideal.\n\nIn the beginning of the 17th century, the size of beards decreased in urban circles of Western Europe. In the second half of the century, being clean-shaven gradually became more common again, so much so that in 1698, [[Peter the Great]] of Russia ordered men to shave off their beards, and in 1705 levied a [[beard tax|tax on beards]] in order to bring Russian society more in line with contemporary Western Europe.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/beard-tax Beard Tax: Information from]. Answers.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-03.</ref>\n\nDuring the early 19th century most men, particularly amongst the nobility and upper classes, went clean-shaven. There was, however, a dramatic shift in the beard's popularity during the 1850s, with it becoming markedly more popular.<ref name=\"Jacob Middleton 2006\">Jacob Middleton, 'Bearded Patriarchs', History Today, Volume: 56 Issue: 2 (February 2006), 26\u201327.</ref> Consequently, beards were adopted by many leaders, such as [[Alexander III of Russia]], [[Napoleon III]] of France and [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] of Germany, as well as many leading statesmen and cultural figures, such as [[Benjamin Disraeli]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. This trend can be recognised in the United States of America, where the shift can be seen amongst the post-Civil War presidents. Before [[Abraham Lincoln]], no President had a beard;<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA59#v=onepage | title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | author=Sherrow, Victoria | year=2006 | pages=59}}</ref> after Lincoln until [[Woodrow Wilson]], every President except [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William McKinley]] had either a beard or a moustache.\n\nThe beard became linked in this period with notions of masculinity and male courage.<ref name=\"Jacob Middleton 2006\"/> The resulting popularity has contributed to the stereotypical Victorian male figure in the popular mind, the stern figure clothed in black whose gravitas is added to by a heavy beard.\n\nIn China, the revolution of 1911 and subsequent May Fourth Movement of 1919 led the Chinese to idealize the West as more modern and progressive than themselves. This included the realm of fashion, and Chinese men began shaving their faces and cutting their hair short.\n\nBy the early-twentieth century, beards began a slow decline in popularity. Although retained by some prominent figures who were young men in the Victorian period (like [[Sigmund Freud]]), most men who retained facial hair during the 1920s and 1930s limited themselves to a moustache or a [[goatee]] (such as with [[Marcel Proust]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]). In the United States, meanwhile, popular movies portrayed heroes with clean-shaven faces and \"[[crew cut]]s\". Concurrently, the psychological [[mass marketing]] of [[Madison Avenue]] was becoming prevalent. The [[The Gillette Company|Gillette]] [[Safety razor|Safety Razor]] Company was one of these marketers' early clients. These events conspired to popularize short hair and clean-shaven faces as the only acceptable style for decades to come. The few men who wore the beard or portions of the beard during this period were usually either old, Central European, members of a religious sect that required it, or in academia.\n\nThe beard was reintroduced to mainstream society by the counterculture, firstly with the \"[[beatnik]]s\" in the 1950s, and then with the [[hippie]] movement of the mid-1960s. Following the [[Vietnam War]], beards exploded in popularity. In the mid-late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, beards were worn by hippies and businessmen alike. Popular musicians like [[The Beatles]], [[Barry White]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Jim Morrison]] (lead singer of [[The Doors]]) and the male members of [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], among many others, wore full beards. The trend of seemingly ubiquitous beards in American culture subsided in the mid-1980s.\n[[File:Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Charles Evans Hughes as Chief Justice of the United States]]\nBy the end of the 20th century, the closely clipped [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] beard, often with a matching integrated moustache, had become relatively common. From the 1990s onward, fashion in the United States has generally trended toward either a goatee, [[Van Dyke beard|Van Dyke]], or a closely cropped full beard undercut on the throat.

The phrase \"nourishing a beard\" was interpreted in different ways, either as imposing a clean-shaven face or only excluding a too-lengthy beard. In relatively modern times, the first pope to wear a beard was [[Pope Julius II]], who in 1511\u201312 did so for a while as a sign of mourning for the loss of the city of [[Bologna]]. [[Pope Clement VII]] let his beard grow at the time of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)]] and kept it. All his successors did so until the death in 1700 of [[Pope Innocent XII]]. Since then, no pope has worn a beard. Most Latin-rite clergy are now clean-shaven, but [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and some others are bearded.

Because [[scissors]] have two blades, some opinions in [[halakha]] (Jewish law) permit their use to trim the beard, as the cutting action comes from contact of the two blades and not the blade against the skin. For this reason, some [[posek|poskim]] (Jewish legal deciders) rule that [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] may use electric razors to remain clean-shaven, as such shavers cut by trapping the hair between the blades and the metal grating, [[Halakha|halakhically]] a scissorlike action. Other poskim like Zokon Yisrael KiHilchso,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://holmininternational613.com/books/BEARD_JEWISH_LAW-E.pdf|format=PDF|author= Gross, Rabbi Sholom Yehuda|title=The Beard in Jewish Law|accessdate= June 23, 2011}}See Zokon Yisrael KiHilchso</ref> maintain that electric shavers constitute a razor-style action and consequently prohibit their use.\n\nThe ''[[Zohar]]'', one of the primary sources of [[Kabbalah]] ([[Jewish mysticism]]), attributes [[Sacred|holiness]] to the beard, specifying that hairs of the beard symbolize channels of subconscious holy energy that flows from above to the human soul. Therefore, most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]], for whom Kabbalah plays an important role in their religious practice, traditionally do not remove or even trim their beards.\n\nTraditional Jews refrain from shaving, trimming the beard, and haircuts during certain times of the year like [[Passover]], [[Sukkot]], the [[Counting of the Omer]] and [[the Three Weeks]]. Cutting the hair is also restricted during the 30-day mourning period after the death of a close relative, known in Hebrew as the ''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Shloshim \u2013 Thirty days|Shloshim]]'' (thirty).\n\n===Sikhism===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nGuru Gobind Singh.jpg|Portrait of [[Sikh Guru]] [[Gobind Singh]], escorted by [[Sikhs]] with beards. \nSikh.man.at.the.Golden.Temple.jpg|A Sikh man with a full beard next to the [[Golden Temple]] at [[Amritsar, India]].\nSikh regiment indian army.jpg|Soldiers of the [[Indian Army]]'s [[Sikh Light Infantry]] regiment with various beards. \n</gallery>\n[[Guru Gobind Singh]], the tenth Sikh Guru, commanded the Sikhs to maintain unshorn hair, recognizing it as a necessary adornment of the body by Almighty God as well as a mandatory [[The Five Ks|Article of Faith]]. Sikhs consider the beard to be part of the nobility and dignity of their manhood. Sikhs also refrain from cutting their hair and beards out of respect for the God-given form. [[Kesh (Sikhism)|Kesh]], uncut hair, is one of [[the Five Ks]], five compulsory articles of faith for a baptized Sikh. As such, a Sikh man is easily identified by his turban and uncut hair and beard.\n\n===Rastafari Movement===\nMale [[Rastafari movement in the United States|Rastafarians]] wear beards in conformity with injunctions given in the Bible, such as [[Leviticus]] 21:5, which reads \"They shall not make any baldness on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh.\" The beard is a symbol of the covenant between God ([[Jah]] or [[Jehovah]] in Rastafari usage) and his people.\n\n==The \"Philosopher's beard\"==\nIn Greco-Roman antiquity the beard was \"seen as the defining characteristic of the philosopher; philosophers had to have beards, and anyone with a beard was assumed to be a philosopher.\"<ref>Citing Lucian's Demonax 13, Cynicus 1 - {{cite book|title=The art of living: the Stoics on the nature and function of philosophy|author=John Sellars|year=1988|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Burlington, VT}}</ref> While one may be tempted to think that [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] sported \"philosopher's beards\", such is not the case. Shaving was not widespread in [[Athens]] during fifth and fourth-century BCE and so they would not be distinguished from the general populace for having a beard. The popularity of shaving did not rise in the region until the example of Alexander the Great near the end of the fourth century BCE. The popularity of shaving did not spread to [[Rome]] until the end of the third century BCE following its acceptance by [[Scipio Africanus]]. In Rome shaving's popularity grew to the point that for a respectable Roman citizen it was seen almost as compulsory.\n\nThe idea of the philosopher's beard gained traction when in 155 BCE three philosophers arrived in Rome as Greek diplomats: [[Carneades]], head of the [[Platonic Academy]]; [[Critolaus]] of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]; and the head of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] [[Diogenes of Babylon]]. \"In contrast to their beautifully clean-shaven Italian audience, these three intellectuals all sported magnificent beards.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\">{{cite book |title=The art of living: the Stoics on the nature and function of philosophy |author=John Sellars |year=1988 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited |location=Burlington, VT}}</ref> Thus the connection of beards and philosophy caught hold of the Roman public imagination.\n\n[[File:Epicteti Enchiridion Latinis versibus adumbratum (Oxford 1715) frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]] stated he would embrace death before shaving.]]\n\nThe importance of the beard to Roman [[philosopher]]s is best seen by the extreme value that the Stoic philosopher [[Epictetus]] placed on it. As historian John Sellars puts it, Epictetus \"affirmed the philosopher's beard as something almost sacred...to express the idea that philosophy is no mere intellectual hobby but rather a way of life that, by definition, transforms every aspect of one's behavior, including one's shaving habits. If someone continues to shave in order to look the part of a respectable Roman citizen, it is clear that they have not yet embraced philosophy conceived as a way of life and have not yet escaped the social customs of the majority...the true philosopher will only act according to reason or according to nature, rejecting the arbitrary conventions that guide the behavior of everyone else.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\"/>\n\nEpictetus saw his beard as an integral part of his identity and held that he would rather be executed than submit to any force demanding he remove it. In his [[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]] 1.2.29, he puts forward such a hypothetical confrontation: {{\"'}}Come now, Epictetus, shave your beard'. If I am a philosopher, I answer, I will not shave it off. 'Then I will have you beheaded'. If it will do you any good, behead me.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> The act of shaving \"would be to compromise his philosophical ideal of living in accordance with nature and it would be to submit to the unjustified authority of another.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\"/>\n\nThis was not theoretical in the age of Epictetus, for the Emperor [[Domitian]] had the hair and beard forcibly shaven off of the philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] \"as punishment for anti-State activities.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> This disgraced Apollonius while avoiding making him a martyr like Socrates. Well before his declaration of \"death before shaving\" Epictetus had been forced to flee Rome when Domitian banished all philosophers from Italy under threat of execution.\n\nRoman philosophers sported different styles of beards to distinguish which school they belonged to. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] with long dirty beards to indicate their \"strict indifference to all external goods and social customs\";<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> Stoics occasionally trimming and washing their beards in accordance with their view \"that it is acceptable to prefer certain external goods so long as they are never valued above virtue\";<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetics]] took great care of their beards believing in accordance with Aristotle that \"external goods and social status were necessary for the good life together with virtue\".<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> To a Roman philosopher in this era, having a beard and its condition indicated their commitment to live in accordance with their philosophy.\n\n==Modern prohibition==\n\n===Civilian prohibitions===\nProfessional airline pilots are required to be shaven to facilitate a tight seal with auxiliary oxygen masks.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Can Airline Pilots Have Beards?|url = https://beardandcompany.com/blog/can-pilots-have-beards/|accessdate = 2015-10-04|first = Beard and|last = Company}}</ref> However, some airlines have recently lifted such bans in light of modern studies.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Air Canada pilots get permission to wear beards|url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/air-canada-pilots-get-permission-to-wear-beards-1.4825104|accessdate = 2018-11-07|first = Beard and|last = Company}}</ref> Similarly, firefighters may also be prohibited from full beards to obtain a proper seal with [[SCBA]] equipment.<ref>''Fitzpatrick v.

[[Willie Randolph]] and [[Joe Girardi]], both former Yankee assistant coaches, adopted a similar clean-shaven policy for their ballclubs: the [[New York Mets]] and [[Miami Marlins]], respectively. [[Fredi Gonzalez]], who replaced Girardi as the Marlins' manager, dropped that policy when he took over after the 2006 season.\n\nThe [[Playoff beard]] is a tradition common with teams in the [[National Hockey League]], and now in other leagues where players allow their beards to grow from the beginning of the playoff season until the playoffs are over for their team.\n\nIn 2008, some members of the [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] [[Gaelic football]] team vowed not to shave until the end of the season.

Fans in the stands could often be seen wearing fake beards and \"fear the beard\" became a popular expression during the team's run in the competition. Kleeberger, who became one of Canada's star players in the tournament, later used the publicity surrounding his beard to raise awareness for two causes; [[Christchurch earthquake]] relief efforts and prostate cancer. As part of this fundraising, his beard was shaved off by television personality [[Rick Mercer]] and aired on national television.

In humans, usually only [[puberty|pubescent]] or [[man|adult males]] are able to grow beards. Some women with [[hirsutism]], a hormonal condition of excessive hairiness, may develop a beard.\n\nThroughout the course of history, societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on factors such as prevailing cultural-religious traditions and the current era's [[fashion]] trends. Some religions (such as [[Islam]], Traditional Christianity, Orthodox Judaism and [[Sikhism]]) have considered a full beard to be absolutely essential for all males able to grow one and mandate it as part of their official [[dogma]]. Other cultures, even while not officially mandating it, view a beard as central to a man's [[virility]], exemplifying such virtues as [[wisdom]], [[Physical strength|strength]], sexual prowess and high [[social status]]. In cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards may be associated with poor hygiene or an uncivilized, dangerous demeanor. In countries with colder climates, beards help protect the wearer's face from the elements.\n\n==Biology==\nThe beard develops during [[puberty]]. Beard growth is linked to stimulation of hair follicles in the area by [[dihydrotestosterone]], which continues to affect beard growth after puberty. Dihydrotestosterone also promotes balding. Dihydrotestosterone is produced from [[testosterone]], the levels of which vary with season. Beard growth rate is also genetic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Randall VA |title=Androgens and hair growth |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=314\u201328 |year=2008 |pmid=18844710 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00214.x}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n[[File:Baerte ohne text.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Different types of beards : 1) Incipient 2) Moustache 3) Goatee or Mandarin 4) Spanish-style 5) Long sideburns 6) Sideburn joined by his moustache 7) Style Van Dyke 8) Full beard.]]\nBiologists characterize beards as a [[secondary sexual characteristic]] because they are unique to one sex, yet do not play a direct role in reproduction.

Where the beard has mostly a strong resemblance to that affected by the Assyrians, and familiar to us from their sculptures. It is arranged in three, four, or five rows of small tight curls, and extends from ear to ear around the cheeks and chin. Sometimes, however, in lieu of the many rows, we find one row only, the beard falling in tresses, which are curled at the extremity. There is no indication of the Phoenicians having cultivated mustachios.<ref>{{citation-attribution|{{cite book|last1=Rawlinson |first1=George |title=History of Phoenicia |url=https://archive.org/details/historyphoenici01rawlgoog |year=1889 |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co }}}}</ref>\n\n====Mesopotamia====\n[[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations (Sumerian, Assyrians, Babylonians, Chaldeans and Medians) devoted great care to oiling and dressing their beards, using tongs and curling irons to create elaborate ringlets and tiered patterns.\n\n====Egypt====\nThe highest ranking [[Ancient Egypt]]ians grew hair on their chins which was often dyed or [[henna]]ed (reddish brown) and sometimes plaited with interwoven gold thread. A metal false beard, or [[postiche]], which was a sign of sovereignty, was worn by queens and kings. This was held in place by a ribbon tied over the head and attached to a gold chin strap, a fashion existing from about 3000 to 1580 BC.\n\n====Indian subcontinent====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nIndian warriors (Sattagydian, Gandharan, Hindush) circa 480 BCE in the Naqsh-e Roastam reliefs of Xerxes I.jpg|[[Ancient India]]n warriors with various types of beards, circa 480 BCE. \nShivaji Rijksmuseum.jpg|[[Chhatrapati]] [[Shivaji]] of the [[Maratha Empire]] with a trimmed beard. \nMaharaj Ranjit Singh.jpg|[[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] of the [[Sikh Empire]] with a long beard.\nKunvar singh.jpg|Indian warrior [[Kunwar Singh]] of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] with a standard beard.\n</gallery>\nIn ancient India, the beard was allowed to grow long, a symbol of dignity and of wisdom (cf. [[sadhu]]). The nations in the east generally treated their beards with great care and veneration, and the punishment for licentiousness and adultery was to have the beard of the offending parties publicly cut off. They had such a sacred regard for the preservation of their beards that a man might pledge it for the payment of a debt.\n\n[[File:Ming emperor with beard.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Tang-xuanzong.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuan Zong]] of Tang. He has the specific east asian facial hair growth pattern in which hair only grows above and below the lips and on the chin. The cheeks and jaw are unshaved as no hair grows there.]]\n\n====China====\n[[Confucius]] held that the human body was a gift from one's parents to which no alterations should be made. Aside from abstaining from body modifications such as tattoos, Confucians were also discouraged from cutting their hair, fingernails or beards. To what extent people could actually comply with this ideal depended on their profession; farmers or soldiers could probably not grow long beards as it would have interfered with their work.\n\nOnly a certain percentage of [[East Asia|east asian]] men are capable of growing a full beard. Another proportion of east asian men are capable of growing facial hair but only in a very specific growth pattern in which hair only grows above the lip, below the lip and on the chin, with no hair growth on the cheeks or jaw. Another proportion of east asian men are capable of growing facial hair in some combination of the two.\n\nThis growth pattern can be seen on the clay soldiers in the [[Terracotta Army]].\n\n====Iran====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Detail - Sculpture at the Hall of All Nations (4676223447).jpg|Close-up of one of the [[Lamassu]] beard [[relief]] in [[Gate of All Nations]] in [[Perspolis]] (south of [[Iran]]).\nFile:Mihr Ali 1813.jpg|[[Fath-Ali Shah]], the second [[Qajar]] Shah of Persia had a long beard.\n</gallery>\nThe [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] were fond of long beards, and almost all the [[List of monarchs of Persia|Iranian kings]] had a beard. In Travels by [[Adam Olearius]], a King of Iran commands his steward's head to be cut off, and on its being brought to him, remarks, \"what a pity it was, that a man possessing such fine mustachios, should have been executed.\" Men in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid era]] wore long beards, with warriors adorning theirs with jewelry. Men also commonly wore beards during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar eras]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Greece====\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aristotle]] with a beard.]]\nThe [[ancient Greeks]] regarded the beard as a badge or sign of [[virility]]; in the [[Homeric epics]] it had almost sanctified significance, so that a common form of entreaty was to touch the beard of the person addressed.<ref>See, for example, Homer ''Iliad'' 1:500-1</ref> It was only shaven as a sign of mourning, though in this case it was instead often left untrimmed.

From the earliest times, however, the shaving of the upper lip was not uncommon. Greek beards were also frequently curled with tongs.\n\n====Macedon====\nIn the time of [[Alexander the Great]] the custom of smooth [[shaving]] was introduced.<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Chrysippus ap. Athen. xiii. 565 a</ref> Alexander strongly promoted shaving during his reign because he believed it looked tidier.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria|title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History (Google eBook)|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=dangerous+beard-grabbing+in+combat&source=bl&ots=YK49BZkanc&sig=Xxk_hP1Z-qE6NEZs6nhOPIcIsmk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9yBIUZfKJY-02AXki4CIBg&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dangerous%20beard-grabbing%20in%20combat&f=false}}</ref> Reportedly, Alexander ordered his soldiers to be clean-shaven, fearing that their beards would serve as handles for their enemies to grab and to hold the soldier as he was killed. The practice of shaving spread from the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose kings are represented on coins, etc. with smooth faces, throughout the whole known world of the Macedonian Empire. Laws were passed against it, without effect, at [[Rhodes]] and [[Byzantium]]; and even [[Aristotle]] conformed to the new custom,<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Diog. Laert.v. 1</ref> unlike the other [[philosopher]]s, who retained the beard as a badge of their profession. A man with a beard after the Macedonian period implied a philosopher,<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites cf. Pers.iv. 1, magister [[barbatus (disambiguation)|barbatus]] of Socrates</ref> and there are many allusions to this custom of the later philosophers in such proverbs as: [[Barba non facit philosophum|\"The beard does not make the sage.\"]]<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites {{lang-grc|\u03c0\u03c9\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6}}. De Is. et Osir. 3</ref>\n\n====Rome====\nShaving seems to have not been known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] during their early history (under the kings of Rome and the early Republic). Pliny tells us that P. Ticinius was the first who brought a [[barber]] to Rome, which was in the 454th year from the founding of the city (that is, around 299 BC). [[Scipio Africanus]] (236\u2013183 BC) was apparently the first among the Romans who shaved his beard. However, after that point, shaving seems to have caught on very quickly, and soon almost all Roman men were clean-shaven; being clean-shaven became a sign of being Roman and not Greek. Only in the later times of the Republic did the Roman youth begin shaving their beards only partially, trimming it into an ornamental form; prepubescent boys oiled their chins in hopes of forcing premature growth of a beard.<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Petron. 75, 10</ref>\n\nStill, beards remained rare among the Romans throughout the Late Republic and the early Principate. In a general way, in Rome at this time, a long beard was considered a mark of slovenliness and squalor. The censors [[L. Veturius]] and [[P. Licinius]] compelled [[M. Livius]], who had been banished, on his restoration to the city, to be shaved, to lay aside his dirty appearance, and then, but not until then, to come into the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Liv.xxvii. 34</ref> The first occasion of shaving was regarded as the beginning of [[manhood]], and the day on which this took place was celebrated as a festival.<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Juv.iii. 186</ref> Usually, this was done when the young Roman assumed the ''[[toga virilis]]''. [[Augustus]] did it in his twenty-fourth year, [[Caligula]] in his twentieth. The hair cut off on such occasions was consecrated to a god. Thus [[Nero]] put his into a golden box set with pearls, and dedicated it to [[Jupiter Capitolinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Suet. Ner.12</ref> The Romans, unlike the Greeks, let their beards grow in time of mourning; so did Augustus for the death of [[Julius Caesar]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peck|1898}} cites Dio Cass. xlviii. 34</ref> Other occasions of mourning on which the beard was allowed to grow were, appearance as a ''reus'', condemnation, or some public calamity. On the other hand, men of the country areas around Rome in the time of [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] seem not to have shaved except when they came to market every eighth day, so that their usual appearance was most likely a short [[Shaving|stubble]].<ref>Varro asked rhetorically how often the tradesmen of the country shaved between market days, implying (in chronologist E. J. Bickerman's opinion) that this did not happen at all: \"quoties priscus homo ac rusticus Romanus inter nundinum barbam radebat?\",[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/dict?name=ls&lang=la&word=nundinus&filter=CUTF8 Varr. ap. Non. 214, 30; 32]: see also E J Bickerman, ''Chronology of the Ancient World'', London (Thames & Hudson) 1968, at p.59.</ref>\n\nIn the second century AD the Emperor [[Hadrian]], according to [[Dio Cassius]], was the first of all the Caesars to grow a full beard; [[Plutarch]] says that he did it to hide scars on his face. This was a period in Rome of widespread imitation of Greek culture, and many other men grew beards in imitation of Hadrian and the Greek fashion. Until the time of [[Constantine the Great]] the emperors appear in busts and coins with beards; but Constantine and his successors until the reign of [[Phocas]], with the exception of [[Julian the Apostate]], are represented as beardless.\n\n====Celts and Germanic tribes====\nLate Hellenistic sculptures of [[Celts]]<ref>Examples (both in Roman copies): ''[[Dying Gaul]]'', ''[[Ludovisi Gaul]]''</ref> portray them with long hair and mustaches but beardless. [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] reported the [[British people|Britons]] wore no beard except upon the upper lip.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] on arrival in [[Great Britain|Britain]] wore beards and continued to do so for a considerable time after.<ref>''The National Cyclopedia of Useful Knowledge'', Vol III, (1847) Charles Knight, London, p.46.</ref>\n\nAmong the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Celts of [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], men typically let their facial hair grow into a full beard, and it was often seen as dishonourable for a Gaelic man to have no facial hair.<ref name=\"Connolly-prologue\">{{cite book |title=Contested island: Ireland 1460-1630 |last=Connolly |first=Sean J |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=7 |chapter=Prologue}}</ref><ref name=\"Gerald\">[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/topography_ireland.pdf ''The Topography of Ireland'' by Giraldus Cambrensis] (English translation)</ref><ref>Macleod, John, ''Highlanders: A History of the Gaels'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1997) p43</ref>\n\n[[Tacitus]] states that among the Catti, a [[Germanic people|Germanic]] tribe (perhaps the [[Chatten]]), a young man was not allowed to shave or cut his hair until he had slain an enemy. The [[Lombards]] derived their name from the great length of their beards (Longobards \u2013 Long Beards). When [[Otto the Great]] said anything serious, he swore by his beard, which covered his breast.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Charles IV-John Ocko votive picture-fragment.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]\nIn the [[Middle Ages|Middle-Age Europe]], a beard displayed a [[knight]]'s [[virility]] and [[honour]].\nThe Castilian knight [[El Cid]] is described in ''[[The Lay of the Cid]]'' as \"the one with the flowery beard\".\nHolding somebody else's beard was a serious offence that had to be righted in a [[duel]].\n\nWhile most noblemen and knights were bearded, the Catholic clergy were generally required to be clean-shaven. This was understood as a symbol of their [[celibacy]].\n\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia men would apparently keep mustaches but shave the hair on their chins{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. The prophet Muhammad encouraged his followers to do the opposite, long chin hair but trimmed mustaches, to signify their break with the old religion. This style of beard subsequently spread along with Islam during the Muslim expansion in the Middle Ages.\n\n===From the Renaissance to the present day===\n{{Original research section|date=June 2009}}\n{{Globalize|section|date=April 2014}}\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Friedrich Engels portrait (cropped).jpg|[[Friedrich Engels]] exhibiting a full moustache and beard that was a common style among Europeans of the 19th century.\nFile:Johann Strauss II (3).jpg|[[Johann Strauss II]] with a large beard, moustache, and [[sideburns]].\nFile:Thomas Swann of Maryland - photo portrait seated.jpg|Maryland Governor [[Thomas Swann]] with a long [[goatee]].

Some beards of this time were the Spanish spade beard, the English square cut beard, the forked beard, and the stiletto beard. In 1587 [[Francis Drake]] claimed, in a [[figure of speech]], to have [[singed the King of Spain's beard]].\n\nDuring the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911), the ruling [[Manchu]] minority were either clean-shaven or at most wore mustaches, in contrast to the [[Han Chinese|Han]] majority who still wore beards in keeping with the Confucian ideal.\n\nIn the beginning of the 17th century, the size of beards decreased in urban circles of Western Europe. In the second half of the century, being clean-shaven gradually became more common again, so much so that in 1698, [[Peter the Great]] of Russia ordered men to shave off their beards, and in 1705 levied a [[beard tax|tax on beards]] in order to bring Russian society more in line with contemporary Western Europe.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/beard-tax Beard Tax: Information from]. Answers.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-03.</ref>\n\nDuring the early 19th century most men, particularly amongst the nobility and upper classes, went clean-shaven. There was, however, a dramatic shift in the beard's popularity during the 1850s, with it becoming markedly more popular.<ref name=\"Jacob Middleton 2006\">Jacob Middleton, 'Bearded Patriarchs', History Today, Volume: 56 Issue: 2 (February 2006), 26\u201327.</ref> Consequently, beards were adopted by many leaders, such as [[Alexander III of Russia]], [[Napoleon III]] of France and [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] of Germany, as well as many leading statesmen and cultural figures, such as [[Benjamin Disraeli]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. This trend can be recognised in the United States of America, where the shift can be seen amongst the post-Civil War presidents. Before [[Abraham Lincoln]], no President had a beard;<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA59#v=onepage | title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | author=Sherrow, Victoria | year=2006 | pages=59}}</ref> after Lincoln until [[Woodrow Wilson]], every President except [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William McKinley]] had either a beard or a moustache.\n\nThe beard became linked in this period with notions of masculinity and male courage.<ref name=\"Jacob Middleton 2006\"/> The resulting popularity has contributed to the stereotypical Victorian male figure in the popular mind, the stern figure clothed in black whose gravitas is added to by a heavy beard.\n\nIn China, the revolution of 1911 and subsequent May Fourth Movement of 1919 led the Chinese to idealize the West as more modern and progressive than themselves. This included the realm of fashion, and Chinese men began shaving their faces and cutting their hair short.\n\nBy the early-twentieth century, beards began a slow decline in popularity. Although retained by some prominent figures who were young men in the Victorian period (like [[Sigmund Freud]]), most men who retained facial hair during the 1920s and 1930s limited themselves to a moustache or a [[goatee]] (such as with [[Marcel Proust]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]). In the United States, meanwhile, popular movies portrayed heroes with clean-shaven faces and \"[[crew cut]]s\". Concurrently, the psychological [[mass marketing]] of [[Madison Avenue]] was becoming prevalent. The [[The Gillette Company|Gillette]] [[Safety razor|Safety Razor]] Company was one of these marketers' early clients. These events conspired to popularize short hair and clean-shaven faces as the only acceptable style for decades to come. The few men who wore the beard or portions of the beard during this period were usually either old, Central European, members of a religious sect that required it, or in academia.\n\nThe beard was reintroduced to mainstream society by the counterculture, firstly with the \"[[beatnik]]s\" in the 1950s, and then with the [[hippie]] movement of the mid-1960s. Following the [[Vietnam War]], beards exploded in popularity. In the mid-late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, beards were worn by [[hippie]]s and businessmen alike. Popular musicians like [[The Beatles]], [[Barry White]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Jim Morrison]] (lead singer of [[The Doors]]) and the male members of [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], among many others, wore full beards. The trend of seemingly ubiquitous beards in American culture subsided in the mid-1980s.\n[[File:Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Charles Evans Hughes as Chief Justice of the United States]]\nBy the end of the 20th century, the closely clipped [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] beard, often with a matching integrated moustache, had become relatively common. From the 1990s onward, fashion in the United States has generally trended toward either a goatee, [[Van Dyke beard|Van Dyke]], or a closely cropped full beard undercut on the throat.

However, Western European art generally depicts [[John the Apostle]] as clean-shaven, to emphasize his relative youth. Eight of the figures portrayed in the painting entitled ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] are bearded.

The phrase \"nourishing a beard\" was interpreted in different ways, either as imposing a clean-shaven face or only excluding a too-lengthy beard. In relatively modern times, the first pope to wear a beard was [[Pope Julius II]], who in 1511\u201312 did so for a while as a sign of mourning for the loss of the city of [[Bologna]]. [[Pope Clement VII]] let his beard grow at the time of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)]] and kept it. All his successors did so until the death in 1700 of [[Pope Innocent XII]]. Since then, no pope has worn a beard. Most Latin-rite clergy are now clean-shaven, but [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and some others are bearded.

Because [[scissors]] have two blades, some opinions in [[halakha]] (Jewish law) permit their use to trim the beard, as the cutting action comes from contact of the two blades and not the blade against the skin. For this reason, some [[posek|poskim]] (Jewish legal deciders) rule that [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] may use electric razors to remain clean-shaven, as such shavers cut by trapping the hair between the blades and the metal grating, [[Halakha|halakhically]] a scissorlike action. Other poskim like Zokon Yisrael KiHilchso,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://holmininternational613.com/books/BEARD_JEWISH_LAW-E.pdf|format=PDF|author= Gross, Rabbi Sholom Yehuda|title=The Beard in Jewish Law|accessdate= June 23, 2011}}See Zokon Yisrael KiHilchso</ref> maintain that electric shavers constitute a razor-style action and consequently prohibit their use.\n\nThe ''[[Zohar]]'', one of the primary sources of [[Kabbalah]] ([[Jewish mysticism]]), attributes [[Sacred|holiness]] to the beard, specifying that hairs of the beard symbolize channels of subconscious holy energy that flows from above to the human soul. Therefore, most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]], for whom Kabbalah plays an important role in their religious practice, traditionally do not remove or even trim their beards.\n\nTraditional Jews refrain from shaving, trimming the beard, and haircuts during certain times of the year like [[Passover]], [[Sukkot]], the [[Counting of the Omer]] and [[the Three Weeks]]. Cutting the hair is also restricted during the 30-day mourning period after the death of a close relative, known in Hebrew as the ''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Shloshim \u2013 Thirty days|Shloshim]]'' (thirty).\n\n===Sikhism===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nGuru Gobind Singh.jpg|Portrait of [[Sikh Guru]] [[Gobind Singh]], escorted by [[Sikhs]] with beards. \nSikh.man.at.the.Golden.Temple.jpg|A Sikh man with a full beard next to the [[Golden Temple]] at [[Amritsar, India]].\nSikh regiment indian army.jpg|Soldiers of the [[Indian Army]]'s [[Sikh Light Infantry]] regiment with various beards. \n</gallery>\n[[Guru Gobind Singh]], the tenth Sikh Guru, commanded the Sikhs to maintain unshorn hair, recognizing it as a necessary adornment of the body by Almighty God as well as a mandatory [[The Five Ks|Article of Faith]]. Sikhs consider the beard to be part of the nobility and dignity of their manhood. Sikhs also refrain from cutting their hair and beards out of respect for the God-given form. [[Kesh (Sikhism)|Kesh]], uncut hair, is one of [[the Five Ks]], five compulsory articles of faith for a baptized Sikh. As such, a Sikh man is easily identified by his turban and uncut hair and beard.\n\n===Rastafari Movement===\nMale [[Rastafari movement in the United States|Rastafarians]] wear beards in conformity with injunctions given in the Bible, such as [[Leviticus]] 21:5, which reads \"They shall not make any baldness on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh.\" The beard is a symbol of the covenant between God ([[Jah]] or [[Jehovah]] in Rastafari usage) and his people.\n\n==The \"Philosopher's beard\"==\nIn Greco-Roman antiquity the beard was \"seen as the defining characteristic of the philosopher; philosophers had to have beards, and anyone with a beard was assumed to be a philosopher.\"<ref>Citing Lucian's Demonax 13, Cynicus 1 - {{cite book|title=The art of living: the Stoics on the nature and function of philosophy|author=John Sellars|year=1988|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Burlington, VT}}</ref> While one may be tempted to think that [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] sported \"philosopher's beards\", such is not the case. Shaving was not widespread in [[Athens]] during fifth and fourth-century BCE and so they would not be distinguished from the general populace for having a beard. The popularity of shaving did not rise in the region until the example of [[Alexander the Great]] near the end of the fourth century BCE. The popularity of shaving did not spread to [[Rome]] until the end of the third century BCE following its acceptance by [[Scipio Africanus]]. In Rome shaving's popularity grew to the point that for a respectable Roman citizen it was seen almost as compulsory.\n\nThe idea of the philosopher's beard gained traction when in 155 BCE three philosophers arrived in Rome as Greek diplomats: [[Carneades]], head of the [[Platonic Academy]]; [[Critolaus]] of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]; and the head of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] [[Diogenes of Babylon]]. \"In contrast to their beautifully clean-shaven Italian audience, these three intellectuals all sported magnificent beards.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\">{{cite book |title=The art of living: the Stoics on the nature and function of philosophy |author=John Sellars |year=1988 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited |location=Burlington, VT}}</ref> Thus the connection of beards and philosophy caught hold of the Roman public imagination.\n\n[[File:Epicteti Enchiridion Latinis versibus adumbratum (Oxford 1715) frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]] stated he would embrace death before shaving.]]\n\nThe importance of the beard to Roman [[philosopher]]s is best seen by the extreme value that the Stoic philosopher [[Epictetus]] placed on it. As historian John Sellars puts it, Epictetus \"affirmed the philosopher's beard as something almost sacred...to express the idea that philosophy is no mere intellectual hobby but rather a way of life that, by definition, transforms every aspect of one's behavior, including one's shaving habits. If someone continues to shave in order to look the part of a respectable Roman citizen, it is clear that they have not yet embraced philosophy conceived as a way of life and have not yet escaped the social customs of the majority...the true philosopher will only act according to reason or according to nature, rejecting the arbitrary conventions that guide the behavior of everyone else.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\"/>\n\nEpictetus saw his beard as an integral part of his identity and held that he would rather be executed than submit to any force demanding he remove it. In his [[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]] 1.2.29, he puts forward such a hypothetical confrontation: {{\"'}}Come now, Epictetus, shave your beard'. If I am a philosopher, I answer, I will not shave it off. 'Then I will have you beheaded'. If it will do you any good, behead me.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> The act of shaving \"would be to compromise his philosophical ideal of living in accordance with nature and it would be to submit to the unjustified authority of another.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\"/>\n\nThis was not theoretical in the age of Epictetus, for the Emperor [[Domitian]] had the hair and beard forcibly shaven off of the philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] \"as punishment for anti-State activities.\"<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> This disgraced Apollonius while avoiding making him a martyr like Socrates. Well before his declaration of \"death before shaving\" Epictetus had been forced to flee Rome when Domitian banished all philosophers from Italy under threat of execution.\n\nRoman philosophers sported different styles of beards to distinguish which school they belonged to. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] with long dirty beards to indicate their \"strict indifference to all external goods and social customs\";<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> Stoics occasionally trimming and washing their beards in accordance with their view \"that it is acceptable to prefer certain external goods so long as they are never valued above virtue\";<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetics]] took great care of their beards believing in accordance with Aristotle that \"external goods and social status were necessary for the good life together with virtue\".<ref name=\"Sellars\"/> To a Roman philosopher in this era, having a beard and its condition indicated their commitment to live in accordance with their philosophy.\n\n==Modern prohibition==\n\n===Civilian prohibitions===\nProfessional airline pilots are required to be shaven to facilitate a tight seal with auxiliary oxygen masks.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Can Airline Pilots Have Beards?|url = https://beardandcompany.com/blog/can-pilots-have-beards/|accessdate = 2015-10-04|first = Beard and|last = Company}}</ref> However, some airlines have recently lifted such bans in light of modern studies.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Air Canada pilots get permission to wear beards|url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/air-canada-pilots-get-permission-to-wear-beards-1.4825104|accessdate = 2018-11-07|first = Beard and|last = Company}}</ref> Similarly, firefighters may also be prohibited from full beards to obtain a proper seal with [[SCBA]] equipment.<ref>''Fitzpatrick v.

[[Willie Randolph]] and [[Joe Girardi]], both former Yankee assistant coaches, adopted a similar clean-shaven policy for their ballclubs: the [[New York Mets]] and [[Miami Marlins]], respectively. [[Fredi Gonzalez]], who replaced Girardi as the Marlins' manager, dropped that policy when he took over after the 2006 season.\n\nThe [[Playoff beard]] is a tradition common with teams in the [[National Hockey League]], and now in other leagues where players allow their beards to grow from the beginning of the playoff season until the playoffs are over for their team.\n\nIn 2008, some members of the [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] [[Gaelic football]] team vowed not to shave until the end of the season.

Kleeberger was known, alongside teammates [[Jebb Sinclair]] and [[Hubert Buydens]] as one of \"the beardoes\". Fans in the stands could often be seen wearing fake beards and \"fear the beard\" became a popular expression during the team's run in the competition. Kleeberger, who became one of Canada's star players in the tournament, later used the publicity surrounding his beard to raise awareness for two causes; [[Christchurch earthquake]] relief efforts and prostate cancer. As part of this fundraising, his beard was shaved off by television personality [[Rick Mercer]] and aired on national television.

Geometrically, these are [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] involving certain functions of one or more [[angle]]s. They are distinct from [[Trigonometry#Triangle identities|triangle identities]], which are identities potentially involving angles but also involving side lengths or other lengths of a [[triangle]].\n\nThese identities are useful whenever expressions involving trigonometric functions need to be simplified. An important application is the [[integral|integration]] of non-trigonometric functions: a common technique involves first using the [[Trigonometric substitution|substitution rule with a trigonometric function]],and then simplifying the resulting integral with a trigonometric identity.\n\n==Notation==\n\n===Angles===\n[[File:trigonometric function quadrant sign.svg|thumb|Signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant.

Their usual abbreviations are {{math|sin(''\u03b8'')}}, {{math|cos(''\u03b8'')}} and {{math|tan(''\u03b8'')}}, respectively, where {{mvar|\u03b8}} denotes the angle. The parentheses around the argument of the functions are often omitted, e.g., {{math|sin ''\u03b8''}} and {{math|cos ''\u03b8''}}, if an interpretation is unambiguously possible.\n\nThe sine of an angle is defined, in the context of a [[right triangle]], as the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite to the angle divided by the length of the longest side of the triangle (the [[hypotenuse]]).\n:<math>\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}.</math>\nThe cosine of an angle in this context is the ratio of the length of the side that is adjacent to the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.\n:<math>\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}.</math>\nThe [[tangent function|tangent]] of an angle in this context is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite to the angle divided by the length of the side that is adjacent to the angle. This is the same as the [[ratio]] of the sine to the cosine of this angle, as can be seen by substituting the definitions of {{math|sin}} and {{math|cos}} from above:\n:<math>\\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}=\\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}}.</math>\n\nThe remaining trigonometric functions secant ({{math|sec}}), cosecant ({{math|csc}}), and cotangent ({{math|cot}}) are defined as the [[Trigonometric functions#Cosecant, secant, and cotangent|reciprocal functions]] of cosine, sine, and tangent, respectively. Rarely, these are called the secondary trigonometric functions:\n\n:<math>\\sec\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta},\\quad\\csc\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta},\\quad\\cot\\theta=\\frac{1}{\\tan\\theta}=\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}.</math>\nThese definitions are sometimes referred to as [[Proofs of trigonometric identities#Ratio identities|ratio identities]].\n\n==Inverse functions==\n{{main|Inverse trigonometric functions}}\nThe inverse trigonometric functions are partial [[inverse function]]s for the trigonometric functions. For example, the inverse function for the sine, known as the '''inverse sine''' ({{math|sin<sup>\u22121</sup>}}) or '''arcsine''' ({{math|arcsin}} or {{math|asin}}), satisfies\n:<math>\\sin(\\arcsin x) = x\\quad\\text{for} \\quad |x| \\leq 1 </math>\nand\n:<math>\\arcsin(\\sin x) = x\\quad\\text{for} \\quad |x| \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}. </math>\n\nThis article uses the notation below for inverse trigonometric functions:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

This equation can be solved for either the sine or the cosine:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin\\theta &= \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\theta}, \\\\\n\\cos\\theta &= \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\theta}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the sign depends on the [[Quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]] of {{mvar|\u03b8}}.\n\nDividing this identity by either {{math|sin<sup>2</sup> ''\u03b8''}} or {{math|cos<sup>2</sup> ''\u03b8''}} yields the other two Pythagorean identities:\n\n:<math>1 + \\tan^2\\theta = \\sec^2\\theta\\quad\\text{and}\\quad 1 + \\cot^2\\theta = \\csc^2\\theta.</math>\n\nUsing these identities together with the ratio identities, it is possible to express any trigonometric function in terms of any other ([[up to]] a plus or minus sign):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;text-align:center\"\n|+ Each trigonometric function in terms of each of the other five.<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, p.&nbsp;73, 4.3.45</ref>\n! in terms of\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\sin \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\cos \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\tan \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\csc \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\sec \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\cot \\theta</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\sin \\theta =</math>\n| <math> \\sin \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\tan \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\csc \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sec^2 \\theta - 1}}{\\sec \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\cot^2 \\theta}}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\cos \\theta =</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\theta}</math>\n| <math> \\cos \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{\\csc^2 \\theta - 1}}{\\csc \\theta}</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\sec \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 + \\cot^2 \\theta}}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\tan \\theta =</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta}}{\\cos \\theta}</math>\n| <math> \\tan \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\csc^2 \\theta - 1}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{\\sec^2 \\theta - 1}</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\cot \\theta}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\csc \\theta =</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta}}{\\tan \\theta}</math>\n| <math> \\csc \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sec \\theta}{\\sqrt{\\sec^2 \\theta - 1}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{1 + \\cot^2 \\theta}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\sec \\theta =</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta}}</math><center>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\csc \\theta}{\\sqrt{\\csc^2 \\theta - 1}}</math>\n| <math> \\sec \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{1 + \\cot^2 \\theta}}{\\cot \\theta}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\cot \\theta =</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta}}{\\sin \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\cos \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{\\csc^2 \\theta - 1}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sec^2 \\theta - 1}}</math>\n| <math> \\cot \\theta</math>\n|}\n\n==Historical shorthands==\n[[File:Circle-trig6.svg|300px|right|thumb|All of the trigonometric functions of an angle {{mvar|\u03b8}} can be constructed geometrically in terms of a unit circle centered at&nbsp;''O''.

Some examples of shifts are shown below in the table.\n* A '''full turn''', or {{math|360\u00b0}}, or 2{{pi}} radian leaves the unit circle fixed and is the smallest interval for which the trigonometric functions {{math|sin, cos, sec, and csc}} repeat their values, and is thus their period. Shifting arguments of any periodic function by any integer multiple of a full period preserves the function value of the unshifted argument.\n* A '''half turn''', or {{math|180\u00b0}}, or {{pi}} radian is the period of {{math|tan(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|sin(''x'')|cos(''x'')}} and cot(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|cos(''x'')|sin(''x'')}}}}, as can be seen from these definitions and the period of the defining trigonometric functions. So shifting the arguments of {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} by any multiple of {{pi}}, does not change their function values.\n:For the functions {{math|sin, cos, sec, and csc}} with period 2{{pi}} half a turn is half of their period. For this shift they change the sign of their values, as can be seen from the unit circle again. This new value repeats after any additional shift of 2{{pi}}, so all together they change the sign for a shift by any odd multiple of {{pi}}, i.e., by {{math|(2''k'' + 1)\u22c5{{pi}}}}, with {{mvar|k}} an arbitrary integer. Any even multiple of {{pi}} is of course just a full period, and a backward shift by half a period is the same as a backward shift by one full period plus one shift forward by half a period.\n* A '''quarter turn''', or {{math|90\u00b0}}, or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radian is a half period shift for {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} with period {{math|{{pi}}}} ({{math|180\u00b0}}), and yields the function value of applying the complementary function to the unshifted argument. By the argument above this also holds for a shift by any odd multiple {{math|(2''k'' + 1)\u22c5{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}} of the half period.\n: For the four other trigonometric functions a quarter turn also represents a quarter period. A shift by an arbitrary multiple of a quarter period, that is not covered by a multiple of half periods, can be decomposed in an integer multiple of periods, plus or minus one quarter period. The terms expressing these multiples are {{math|(4''k'' \u00b1 1)\u22c5{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}. The forward/backward shifts by one quarter period are reflected in the table below. Again, these shifts yield function values, employing the respective complementary function applied to the unshifted argument.\n: Shifting the arguments of {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} by their quarter period ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}}) does not yield such simple results.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF\"\n!Shift by one quarter period\n!Shift by one half period<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, p.&nbsp;72, 4.3.9</ref>\n!Shift by full periods<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, p.&nbsp;72, 4.3.7\u20138</ref>\n!Period\n|-\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\pm\\cos \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sin \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\sin \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\mp\\sin \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\cos \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\cos \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}) =  \\tfrac{\\tan \\theta \\pm 1}{1\\mp \\tan \\theta}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta + \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = -\\cot \\theta </math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta + k\\cdot \\pi) = +\\tan \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\pm\\sec \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\csc \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\csc \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\mp\\csc \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sec \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\sec \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}) =  \\tfrac{\\cot \\theta \\pm 1}{1\\mp \\cot \\theta}</math>\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta + \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = -\\tan\\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta + k\\cdot \\pi) = +\\cot \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>\\pi</math>\n|}\n\n==Angle sum and difference identities==\n[[File:AngleAdditionDiagramSine.svg|right|thumb|225px|Illustration of angle addition formulae for the sine and cosine. Emphasized segment is of unit length.]]\n{{see also|#Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities|Small-angle approximation#Angle sum and difference}}\n\nThese are also known as the ''angle addition and subtraction theorems'' (or ''formulae'').\nThe identities can be derived by combining right triangles such as in the adjacent diagram, or by considering the invariance of the length of a chord on a unit circle given a particular central angle. The most intuitive derivation uses rotation matrices (see below).\n\n[[File:AngleAdditionDiagramTangent.svg|right|thumb|225px|Illustration of the angle addition formula for the tangent. Emphasized segments are of unit length.]]\n\nFor acute angles {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{mvar|\u03b2}}, whose sum is non-obtuse, a concise diagram (shown) illustrates the angle sum formulae for sine and cosine: The bold segment labeled \"1\" has unit length and serves as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with angle {{mvar|\u03b2}}; the opposite and adjacent legs for this angle have respective lengths {{math|sin ''\u03b2''}} and {{math|cos ''\u03b2''}}. The {{math|cos ''\u03b2''}} leg is itself the hypotenuse of a right triangle with angle {{mvar|\u03b1}}; that triangle's legs, therefore, have lengths given by {{math|sin ''\u03b1''}} and {{math|cos ''\u03b1''}}, multiplied by {{math|cos ''\u03b2''}}. The {{math|sin ''\u03b2''}} leg, as hypotenuse of another right triangle with angle {{mvar|\u03b1}}, likewise leads to segments of length {{math|cos ''\u03b1'' sin ''\u03b2''}} and {{math|sin ''\u03b1'' sin ''\u03b2''}}. Now, we observe that the \"1\" segment is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle with angle {{math|''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2''}}; the leg opposite this angle necessarily has length {{math|sin(''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2'')}}, while the leg adjacent has length {{math|cos(''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2'')}}. Consequently, as the opposing sides of the diagram's outer rectangle are equal, we deduce\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) &= \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta + \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\\\\n\\cos(\\alpha + \\beta) &= \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta - \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta\n\\end{align}</math>\nRelocating one of the named angles yields a variant of the diagram that demonstrates the angle difference formulae for sine and cosine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trigonography.com/2015/09/28/angle-sum-and-difference-for-sine-and-cosine/|title=Angle Sum and Difference for Sine and Cosine|last=The Trigonographer|date=28 September 2015|website=Trigonography.com|access-date=28 May 2017}}</ref> (The diagram admits further variants to accommodate angles and sums greater than a right angle.)

Furthermore, matrix multiplication of the rotation matrix for an angle {{math|''\u03b1''}} with a column vector will rotate the column vector counterclockwise by the angle {{math|''\u03b1''}}.\n\nSince multiplication by a [[complex number]] of unit length rotates the complex plane by the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of the number, the above multiplication of rotation matrices is equivalent to a multiplication of complex numbers:<blockquote><math>\\begin{array}{rcl}(\\cos\\alpha + i\\sin\\alpha)(\\cos\\beta + i\\sin\\beta) \n&=& (\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\beta-\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\beta)+i(\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\beta+\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\beta)\\\\\n&=& \\cos(\\alpha{+}\\beta) + i\\sin(\\alpha{+}\\beta).\n\\end{array}</math></blockquote>In terms of [[Euler's formula]], this simply says <math>e^{i\\alpha} e^{i\\beta} = e^{i(\\alpha+\\beta)}</math>, showing that <math>\\theta\\ \\mapsto\\ e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta</math> is a one-dimensional complex representation of <math>\\mathrm{SO}(2)</math>.\n\n=== Sines and cosines of sums of infinitely many angles ===\nWhen the series <math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i</math> [[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]] then\n: <math> \\sin\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i\\right)\n=\\sum_{\\text{odd}\\ k \\ge 1} (-1)^\\frac{k-1}{2}\n\\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix} A \\subseteq \\{\\,1,2,3,\\dots\\,\\} \\\\ \\left|A\\right| = k\\end{smallmatrix}}\n\\left(\\prod_{i \\in A} \\sin\\theta_i \\prod_{i \\not \\in A} \\cos\\theta_i\\right) </math>\n\n: <math> \\cos\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i\\right)\n=\\sum_{\\text{even}\\ k \\ge 0} ~ (-1)^\\frac{k}{2} ~~\n\\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix} A \\subseteq \\{\\,1,2,3,\\dots\\,\\} \\\\ \\left|A\\right| = k\\end{smallmatrix}}\n\\left(\\prod_{i \\in A} \\sin\\theta_i \\prod_{i \\not \\in A} \\cos\\theta_i\\right) \\,.</math>\n\nBecause the series <math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i</math> converges absolutely, it is necessarily the case that <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\theta_i = 0</math>, <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sin\\,\\theta_i = 0</math>, and <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\cos \\theta_i = 1</math>.  In particular, in these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many angles: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors but there are [[cofiniteness|cofinite]]ly many cosine factors.  Terms with infinitely many sine factors would necessarily be equal to zero.\n\nWhen only finitely many of the angles {{mvar|\u03b8<sub>i</sub>}} are nonzero then only finitely many of the terms on the right side are nonzero because all but finitely many sine factors vanish.

Their usual abbreviations are {{math|sin(''\u03b8'')}}, {{math|cos(''\u03b8'')}} and {{math|tan(''\u03b8'')}}, respectively, where {{mvar|\u03b8}} denotes the angle. The parentheses around the argument of the functions are often omitted, e.g., {{math|sin ''\u03b8''}} and {{math|cos ''\u03b8''}}, if an interpretation is unambiguously possible.\n\nThe sine of an angle is defined, in the context of a [[right triangle]], as the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite to the angle divided by the length of the longest side of the triangle (the [[hypotenuse]]).\n:<math>\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}.</math>\nThe cosine of an angle in this context is the ratio of the length of the side that is adjacent to the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.\n:<math>\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}.</math>\nThe [[tangent function|tangent]] of an angle in this context is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite to the angle divided by the length of the side that is adjacent to the angle. This is the same as the [[ratio]] of the sine to the cosine of this angle, as can be seen by substituting the definitions of {{math|sin}} and {{math|cos}} from above:\n:<math>\\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}=\\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}}.</math>\n\nThe remaining trigonometric functions secant ({{math|sec}}), cosecant ({{math|csc}}), and cotangent ({{math|cot}}) are defined as the [[Trigonometric functions#Cosecant, secant, and cotangent|reciprocal functions]] of cosine, sine, and tangent, respectively. Rarely, these are called the secondary trigonometric functions:\n\n:<math>\\sec\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta},\\quad\\csc\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta},\\quad\\cot\\theta=\\frac{1}{\\tan\\theta}=\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}.</math>\nThese definitions are sometimes referred to as [[Proofs of trigonometric identities#Ratio identities|ratio identities]].\n\n==Inverse functions==\n{{main|Inverse trigonometric functions}}\nThe inverse trigonometric functions are partial [[inverse function]]s for the trigonometric functions. For example, the inverse function for the sine, known as the '''inverse sine''' ({{math|sin<sup>\u22121</sup>}}) or '''arcsine''' ({{math|arcsin}} or {{math|asin}}), satisfies\n:<math>\\sin(\\arcsin x) = x\\quad\\text{for} \\quad |x| \\leq 1 </math>\nand\n:<math>\\arcsin(\\sin x) = x\\quad\\text{for} \\quad |x| \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}. </math>\n\nThis article uses the notation below for inverse trigonometric functions:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

This equation can be solved for either the sine or the cosine:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin\\theta &= \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\theta}, \\\\\n\\cos\\theta &= \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\theta}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the sign depends on the [[Quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]] of {{mvar|\u03b8}}.\n\nDividing this identity by either {{math|sin<sup>2</sup> ''\u03b8''}} or {{math|cos<sup>2</sup> ''\u03b8''}} yields the other two Pythagorean identities:\n\n:<math>1 + \\tan^2\\theta = \\sec^2\\theta\\quad\\text{and}\\quad 1 + \\cot^2\\theta = \\csc^2\\theta.</math>\n\nUsing these identities together with the ratio identities, it is possible to express any trigonometric function in terms of any other ([[up to]] a plus or minus sign):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;text-align:center\"\n|+ Each trigonometric function in terms of each of the other five.<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, p.&nbsp;73, 4.3.45</ref>\n! in terms of\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\sin \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\cos \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\tan \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\csc \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\sec \\theta</math>\n! scope=\"col\" | <math> \\cot \\theta</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\sin \\theta =</math>\n| <math> \\sin \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\tan \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\csc \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sec^2 \\theta - 1}}{\\sec \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\cot^2 \\theta}}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\cos \\theta =</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\theta}</math>\n| <math> \\cos \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{\\csc^2 \\theta - 1}}{\\csc \\theta}</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\sec \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 + \\cot^2 \\theta}}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\tan \\theta =</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta}}{\\cos \\theta}</math>\n| <math> \\tan \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\csc^2 \\theta - 1}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{\\sec^2 \\theta - 1}</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\cot \\theta}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\csc \\theta =</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta}}{\\tan \\theta}</math>\n| <math> \\csc \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sec \\theta}{\\sqrt{\\sec^2 \\theta - 1}}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{1 + \\cot^2 \\theta}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\sec \\theta =</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta}}</math><center>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{1 + \\tan^2 \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\csc \\theta}{\\sqrt{\\csc^2 \\theta - 1}}</math>\n| <math> \\sec \\theta</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{1 + \\cot^2 \\theta}}{\\cot \\theta}</math>\n|-\n! <math> \\cot \\theta =</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta}}{\\sin \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{\\cos \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta}}</math>\n| <math> \\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\sqrt{\\csc^2 \\theta - 1}</math>\n| <math>\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sec^2 \\theta - 1}}</math>\n| <math> \\cot \\theta</math>\n|}\n\n==Historical shorthands==\n[[File:Circle-trig6.svg|300px|right|thumb|All of the trigonometric functions of an angle {{mvar|\u03b8}} can be constructed geometrically in terms of a unit circle centered at&nbsp;''O''.

Some examples of shifts are shown below in the table.\n* A '''full turn''', or {{math|360\u00b0}}, or 2{{pi}} radian leaves the unit circle fixed and is the smallest interval for which the trigonometric functions {{math|sin, cos, sec, and csc}} repeat their values, and is thus their period. Shifting arguments of any periodic function by any integer multiple of a full period preserves the function value of the unshifted argument.\n* A '''half turn''', or {{math|180\u00b0}}, or {{pi}} radian is the period of {{math|tan(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|sin(''x'')|cos(''x'')}} and cot(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|cos(''x'')|sin(''x'')}}}}, as can be seen from these definitions and the period of the defining trigonometric functions. So shifting the arguments of {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} by any multiple of {{pi}}, does not change their function values.\n:For the functions {{math|sin, cos, sec, and csc}} with period 2{{pi}} half a turn is half of their period. For this shift they change the sign of their values, as can be seen from the unit circle again. This new value repeats after any additional shift of 2{{pi}}, so all together they change the sign for a shift by any odd multiple of {{pi}}, i.e., by {{math|(2''k'' + 1)\u22c5{{pi}}}}, with {{mvar|k}} an arbitrary integer. Any even multiple of {{pi}} is of course just a full period, and a backward shift by half a period is the same as a backward shift by one full period plus one shift forward by half a period.\n* A '''quarter turn''', or {{math|90\u00b0}}, or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radian is a half period shift for {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} with period {{math|{{pi}}}} ({{math|180\u00b0}}), and yields the function value of applying the complementary function to the unshifted argument. By the argument above this also holds for a shift by any odd multiple {{math|(2''k'' + 1)\u22c5{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}} of the half period.\n: For the four other trigonometric functions a quarter turn also represents a quarter period. A shift by an arbitrary multiple of a quarter period, that is not covered by a multiple of half periods, can be decomposed in an integer multiple of periods, plus or minus one quarter period. The terms expressing these multiples are {{math|(4''k'' \u00b1 1)\u22c5{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}. The forward/backward shifts by one quarter period are reflected in the table below. Again, these shifts yield function values, employing the respective complementary function applied to the unshifted argument.\n: Shifting the arguments of {{math|tan(''x'')}} and {{math|cot(''x'')}} by their quarter period ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}}) does not yield such simple results.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF\"\n!Shift by one quarter period\n!Shift by one half period<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, p.&nbsp;72, 4.3.9</ref>\n!Shift by full periods<ref>Abramowitz and Stegun, p.&nbsp;72, 4.3.7\u20138</ref>\n!Period\n|-\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\pm\\cos \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sin \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sin(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\sin \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\mp\\sin \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\cos \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cos(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\cos \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}) =  \\tfrac{\\tan \\theta \\pm 1}{1\\mp \\tan \\theta}</math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta + \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = -\\cot \\theta </math>\n|<math>\\tan(\\theta + k\\cdot \\pi) = +\\tan \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\pm\\sec \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\csc \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\csc(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\csc \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = \\mp\\csc \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sec \\theta</math>\n|<math>\\sec(\\theta + k\\cdot 2\\pi) = +\\sec \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>2\\pi</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta \\pm \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}) =  \\tfrac{\\cot \\theta \\pm 1}{1\\mp \\cot \\theta}</math>\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta + \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}) = -\\tan\\theta</math>\n|<math>\\cot(\\theta + k\\cdot \\pi) = +\\cot \\theta</math>\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|<math>\\pi</math>\n|}\n\n==Angle sum and difference identities==\n[[File:AngleAdditionDiagramSine.svg|right|thumb|225px|Illustration of angle addition formulae for the sine and cosine. Emphasized segment is of unit length.]]\n{{see also|#Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities|Small-angle approximation#Angle sum and difference}}\n\nThese are also known as the ''angle addition and subtraction theorems'' (or ''formulae'').\nThe identities can be derived by combining right triangles such as in the adjacent diagram, or by considering the invariance of the length of a chord on a unit circle given a particular central angle. The most intuitive derivation uses rotation matrices (see below).\n\n[[File:AngleAdditionDiagramTangent.svg|right|thumb|225px|Illustration of the angle addition formula for the tangent. Emphasized segments are of unit length.]]\n\nFor acute angles {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{mvar|\u03b2}}, whose sum is non-obtuse, a concise diagram (shown) illustrates the angle sum formulae for sine and cosine: The bold segment labeled \"1\" has unit length and serves as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with angle {{mvar|\u03b2}}; the opposite and adjacent legs for this angle have respective lengths {{math|sin ''\u03b2''}} and {{math|cos ''\u03b2''}}. The {{math|cos ''\u03b2''}} leg is itself the hypotenuse of a right triangle with angle {{mvar|\u03b1}}; that triangle's legs, therefore, have lengths given by {{math|sin ''\u03b1''}} and {{math|cos ''\u03b1''}}, multiplied by {{math|cos ''\u03b2''}}. The {{math|sin ''\u03b2''}} leg, as hypotenuse of another right triangle with angle {{mvar|\u03b1}}, likewise leads to segments of length {{math|cos ''\u03b1'' sin ''\u03b2''}} and {{math|sin ''\u03b1'' sin ''\u03b2''}}. Now, we observe that the \"1\" segment is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle with angle {{math|''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2''}}; the leg opposite this angle necessarily has length {{math|sin(''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2'')}}, while the leg adjacent has length {{math|cos(''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2'')}}. Consequently, as the opposing sides of the diagram's outer rectangle are equal, we deduce\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) &= \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta + \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\\\\n\\cos(\\alpha + \\beta) &= \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta - \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta\n\\end{align}</math>\nRelocating one of the named angles yields a variant of the diagram that demonstrates the angle difference formulae for sine and cosine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trigonography.com/2015/09/28/angle-sum-and-difference-for-sine-and-cosine/|title=Angle Sum and Difference for Sine and Cosine|last=The Trigonographer|date=28 September 2015|website=Trigonography.com|access-date=28 May 2017}}</ref> (The diagram admits further variants to accommodate angles and sums greater than a right angle.)

Furthermore, matrix multiplication of the rotation matrix for an angle {{math|''\u03b1''}} with a column vector will rotate the column vector counterclockwise by the angle {{math|''\u03b1''}}.\n\nSince multiplication by a [[complex number]] of unit length rotates the complex plane by the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of the number, the above multiplication of rotation matrices is equivalent to a multiplication of complex numbers:<blockquote><math>\\begin{array}{rcl}(\\cos\\alpha + i\\sin\\alpha)(\\cos\\beta + i\\sin\\beta) \n&=& (\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\beta-\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\beta)+i(\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\beta+\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\beta)\\\\\n&=& \\cos(\\alpha{+}\\beta) + i\\sin(\\alpha{+}\\beta).\n\\end{array}</math></blockquote>In terms of [[Euler's formula]], this simply says <math>e^{i\\alpha} e^{i\\beta} = e^{i(\\alpha+\\beta)}</math>, showing that <math>\\theta\\ \\mapsto\\ e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta</math> is a one-dimensional complex representation of <math>\\mathrm{SO}(2)</math>.\n\n=== Sines and cosines of sums of infinitely many angles ===\nWhen the series <math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i</math> [[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]] then\n: <math> \\sin\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i\\right)\n=\\sum_{\\text{odd}\\ k \\ge 1} (-1)^\\frac{k-1}{2}\n\\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix} A \\subseteq \\{\\,1,2,3,\\dots\\,\\} \\\\ \\left|A\\right| = k\\end{smallmatrix}}\n\\left(\\prod_{i \\in A} \\sin\\theta_i \\prod_{i \\not \\in A} \\cos\\theta_i\\right) </math>\n\n: <math> \\cos\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i\\right)\n=\\sum_{\\text{even}\\ k \\ge 0} ~ (-1)^\\frac{k}{2} ~~\n\\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix} A \\subseteq \\{\\,1,2,3,\\dots\\,\\} \\\\ \\left|A\\right| = k\\end{smallmatrix}}\n\\left(\\prod_{i \\in A} \\sin\\theta_i \\prod_{i \\not \\in A} \\cos\\theta_i\\right) \\,.</math>\n\nBecause the series <math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\theta_i</math> converges absolutely, it is necessarily the case that <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\theta_i = 0</math>, <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sin\\,\\theta_i = 0</math>, and <math>\\lim_{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\cos \\theta_i = 1</math>.  In particular, in these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many angles: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors but there are [[cofiniteness|cofinite]]ly many cosine factors.  Terms with infinitely many sine factors would necessarily be equal to zero.\n\nWhen only finitely many of the angles {{mvar|\u03b8<sub>i</sub>}} are nonzero then only finitely many of the terms on the right side are nonzero because all but finitely many sine factors vanish.

The first one, Bergen refers to as the \"Poles as arch-antisemite\" theory which sees Poles as participating in the Holocaust. Bergen dismisses this approach by saying that while it may sometimes be \"emotionally satisfying\", it neglects the brutality of the German occupation directed at the Poles themselves. At the other extreme Bergen puts the \"all Poles were victims of the Holocaust\" school of thought, which emphasizes the fact that about as many non-Jewish as Jewish Poles died during the war. This approach argues that Poles \"did all they could (...) under the circumstances\" to help Jews and tends to see Christian Poles as victims as much as Jews. Bergen notes that while this scholarship has produced valuable work regarding the suffering of non-Jewish Poles during the war, it sometimes achieves this by minimizing the suffering of Jews or even repeating some anti-semitic canards. The third interpretation is the \"unequal victims\" theory, which views both Polish gentiles and Jews as victims of Nazi Germany but to a different extent; while equal numbers of each group died, the 3 million non-Jewish Poles comprised 10% of the respective population, but for Polish Jews, the 3 million murdered constituted 80% of the pre-war population. Bergen says that while this view has some validity, too often it ends up engaging in a \"competition in suffering\" and that such a \"numbers game\" does not make moral sense when talking about human agony. In response to these three approaches, Bergen cautions against broad generalizations, she emphasizes the range of experiences and notes that the fates of both groups were inexorably linked in complicated ways.<ref name=\"bergen\">{{Cite book |title=War and Genocide: A Concise History of the Holocaust |last=Bergen |first=Doris L. |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=9780760789063 |pages=118\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===Antisemitism===\nPolish antisemitism had two formative motifs: claims of defilement of the Catholic faith; and [[\u017bydokomuna]] (Jew-communism). During the 1930s, Catholic journals in Poland paralleled western European social-Darwinist antisemitism and the Nazi press. However, church doctrine ruled out violence, which only became more common in the mid-1930s. Unlike German antisemitism, Polish political-ideological antisemites rejected the idea of genocide or pogroms of the Jews, advocating mass emigration instead.{{efn|\"The difficulty of including Poles among the peoples that collaborated with the Nazis in genocide recurs when we examine the attributes of Polish Antisemitism. Polish national history and consciousness bear no memory of a pogromistic anti-Jewish movement. Acts of violence\u2013sometimes severe\u2013were committed against Jews before and after World War I, but, unlike the Russian and Ukrainian cases, they were not indicative of a politically significant mass movement. Furthermore, although violent incidents took place, a pogrom in which a murderously enflamed mob assailed and mauled Jews was foreign to the Polish identity\u2013at least until the events in Kielce in 1946. This last statement is based on the fact that Polish Antisemitism, even during the war, was not murderous in nature and did not speak in terms of outright liquidation except on its outermost fringes. It expressed extreme messages and unequivocal conclusions\u2013the imperative of mass Jewish emigration from Poland\u2013but did not advocate pogroms or genocide.18 However, the antiJewish image persisted in the public national debate and in the resistance in occupied Poland. By 1939, the image of a Polish nation embroiled in grim struggle against the Jewish minority solidified in the Polish national consciousness\u2013a struggle in which anti-Jewish rhetoric, images, and related associations took on the character of existential defense and adopted violence as its legitimate manifestation.\"<ref>''Were These Ordinary Poles?''

The first one, Bergen refers to as the \"Poles as arch-antisemite\" theory which sees Poles as participating in the Holocaust. Bergen dismisses this approach by saying that while it may sometimes be \"emotionally satisfying\", it neglects the brutality of the German occupation directed at the Poles themselves. At the other extreme Bergen puts the \"all Poles were victims of the Holocaust\" school of thought, which emphasizes the fact that about as many non-Jewish as Jewish Poles died during the war. This approach argues that Poles \"did all they could (...) under the circumstances\" to help Jews and tends to see Christian Poles as victims as much as Jews. Bergen notes that while this scholarship has produced valuable work regarding the suffering of non-Jewish Poles during the war, it sometimes achieves this by minimizing the suffering of Jews or even repeating some anti-semitic canards. The third interpretation is the \"unequal victims\" theory, which views both Polish gentiles and Jews as victims of Nazi Germany but to a different extent; while equal numbers of each group died, the 3 million non-Jewish Poles comprised 10% of the respective population, but for Polish Jews, the 3 million murdered constituted 80% of the pre-war population. Bergen says that while this view has some validity, too often it ends up engaging in a \"competition in suffering\" and that such a \"numbers game\" does not make moral sense when talking about human agony. In response to these three approaches, Bergen cautions against broad generalizations, she emphasizes the range of experiences and notes that the fates of both groups were inexorably linked in complicated ways.<ref name=\"bergen\">{{Cite book |title=War and Genocide: A Concise History of the Holocaust |last=Bergen |first=Doris L. |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=9780760789063 |pages=118\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===Antisemitism===\nPolish antisemitism had two formative motifs: claims of defilement of the Catholic faith; and [[\u017bydokomuna]] (Jew-communism). During the 1930s, Catholic journals in Poland paralleled western European social-Darwinist antisemitism and the Nazi press. However, church doctrine ruled out violence, which only became more common in the mid-1930s. Unlike German antisemitism, Polish political-ideological antisemites rejected the idea of genocide or pogroms of the Jews, advocating mass emigration instead.{{efn|\"The difficulty of including Poles among the peoples that collaborated with the Nazis in genocide recurs when we examine the attributes of Polish Antisemitism. Polish national history and consciousness bear no memory of a pogromistic anti-Jewish movement. Acts of violence\u2013sometimes severe\u2013were committed against Jews before and after World War I, but, unlike the Russian and Ukrainian cases, they were not indicative of a politically significant mass movement. Furthermore, although violent incidents took place, a pogrom in which a murderously enflamed mob assailed and mauled Jews was foreign to the Polish identity\u2013at least until the events in Kielce in 1946. This last statement is based on the fact that Polish Antisemitism, even during the war, was not murderous in nature and did not speak in terms of outright liquidation except on its outermost fringes. It expressed extreme messages and unequivocal conclusions\u2013the imperative of mass Jewish emigration from Poland\u2013but did not advocate pogroms or genocide.18 However, the antiJewish image persisted in the public national debate and in the resistance in occupied Poland. By 1939, the image of a Polish nation embroiled in grim struggle against the Jewish minority solidified in the Polish national consciousness\u2013a struggle in which anti-Jewish rhetoric, images, and related associations took on the character of existential defense and adopted violence as its legitimate manifestation.\"<ref>''Were These Ordinary Poles?''

[[New York City]], west of [[Midtown Manhattan]]. It is traditionally considered to be bordered by [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] to the south, [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]] to the north, [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] to the east, and the [[Hudson River]] to the west.\n\nUntil the 1970s, Hell's Kitchen was a bastion of poor and working-class [[Irish Americans]]. Though its gritty reputation had long held real-estate prices below those of most other areas of Manhattan, by 1969, the City Planning Commission's ''Plan for New York City'' reported that development pressures related to its Midtown location were driving people of modest means from the area. Since the early 1990s, the area has been [[Gentrification|gentrifying]], and rents have risen rapidly. Located close to both [[Broadway theatre]]s and the [[Actors Studio]] training school, Hell's Kitchen has long been a home to learning and practicing actors.\n\nHell's Kitchen is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 4|Manhattan Community District 4]].<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\"/> It is patrolled by the 10th and 18th Precincts of the [[New York City Police Department]]. The area provides transport, medical, and warehouse-infrastructure support to the business district of Manhattan. It is also known for its extensive selection of multiethnic, small, and relatively inexpensive restaurants, bars, and associated nightlife.\n\n==Boundaries==\n[[File:Hell's Kitchen NYC-Map.png|thumb|left|General map of the Hell's Kitchen area, including the northern part of [[Hudson Yards (neighborhood), Manhattan|Hudson Yards]] to the south, but excluding the [[Columbus Circle]] transition area to the north]]\nThe name \"Hell's Kitchen\" generally refers to the area from [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th]] to [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Streets]]. Starting west of [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] and the north side of 43rd Street, city zoning regulations generally limit buildings to six stories. As a result, most of the buildings are older, and are often [[wikt:walk-up|walk-up]] [[apartment]]s. For the most part, the neighborhood encompasses the [[ZIP Code]]s 10019 and 10036. The post office for 10019 is called Radio City Station, the original name for [[Rockefeller Center]] on [[Sixth Avenue]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\">Benson, Michael R.

Accessed February 17, 2008. \"Hell's Kitchen, which stretched from 40th to 59th Streets and from Eighth Avenue to the Hudson, is now called Clinton. The modern district reaches south to 34th Street.\"</ref>\n\nThe neighborhood overlaps [[Times Square]] and the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] to the east at Eighth Avenue. On its southeast border, it overlaps the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] also on Eighth Avenue. Two landmarks are located here \u2013 the [[New Yorker Hotel]] at 481 Eighth Avenue, and the [[Manhattan Center]] building at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Eighth Avenue. Included in the transition area on Eighth Avenue are the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], the Pride of Midtown fire station (from which an entire shift, 15 firefighters, died at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]), several theatres including [[Studio 54]], the original soup stand of ''[[Seinfeld]]''{{-'}}s \"[[The Soup Nazi]]\"' and the [[Hearst Tower (Manhattan)|Hearst Tower]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\" />\n\nThe northern edge of Hell's Kitchen borders the southern edge of the [[Upper West Side]], though the section north of Ninth Avenue and east of [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] is also part of the [[Columbus Circle]] neighborhood. 57th Street was traditionally the boundary between the Upper West Side and Hell's Kitchen, but another interpretation puts the northern border at 59th Street, where the names of the north\u2013south avenues change. Included between 57th and 59th Streets the [[Time Warner Center]] at Columbus Circle; [[Hudson Hotel]]; [[Mount Sinai West (hospital)|Mount Sinai West]], where [[John Lennon]] died in 1980 after being shot; and [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice|John Jay College]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\" />\n\nThe southern boundary is at [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] and [[Hudson Yards (neighborhood), Manhattan|Hudson Yards]]. Hudson Yards overlaps with both Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea, and the areas are often lumped together as \"West Midtown\", given their role in surrounding the [[Midtown Manhattan]] business district. The traditional dividing line is 34th Street. The transition area just north of [[Madison Square Garden]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] includes the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\" />\n\nThe western border of the neighborhood is the [[Hudson River]] at the [[Hudson River Park]] and [[West Side Highway]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Name}} Etymology==\n[[File:Eighth Avenue 46th Street jeh.JPG|thumb|Looking south from Eighth Avenue and [[46th Street (Manhattan)|46th Street]]]]\n[[File:Ninth-north.jpg|thumb|View from between 47th and 48th Streets on [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenue]] looking northeast toward [[Time Warner Center]] and [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]]]]\nSeveral explanations exist for the original name. An early use of the phrase appears in a comment [[Davy Crockett]] made about another notorious Irish slum in Manhattan, [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]]. According to the Irish Cultural Society of the Garden City Area:\n\n{{Quote|When, in 1835, Davy Crockett said, \"In my part of the country, when you meet an Irishman, you find a first-rate gentleman; but these are worse than savages; they are too mean to swab hell's kitchen.\" He was referring to the Five Points.<ref name=\"5 Points\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-society.org/home/hedgemaster-archives-2/places-artifacts/the-five-points|title=The Five Points|last=Walsh|first=John|date=September 1994|publisher= Irish Cultural Society of the Garden City Area|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to an article by Kirkley Greenwell, published online by the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association:\n\n{{Quote|No one can pin down the exact origin of the label, but some refer to a [[tenement]] on [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] as the first \"Hell's Kitchen.\" Another explanation points to an infamous building at 39th as the true original.

He referred to a particularly infamous tenement at 39th Street and [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth Avenue]] as \"Hell's Kitchen\" and said that the entire section was \"probably the lowest and filthiest in the city.\" According to this version, 39th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues became known as Hell's Kitchen and the name was later expanded to the surrounding streets. Another version ascribes the name's origins to a German restaurant in the area known as Heil's Kitchen, after its proprietors.<ref>Lambert, Bruce.

Accessed March 31, 2017. \"Among the theories on the name is that it derived from a restaurant called Heil's Kitchen.\"</ref> But the most common version traces it to the story of \"Dutch Fred the Cop\", a veteran policeman, who with his rookie partner, was watching a small riot on West 39th Street near Tenth Avenue. The rookie is supposed to have said, \"This place is hell itself\", to which Fred replied, \"Hell's a mild climate. This is Hell's Kitchen.\"<ref name=\"hells-kitchen-park\"/>}}\n\nThe 1929 book ''Manna-Hatin: The Story of New York'' states that the [[Panic of 1857]] led to gangs formed \"in the notorious '[[Gas House District]]' at Twenty-First Street and the East River, or in 'Hell's Kitchen', in the West Thirties.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=Bank of the Manhattan Company | author2=Brearley Service Organization | title=\"Manna-hatin\": the story of New York | publisher=[[The Manhattan Company]] | series=Henry Ford Estate collection | year=1929 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wwMAAAAYAAJ | access-date=October 16, 2018 | page=160}}</ref>\n\nHell's Kitchen has become the most frequently used name of the neighborhood, even though real estate developers have offered alternatives of \"Clinton\" and \"Midtown West\", or even \"the Mid-West\". The \"Clinton\" name, used by the municipality of New York City, originated in 1959 in an attempt to link the area to [[DeWitt Clinton Park]] at 52nd and [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Eleventh Avenue]], named after the 19th century [[DeWitt Clinton|New York governor]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/realestate/a-place-of-contrasts-and-even-an-alias-living-in-hells-kitchen-north.html|title=A Place of Contrasts, and Even an Alias \u2013 Living In {{!}} Hell's Kitchen North|last=Gill|first=John Freeman|date=September 23, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 31, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and development===\n{{redirect|Great Kill|the neighborhood in Staten Island|Great Kills, Staten Island}}\n[[File:West-side-ship.jpg|thumb|[[Manhattan Cruise Terminal]] in Hell's Kitchen at 52nd Street|left]]\n\nOn the island of Manhattan as it was when Europeans first saw it, the Great [[Kill (body of water)|Kill]] formed from three small streams that united near present-day Tenth Avenue and 40th Street, and then wound through the low-lying Reed Valley, renowned for fish and waterfowl,<ref>[[Gerard T.

One of the Hopper farmhouses, built in 1752 for John Hopper the younger, stood near [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] and Eleventh Avenue; christened \"Rosevale\" for its extensive gardens, it was the home of the War of 1812 veteran, Gen.

Irish immigrants&nbsp;\u2013 mostly refugees from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]&nbsp;\u2013 found work on the docks and railroad along the [[Hudson River]] and established [[shanty town|shantytowns]] there.\n\n[[File:782 8th Ave NYC 1915 where Elsie Sigel was murdered.jpg|thumb|Mission House, Hell's Kitchen, c.&nbsp;1915]]\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], there was an influx of people who moved to New York City. The tenements that were built became overcrowded quickly. Many who lived in this congested, poverty-stricken area turned to gang life. Following [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], implemented in 1919, the district's many warehouses were ideal locations for bootleg distilleries for the [[rum-running|rumrunners]] who controlled illicit liquor. At the start of the 20th century, the neighborhood was controlled by gangs, including the violent [[Gopher Gang]] led by One Lung Curran and later by [[Owney Madden]].<ref>Bayor, Ronald H. and Meagher, Timothy J.

It became known as the \"most dangerous area on the American Continent\".\n\nAfter the [[repeal of Prohibition]], many of the organized crime elements moved into other rackets, such as illegal gambling and union shakedowns. The postwar era was characterized by a flourishing waterfront, and longshoreman work was plentiful. By the end of the 1950s, however, the implementation of [[containerization|containerized]] shipping led to the decline of the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] piers and many longshoremen found themselves out of work. In addition, construction of the [[Lincoln Tunnel]], Lincoln Tunnel access roads, and the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] and ramps destroyed much of Hell's Kitchen south of 41st Street.<ref>English, T.J.

By 1965, Hell's Kitchen was the home base of the [[Westies]], an [[Irish mob]] aligned with the [[Gambino crime family]]. It was not until the early 1980s that widespread [[gentrification]] began to alter the demographics of the longtime working-class [[Irish American]] neighborhood. The 1980s also saw an end to the Westies' reign of terror, when the gang lost all of its power after the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] convictions of most of its principals in 1986.\n\n===First wave of gentrification===\n\n====Special Clinton zoning district====\n\n[[File:NYC-play-pen.jpg|thumb|Eighth Avenue was once lined with porn stores and theaters.

R-7 density, 6-story height limit on new buildings, suggested average apartment size of two bedrooms (this was a response to the fact that between 1960 and 1970 developers had torn down 2,300 family-sized units and replaced them with 1,500 smaller units).\n* '''Perimeter Area:''' Eighth Avenue, 42nd and 57th Streets.

Later combined with \"Mixed Use Area\"\n\nSpecial permits are required for all demolition and construction in the SCD, including demolition of \"any sound housing in the District\" and any rehabilitation that increases the number of dwellings in a structure. In the original provisions. no building could be demolished unless it was unsound. New developments, conversions, or alterations that create new units or zero bedroom units must contain at least 20% two bedroom apartments with a minimum room size of {{convert|168|sqft|m2|0}}. Alterations that reduce the percentage of two-bedroom units are not permitted unless the resulting building meets the 20% two-bedroom requirement.

[[New York City]], west of [[Midtown Manhattan]]. It is traditionally considered to be bordered by [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] to the south, [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]] to the north, [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] to the east, and the [[Hudson River]] to the west.\n\nUntil the 1970s, Hell's Kitchen was a bastion of poor and working class [[Irish Americans]]. Though its gritty reputation had long held real-estate prices below those of most other areas of Manhattan, by 1969, the City Planning Commission's ''Plan for New York City'' reported that development pressures related to its Midtown location were driving people of modest means from the area. Since the early 1990s, the area has been [[Gentrification|gentrifying]], and rents have risen rapidly. Located close to both [[Broadway theatre]]s and the [[Actors Studio]] training school, Hell's Kitchen has long been a home to learning and practicing actors.\n\nHell's Kitchen is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 4|Manhattan Community District 4]].<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\"/> It is patrolled by the 10th and 18th Precincts of the [[New York City Police Department]]. The area provides transport, medical, and warehouse-infrastructure support to the business district of Manhattan. It is also known for its extensive selection of multi-ethnic, small, and relatively inexpensive restaurants, bars, and associated nightlife.\n\n==Boundaries==\n[[File:Hell's Kitchen NYC-Map.png|thumb|left|General map of the Hell's Kitchen area, including the northern part of [[Hudson Yards (neighborhood), Manhattan|Hudson Yards]] to the south, but excluding the [[Columbus Circle]] transition area to the north]]\nThe name \"Hell's Kitchen\" generally refers to the area from [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th]] to [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Streets]]. Starting west of [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] and the north side of 43rd Street, city zoning regulations generally limit buildings to six stories. As a result, most of the buildings are older, and are often [[wikt:walk-up|walk-up]] [[apartment]]s. For the most part, the neighborhood encompasses the [[ZIP Code]]s 10019 and 10036. The post office for 10019 is called Radio City Station, the original name for [[Rockefeller Center]] on [[Sixth Avenue]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\">Benson, Michael R.

On its southeast border, it overlaps the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] also on Eighth Avenue. Two landmarks are located here \u2013 the [[New Yorker Hotel]] at 481 Eighth Avenue, and the [[Manhattan Center]] building at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Eighth Avenue. Included in the transition area on Eighth Avenue are the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], the Pride of Midtown fire station (from which an entire shift, 15 firefighters, died at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]), several theatres including [[Studio 54]], the original soup stand of ''[[Seinfeld]]''{{-'}}s \"[[The Soup Nazi]]\"' and the [[Hearst Tower (Manhattan)|Hearst Tower]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\" />\n\nThe northern edge of Hell's Kitchen borders the southern edge of the [[Upper West Side]], though the section north of Ninth Avenue and east of [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] is also part of the [[Columbus Circle]] neighborhood. 57th Street was traditionally the boundary between the Upper West Side and Hell's Kitchen, but another interpretation puts the northern border at 59th Street, where the names of the north\u2013south avenues change. Included between 57th and 59th Streets the [[Time Warner Center]] at Columbus Circle; [[Hudson Hotel]]; [[Mount Sinai West (hospital)|Mount Sinai West]], where [[John Lennon]] died in 1980 after being shot; and [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice|John Jay College]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\" />\n\nThe southern boundary is at [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] and [[Hudson Yards (neighborhood), Manhattan|Hudson Yards]]. Hudson Yards overlaps with both Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea, and the areas are often lumped together as \"West Midtown\", given their role in surrounding the [[Midtown Manhattan]] business district. The traditional dividing line is 34th Street. The transition area just north of [[Madison Square Garden]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] includes the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\" />\n\nThe western border of the neighborhood is the [[Hudson River]] at the [[Hudson River Park]] and [[West Side Highway]].<ref name=\"nyt19851222\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Name}} Etymology==\n[[File:Eighth Avenue 46th Street jeh.JPG|thumb|Looking south from Eighth Avenue and [[46th Street (Manhattan)|46th Street]]]]\n[[File:Ninth-north.jpg|thumb|View from between 47th and 48th Streets on [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenue]] looking northeast toward [[Time Warner Center]] and [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]]]]\nSeveral explanations exist for the original name. An early use of the phrase appears in a comment [[Davy Crockett]] made about another notorious Irish slum in Manhattan, [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]]. According to the Irish Cultural Society of the Garden City Area:\n\n{{Quote|When, in 1835, Davy Crockett said, \"In my part of the country, when you meet an Irishman, you find a first-rate gentleman; but these are worse than savages; they are too mean to swab hell's kitchen.\" He was referring to the Five Points.<ref name=\"5 Points\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-society.org/home/hedgemaster-archives-2/places-artifacts/the-five-points|title=The Five Points|last=Walsh|first=John|date=September 1994|publisher= Irish Cultural Society of the Garden City Area|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to an article by Kirkley Greenwell, published online by the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association:\n\n{{Quote|No one can pin down the exact origin of the label, but some refer to a [[tenement]] on [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] as the first \"Hell's Kitchen.\" Another explanation points to an infamous building at 39th as the true original.

He referred to a particularly infamous tenement at 39th Street and [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth Avenue]] as \"Hell's Kitchen\" and said that the entire section was \"probably the lowest and filthiest in the city.\" According to this version, 39th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues became known as Hell's Kitchen and the name was later expanded to the surrounding streets. Another version ascribes the name's origins to a German restaurant in the area known as Heil's Kitchen, after its proprietors.<ref>Lambert, Bruce.

Irish immigrants&nbsp;\u2013 mostly refugees from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]&nbsp;\u2013 found work on the docks and railroad along the [[Hudson River]] and established [[shanty town|shantytowns]] there.\n\n[[File:782 8th Ave NYC 1915 where Elsie Sigel was murdered.jpg|thumb|Mission House, Hell's Kitchen, c.&nbsp;1915]]\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], there was an influx of people who moved to New York City. The tenements that were built became overcrowded quickly. Many who lived in this congested, poverty-stricken area turned to gang life. Following [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], implemented in 1919, the district's many warehouses were ideal locations for bootleg distilleries for the [[rum-running|rumrunners]] who controlled illicit liquor. At the start of the 20th century, the neighborhood was controlled by gangs, including the violent [[Gopher Gang]] led by One Lung Curran and later by [[Owney Madden]].<ref>Bayor, Ronald H. and Meagher, Timothy J.

It became known as the \"most dangerous area on the American Continent\".\n\nAfter the [[repeal of Prohibition]], many of the organized crime elements moved into other rackets, such as illegal gambling and union shakedowns. The postwar era was characterized by a flourishing waterfront, and longshoreman work was plentiful. By the end of the 1950s, however, the implementation of [[containerization|containerized]] shipping led to the decline of the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] piers and many longshoremen found themselves out of work. In addition, construction of the [[Lincoln Tunnel]], Lincoln Tunnel access roads, and the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] and ramps destroyed much of Hell's Kitchen south of 41st Street.<ref>English, T.J.

By 1965, Hell's Kitchen was the home base of the [[Westies]], an [[Irish mob]] aligned with the [[Gambino crime family]]. It was not until the early 1980s that widespread [[gentrification]] began to alter the demographics of the longtime working-class [[Irish American]] neighborhood. The 1980s also saw an end to the Westies' reign of terror, when the gang lost all of its power after the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] convictions of most of its principals in 1986.\n\n===First wave of gentrification===\n\n====Special Clinton zoning district====\n\n[[File:NYC-play-pen.jpg|thumb|Eighth Avenue was once lined with porn stores and theaters.

In the original provisions. no building could be demolished unless it was unsound. New developments, conversions, or alterations that create new units or zero bedroom units must contain at least 20% two bedroom apartments with a minimum room size of {{convert|168|sqft|m2|0}}. Alterations that reduce the percentage of two-bedroom units are not permitted unless the resulting building meets the 20% two-bedroom requirement.

This is the main room of the temple which contains a ''shivling'' or ''pindi'' at its centre. Later, in the mid 18th century, Sardar Sambhaji Angre and Sankhoji Angre built a '''Mandap''' in front of the gabhara. This mandap consisted of four huge wooden pillars bearing beautiful carvings all over them. They also built a '''Pradakshina Marg''' around the gabhara. The entire area was enclosed with walls to form a small temple consisting of the gabhara, the mandap and pradakshina Marg. The entire temple building covers an area of 4,025 sq ft.

The eastern gate was built by making a way or ''Ghati'' by cutting a small hill adjoining the temple on the eastern side. He also built the main entrance or the '''Mukhya Pravesh Dwar''' for the temple. A huge bell hangs on the eastern gate which has year 1791 engraved on it.
