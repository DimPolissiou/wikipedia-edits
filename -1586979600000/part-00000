The first case was identified on 9 March,<ref name=\"firstcase\"/> and transmission within the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 24 March.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> As of 15 April, there have been 228 cases identified in the Bailiwick, all in Guernsey,{{refn|group=note|'Guernsey' refers to the entire jurisdiction of Guernsey, which includes the island of Guernsey as well as the three inhabited islands of [[Herm]], [[Jethou]] and [[Lihou]].}} and 8 people are confirmed to have died from the infection.{{refn|group=note|The States of Guernsey has also recorded (separately) 3 'presumptive' deaths presumed to be due to COVID-19.}}\n\nThe [[States of Guernsey]] response is led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA), a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island, chaired by [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey#List of heads of government of Guernsey|Chief Minister]] [[Gavin St Pier]]. Early response measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close. Several further emergency regulations have been enacted by the CCA to address the various challenges presented by the pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation or postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), and fears of supply shortages have resulted in [[panic buying]].

A part of the tower is visible on the right.]]\n[[Image:Montesantangelo0002.jpg|thumb|The octagonal tower (campanile) of the Sanctuary of San Michele Arcangelo.]]\n[[File:Puglia MonteSAngelo3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint Michael overlooking the entrance of the Sanctuary.]]\n\nThe '''Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano''' is a Catholic sanctuary  on Mount [[Gargano]], [[Italy]], part of the commune of [[Monte Sant'Angelo]], in the [[province of Foggia]], northern [[Apulia]].\n\nIt is the oldest shrine in [[Western Europe]] dedicated to the [[Michael (archangel)|archangel Michael]] and has been an important pilgrimage site since the early Middle Ages. The historic site and its environs are protected by the [[Gargano|Parco Nazionale del Gargano]].\n\nIn 2011, it became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] as part of a group of seven inscribed as [[Longobards in Italy: Places of Power (568-774 A.D.)]].\n\n==Legendary history==\nThe earliest account of the foundation of the Sanctuary is a composite Latin hagiographical text known as ''[[Liber de apparitione Sancti Michaelis|Liber de apparitione Sancti Michaelis in Monte Gargano]]'' (''[[Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina]]'' 5948).<ref>Ed. by G. Waitz in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum (Havover 1898), pp. 541-43; reprinted, with an English translation, in Richard F. Johnson, ''Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 110-15.</ref>\n\nThere are three sections to the legend, recording three apparitions by Michael: the first and third sections appear to be part of the same narrative, while the second is possibly the account of a battle half a century later. According to the first and last parts of the legend, around the year 490 the Archangel Michael appeared several times to the Bishop of [[Siponto|Sipontum]] near a cave in the mountains, instructing that the cave be dedicated to Christian worship and promising protection of the nearby town of Sipontum from pagan invaders. These apparitions are also the first appearances of Saint Michael in western Europe.\n\nThe second section of the text describes Michael's intercession on behalf of the Sipontans and the Beneventans against invading pagan Neapolitans. On the eve of the battle, Michael appears with flaming sword atop the mountain; the Sipontans and Beneventans are victorious. Giorgio Otranto<ref>Otranto, Giorgio. \"'Il Liber de Apparitione,' il santuario di san Michele sul Gargano e i Longobardi del Ducato di Benevento.\" In ''Santuari e politica nel mondo antico'', 210-245. Milan: 1983.</ref> identifies this battle as the one recorded in Book 4 of [[Paul the Deacon|Paul the Deacon's]] ''[[History of the Lombards]]'',<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardi. In ''Monumenta Germanica Historica: Scriptores Rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum''. Edited by Ludwig Bethmann and Georg Waitz. Hanover, 1878.</ref> which describes the defense of Mount Gargano against unidentified 'Greeks'\u2013 possibly Byzantine Greeks\u2013 by the Lombard Duke of Benevento, [[Grimoald, King of the Lombards|Grimoald I]], on May 8, 663.\n\nIn commemoration of this victory, the church of Sipontum instituted a special feast on May 8 honoring the Archangel, which then spread throughout the Catholic Church throughout the 9th century. Since the time of [[Pius V]] it has been formalized as ''Apparitio Sancti Michaelis'', although it originally did not commemorate the apparition, but the victory of the Lombards over invading Greeks.\n\nPope [[Gelasius I]] (reigned 492-496) directed that a [[basilica]] be erected enclosing the space. The '''Basilica di San Giovanni in Tumba''' is the final resting-place of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Rothari]] (died 652); the designation \"tumba\" is now applied to the cupola on [[squinches]].<ref>\"La Tomba di Rotari \u00e8 un battistero del XII secolo con copertura a cupola (o Tumba).\" [http://www.matinum.info/public/content/view/66/105/lang,it/]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nAfter the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] (535-554), Byzantium lacked the power to maintain its holdings in Italy and the Lombards successfully conquered southern Italy by the end of the 6th century. Grimoald I controlled the area as Duke of Benevento from 647-662; when he became King of the Lombards in 662 he passed on the region to his son, [[Romuald I of Benevento|Romuald I]], who renovated the sanctuary and encouraged its use as a pilgrimage site.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Monte Sant'Angelo, 1965) - BEIC 6366186.jpg|thumb|The [[Saint Michael the Archangel|Saint Michael Archangel]] grotto in 1965. Photo [[Paolo Monti]]]]\n\nThe complex of buildings consists of the Battistero di San Giovanni in Tumba, damaged in 1942, and the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. The [[baptistery]] presents a rectangular storey on which rests an octagon supporting an elliptical section and a high drum that supports the cupola. The church erected in the eleventh century by Archbishop Leone stands upon the remains of an ancient [[necropolis]]. A few remnants attest to its once-rich [[fresco]] decoration.\n\nThe Castello was enlarged by the [[Normans]] upon an episcopal residence of [[Orso, Bishop of Benevento]], to provide a suitable seat for the ''Honor Montis Sancti Angeli'', further modified by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].<ref>[http://www.finpress.it/monte-sant-angelo/itinerari-monte-sant-angelo.php Itinerari turistici Monte Sant' Angelo - Gargano<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224002139/http://www.finpress.it/monte-sant-angelo/itinerari-monte-sant-angelo.php |date=2007-02-24 }}</ref> The massive, octagonal [[campanile]] was built in the late 13th century by Frederick II as a watchtower. It was turned into a bell tower by [[Charles I of Anjou]].\n\nBehind a forecourt the sanctuary presents a portico of two Gothic arches, the right one of 1395 by the local architect Simone, the left one a reconstruction of 1865. From the portico steps lead down to the low arched nave. The cavern can be accessed from a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] portal, called the   ''Portale del Toro'' (\"Gate of the Bull\"): the doors, in bronze, were made in Constantinople in 1076, the donation of an [[Amalfi]]tan noble. They are divided in 24 panels portraying episodes of angels from the Old and New Testaments.\n\nThe archaic cavern opening to the left, with its holy well, is full of [[votive offering]]s, especially the 12th century marble bishop's throne supported on crouching lions.<ref>The votive offerings have been studied in Giovanni Battista Bronzini, ''Ex voto e Santuari in Puglia: 1. Il Gargano'' (Florence:Olschki) 1993.</ref> Among the ''ex voto'' objects is a statue of the Archangel by [[Andrea Sansovino]].\n\n==Pilgrimages==\nMonte Sant'Angelo was a popular pilgrimage site on the way the way to Jerusalem; pilgrims travelled from as far as the British Isles to visit the \u201cCelestial Basilica\u201d.

The historic site and its environs are protected by the [[Gargano|Parco Nazionale del Gargano]].\n\nIn 2011, it became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] as part of a group of seven inscribed as [[Longobards in Italy: Places of Power (568-774 A.D.)]].\n\n==Legendary history==\nThe earliest account of the foundation of the Sanctuary is a composite Latin hagiographical text known as ''[[Liber de apparitione Sancti Michaelis|Liber de apparitione Sancti Michaelis in Monte Gargano]]'' (''[[Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina]]'' 5948).<ref>Ed. by G. Waitz in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum (Havover 1898), pp. 541-43; reprinted, with an English translation, in Richard F. Johnson, ''Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 110-15.</ref>\n\nThere are three sections to the legend, recording three apparitions by Michael: the first and third sections appear to be part of the same narrative, while the second is possibly the account of a battle half a century later. According to the first and last parts of the legend, around the year 490 the Archangel Michael appeared several times to the Bishop of [[Siponto|Sipontum]] near a cave in the mountains, instructing that the cave be dedicated to Christian worship and promising protection of the nearby town of Sipontum from pagan invaders. These apparitions are also the first appearances of Saint Michael in western Europe.\n\nThe second section of the text describes Michael's intercession on behalf of the Sipontans and the Beneventans against invading pagan Neapolitans. On the eve of the battle, Michael appears with flaming sword atop the mountain; the Sipontans and Beneventans are victorious. Giorgio Otranto<ref>Otranto, Giorgio. \"'Il Liber de Apparitione,' il santuario di san Michele sul Gargano e i Longobardi del Ducato di Benevento.\" In ''Santuari e politica nel mondo antico'', 210-245. Milan: 1983.</ref> identifies this battle as the one recorded in Book 4 of [[Paul the Deacon|Paul the Deacon's]] ''[[History of the Lombards]]'',<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardi. In ''Monumenta Germanica Historica: Scriptores Rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum''. Edited by Ludwig Bethmann and Georg Waitz. Hanover, 1878.</ref> which describes the defense of Mount Gargano against unidentified 'Greeks'\u2013 possibly Byzantine Greeks\u2013 by the Lombard Duke of Benevento, [[Grimoald, King of the Lombards|Grimoald I]], on May 8, 663.\n\nIn commemoration of this victory, the church of Sipontum instituted a special feast on May 8 honoring the Archangel, which then spread throughout the Catholic Church throughout the 9th century. Since the time of [[Pius V]] it has been formalized as ''Apparitio Sancti Michaelis'', although it originally did not commemorate the apparition, but the victory of the Lombards over invading Greeks.\n\nPope [[Gelasius I]] (reigned 492-496) directed that a [[basilica]] be erected enclosing the space. The '''Basilica di San Giovanni in Tumba''' is the final resting-place of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Rothari]] (died 652); the designation \"tumba\" is now applied to the cupola on [[squinches]].<ref>\"La Tomba di Rotari \u00e8 un battistero del XII secolo con copertura a cupola (o Tumba).\" [http://www.matinum.info/public/content/view/66/105/lang,it/]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nAfter the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] (535-554), Byzantium lacked the power to maintain its holdings in Italy and the Lombards successfully conquered southern Italy by the end of the 6th century. Grimoald I controlled the area as Duke of Benevento from 647-662; when he became King of the Lombards in 662 he passed on the region to his son, [[Romuald I of Benevento|Romuald I]], who renovated the sanctuary and encouraged its use as a pilgrimage site.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Monte Sant'Angelo, 1965) - BEIC 6366186.jpg|thumb|The [[Saint Michael the Archangel|Saint Michael Archangel]] grotto in 1965. Photo [[Paolo Monti]]]]\n\nThe complex of buildings consists of the Battistero di San Giovanni in Tumba, damaged in 1942, and the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. The [[baptistery]] presents a rectangular storey on which rests an octagon supporting an elliptical section and a high drum that supports the cupola. The church erected in the eleventh century by Archbishop Leone stands upon the remains of an ancient [[necropolis]]. A few remnants attest to its once-rich [[fresco]] decoration.\n\nThe Castello was enlarged by the [[Normans]] upon an episcopal residence of [[Orso, Bishop of Benevento]], to provide a suitable seat for the ''Honor Montis Sancti Angeli'', further modified by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].<ref>[http://www.finpress.it/monte-sant-angelo/itinerari-monte-sant-angelo.php Itinerari turistici Monte Sant' Angelo - Gargano<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224002139/http://www.finpress.it/monte-sant-angelo/itinerari-monte-sant-angelo.php |date=2007-02-24 }}</ref> The massive, octagonal [[campanile]] was built in the late 13th century by Frederick II as a watchtower. It was turned into a bell tower by [[Charles I of Anjou]].\n\nBehind a forecourt the sanctuary presents a portico of two Gothic arches, the right one of 1395 by the local architect Simone, the left one a reconstruction of 1865. From the portico steps lead down to the low arched nave. The cavern can be accessed from a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] portal, called the   ''Portale del Toro'' (\"Gate of the Bull\"): the doors, in bronze, were made in Constantinople in 1076, the donation of an [[Amalfi]]tan noble. They are divided in 24 panels portraying episodes of angels from the Old and New Testaments.\n\nThe archaic cavern opening to the left, with its holy well, is full of [[votive offering]]s, especially the 12th century marble bishop's throne supported on crouching lions.<ref>The votive offerings have been studied in Giovanni Battista Bronzini, ''Ex voto e Santuari in Puglia: 1. Il Gargano'' (Florence:Olschki) 1993.</ref> Among the ''ex voto'' objects is a statue of the Archangel by [[Andrea Sansovino]].\n\n==Pilgrimages==\nMonte Sant'Angelo was a popular pilgrimage site on the way the way to Jerusalem; pilgrims travelled from as far as the British Isles to visit the \u201cCelestial Basilica\u201d.
