{"title_page": "Byzantine law", "text_new": "{{Byzantine culture}}\n\n'''Byzantine law''' was essentially a continuation of [[Roman law]] with increased [[Christianity|Christian]] influence. Most sources define ''Byzantine law'' as the Roman legal traditions starting after the reign of [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century and ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the 15th century.\n\nThough during and after the [[European Renaissance]] Western legal practices were heavily influenced by ''[[Justinian's Code]]'' (the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'') and Roman law during classical times,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://globalconnections.champlain.edu/2015/04/17/the-justinian-code-and-its-influence/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404223403/http://globalconnections.champlain.edu/2015/04/17/the-justinian-code-and-its-influence/ |archive-date=2018-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Byzantine law nevertheless had substantial influence on Western traditions during the [[Middle Ages]] and after.\n\nThe most important work of Byzantine law was the [[Ecloga]], issued by [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], the first major Roman-Byzantine legal code issued in Greek rather than Latin. Soon after the ''Farmer's Law'' was established regulating legal standards outside the cities. While the Ecloga was influential throughout the Mediterranean (and Europe) because of the importance of Constantinople as a trading center, the Farmer's Law was a seminal influence on Slavic legal traditions including [[Law of Russia|those of Russia]].\n\n==Influences and sources==\nByzantium inherited its main political, cultural and social institutions from Rome. Similarly, Roman law constituted the basis for the Byzantine legal system. For many centuries, the two great codifications of Roman law carried out by [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I|Justinian]] respectively, were the cornerstones of Byzantine legislation. Of course, over the years these Roman codes were adjusted to the current circumstances and then replaced by new codifications, written in Greek. However, the influence of Roman law persisted, and it is obvious in codifications, such as ''[[Basilika]]'', which was based on ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. In the 11th century, [[Michael Psellos]] prides himself for being acquainted with the Roman legal legacy (\"\u1f38\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\").<ref>A. Cameron, ''The Byzantines'', p. 153; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', p. 397.</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the late Roman legal tradition, the main source of law (''fons legum'') in Byzantium remained the enactments of the emperors. The latter initiated some major codifications of the Roman law, but they also issued their own \"new laws\", the ''Novels'' (\"Novellae\", \"\u039d\u03b5\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76\"). In early Byzantine (late Roman) era the legislative interest of the emperors intensified, and laws were now regulating the main aspects of public, private, economic and social life.<ref>M.T. F\u00f6gen, \"Legislation in Byzantium\", pp. 53&ndash;54; R. Morris, \"Dispute Settlement\", 126; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', pp. 399&ndash;400.</ref> For example, [[Constantine I]] was the first to regulate divorce and Theodosius I intervened in faith issues, imposing a specific version of the [[Apostles' Creed|Creed]].<ref>M.T. F\u00f6gen, \"Legislation in Byzantium\", pp. 56, 59.</ref> From [[Diocletian]] to [[Theodosius I]], namely during approximately 100 years, more than 2,000 laws were issued. Justinian alone promulgated approximately 600 laws. Gradually, the legislative enthusiasm receded, but still some of the laws of later emperors, such as [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]]'s ''Novels'', are of particular importance.<ref>A. Cameron, ''The Byzantines'', p. 153; M.T. F\u00f6gen, \"Legislation in Byzantium\", pp. 53&ndash;54.</ref> The custom continued to play a limited role as a secondary source of law, but written legislation had a precedence.<ref>R. Morris, \"Dispute Settlement\", 126; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', pp. 401&ndash;402.</ref>\n\n== Early Byzantine period ==\nThere is no definitively established date for when the so-called ''Byzantine'' period of Roman history begins. During the 4th, 5th, and 6th centuries the Empire was split and united administratively more than once. But it was during this period that Constantinople was first established and the East gained its own identity administratively; thus, it is often considered the ''early'' Byzantine period. Despite this, though, the legal developments during this period are typically considered part of ''Roman'' Law, as opposed to ''Byzantine'' Law, in part because legal documents during this period were still written in Latin. These developments, nevertheless, were key steps in the formation of Byzantine Law.\n\n===Codex Theodosianus===\n{{main|Codex Theodosianus}}\n\nIn 438, Emperor Theodosius published the [[Codex Theodosianus]], which consisted of 16 books, containing all standing laws from the age of [[Constantine I]] till then.\n\n=== Corpus Iuris Civilis ===\n{{main|Corpus Iuris Civilis}}\n\nSoon after his accession in 527, [[Justinian]] appointed a commission to collect and codify existing Roman law. A second commission, headed by the jurist [[Tribonian]], was appointed in 530 to select matter of permanent value from the works of the jurists, to edit it and to arrange it into 50 books. In 533 this commission produced the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]a''.\n\nAlthough Law as practiced in Rome had grown up as a type of case law, this was not the \"Roman Law\" known to the Medieval, or modern world. Now Roman law claims to be based on abstract principles of justice that were made into actual rules of law by legislative authority of the emperor or the Roman people. These ideas were transmitted to the Middle Ages in the great codification of Roman law carried throughout by the emperor Justinian. The [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]] was issued in Latin in three parts: the [[Institutes of Justinian|Institutes]], the Digest (Pandects), and the Code (Codex). It was the last major legal document written in Latin.\n\nThe world's most widespread legal system, [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], is based on the Corpus (in, for instance, most of Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa, as well as in the mixed jurisdictions of [[South African law|South Africa]], [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Quebec law|Quebec]], the [[Civil Code of the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]]).\n\n== Middle Byzantine period ==\nFollowing Justinian's reign the Empire entered a period of rapid decline partially enabling the Arab conquests which would further weaken the Empire. Knowledge of Latin, which had been in decline since the fall of the West, virtually disappeared making many of the old legal codices almost inaccessible. These developments contributed to a dramatic weakening of legal standards in the Empire and a substantial drop in the standards of legal scholarship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mousourakis|first=George|title=The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law|isbn=0-7546-2108-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC|pages=402\u2013403}}</ref> Legal practice would become much more ''pragmatic'' and, as knowledge of [[Latin language|Latin]] in the Empire waned, direct use of Justinian's ''\"Corpus Juris Civilis\"'' would be abandoned in favor of summaries, commentaries, and new compilations written in [[Medieval Greek|Greek]].\n\n=== Ecloga ===\nThe changes in the internal life of the empire which occurred in the years following the publication of Justinian's code called for a review of the legislation, so as to meet the requirements of the times. It was introduced within the framework of the reforms of [[Leo III the Isaurian]] (the first [[Isauria]]n emperor), and he also provided the modification of current laws. In 726 he issued the \"Ecloga\", that had his name as well as the name of his son Constantine.\n\"Ecloga\", referring to both the civil and criminal law constituted, as was declared in the title, a \"rectification (of the Justinian legislation) towards a more philanthropic version\". The membership of the editing committee is not known, but its primary mission, however, was on the one hand, to modify those dispositions not to be aligned with the current times and, on the other, to prevent judges from taking money for their actions and to help them to solve cases properly.\n\nThe dispositions of \"Ecloga\" were influenced by the Christian spirit, as well as by the [[common law]], that protected and supported the institution of marriage and introduced the equality of all citizens in law. On the other hand, the penalties of amputation and blindness were introduced, reflecting the Byzantine concept in this period of changes{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. By means of his \"Ecloga\" Leo also addressed the judges, inviting them ''\"neither the poor to despise nor the ones unjust to let uncontrolled\"''. Besides, in his effort to deter bribery in the execution of their duties he made their payment local and payable by the imperial treasury. \"Ecloga\" constituted the basic handbook of justice dispensation up to the days of the Macedonian emperors, that also assumed legislative activity, whereas later it influenced the ecclesiastic law of the Russian Orthodox Church. Formerly the researchers attributed the juridical collections ''\"Farmer's Law\", \"Rhodian Sea Law\"'' and ''\"Military Laws\"'' to [[Leo III the Isaurian]].\n\nThe structure of the act is original and it isn't taken from any other source, considering that Leon didn't want to complete layer legal reform. It seems that his goal was just to modify Justinian's legal tradition in the most important segments of legal life, while still adapting it to the needs and actions of the Middle Ages. It needed to be distinguished from its original model. Among the most important deviations from Justinian's Roman law are departure of consensuality when traiding goods. So that a contract could exist, it was necessary for the object to either be given to the buyer or that a price be paid to the seller. As long as both sides finish their parts, the contract is not valid even if there is downpayment being given as validation element.   Patria potestas is decresing its power influenced by hellenistic and canon laws and the rights of women and children are increasing. But Ecloga brings even bigger and more controversial changes in criminal law, which can be seen in the  frequent use of physical punishments, not typical for Justinian's law.\n\n=== The Farmer's Laws ===\nWith the exception of a few cities, and especially [[Constantinople]], where other types of urban economic activities were also developed, Byzantine society remained at its heart agricultural.  An important source regarding law, which reflects in a particularly characteristic way the internal life of the Byzantine villages during the Middle Byzantine Era (7th \u2013 end of 12th century) is the ''Nomos Georgikos'', also known as the ''Lex Rustica'' or ''Farmer's Law''. Due to its importance, the ''Farmer's Law'' roused the interest of researchers from a very early stage. Ever since it has been one of the most discussed texts concerning the internal history of Byzantium. It has been suggested that, because of the major influences caused by the influx of Slavs into the Empire at the time the Farmer's Law was established, Slavic traditions were in fact an important influence of the Farmer's Law, both in terms of why it was developed and its content.<ref>J. Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century'', pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nIt is a private collection, continuously enriched, and refers to specific cases relevant to rural property within the framework of the Byzantine rural \"community\". As evident by the dispositions of the \"Law\", peasants were organized in \"communities\" and collectively responsible for the payment of the total tax the \"community\" was liable for, being obliged to pay as well the amounts corresponding to indebted members of the community. As for the chronology of its writing, since the text itself bears no specific date, it is placed somewhere in between the second half of the 6th century and the middle of the 14th. Very early on, it was acknowledged as a legal handbook of great importance and greatly influenced much of the law of the Slavic countries and especially [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Russia]].\n\n=== The Sea Laws ===\nDating  problems, similar to the ones of the ''\"Farmer's Law\"'', presents a code of equal character, the \"Rhodian Sea Law\" (''Nomos Rhodion Nautikos''). Written probably between 600 and 800, it is a collection of [[maritime law]] regulations divided into three parts. The first part refers to the ratification of the \"Naval Law\" by the Roman emperors. The second specifies the participation of the crew in maritime profits and the regulations valid on the ship, while the third and largest refers to maritime law, as for example to the apportionment of responsibility in case of theft or damage to the cargo or the ship. The ''\"Naval Law\"'' was included in the ''Basilika'' of [[Leo VI the Wise]] as a complement to book 53.\n\n=== Ecclesiastical law ===\nIn accordance with the model of the secular legal associations, the canons of the ecclesiastic councils concerned ecclesiastic issues and  regulated the conduct of the clergy, as well as of the secular as concerned matters of belief. The \"In Trullo\" or \"Fifth-Sixth Council\", known for its canons, was convened in the years of Justinian II (691\u2013692) and occupied itself exclusively with matters of discipline. The aim of the synod was to cover the gaps left in canon law by the previous Fifth (553) and Sixth [[Ecumenical Councils]].\n\nThis collection of canons was divided into four parts:\n\na) The canons ratifying the doctrinal decisions of the first six ecumenical councils along with the teachings of the Fathers of the Church.\n\nb) The canons specifying the obligations of the ministrational clergy.\n\nc) The canons referring to the monks.\n\nd) The canons referring to the secular. The influence of these canons carried on in the future and they were extensively annotated by Balsamon, Zonaras and Aristenos, the three great ecclesiastic jurists of the 12th century.\n\n==== Editions ====\n* The ''[[Didache]]'', from the 2nd century\n* The ''[[Apostolic Church-Ordinance]]'', from the 3rd century\n* The ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', from 375 to 380 AD\n* The ''[[Canons of the Apostles]]''<ref>Pitra, Jean Baptiste Francois (1864). Juris ecc. Gr\u00e6corum historia et monumenta. I. Rome.</ref>\n\nThere were also other [[Ancient Church Orders]] no longer extant in Greek. Later, more-scientific collections emerged, including:\n\n* The ''[[Nomocanon]]'' of [[John Scholasticus]], from the 6th century \n* The ''Nomocanon'' in 14 titles of [[Heraclius]], from the 7th century\n* The ''Nomocanon'' of [[Photios]], from the 9th century\n* The ''Syntagma'' of [[Theodore Balsamon]] and his ''Scholia'' to the ''Nomocanon'' of Photios, from the 12th century\n* The ''Synopsis Canonum'' by [[Alexios Aristenos]], from the 12th century\n\nAll of these books were compiled later by the [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] monk Saint [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite]] and became the basis of the modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] law, his ''[[Pedalion]]''.\n\n== Later Byzantine law ==\nThe following legal texts were prepared in the later Byzantine Empire:\n* The ''Prochiron'' of Basil the Macedonian, c. 870<ref name=\"Mears\">Lambert Mears, Analysis of M. Ortolan's Institutes of Justinian, pp. 64\u201366</ref> or 872,<ref name=\"Laiou\">Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 71</ref> which invalidates parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restores Justinians Laws, as well as Hellenising arcane Latin expressions.\n* The ''Epanagoge'' (repetita proelectio legis),<ref name=\"Mears\" /> also of [[Basil I|Basil the Macedonian]], together with his sons, a second edition of the Prochiron, c. 879\u2013886<ref name=\"Mears\" />\n* The ''Eisagoge'' of Photios, which includes novel law, c. 880<ref name=\"Laiou\" />\n* The ''[[Basilika|Basilicae]]'' (repurgatio veterum legum) or ''Basilics'' of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo the Philosopher]], together with his brother [[Alexander (Byzantine emperor)|Alexander]] and [[Constantine VII]], c. 900<ref name=\"Laiou\" /> or 906\u201311,<ref name=\"Mears\" /> which attempts to synthesise 6th century commentaries and glosses on Justinians laws by headings, and remove contradictions.  By the 11th century, the Basilics had replaced Justinian's laws as the primary source of Roman law.\n* The ''Synopsis (Basilicorum) maior'', an abridgment of the ''Basilika'' from the late 9th century<ref>G. Mousourakis, Roman Law and the Origins of the Civil Law Tradition, p. 226</ref>\n* The ''Epitome Legum'', later known as the Epitome ad Prochiron mutata, a synthesis of Justinian and the Epanagoge, c. 920\u20131<ref name=\"Mears\" /><ref name=\"Laiou\" />\n* The ''Epanagoge aucta'', a revision of the 9th century Epanagogue from c. 11th century.<ref name=\"Mears\" />\n* The ''Prochiron aucta'', a revision of the 9th century Prochiron from c. 13th century.<ref name=\"Mears\" />\n* The ''Hexabiblos'', a 14th-century compilation of the above books made by [[Constantine Harmenopoulos]], a judge in [[Thessalonica]]\n* The ''Hexabiblos aucta'', a late 14th century revision of Harmenopoulos' work by  Ioannes Holobolos\nOther jurists (including at least one Emperor) prepared private collections of cases and commentaries,<ref name=\"Mears\" /> but these did not form the body of law used by jurists at large.  It is held that the ''113 Novels of Leo the Wise'' fall into this category.<ref name=\"Laiou\" />\n\nLokin<ref name=\"Laiou\" /> argues that while later legal texts tended to rearrange or explain the 6th century work of Justinian, rather than create new law, they did alter the locus of authority for law (''legis vigor'') from the Emperor to God.  In Justinian's work, Mosa\u00efc Law and God's authority ''support'' the Emperor, and are consultative, but do not temper his absolute authority.  This process has already begun in the  ''Ecloga'', which states law is God-given by way of Isaiah 8:20, and is made explicit first in the Prochiron.<ref>Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 77</ref>  There was, however, 'legislative creep' over this period, where the redaction of old laws and case law created new laws in effect, although not explicitly cited as such.<ref>Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 85</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDuring the early Middle Ages Roman/Byzantine Law played a major role throughout the Mediterranean region and much of Europe because of the economic and military importance of the Empire.\n\nThe ''[[Syro-Roman Law Book]]'', a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of a Greek original from the 5th century, was highly influential in eastern Christian communities after the early Muslim conquests. It was based on Roman case law and imperial statutes from the east of the empire.\n\nAfter the Islamic conquests of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Islamic caliphates gradually codified their legal systems using Roman/Byzantine law as an important model. It has been suggested in fact that it was the ''Ecloga''\u2019s publication that spurred the first major codification of Islamic imperial law.<ref>B. Jokisch, ''Islamic Imperial Law: Harun-Al-Rashid's Codification Project'', pp. 484\u2013485.</ref>\n\nSlavic legal traditions, including countries ranging from [[Bulgaria]] to [[Russia]], were substantially influenced by the ''Farmer's Law''.<ref>Elena Salogubova & Alan Zenkov, \u201cRoman Law's Influence on Russian Civil Law and Procedure\u201d, ''Russian Law Journal'' 6, no. 2 (2018): 118\u201333.</ref> To a lesser extent the ''Ecloga'' and other Byzantine codices influenced these areas as well. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as Russia increased its contact with the West, Justinian's Code began to be studied thus bringing in this influence.\n\nIn Western Europe, following the fall of the Roman Empire, the influence of Roman/Byzantine law became more indirect though always significant during much of the Middle Ages. During the European Renaissance, Western scholars embraced Justinian's Code as a basis for jurisprudence, shunning many of the later legal developments of the Byzantine Empire such as the ''Ecloga''. This was to a great extent affected by the East/West ([[Roman Catholic]] vs. [[Eastern Orthodox]]) split in the Church.

Most sources define ''Byzantine law'' as the Roman legal traditions starting after the reign of [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century and ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the 15th century.\n\nThough during and after the [[European Renaissance]] Western legal practices were heavily influenced by ''[[Justinian's Code]]'' (the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'') and Roman law during classical times,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://globalconnections.champlain.edu/2015/04/17/the-justinian-code-and-its-influence/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404223403/http://globalconnections.champlain.edu/2015/04/17/the-justinian-code-and-its-influence/ |archive-date=2018-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Byzantine law nevertheless had substantial influence on Western traditions during the [[Middle Ages]] and after.\n\nThe most important work of Byzantine law was the [[Ecloga]], issued by [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], the first major Roman-Byzantine legal code issued in Greek rather than Latin. Soon after the ''Farmer's Law'' was established regulating legal standards outside the cities. While the Ecloga was influential throughout the Mediterranean (and Europe) because of the importance of Constantinople as a trading center, the Farmer's Law was a seminal influence on Slavic legal traditions including [[Law of Russia|those of Russia]].\n\n==Influences and sources==\nByzantium inherited its main political, cultural and social institutions from Rome. Similarly, Roman law constituted the basis for the Byzantine legal system. For many centuries, the two great codifications of Roman law carried out by [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I|Justinian]] respectively, were the cornerstones of Byzantine legislation. Of course, over the years these Roman codes were adjusted to the current circumstances and then replaced by new codifications, written in Greek. However, the influence of Roman law persisted, and it is obvious in codifications, such as ''[[Basilika]]'', which was based on ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. In the 11th century, [[Michael Psellos]] prides himself for being acquainted with the Roman legal legacy (\"\u1f38\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\").<ref>A. Cameron, ''The Byzantines'', p. 153; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', p. 397.</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the late Roman legal tradition, the main source of law (''fons legum'') in Byzantium remained the enactments of the emperors. The latter initiated some major codifications of the Roman law, but they also issued their own \"new laws\", the ''Novels'' (\"Novellae\", \"\u039d\u03b5\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76\"). In early Byzantine (late Roman) era the legislative interest of the emperors intensified, and laws were now regulating the main aspects of public, private, economic and social life.<ref>M.T. F\u00f6gen, \"Legislation in Byzantium\", pp. 53&ndash;54; R. Morris, \"Dispute Settlement\", 126; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', pp. 399&ndash;400.</ref> For example, [[Constantine I]] was the first to regulate divorce and Theodosius I intervened in faith issues, imposing a specific version of the [[Apostles' Creed|Creed]].<ref>M.T. F\u00f6gen, \"Legislation in Byzantium\", pp. 56, 59.</ref> From [[Diocletian]] to [[Theodosius I]], namely during approximately 100 years, more than 2,000 laws were issued. Justinian alone promulgated approximately 600 laws. Gradually, the legislative enthusiasm receded, but still some of the laws of later emperors, such as [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]]'s ''Novels'', are of particular importance.<ref>A. Cameron, ''The Byzantines'', p. 153; M.T. F\u00f6gen, \"Legislation in Byzantium\", pp. 53&ndash;54.</ref> The custom continued to play a limited role as a secondary source of law, but written legislation had a precedence.<ref>R. Morris, \"Dispute Settlement\", 126; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', pp. 401&ndash;402.</ref>\n\n== Early Byzantine period ==\nThere is no definitively established date for when the so-called ''Byzantine'' period of Roman history begins. During the 4th, 5th, and 6th centuries the Empire was split and united administratively more than once. But it was during this period that Constantinople was first established and the East gained its own identity administratively; thus, it is often considered the ''early'' Byzantine period. Despite this, though, the legal developments during this period are typically considered part of ''Roman'' Law, as opposed to ''Byzantine'' Law, in part because legal documents during this period were still written in Latin. These developments, nevertheless, were key steps in the formation of Byzantine Law.\n\n===Codex Theodosianus===\n{{main|Codex Theodosianus}}\n\nIn 438, Emperor Theodosius published the [[Codex Theodosianus]], which consisted of 16 books, containing all standing laws from the age of [[Constantine I]] till then.\n\n=== Corpus Iuris Civilis ===\n{{main|Corpus Iuris Civilis}}\n\nSoon after his accession in 527, [[Justinian]] appointed a commission to collect and codify existing Roman law. A second commission, headed by the jurist [[Tribonian]], was appointed in 530 to select matter of permanent value from the works of the jurists, to edit it and to arrange it into 50 books. In 533 this commission produced the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]a''.\n\nAlthough Law as practiced in Rome had grown up as a type of case law, this was not the \"Roman Law\" known to the Medieval, or modern world. Now Roman law claims to be based on abstract principles of justice that were made into actual rules of law by legislative authority of the emperor or the Roman people. These ideas were transmitted to the Middle Ages in the great codification of Roman law carried throughout by the emperor Justinian. The [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]] was issued in Latin in three parts: the [[Institutes of Justinian|Institutes]], the Digest (Pandects), and the Code (Codex). It was the last major legal document written in Latin.\n\nThe world's most widespread legal system, [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], is based on the Corpus (in, for instance, most of Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa, as well as in the mixed jurisdictions of [[South African law|South Africa]], [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Quebec law|Quebec]], the [[Civil Code of the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]]).\n\n== Middle Byzantine period ==\nFollowing Justinian's reign the Empire entered a period of rapid decline partially enabling the Arab conquests which would further weaken the Empire. Knowledge of Latin, which had been in decline since the fall of the West, virtually disappeared making many of the old legal codices almost inaccessible. These developments contributed to a dramatic weakening of legal standards in the Empire and a substantial drop in the standards of legal scholarship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mousourakis|first=George|title=The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law|isbn=0-7546-2108-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC|pages=402\u2013403}}</ref> Legal practice would become much more ''pragmatic'' and, as knowledge of [[Latin language|Latin]] in the Empire waned, direct use of Justinian's ''\"Corpus Juris Civilis\"'' would be abandoned in favor of summaries, commentaries, and new compilations written in [[Medieval Greek|Greek]].\n\n=== Ecloga ===\nThe changes in the internal life of the empire which occurred in the years following the publication of Justinian's code called for a review of the legislation, so as to meet the requirements of the times. It was introduced Within the framework of the reforms of  [[Leo III the Isaurian]], (the first [[Isauria]]n emperor) and he also provided the modification of current laws. In 726 he issued the \"Ecloga\", that had his name as well as the name of his son Constantine.\n\"Ecloga\", referring to both the civil and criminal law constituted, as was declared in the title, a \"rectification (of the Justinian legislation) towards a more philanthropic version\". The membership of the editing committee is not known, but its primary mission, however, was on the one hand, to modify those dispositions not to be aligned with the current times and, on the other, to prevent judges from taking money for their actions and to help them to solve cases properly.\n\nThe dispositions of \"Ecloga\" were influenced by the Christian spirit, as well as by the [[common law]], that protected and supported the institution of marriage and introduced the equality of all citizens in law. On the other hand, the penalties of amputation and blindness were introduced, reflecting the Byzantine concept in this period of changes{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. By means of his \"Ecloga\" Leo also addressed the judges, inviting them ''\"neither the poor to despise nor the ones unjust to let uncontrolled\"''. Besides, in his effort to deter bribery in the execution of their duties he made their payment local and payable by the imperial treasury. \"Ecloga\" constituted the basic handbook of justice dispensation up to the days of the Macedonian emperors, that also assumed legislative activity, whereas later it influenced the ecclesiastic law of the Russian Orthodox Church. Formerly the researchers attributed the juridical collections ''\"Farmer's Law\", \"Rhodian Sea Law\"'' and ''\"Military Laws\"'' to [[Leo III the Isaurian]].\n\nThe structure of the act is original and it isn't taken from any other source, considering that Leon didn't want to complete layer legal reform. It seems that his goal was just to modify Justinian's legal tradition in the most important segments of legal life, while still adapting it to the needs and actions of the Middle Ages. It needed to be distinguished from its original model. Among the most important deviations from Justinian's Roman law are departure of consensuality when traiding goods. So that a contract could exist, it was necessary for the object to either be given to the buyer or that a price be paid to the seller. As long as both sides finish their parts, the contract is not valid even if there is downpayment being given as validation element.   Patria potestas is decresing its power influenced by hellenistic and canon laws and the rights of women and children are increasing. But Ecloga brings even bigger and more controversial changes in criminal law, which can be seen in the  frequent use of physical punishments, not typical for Justinian's law.\n\n=== The Farmer's Laws ===\nWith the exception of a few cities, and especially [[Constantinople]], where other types of urban economic activities were also developed, Byzantine society remained at its heart agricultural.  An important source regarding law, which reflects in a particularly characteristic way the internal life of the Byzantine villages during the Middle Byzantine Era (7th \u2013 end of 12th century) is the ''Nomos Georgikos'', also known as the ''Lex Rustica'' or ''Farmer's Law''. Due to its importance, the ''Farmer's Law'' roused the interest of researchers from a very early stage. Ever since it has been one of the most discussed texts concerning the internal history of Byzantium. It has been suggested that, because of the major influences caused by the influx of Slavs into the Empire at the time the Farmer's Law was established, Slavic traditions were in fact an important influence of the Farmer's Law, both in terms of why it was developed and its content.<ref>J. Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century'', pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nIt is a private collection, continuously enriched, and refers to specific cases relevant to rural property within the framework of the Byzantine rural \"community\". As evident by the dispositions of the \"Law\", peasants were organized in \"communities\" and collectively responsible for the payment of the total tax the \"community\" was liable for, being obliged to pay as well the amounts corresponding to indebted members of the community. As for the chronology of its writing, since the text itself bears no specific date, it is placed somewhere in between the second half of the 6th century and the middle of the 14th. Very early on, it was acknowledged as a legal handbook of great importance and greatly influenced much of the law of the Slavic countries and especially [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Russia]].\n\n=== The Sea Laws ===\nDating  problems, similar to the ones of the ''\"Farmer's Law\"'', presents a code of equal character, the \"Rhodian Sea Law\" (''Nomos Rhodion Nautikos''). Written probably between 600 and 800, it is a collection of [[maritime law]] regulations divided into three parts. The first part refers to the ratification of the \"Naval Law\" by the Roman emperors. The second specifies the participation of the crew in maritime profits and the regulations valid on the ship, while the third and largest refers to maritime law, as for example to the apportionment of responsibility in case of theft or damage to the cargo or the ship. The ''\"Naval Law\"'' was included in the ''Basilika'' of [[Leo VI the Wise]] as a complement to book 53.\n\n=== Ecclesiastical law ===\nIn accordance with the model of the secular legal associations, the canons of the ecclesiastic councils concerned ecclesiastic issues and  regulated the conduct of the clergy, as well as of the secular as concerned matters of belief. The \"In Trullo\" or \"Fifth-Sixth Council\", known for its canons, was convened in the years of Justinian II (691\u2013692) and occupied itself exclusively with matters of discipline. The aim of the synod was to cover the gaps left in canon law by the previous Fifth (553) and Sixth [[Ecumenical Councils]].\n\nThis collection of canons was divided into four parts:\n\na) The canons ratifying the doctrinal decisions of the first six ecumenical councils along with the teachings of the Fathers of the Church.\n\nb) The canons specifying the obligations of the ministrational clergy.\n\nc) The canons referring to the monks.\n\nd) The canons referring to the secular. The influence of these canons carried on in the future and they were extensively annotated by Balsamon, Zonaras and Aristenos, the three great ecclesiastic jurists of the 12th century.\n\n==== Editions ====\n* The ''[[Didache]]'', from the 2nd century\n* The ''[[Apostolic Church-Ordinance]]'', from the 3rd century\n* The ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', from 375 to 380 AD\n* The ''[[Canons of the Apostles]]''<ref>Pitra, Jean Baptiste Francois (1864).

Later, more-scientific collections emerged, including:\n\n* The ''[[Nomocanon]]'' of [[John Scholasticus]], from the 6th century \n* The ''Nomocanon'' in 14 titles of [[Heraclius]], from the 7th century\n* The ''Nomocanon'' of [[Photios]], from the 9th century\n* The ''Syntagma'' of [[Theodore Balsamon]] and his ''Scholia'' to the ''Nomocanon'' of Photios, from the 12th century\n* The ''Synopsis Canonum'' by [[Alexios Aristenos]], from the 12th century\n\nAll of these books were compiled later by the [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] monk Saint [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite]] and became the basis of the modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] law, his ''[[Pedalion]]''.\n\n== Later Byzantine law ==\nThe following legal texts were prepared in the later Byzantine Empire:\n* The ''Prochiron'' of Basil the Macedonian, c. 870<ref name=\"Mears\">Lambert Mears, Analysis of M. Ortolan's Institutes of Justinian, pp. 64\u201366</ref> or 872,<ref name=\"Laiou\">Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 71</ref> which invalidates parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restores Justinians Laws, as well as Hellenising arcane Latin expressions.\n* The ''Epanagoge'' (repetita proelectio legis),<ref name=\"Mears\" /> also of [[Basil I|Basil the Macedonian]], together with his sons, a second edition of the Prochiron, c. 879\u2013886<ref name=\"Mears\" />\n* The ''Eisagoge'' of Photios, which includes novel law, c. 880<ref name=\"Laiou\" />\n* The ''[[Basilika|Basilicae]]'' (repurgatio veterum legum) or ''Basilics'' of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo the Philosopher]], together with his brother [[Alexander (Byzantine emperor)|Alexander]] and [[Constantine VII]], c. 900<ref name=\"Laiou\" /> or 906\u201311,<ref name=\"Mears\" /> which attempts to synthesise 6th century commentaries and glosses on Justinians laws by headings, and remove contradictions.  By the 11th century, the Basilics had replaced Justinian's laws as the primary source of Roman law.\n* The ''Synopsis (Basilicorum) maior'', an abridgment of the ''Basilika'' from the late 9th century<ref>G. Mousourakis, Roman Law and the Origins of the Civil Law Tradition, p. 226</ref>\n* The ''Epitome Legum'', later known as the Epitome ad Prochiron mutata, a synthesis of Justinian and the Epanagoge, c. 920\u20131<ref name=\"Mears\" /><ref name=\"Laiou\" />\n* The ''Epanagoge aucta'', a revision of the 9th century Epanagogue from c. 11th century.<ref name=\"Mears\" />\n* The ''Prochiron aucta'', a revision of the 9th century Prochiron from c. 13th century.<ref name=\"Mears\" />\n* The ''Hexabiblos'', a 14th-century compilation of the above books made by [[Constantine Harmenopoulos]], a judge in [[Thessalonica]]\n* The ''Hexabiblos aucta'', a late 14th century revision of Harmenopoulos' work by  Ioannes Holobolos\nOther jurists (including at least one Emperor) prepared private collections of cases and commentaries,<ref name=\"Mears\" /> but these did not form the body of law used by jurists at large.  It is held that the ''113 Novels of Leo the Wise'' fall into this category.<ref name=\"Laiou\" />\n\nLokin<ref name=\"Laiou\" /> argues that while later legal texts tended to rearrange or explain the 6th century work of Justinian, rather than create new law, they did alter the locus of authority for law (''legis vigor'') from the Emperor to God.  In Justinian's work, Mosa\u00efc Law and God's authority ''support'' the Emperor, and are consultative, but do not temper his absolute authority.  This process has already begun in the  ''Ecloga'', which states law is God-given by way of Isaiah 8:20, and is made explicit first in the Prochiron.<ref>Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 77</ref>  There was, however, 'legislative creep' over this period, where the redaction of old laws and case law created new laws in effect, although not explicitly cited as such.<ref>Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 85</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDuring the early Middle Ages Roman/Byzantine Law played a major role throughout the Mediterranean region and much of Europe because of the economic and military importance of the Empire.\n\nThe ''[[Syro-Roman Law Book]]'', a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of a Greek original from the 5th century, was highly influential in eastern Christian communities after the early Muslim conquests. It was based on Roman case law and imperial statutes from the east of the empire.\n\nAfter the Islamic conquests of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Islamic caliphates gradually codified their legal systems using Roman/Byzantine law as an important model. It has been suggested in fact that it was the ''Ecloga''\u2019s publication that spurred the first major codification of Islamic imperial law.<ref>B. Jokisch, ''Islamic Imperial Law: Harun-Al-Rashid's Codification Project'', pp. 484\u2013485.</ref>\n\nSlavic legal traditions, including countries ranging from [[Bulgaria]] to [[Russia]], were substantially influenced by the ''Farmer's Law''.<ref>Elena Salogubova & Alan Zenkov, \u201cRoman Law's Influence on Russian Civil Law and Procedure\u201d, ''Russian Law Journal'' 6, no. 2 (2018): 118\u201333.</ref> To a lesser extent the ''Ecloga'' and other Byzantine codices influenced these areas as well. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as Russia increased its contact with the West, Justinian's Code began to be studied thus bringing in this influence.\n\nIn Western Europe, following the fall of the Roman Empire, the influence of Roman/Byzantine law became more indirect though always significant during much of the Middle Ages. During the European Renaissance, Western scholars embraced Justinian's Code as a basis for jurisprudence, shunning many of the later legal developments of the Byzantine Empire such as the ''Ecloga''. This was to a great extent affected by the East/West ([[Roman Catholic]] vs. [[Eastern Orthodox]]) split in the Church. The perception in the West was that Roman law that was recorded in Latin was truly ''Roman'' whereas later laws written in Greek was distinct and foreign.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |title=The Byzantines|last=Cameron |first=Averil|authorlink=Averil Cameron | year=2009|publisher= Editions Psychogios|location=Athens |isbn=978-960-453-529-3|language=Greek |translator= Giorgos Tzimas}}\n*Chitwood, Zachary (2017).

These give us an idea of the weakness of the current operations research model and the effectiveness of behavioral operations research in predicting human decisions and reactions when facing different situations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Socio-technical view of technology management===\nPhysical technologies can be defined as a socio-technology system, which consists of humans, human activity, spaces, artifacts, tools, and communications media. This theory suggests that social interaction at the workplace is determined by the technology and techniques used at work. Therefore, a change in technology used at work can lead to unexpected consequences. This may include differences in motivation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Human factor engineering===\nHuman factor engineering can be applied to improve workplaces, working systems and products aiming to reduce human errors during operations as well as improving human efficiency, productivity and operational performance. It often involves improvements of large machineries to reduce accidents during work. It is believed that behavior operations research can be related to human factor engineering as systematic errors, which happens very often technology and different machineries, can affect people's decision making and their interaction with the operating system.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/454.pdf|title = Human factors engineering in projects|last = |first = |date = August 2011|journal = International Association of Oil & Gas Producers|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 October 2015|volume = 454|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305125218/http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/454.pdf|archive-date = 5 March 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n[[File:Bulwhip efect.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of the bullwhip effect|300x300px]]\n\n===The bullwhip effect===\nThe bullwhip effect happens along the supply chain of an organisation. This is when agents along the supply chain fail to pass on relevant and accurate information to their superior, leading to a large variation in the demand of goods and services from the customers and the supply from the organisation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect|url = http://www.quickmba.com/ops/bullwhip-effect/|website = www.quickmba.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}</ref> Human behavior is a very important aspect to be considered, as decision making and emotions in the market will make a big difference to the final result of the bullwhip effect. This is because managers who can calmly make decisions while others competitors panic and deliver inaccurate messages often perform better within the industry. When the market is in poor condition, fear can be an important factor affecting managers' decisions. Therefore, human behavior is closely related to people's decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect and Your Supply Chain|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232953|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-01|date = 2014-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===System dynamics models in operations contexts===\nSystem dynamics models in operations contexts focuses on the importance of how components in a system interact with each other as well as providing an overview of the processes that takes place within the system. Behavioral operations research often benefits from the development of comprehensive systems models as they are able to analyse and provide an insight of the operational system. This allows the study of behavioral operations to understand how people in these settings or work conditions think about the context in which they operate. In an operations system, it often involves levers for managers to manipulate the components involved in the system. The uses of these levers are determined by human behaviors and these behaviors include feelings of stress and fear.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Behavioral Operations Management: Social and Psychological Dynamics in Production and Service Settings|last = Bendoly|first = Elliot|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 25 June 2015|isbn = 978-0199357222|location = United States|pages = 6\u20138|last2 = van Wezel|first2 = Wout|last3 = Banchrach|first3 = Daniel G.}}</ref>\n\n==Related problems==\n\n===Newsvendor problem===\nThe [[newsvendor model]] (or newsboy or single-period or perishable) is a mathematical model used in operations management and applied economics to determine optimal level products or services to keep in stock when the demand is unknown. This model is also known as the newsvendor problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must make on time stocking decision of how many copies of newspaper to keep in stock when facing uncertain demand. If the newspaper vendor stocks too much, these newspaper may end up worthless by the end of the day as they are no longer up-to-date. However, if the newspaper vendor stocks too little, he misses the opportunity to make more profit and suffers loss of goodwill.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Newsvendor Model|last = Adelman|first = Dan|date = 1999|journal = The Operations Quadrangle: Business Process Fundamentals|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Barnes-Schuster|first2 = Dawn|first3 = Don|last3 = Eisenstein|pages = |page = }}</ref>\n[[File:SecretaryProblemHeuristicPlot.png|thumb|278x278px|\nHeuristic performance regarding the secretary problem \u2013\nExpected success probabilities for three heuristics]]\n\n===Assignment problem===\nThe assignment problem is a complex optimization problem. The problem involves number of agents and a number of tasks. The purpose is to assign each agent with a task. All agents are expected or aimed to be allocated in a way that will maximize productivity and efficiency and minimize the total cost of the assignment.\n\n===Secretary problem===\n\nThe secretary problem can also be called the optimal stopping theory. It focuses heavily on applied probability, statistics and decision theory. The idea behind the secretary problem is that to make the best decisions when there is a pool of different options, other options are unknown, details of other options will only be given if the currently existing option is given up. The problem comes down to the idea of optimal strategy, maximizing the probability of selecting the best option.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Decision theory]]\n[[Category:Operations research]]\n", "text_old": "'''Behavioral operations management''' (often called '''behavioral operations''') examines and takes into consideration human behaviors and emotions when facing complex decision problems.<ref name=\"Behavioral Opertions review\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Donohue | first1 =K. | last2 = \u00d6zer | first2 = \u00d6 | last3 = Zheng | first3 =  Y. | title = Behavioral operations: Past, present, and future | journal = Manufacturing & Service Operations Management | date = 2020 | pages = 191\u2013202 | volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1287/msom.2019.0828}}</ref> It relates to the behavioral aspects of the use of [[operations research]] and [[operations management]].

Therefore, human behavior is closely related to people's decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect and Your Supply Chain|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232953|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-01|date = 2014-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===System dynamics models in operations contexts===\nSystem dynamics models in operations contexts focuses on the importance of how components in a system interact with each other as well as providing an overview of the processes that takes place within the system. Behavioral operations research often benefits from the development of comprehensive systems models as they are able to analyse and provide an insight of the operational system. This allows the study of behavioral operations to understand how people in these settings or work conditions think about the context in which they operate. In an operations system, it often involves levers for managers to manipulate the components involved in the system. The uses of these levers are determined by human behaviors and these behaviors include feelings of stress and fear.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Behavioral Operations Management: Social and Psychological Dynamics in Production and Service Settings|last = Bendoly|first = Elliot|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 25 June 2015|isbn = 978-0199357222|location = United States|pages = 6\u20138|last2 = van Wezel|first2 = Wout|last3 = Banchrach|first3 = Daniel G.}}</ref>\n\n==Related problems==\n\n===Newsvendor problem===\nThe [[newsvendor model]] (or newsboy or single-period or perishable) is a mathematical model used in operations management and applied economics to determine optimal level products or services to keep in stock when the demand is unknown. This model is also known as the newsvendor problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must make on time stocking decision of how many copies of newspaper to keep in stock when facing uncertain demand. If the newspaper vendor stocks too much, these newspaper may end up worthless by the end of the day as they are no longer up-to-date. However, if the newspaper vendor stocks too little, he misses the opportunity to make more profit and suffers loss of goodwill.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Newsvendor Model|last = Adelman|first = Dan|date = 1999|journal = The Operations Quadrangle: Business Process Fundamentals|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Barnes-Schuster|first2 = Dawn|first3 = Don|last3 = Eisenstein|pages = |page = }}</ref>\n[[File:SecretaryProblemHeuristicPlot.png|thumb|278x278px|\nHeuristic performance regarding the secretary problem \u2013\nExpected success probabilities for three heuristics]]\n\n===Assignment problem===\nThe assignment problem is a complex optimization problem.

The idea behind the secretary problem is that to make the best decisions when there is a pool of different options, other options are unknown, details of other options will only be given if the currently existing option is given up. The problem comes down to the idea of optimal strategy, maximizing the probability of selecting the best option.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Decision theory]]\n[[Category:Operations research]]\n", "name_user": "TPape", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview:Replaced word \"operations research\" with \"opterations management\" to make section confirm with the change of the article's title to \"Behavioral operations management\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_operations_management"}

Therefore, specialists have developed criteria for the selection of proper, adequate respirators, including the '''Assigned Protection Factors''' (APF) - the decrease of the concentration of harmful substances in the inhaled air, which (is expected) to be provided with timely and proper use of a certified respirator of certain types (''design'') by taught and trained [[Workforce|workers]] (after individual selection with a tight-fitting mask and [[Respirator fit test|fit testing]]), when the [[Employment|employer]] performs an effective respiratory protective device programme.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Self-contained breathing apparatus|Self Containing Breathing Apparatus]] (SCBA) with pressure-demand air supply mode into the full face mask.

These respirators must be sufficiently effective, and they should correspond to known or expected conditions at the workplace. However, the sole reliance on personal protective equipment for personnel is considered the least [[Hierarchy of hazard control|effective means of controlling hazards]], for reasons including: non-usage of the respirators in the contaminated atmosphere; leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and face; and [[Cartridges and canisters of air-purifying respirators#Replacement|delayed replacement of gas cartridges]].\n\n=== The effectiveness of respirators with different designs ===\nDifferent terms may be used to describe the protective properties of respirators:\n* '''Penetration''' = (the concentration of harmful substances under mask) / (concentration outside the mask);\n* '''Efficiency''' = <big>'''('''</big> (concentration outside the mask) - (the concentration of harmful substances under mask) <big>''')'''</big> / (concentration outside the mask) = 1 - Penetration;\n* '''Protection Factor''' (PF) = (the concentration of harmful substances on the outside of the mask) / (concentration under mask) = 1 / Penetration.\nThe term \"Protection Factor PF\" has been used in the U.S., and the term \"Penetration\" was used in the soviet literature from the 1960s.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, experts measured protective properties of respirators in the laboratories. They used different control substances ([[argon]],<ref name=\"Griffin-1970\" /> halogenated hydrocarbon vapour,<ref name=\"Hounam-1964\" /> [[aerosol]]s of [[sodium chloride]] and oil mist,<ref name=\"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439-1979\" /> [[fluorophore]]s,<ref name=\"Burgess-1961\" /> [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|dioctyl phthalate]],<ref name=\"30-CFR-14\" /><ref name=\"Hyatt-1972\" /> and others, and they measured their concentrations under the mask, and outside masks (simultaneously). The ratio of the measured concentrations is an indicator of the protective properties of different types of respirators. These measurements showed that if the efficiency of [[Cartridges and canisters of air-purifying respirators|filters]] is sufficiently high, then the gaps between the mask and the face become the main way of penetration of air contamination under the mask, in the same way that on a cold day, a person wearing a warm jacket and pants will lose most of their heat through the head and extremities. \n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace PF]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters. In-facepiece dust concentration is changed dozens of times in a matter of minutes due to changes of the size of the gaps between the mask and face. Source<ref name=\"Grinshpun-2005\" />]]\nThe shape and size of these gaps is not constant, and depends on many factors (the degree of fit the mask to the face - by shape and size; the correct donning the mask; the mask slippage on the face during the work due to execution of different movements; the design of the mask). The respirator's PF may change dozens of times during of several minutes; and the two average PF (''that were measured for the same worker in one day; for example - before and after the lunch break'') can differ by more than 12 000 times.<ref name=\"Zhuang-2003\" />\n\nExperts believed that the measurement of protection factors in the laboratory allows them to correctly evaluate, predict the RPD efficiency in the workplace conditions. But after the detection of cases of excessive harmful exposure on employees who used high quality respirators with [[HEPA]] particle filters in the [[Nuclear power|nuclear industry]] of the USA, the experts changed their opinion.<ref name=\"Patty-1985\" /> [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Studies have been carried out to measure the protection factors for the various types of respirators - not only in the laboratories, but also at the workplaces]].<ref name=\"Kirillov-2014\" /> Dozens of such field studies have shown that the performance of serviceable respiratory protective equipment at the workplaces may be significantly less than in laboratory conditions. Therefore, the usage of laboratory results to assess the real efficiency is incorrect; and can lead to a wrong choice of such respirators that can not reliably protect workers.\n\n=== Terminology to describe the different PF, and methods for APF development ===\nThe experts used the results of measurements at the laboratories and [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|at the workplaces]] to develop more completely terminology for description of the respirators' performance;<ref name=\"Letter-1\" /><ref name=\"Letter-2\" /><ref name=\"Letter-2+\" /><ref name=\"Letter-3\" /> and this terminology has been applied officially,<ref name=\"NIOSH-2004\" /> and in the preparation of research results for publication.<ref name=\"Letter-4\" /> Specialists began to use different terms to describe the protection factors, which were measured at workplaces with continuous use of respirators; and measured in the workplace when the workers used of respirators intermittently; measured not in the workplace while [[Respirator fit test|fit testing]]; measured in the laboratories under the simulation workplace's conditions; and for the protection factors, that can be expected (''in most cases'') when the workers properly used the respirators at the workplace.\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u044d\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044b PAPR en.jpg|thumb|350px|The diagram show 92 values of the Workplace PFs of PAPRs with loose-fitting facepieces (hood or helmet).

And instability of respirators' protective properties (for the same RPD design, and in the same usage conditions) prevented evaluate their efficiency. For solving these problems, scientists Donald Campbell and Steven Lenhart suggested to use the results of measurements of Workplace PF values for development of Assigned (''expected in practice'') PF values (APF) - as the '''lower''' [[Confidence interval|95% confidence interval]] of WPF values.<ref name=\"Lenhart-1984\" /> The results of measurements of WPF has been used in the development of APF by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] (for the recommended standard, that is not mandatory).<ref name=\"Nelson-1996\" /> The same was made during the development of the APF<ref name=\"FedRegAPF\" /> by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] (in the development of the standard,<ref name=\"Standard-US\" /> that is mandatory for the employer).\n\n=== Development of APF values for the various respirator types ===\nResults of measurements of WPF in the US and the UK became the basis for the development of APF for UK standard<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /> and for English version of EU standard.<ref name=\"DIN-EN-529\" />\nIn some cases, there was no information on the effectiveness for respirators of specific design (type) in the workplace. This is due to the fact that the measurement of workplace PF is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive work, which was carried out not very often. For these types of respirators experts used the results of WPF measurements of other types of respirators, which are similar. For example, the effectiveness of the Supplied Air Respirators (SARs, with hose) was considered similar to the efficiency of [[Powered air-purifying respirator|Powered Air Purifying Respirators]] (PAPRs), if they have the same facepieces and the same air supply mode. Finally, in the absence of this information, specialists could use the results of Simulated WPF measurements; or estimates of competent experts.<ref name=\"Nelson-1996\" />\n\n== Correction of Assigned PF values ==\nMeasurement of workplace protection factors surprisingly revealed the low efficiency of some designs of respirators, and that results have led to a sharp tightening of the requirements for application limits for respirators of such designs.\n[[File:\u0424\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u044e\u0448\u043e\u043d.JPG|thumb|150px|PAPR with hood.

It was a surprise, since earlier studies in the laboratory showed that the flow of clean filtered air from the inside to the outside of the helmet prevents ingress of harmful substances under the helmet (PF > 1000). Additional studies<ref name=\"Myers-1986\" /> have confirmed the result of the first study: the minimum values of the workplace protection factors of 2 models of respirators were 31 and 23; and leakage of unfiltered air achieved 16% in some cases in [[wind tunnel]] at 2&nbsp;m/s air velocity<ref name=\"Cecala-1981\" />\n\nTherefore, the use of such RPD types was limited 25 PEL in the U.S.,<ref name=\"Standard-US\" /> and 40 [[Occupational exposure limit|OEL]] in the UK.<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /><ref name=\"DIN-EN-529\" /> \n[[File:Workplace Protection Factors of full face masks.jpg|thumb|200px|Results of respirator Workplace Protection Factors (WPF) measurement.

However, the experts in the UK believed that the quality of their masks is higher than American masks, and were allowed to use up to 900 OEL. But the study<ref name=\"Tannahill-1990\" /> showed that the value of the protection factor of > 900 has been achieved in practice infrequently. Minimum protection factors of 3 different models of full facepiece respirators were 11, 18 and 26. So, the new standards<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /><ref name=\"DIN-EN-529\" /> limit usage of these respirators up to 40 OEL in UK (after this study).\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430 MSA.jpg|thumb|150px|Negative pressure full face masks, possible APF decreased from 100 to 10]]\n* Negative pressure half mask respirators (after fit testing)\n[[Respirator fit test|Fit testing]] of tight-fitting masks of negative-pressure respirators became widely used in US industry in 1980-s. At the beginning, it was thought that the half-mask fit quite well to the worker's face, if during a fit test the protection factor (fit factor) is not less than 10 (later, experts began to use [[Factor of safety|\"safety factor\"]] = 10 during the fit test; threshold fit factor become 10 \u00d7 10 = 100). The widespread use of fit testing in the industry gives professionals optimism, and they allowed to the employers restrict the use of half mask respirators in accordance with the values of worker's personal fit factor (the maximum concentration of pollutants = personal Fit Factor \u00d7 PEL), but not more than 100 \u00d7 PEL. However, scientific studies have shown that although such test increases the effectiveness of protection, the risk of leakage of large amounts of unfiltered air is maintained. Furthermore, the studies have shown that non-filtered air under the mask is not uniformly mixed with the filtered air, which leads to large errors in the measurement of the in-facepiece concentration of contaminants, and subsequent calculations of fit factors - the latter is often much smaller than the \"measured\" value. So, specialists recommend not allowed usage negative pressure half mask respirators then harmful substances' concentrations exceeds 10 PEL.<ref name=\"Bollinger-1988\" /> Therefore, OSHA standards require to restrict using of half-mask negative-pressure respirators up to 10 PEL after obtaining fit factor greater than or equal to 100 during the mask selection for the worker (they used a [[Factor of safety|safety factor]] = 10).\n\n== Comparison of APF in the US and the UK ==\nThe table lists the APF values for the most common respirator types (for US and UK). \n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible \" style=\"text-align:center\" collapsed\n! colspan=\"4\" | The Assigned Protection Factors for some main (''equivalent'') RPD types ''(developed on the basis of results of Workplace Protection Factors studies)'' \n|-\n!

The difference between PAPR with helmets a few more. But measurements showed that the [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|real effectiveness of RPD (at the workplace conditions)]] is strongly dependent on the conditions of their use, not only from the design, and this partly explains the difference in APF values. The APF for negative pressure half mask respirators are twofold. But this difference cannot be considered separately from recommendations for use of respirators. The use of half-face masks in the US is limited to 10 PEL for the \"worst case\" - work in the polluted atmosphere of 8 hours per day, 40 hours a week. But British experts took into account large experience of the use of negative pressure air purifying RPDs, and they concluded that to achieve continuous wear respirator 8 hours a day is impossible (because of the negative impact on the health of workers). For this reason,  they recommend to the employer to give the job to the workers so that they work in the polluted atmosphere not during entire shift, but only a part of the shift. The remaining time the employee needs to work in a non-polluted atmosphere (without the respirator). The fact that the employee is in a non-polluted atmosphere some part of working time provide additional protection of his health, and therefore, the requirements to the efficiency of the respirator may be less stringent.\n\nThe development of the Assigned PF in the United States and Britain were based on measurements of the effectiveness of respirators in the workplace (after statistical processing). Also used opinions of experts, based on the similarity of the respirators with different designs (for example, powered air purifying filtering respirators (PAPR), and a similar supplied air respirators SAR) - provided that the mode and the quantity of air supply, and the facepieces (masks) were the same. Experts in the two countries often used the results of the same studies of WPF (because of their limited number). For example, British standard<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /> had been developed with usage of results of 1897 WPF measurements during 31 studies; and 23 of this 31 studies had been conducted in United States.\n\nTherefore, the values of the assigned PF in the US and in the UK are evidence-based; and they are very similar to each other.\n\n== The values of the APF in EU and other countries ==\nStudies of respirator's performance was carried out not very often, and almost all of these studies were conducted in USA (and UK). It is possible that the lack of information about the RPD efficiency in the workplaces, was the reason behind developing these assigned PF in several European countries, whose values differ significantly from the evidence-based values of APFs in the US and UK.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | The Assigned Protection Factors for some main RPD types, developed in several [[European Union|EU]] countries<ref name=\"DIN-EN-529\" />\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | RPD type || colspan=\"4\" | APF in several EU countries\n|- \n!

For example, after the study<ref name=\"Tannahill-1990\" /> in 1990, the APF value of negative pressure full face masks was reduced from 900 to 40 (1997)<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /> in UK. But in other countries, similar research was not carried out; and a similar decrease did not occur.\n\nThe study<ref name=\"Tannahill-1990\" /> showed that the three models of full face masks had a significant leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and the face. The minimum values of the workplace protection factors (WPF) of each of the three negative pressure full face mask models were 11, 17 and 26. The maximum value of the WPF from one of the models did not exceed 500 no times at all. And for all results together, the WPF was not more than 100 in ~ 30% of the measurements. So, for this reason, the values of the APFs for this RPD type in Germany (400), Finland (500), Italy (400), and Sweden (500), may not fully take into account the lower this type respirators' performance at the workplace compared to the performance in the laboratory (during certification). The same was true for other RPD types and their APF.\n\nState standard in [[India]]<ref name=\"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f\" /> points to the need to use the workplace protection factors for restricting the permissible use of respirators, but does not set any values of the APFs. The standard also recommends the use of those PFs, which are obtained during the certification (in the laboratories, but not at workplaces). These values greatly exceed the values used in the USA and in the UK.\n\nThe [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] version of the EU standard EN 529 does not set any values of the APFs for the selection of respirator in this country.<ref name=\"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430\" /> This document only listed the values of APFs in several European countries (for reference); and declares the inadmissibility of the use of laboratory efficiency for predicting the protective properties at the workplace.\n\nThe APFs are not developed in [[Russia|RF]],<ref name=\"\u0413\u041e\u0421\u0422 \u0420\u0424\" /> in [[South Korea]], as well as in many other countries, and selection of respirators is not regulated by its national legislation. This contributes to errors, and the usage of such respirator's types, which are not able to reliably protect the workers due to its design (even at high quality of specific certified models).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"12\"| The Assigned Protection Factors'''<sup><big>1</big></sup>''' for different RPD types in several countries\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Facepiece type\n\n\u043f\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \n| colspan=\"10\" |  Country \n| rowspan=\"2\" | Minimum values,\n\n[[Workplace respirator testing|measured at the workplaces]]'''<sup><big>4</big></sup>'''\n|-\n| USA<ref name=\"OSHA-1910-134\">{{cite book|title=OSHA Standard: 29 Code of Federal Register 1910.134 \"Respiratory Protection\"|chapter-url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=12716|accessdate=4 June 2018|series=Personal Protective Equipment|year=2011|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration ([[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]])|language=en|chapter=1910.134(d)(3)(i)(A) Assigned Protection Factors (APFs)}}</ref> || United Kingdom<ref name=\"BSI-2005\">{{cite book|last=BSI PH/4 Committee|title=BS EN 529:2005 Respiratory protective devices.

Therefore, specialists have developed criteria for the selection of proper, adequate respirators, including the '''Assigned Protection Factors''' (APF) - the decrease of the concentration of harmful substances in the inhaled air, which (is expected) to be provided with timely and proper use of a certified respirator of certain types (''design'') by taught and trained [[Workforce|workers]] (after individual selection with a tight-fitting mask and [[Respirator fit test|fit testing]]), when the [[Employment|employer]] performs an effective respiratory protective device programme.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Self-contained breathing apparatus|Self Containing Breathing Apparatus]] (SCBA) with pressure-demand air supply mode into the full face mask.

These respirators must be sufficiently effective, and they should correspond to known or expected conditions at the workplace. However, the sole reliance on personal protective equipment for personnel is considered the least [[Hierarchy of hazard control|effective means of controlling hazards]], for reasons including: non-usage of the respirators in the contaminated atmosphere; leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and face; and [[Cartridges and canisters of air-purifying respirators#Replacement|delayed replacement of gas cartridges]].\n\n=== The effectiveness of respirators with different designs ===\nDifferent terms may be used to describe the protective properties of respirators:\n* '''Penetration''' = (the concentration of harmful substances under mask) / (concentration outside the mask);\n* '''Efficiency''' = <big>'''('''</big> (concentration outside the mask) - (the concentration of harmful substances under mask) <big>''')'''</big> / (concentration outside the mask) = 1 - Penetration;\n* '''Protection Factor''' (PF) = (the concentration of harmful substances on the outside of the mask) / (concentration under mask) = 1 / Penetration.\nThe term \"Protection Factor PF\" has been used in the U.S., and the term \"Penetration\" was used in the soviet literature from the 1960s.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, experts carried out measurements protective properties of respirators in the laboratories. They used different control substances ([[argon]],<ref name=\"Griffin-1970\" /> halogenated hydrocarbon vapour,<ref name=\"Hounam-1964\" /> [[aerosol]]s of [[sodium chloride]] and oil mist,<ref name=\"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439-1979\" /> [[fluorophore]]s,<ref name=\"Burgess-1961\" /> [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|dioctyl phthalate]],<ref name=\"30-CFR-14\" /><ref name=\"Hyatt-1972\" /> and others, and they measured their concentrations under the mask, and outside masks (simultaneously). The ratio of the measured concentrations is an indicator of the protective properties of different types of respirators. These measurements showed that if the efficiency of [[Cartridges and canisters of air-purifying respirators|filters]] is sufficiently high, then the gaps between the mask and the face become the main way of penetration of air contamination under the mask, in the same way that on a cold day, a person wearing a warm jacket and pants will lose most of their heat through the head and extremities. \n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace PF]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters. In-facepiece dust concentration is changed dozens of times in a matter of minutes due to changes of the size of the gaps between the mask and face. Source<ref name=\"Grinshpun-2005\" />]]\nThe shape and size of these gaps is not constant, and depends on many factors (the degree of fit the mask to the face - by shape and size; the correct donning the mask; the mask slippage on the face during the work due to execution of different movements; the design of the mask). The respirator's PF may change dozens of times during of several minutes; and the two average PF (''that were measured for the same worker in one day; for example - before and after the lunch break'') can differ by more than 12 000 times.<ref name=\"Zhuang-2003\" />\n\nExperts believed that the measurement of protection factors in the laboratory allows them to correctly evaluate, predict the RPD efficiency in the workplace conditions. But after the detection of cases of excessive harmful exposure on employees who used high quality respirators with [[HEPA]] particle filters in the [[Nuclear power|nuclear industry]] of the USA, the experts changed their opinion.<ref name=\"Patty-1985\" /> [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Studies have been carried out to measure the protection factors for the various types of respirators - not only in the laboratories, but also at the workplaces]].<ref name=\"Kirillov-2014\" /> Dozens of such field studies have shown that the performance of serviceable respiratory protective equipment at the workplaces may be significantly less than in laboratory conditions. Therefore, the usage of laboratory results to assess the real efficiency is incorrect; and can lead to a wrong choice of such respirators that can not reliably protect workers.\n\n=== Terminology to describe the different PF, and methods for APF development ===\nThe experts used the results of measurements at the laboratories and [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|at the workplaces]] to develop more completely terminology for description of the respirators' performance;<ref name=\"Letter-1\" /><ref name=\"Letter-2\" /><ref name=\"Letter-2+\" /><ref name=\"Letter-3\" /> and this terminology has been applied officially,<ref name=\"NIOSH-2004\" /> and in the preparation of research results for publication.<ref name=\"Letter-4\" /> Specialists began to use different terms to describe the protection factors, which were measured at workplaces with continuous use of respirators; and measured in the workplace when the workers used of respirators intermittently; measured not in the workplace while [[Respirator fit test|fit testing]]; measured in the laboratories under the simulation workplace's conditions; and for the protection factors, that can be expected (''in most cases'') when the workers properly used the respirators at the workplace.\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u044d\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044b PAPR en.jpg|thumb|350px|The diagram show 92 values of the Workplace PFs of PAPRs with loose-fitting facepieces (hood or helmet).

And instability of respirators' protective properties (for the same RPD design, and in the same usage conditions) prevented evaluate their efficiency. For solving these problems, scientists Donald Campbell and Steven Lenhart suggested to use the results of measurements of Workplace PF values for development of Assigned (''expected in practice'') PF values (APF) - as the '''lower''' [[Confidence interval|95% confidence interval]] of WPF values.<ref name=\"Lenhart-1984\" /> The results of measurements of WPF has been used in the development of APF by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] (for the recommended standard, that is not mandatory).<ref name=\"Nelson-1996\" /> The same was made during the development of the APF<ref name=\"FedRegAPF\" /> by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] (in the development of the standard,<ref name=\"Standard-US\" /> that is mandatory for the employer).\n\n=== Development of APF values for the various respirator types ===\nResults of measurements of WPF in the US and the UK became the basis for the development of APF for UK standard<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /> and for English version of EU standard.<ref name=\"DIN-EN-529\" />\nIn some cases, there was no information on the effectiveness for respirators of specific design (type) in the workplace. This is due to the fact that the measurement of workplace PF is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive work, which was carried out not very often. For these types of respirators experts used the results of WPF measurements of other types of respirators, which are similar. For example, the effectiveness of the Supplied Air Respirators (SARs, with hose) was considered similar to the efficiency of [[Powered air-purifying respirator|Powered Air Purifying Respirators]] (PAPRs), if they have the same facepieces and the same air supply mode. Finally, in the absence of this information, specialists could use the results of Simulated WPF measurements; or estimates of competent experts.<ref name=\"Nelson-1996\" />\n\n== Correction of Assigned PF values ==\nMeasurement of workplace protection factors surprisingly revealed the low efficiency of some designs of respirators, and that results have led to a sharp tightening of the requirements for application limits for respirators of such designs.\n[[File:\u0424\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u044e\u0448\u043e\u043d.JPG|thumb|150px|PAPR with hood.

It was a surprise, since earlier studies in the laboratory showed that the flow of clean filtered air from the inside to the outside of the helmet prevents ingress of harmful substances under the helmet (PF > 1000). Additional studies<ref name=\"Myers-1986\" /> have confirmed the result of the first study: the minimum values of the workplace protection factors of 2 models of respirators were 31 and 23; and leakage of unfiltered air achieved 16% in some cases in [[wind tunnel]] at 2&nbsp;m/s air velocity<ref name=\"Cecala-1981\" />\n\nTherefore, the use of such RPD types was limited 25 PEL in the U.S.,<ref name=\"Standard-US\" /> and 40 [[Occupational exposure limit|OEL]] in the UK.<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /><ref name=\"DIN-EN-529\" /> \n[[File:Workplace Protection Factors of full face masks.jpg|thumb|200px|Results of respirator Workplace Protection Factors (WPF) measurement.

But the study<ref name=\"Tannahill-1990\" /> showed that the value of the protection factor of > 900 has been achieved in practice infrequently. Minimum protection factors of 3 different models of full facepiece respirators were 11, 18 and 26. So, the new standards<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /><ref name=\"DIN-EN-529\" /> limit usage of these respirators up to 40 OEL in UK (after this study).\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430 MSA.jpg|thumb|150px|Negative pressure full face masks, possible APF decreased from 100 to 10]]\n* Negative pressure half mask respirators (after fit testing)\n[[Respirator fit test|Fit testing]] of tight-fitting masks of negative-pressure respirators became widely used in US industry in 1980-s. At the beginning, it was thought that the half-mask fit quite well to the worker's face, if during a fit test the protection factor (fit factor) is not less than 10 (later, experts began to use [[Factor of safety|\"safety factor\"]] = 10 during the fit test; threshold fit factor become 10 \u00d7 10 = 100). The widespread use of fit testing in the industry gives professionals optimism, and they allowed to the employers restrict the use of half mask respirators in accordance with the values of worker's personal fit factor (the maximum concentration of pollutants = personal Fit Factor \u00d7 PEL), but not more than 100 \u00d7 PEL. However, scientific studies have shown that although such test increases the effectiveness of protection, the risk of leakage of large amounts of unfiltered air is maintained. Furthermore, the studies have shown that non-filtered air under the mask is not uniformly mixed with the filtered air, which leads to large errors in the measurement of the in-facepiece concentration of contaminants, and subsequent calculations of fit factors - the latter is often much smaller than the \"measured\" value. So, specialists recommend not allowed usage negative pressure half mask respirators then harmful substances' concentrations exceeds 10 PEL.<ref name=\"Bollinger-1988\" /> Therefore, OSHA standards require to restrict using of half-mask negative-pressure respirators up to 10 PEL after obtaining fit factor greater than or equal to 100 during the mask selection for the worker (they used a [[Factor of safety|safety factor]] = 10).\n\n== Comparison of APF in the US and the UK ==\nThe table lists the APF values for the most common respirator types (for US and UK). \n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible \" style=\"text-align:center\" collapsed\n! colspan=\"4\" | The Assigned Protection Factors for some main (''equivalent'') RPD types ''(developed on the basis of results of Workplace Protection Factors studies)'' \n|-\n!

The difference between PAPR with helmets a few more. But measurements showed that the [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|real effectiveness of RPD (at the workplace conditions)]] is strongly dependent on the conditions of their use, not only from the design, and this partly explains the difference in APF values. The APF for negative pressure half mask respirators are twofold. But this difference cannot be considered separately from recommendations for use of respirators. The use of half-face masks in the US is limited to 10 PEL for the \"worst case\" - work in the polluted atmosphere of 8 hours per day, 40 hours a week. But British experts took into account large experience of the use of negative pressure air purifying RPDs, and they concluded that to achieve continuous wear respirator 8 hours a day is impossible (because of the negative impact on the health of workers). For this reason,  they recommend to the employer to give the job to the workers so that they work in the polluted atmosphere not during entire shift, but only a part of the shift. The remaining time the employee needs to work in a non-polluted atmosphere (without the respirator). The fact that the employee is in a non-polluted atmosphere some part of working time provide additional protection of his health, and therefore, the requirements to the efficiency of the respirator may be less stringent.\n\nThe development of the Assigned PF in the United States and Britain were based on measurements of the effectiveness of respirators in the workplace (after statistical processing). Also used opinions of experts, based on the similarity of the respirators with different designs (for example, powered air purifying filtering respirators (PAPR), and a similar supplied air respirators SAR) - provided that the mode and the quantity of air supply, and the facepieces (masks) were the same. Experts in the two countries often used the results of the same studies of WPF (because of their limited number). For example, British standard<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /> had been developed with usage of results of 1897 WPF measurements during 31 studies; and 23 of this 31 studies had been conducted in United States.\n\nTherefore, the values of the assigned PF in the US and in the UK are evidence-based; and they are very similar to each other.\n\n== The values of the APF in EU and other countries ==\nStudies of respirator's performance was carried out not very often, and almost all of these studies were conducted in USA (and UK). It is possible that the lack of information about the RPD efficiency in the workplaces, was the reason behind developing these assigned PF in several European countries, whose values differ significantly from the evidence-based values of APFs in the US and UK.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | The Assigned Protection Factors for some main RPD types, developed in several [[European Union|EU]] countries<ref name=\"DIN-EN-529\" />\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | RPD type || colspan=\"4\" | APF in several EU countries\n|- \n!

Therefore, it may be that some countries do not take full account of results of foreign researches (that showed a significant difference between the effectiveness of respirators in a laboratory environment; and in applying them in the workplaces). For example, after the study<ref name=\"Tannahill-1990\" /> in 1990, the APF value of negative pressure full face masks was reduced from 900 to 40 (1997)<ref name=\"BS-4275\" /> in UK. But in other countries, similar research was not carried out; and a similar decrease did not occur.\n\nThe study<ref name=\"Tannahill-1990\" /> showed that the three models of full face masks had a significant leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and the face. The minimum values of the workplace protection factors (WPF) of each of the three negative pressure full face mask models were 11, 17 and 26. The maximum value of the WPF from one of the models did not exceed 500 no times at all. And for all results together, the WPF was not more than 100 in ~ 30% of the measurements. So, for this reason, the values of the APFs for this RPD type in Germany (400), Finland (500), Italy (400), and Sweden (500), may not fully take into account the lower this type respirators' performance at the workplace compared to the performance in the laboratory (during certification). The same was true for other RPD types and their APF.\n\nState standard in [[India]]<ref name=\"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f\" /> points to the need to use the workplace protection factors for restricting the permissible use of respirators, but does not set any values of the APFs. The standard also recommends the use of those PFs, which are obtained during the certification (in the laboratories, but not at workplaces). These values greatly exceed the values used in the USA and in the UK.\n\nThe [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] version of the EU standard EN 529 does not set any values of the APFs for the selection of respirator in this country.<ref name=\"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430\" /> This document only listed the values of APFs in several European countries (for reference); and declares the inadmissibility of the use of laboratory efficiency for predicting the protective properties at the workplace.\n\nThe APFs are not developed in [[Russia|RF]],<ref name=\"\u0413\u041e\u0421\u0422 \u0420\u0424\" /> in [[South Korea]], as well as in many other countries, and selection of respirators is not regulated by its national legislation. This contributes to errors, and the usage of such respirator's types, which are not able to reliably protect the workers due to its design (even at high quality of specific certified models).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"12\"| The Assigned Protection Factors'''<sup><big>1</big></sup>''' for different RPD types in several countries\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Facepiece type\n\n\u043f\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \n| colspan=\"10\" |  Country \n| rowspan=\"2\" | Minimum values,\n\n[[Workplace respirator testing|measured at the workplaces]]'''<sup><big>4</big></sup>'''\n|-\n| USA<ref name=\"OSHA-1910-134\">{{cite book|title=OSHA Standard: 29 Code of Federal Register 1910.134 \"Respiratory Protection\"|chapter-url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=12716|accessdate=4 June 2018|series=Personal Protective Equipment|year=2011|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration ([[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]])|language=en|chapter=1910.134(d)(3)(i)(A) Assigned Protection Factors (APFs)}}</ref> || United Kingdom<ref name=\"BSI-2005\">{{cite book|last=BSI PH/4 Committee|title=BS EN 529:2005 Respiratory protective devices.

The results of such measurements are used to assess whether short-term inhalation of harmful substances may lead to irreversible and significant deterioration of health, or death ([[Immediately dangerous to life or health|IDLH concentrations]]). If concentrations exceed the IDLH, the standard allows the use of only the most reliable respirators - SAR or self-contained breathing apparatus: with pressure-demand air supply in the full facepiece mask ( \u00a7(d)(2)<ref name=\"Standard-US\" />).\n\nIf the concentration of a harmful substance is less than the IDLH, the coefficient of air pollution for the harmful substance (Hazard Factor) is determined, which is equal to the ratio of this concentration to the PEL (TLV, OEL) for the harmful substance. The APF of the selected respirator type must equal or exceed the Hazard Factor.<ref name=\"NIOSH-2004\" /><ref name=\"NIOSH-1987\" />\n\nIf there are several harmful substances in the workplace air, then the selected respirator must meet the following requirement:<ref name=\"NIOSH-2004\" />\n\nC<sub>'''1'''</sub>/(APF\u00d7PEL<sub>'''1'''</sub>) + C<sub>'''2'''</sub>/(APF\u00d7PEL<sub>'''2'''</sub> ) + C<sub>'''3'''</sub>/(APF\u00d7PEL<sub>'''3'''</sub> ) + ... + Cn/(APF\u00d7PELn) \u2264 1\n\nwhere C<sub>'''1'''</sub>, C<sub>'''2'''</sub> ... and Cn are the concentrations of harmful substances number 1, 2 ... n; and [[Permissible exposure limit|PEL]] is the maximum allowable concentration for corresponding harmful substances in the breathing zone.\n\nIf this requirement is not met, the employer needs to choose a different type of respirator, which has a greater APF value.\n\nIn all cases, if they employer selects a respirator with tight-fitting facepiece (full face mask, elastomeric half-mask or quarter-mask, or filtering facepiece respirator), all employee must be [[Respirator fit test|fit tested]] (''to prevent the leakage of unfiltered polluted air through gaps between their faces and the tight-fitting masks, which may not match to their faces'').

{"title_page": "Biharmonic equation", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], the '''biharmonic equation''' is a fourth-order [[partial differential equation]] which arises in areas of [[continuum mechanics]], including [[linear elasticity]] theory and the solution of [[Stokes flow]]s. Specifically, it is used in the modeling of thin structures that react [[Elasticity (physics)|elastically]] to external forces.\n\n== Notation ==\nIt is written as\n\n:<math>\\nabla^4\\varphi=0</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>\\nabla^2\\nabla^2\\varphi=0</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>\\Delta^2\\varphi=0</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nabla^4</math>, which is the fourth power of the [[del]] operator and the square of the [[Laplacian]] operator <math>\\nabla^2</math> (or <math>\\Delta</math>), is known as the '''biharmonic operator''' or the '''bilaplacian operator'''.  In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it can be written in <math>n</math> dimensions as:\n\n: <math>\n\\nabla^4\\varphi=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n\\partial_i\\partial_i\\partial_j\\partial_j \\varphi.\n</math>\n\nFor example, in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinates]] the biharmonic equation has the form\n\n: <math>\n{\\partial^4 \\varphi\\over \\partial x^4 } +\n{\\partial^4 \\varphi\\over \\partial y^4 } +\n{\\partial^4 \\varphi\\over \\partial z^4 }+ \n2{\\partial^4 \\varphi\\over \\partial x^2\\partial y^2}+\n2{\\partial^4 \\varphi\\over \\partial y^2\\partial z^2}+\n2{\\partial^4 \\varphi\\over \\partial x^2\\partial z^2} = 0.\n</math>\n\nAs another example, in ''n''-dimensional [[Real coordinate space]] without the origin <math>\\left( \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\mathbf 0 \\right) </math>,\n\n:<math>\\nabla^4 \\left({1\\over r}\\right)= {3(15-8n+n^2)\\over r^5}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>r=\\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\\cdots+x_n^2}.</math>\n\nwhich shows, for ''n=3 and n=5'' only, <math>\\frac{1}{r}</math> is a solution to the biharmonic equation.\n\nA solution to the biharmonic equation is called a '''biharmonic function'''.

cervical chiropractic treatment technique created by [[Frederick M. Vogel]] and [[Roy W. Sweat]] in 1979. It is a technique which uses a percussion instrument in attempts to adjust what is measured from specific X-rays and found to be a [[vertebral subluxation]]. It is based on the teachings of [[B. J. Palmer]], who advocated the Hole-In-One version of [[spinal adjustment]]. It is primarily used by [[Chiropractic#Straights and mixers|straight]] chiropractors. Referring to the origins of upper cervical techniques, Dan Murphy, DC, DABCO, wrote: \"Over the past 100 years, the practice of chiropractic has branched into dozens of specialty techniques. However, historically, for a third of this time, from the 1930s into the 1960s, the predominant practice of chiropractic involved primarily the upper cervical spine.\"<ref name=Eriksen>Eriksen K.

The device is categorized as a mechanical force manual assisted (MFMA) instrument which is generally regarded as a softer chiropractic treatment technique.\n\nThe activator is a small handheld spring-loaded instrument which delivers a small impulse to the spine. It was found to give off no more than 0.3 J of kinetic energy in a 3-millisecond pulse.  The aim is to produce enough force to move the vertebrae but not enough to cause injury.<ref name=Fuhr2005>{{cite journal |last=Fuhr |first=Arlan W. |author2= J.

Often one leg will seem to be shorter than the other.  The chiropractor then carries out a series of muscle tests such as having the patient move their arms in a certain position in order to activate the muscles attached to specific vertebrae.  If the leg lengths are not the same, that is taken as a sign that the problem is located at that vertebra. The chiropractor treats problems found in this way moving progressively along the spine in the direction from the feet towards the head.<ref name=Fuhr2005/>\n\nAlthough prone \"functional leg length\" is a widely used chiropractic tool, it is not a recognized [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]] technique, since legs are often of unequal length, and measurements in the prone position are not entirely valid estimates of standing X-ray differences.<ref name=Rhodes_prone>D W Rhodes, E R Mansfield, P A Bishop, J F Smith.

cervical chiropractic treatment technique created by [[Frederick M. Vogel]] and [[Roy W. Sweat]] in 1979. It is a technique which uses a percussion instrument in attempts to adjust what is measured from specific X-rays and found to be a [[vertebral subluxation]]. It is based on the teachings of [[B. J. Palmer]], who advocated the Hole-In-One version of [[spinal adjustment]]. It is primarily used by [[Chiropractic#Straights and mixers|straight]] chiropractors. Referring to the origins of upper cervical techniques, Dan Murphy, DC, DABCO, wrote: \"Over the past 100 years, the practice of chiropractic has branched into dozens of specialty techniques. However, historically, for a third of this time, from the 1930s into the 1960s, the predominant practice of chiropractic involved primarily the upper cervical spine.\"<ref name=Eriksen>Eriksen K.

The device is categorized as a mechanical force manual assisted (MFMA) instrument which is generally regarded as a softer chiropractic treatment technique.\n\nThe activator is a small handheld spring-loaded instrument which delivers a small impulse to the spine. It was found to give off no more than 0.3 J of kinetic energy in a 3-millisecond pulse.  The aim is to produce enough force to move the vertebrae but not enough to cause injury.<ref name=Fuhr2005>{{cite journal |last=Fuhr |first=Arlan W. |author2= J.

Often one leg will seem to be shorter than the other.  The chiropractor then carries out a series of muscle tests such as having the patient move their arms in a certain position in order to activate the muscles attached to specific vertebrae.  If the leg lengths are not the same, that is taken as a sign that the problem is located at that vertebra. The chiropractor treats problems found in this way moving progressively along the spine in the direction from the feet towards the head.<ref name=Fuhr2005/>\n\nAlthough prone \"functional leg length\" is a widely used chiropractic tool, it is not a recognized [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]] technique, since legs are often of unequal length, and measurements in the prone position are not entirely valid estimates of standing X-ray differences.<ref name=Rhodes_prone>D W Rhodes, E R Mansfield, P A Bishop, J F Smith.

Buffalo's no-huddle offense led the league in rushing yards (2,436) and ranked second in the league in total offensive yards (6,114 yards).  The main keys to their success would be their four future hall of fame players on offense: Quarterback [[Jim Kelly]], running back [[Thurman Thomas]], and receivers [[Andre Reed]] and [[James Lofton]].  Buffalo also had a Hall of Fame defensive end, [[Bruce Smith]], who would go on to become the NFL's all time leader in sacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Houston Oilers finished in second place in the [[AFC Central|AFC Central Division]] with a 10\u20136 record. Houston's [[run and shoot offense]] led the league in passing (4,231 yards) and its defense ranked third in the league, allowing only 4,532 total yards. Overall, the team boasted nine pro bowl selections, including their quarterback [[Warren Moon]] (despite missing six games with injuries) and three wide receivers, [[Curtis Duncan]],  [[Haywood Jeffires]], and [[Ernest Givins]].  The Oilers also had a powerful running attack with [[Lorenzo White]], who rushed for 1,226 yards and caught 57 passes.\n\nThe Bills and Oilers had faced each other for the final game of the regular season, with Houston defeating Buffalo, 27\u20133 in Houston. During that game, Kelly suffered strained ligaments in his knee, leaving backup quarterback [[Frank Reich]] to finish the game in his place.  Reich completed a mere 11 of 23 passes for 99 yards, with 2 interceptions and a passer rating of 23.6.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199212270oti.htm</ref> With Kelly out, Reich would take the reins starting in place of Kelly the following week in the wild card game, which Buffalo hosted. Reich would also start the following divisional playoff game in [[Pittsburgh]] in which Buffalo also won 24\u20133 to advance to the AFC Championship game the following week versus the [[Miami Dolphins]].\n\nIn addition to losing Kelly, injuries would also rob Buffalo of one of their best defensive players for the upcoming wildcard game:  linebacker [[Cornelius Bennett]].\n\n===Reich and the biggest comeback in college football history===\nAs the backup quarterback for the [[Maryland Terrapins]], Reich replaced starter [[Stan Gelbaugh]] on November 10, 1984, and led the Terrapins back from a first-half deficit of 31\u20130 to a 42\u201340 victory over the [[University of Miami|Miami Hurricanes]] under [[Bernie Kosar]]. This college record stood until being broken by the [[2006 Michigan State vs. Northwestern football game|2006 Michigan State vs. Northwestern game]].\n\n==Game summary==\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle= {{NFLPrimaryStyle|Buffalo Bills|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=1992\u201393 AFC Wild Card: Houston Oilers at Buffalo Bills \u2013 Game summary\n |date=January 3, 1993\n |time=12:30 p.m. EST\n |road=Oilers\n |R1=7|R2=21|R3=7|R4=3|R5=0\n |home='''Bills'''\n |H1=3|H2=0|H3=28|H4=7|H5=3\n |stadium=[[New Era Field|Rich Stadium]], [[Buffalo, New York]]\n |attendance=75,141\n |weather=34\u00b0F, Sunny\n |referee=[[Gerald Austin]]\n |TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Charlie Jones (sportscaster)|Charlie Jones]] and [[Todd Christensen]]\n |reference=[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199301030buf.htm Boxscore]\n |scoring=\n;First quarter\n*HOU [[Haywood Jeffires]] 3 yard pass from Moon ([[Al Del Greco]] kick)\n*BUF [[Steve Christie]] 36 yard FG\n;Second quarter\n*HOU [[Webster Slaughter]] 7 yard pass from Moon (Del Greco kick)\n*HOU [[Curtis Duncan]] 26 yard pass from Moon (Del Greco kick)\n*HOU Jeffires 27 yard pass from Moon (Del Greco kick)\n;Third quarter\n*HOU [[Bubba McDowell]] 58 yard interception return (Del Greco kick)\n*BUF Davis 1 yard run (Christie kick)\n*BUF [[Don Beebe]] 38 yard pass from Reich (Christie kick)\n*BUF Reed 26 yard pass from Reich (Christie kick)\n*BUF Reed 18 yard pass from Reich (Christie kick)\n;Fourth quarter\n*BUF Reed 17 yard pass from Reich (Christie kick)\n*HOU Del Greco 26 yard FG\n;Overtime\n*BUF Christie 32 yard FG\n |stats=\n;Top passers\n* HOU \u2013 [[Warren Moon]] \u2013 36/50, 371 YDS, 4 TD, 2 INT\n* BUF \u2013 [[Frank Reich]] \u2013 21/34, 289 YDS, 4 TD, INT\n;Top rushers\n* HOU \u2013 [[Lorenzo White]] \u2013 19 CAR, 75 YDS\n* BUF \u2013 [[Kenneth Davis (American football)|Kenneth Davis]] \u2013 13 CAR, 68 YDS, TD\n;Top receivers\n* HOU \u2013 [[Ernest Givins]] \u2013 9 REC, 117 YDS\n* BUF \u2013 [[Andre Reed]] \u2013 8 REC, 136 YDS, 3 TD\n}}\n\n===First half===\n\nHouston dominated the game early, as quarterback [[Warren Moon]] completed 19 of 22 passes for 218 yards and 4 touchdowns in the first half, while the Oilers held the ball for 21:12, keeping the Bills' high-powered offense off the field for most of the first two quarters. On the opening drive of the first quarter, Moon completed 6 of 7 passes on an 80-yard scoring drive that took over 9 minutes off the clock and ended it with his first touchdown throw to wide receiver [[Haywood Jeffires]] for 3 yards to give the Oilers a 7\u20130 lead.  Buffalo responded on their ensuing drive, as [[Kenneth Davis (American football)|Kenneth Davis]] returned the kickoff 33 yards to the 44-yard line.  Reich subsequently led the Bills to the Oilers 18-yard line where [[Steve Christie]] made a 36-yard field goal, to cut the score to 7\u20133.  But Moon struck right back, leading the Oilers on a second quarter scoring drive that was nearly identical to their first one, completing 6 of 7 passes on another 80-yard drive and finishing it with a 7-yard touchdown pass to [[Webster Slaughter]]. Then after forcing the Bills to a [[three-and-out]], Moon threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to [[Curtis Duncan]]. Later on, with 1:15 left in the half, the Oilers drove for another touchdown, aided by an encroachment call against the Bills on fourth down and 1. Moon completed the drive with his second touchdown pass to Jeffires, this one a 27-yarder, and the Oilers went into their locker room with a 28\u20133 halftime lead.\n\n===Second half===\nIn the Bills' locker room, Defensive Coordinator [[Walt Corey]] angrily chided the defense. \"I was hollering the same things the fans were hollering at me when we left the field\", Corey says. \"I can't repeat the words, but the more I talked, the louder I got. The thing that bothered me was their approach. To me, they looked timid. They looked like they were going to get in the right spots, but they weren't going to make anything happen afterward. This is an attitude game. Sometimes you start playing and you're afraid to make things happen or afraid to make a mistake.\" Nose Tackle [[Jeff Wright (defensive tackle)|Jeff Wright]] recalled \"With every word that came out of Walt's mouth, he reached a new temperature level, until he finally just exploded. He had every right to say the things that he said. We were embarrassing him, we were embarrassing ourselves, we were embarrassing Buffalo Bills fans.\"\n\nMeanwhile, head coach [[Marv Levy]] told his team, \"You've got thirty more minutes. Maybe it's the last thirty minutes of your season. When your season's over, you're going to have to live with yourselves and look yourselves in the eyes. You'd well better have reason to feel good about yourselves, regardless of how this game turns out.\"<ref name=billszone>{{cite web|url=http://www.billszone.com/mtlog/archives/2003/10/03/greatest_games_1993_afc_wild_card_gamebills_41_oilers_38_ot.php|title=Greatest Games: 1993 AFC Wild Card Game Bills 41, Oilers 38 (OT)|publisher=Billszone.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608090426/http://www.billszone.com/mtlog/archives/2003/10/03/greatest_games_1993_afc_wild_card_gamebills_41_oilers_38_ot.php|archivedate=2007-06-08}}</ref> [[Steve Tasker]] praised the \"brilliance in his simplicity ... We had been in two Super Bowls, and he appealed to our pride. It wound up working\".{{r|tasker2013}}\n\nReminding Reich about his comeback while at Maryland, Kelly said \"maybe lightning will strike twice\" as the team began the second half.{{r|tasker2013}} The Bills started the 2nd half on their own 36 yard line, and apparently, the words of Corey and Levy did not have any immediate effect, because 1:41 into the third quarter, and on a 3rd and 9, Reich threw a pass that bounced off the hands of tight end [[Keith McKeller]] and went into the arms of defensive back [[Bubba McDowell]], who returned the interception 58 yards for a touchdown. Houston now had a 32-point lead, 35\u20133; it was only the second time all season the Oilers had broken 30 points scored in a game. The Bills' misfortunes were compounded with the loss of [[Thurman Thomas]], who had to leave the game due to a hip injury on the drive, forcing Buffalo to attempt a comeback with a second-string backfield of Reich and Davis.\n \nA Houston radio announcer was immortalized on [[NFL Films]] with the statement \"The lights are on here at Rich Stadium, they've been on since this morning, you could pretty much turn them out on the Bills right now.\"<ref name=billszone/>\n\nThe Bills got a huge assist to start their comeback on the ensuing kickoff. The wind shifted the ball just before it was kicked by [[Al Del Greco]]. As a result, it became an unintentional squib kick that the Bills recovered with great field position at midfield. Buffalo then drove 50 yards in 10 plays, including a pass to [[Pete Metzelaars]] that went right through the hands of linebacker Eddie Robinson, and scored with a 1-yard touchdown run by Davis, cutting the deficit to 35\u201310 when the extra point was added. On the drive, Reich completed a 24-yard pass to tight end Metzelaars and a 16-yard strike to [[Andre Reed]], while Davis kept the drive going with a 5-yard run on fourth down and 2 before finishing it off with a touchdown run with 8:52 left in the 3rd quarter.\n\nThe Bills, still with a 25 point deficit, tried an [[onside kick]]. Steve Christie, Buffalo's kicker and punter recovered his own onside kick and the Bills scored on the fourth play of their ensuing drive with Reich's 38-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Don Beebe]]. One of Beebe's feet went partially out of bounds during the run before he made the catch, and it should have been ruled by the officials as an illegal touching of the football; this was pointed out on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[NFL Primetime]]'' postgame recap as well as by Todd Christensen on the NBC broadcast, but no penalty was called on the play, and at the time the NFL did not have any replay challenge system to challenge the call. The extra point made the score 35\u201317 with 7:46 left in the third quarter.\n\nHouston was then forced to punt for the first time in the game on their next drive, and [[Greg Montgomery]]'s 25-yard kick gave Buffalo the ball at their own 41-yard line. Reich started out the ensuing drive with an 18-yard completion to [[James Lofton]]. Davis gained 20 yards on a screen pass and then Reich threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Reed, trimming the lead (after making the extra point) to 35\u201324. In a span of 10 minutes in the third quarter, the Bills had run 18 plays, gained 176 yards, and scored 21 points, while holding the Oilers' offense to 3 plays for 3 yards.\n\nThe situation did not get any better for Houston. On the first play of the Oilers' ensuing possession, Moon's pass was tipped off the hands of Slaughter; Bills' safety [[Henry Jones (American football)|Henry Jones]] intercepted the pass from Moon and returned it 15 yards to the Houston 23-yard line. Three plays later, Buffalo faced fourth down and five on the 18-yard line. Rather than attempt a field goal, Reich connected with Reed for the touchdown. With the score (including the extra point), the Bills had cut their deficit from 32 points to four in a span of just 6:52. On the Oilers' next drive, linebacker [[Darryl Talley]] forced a fumble from Moon while sacking him. Houston recovered the fumble, but they were forced to punt, and Montgomery's 24-yard kick gave Buffalo the ball at its 48-yard line. In the third quarter, Buffalo had outscored Houston 28\u20137 while holding Moon to 2 of 7 completions for 19 yards.\n\nThis time, the Bills could not take advantage of their excellent starting field position and had to punt. Moon's run and shoot offense began to move the ball effectively again, aided by a roughing the passer penalty on [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]] that negated linebacker [[Carlton Bailey]]'s interception. Despite two sacks by Wright on the drive, Houston reached the Buffalo 14-yard line. [[Al Del Greco]] attempted a field goal to increase the Oilers' lead, but Montgomery fumbled the snap. Talley recovered the ball and returned it 70 yards, but officials ruled him down by contact when he made the initial recovery, giving Buffalo the ball on their own 26-yard line. After two plays, the Bills faced third down and four. With Houston's defense dropping back and expecting a pass, Reich handed the ball off to Davis, who stormed through the line and took off for a 35-yard gain. Only a diving tackle from defensive back [[Steve Jackson (defensive back)|Steve Jackson]] prevented Davis from taking it all the way for a touchdown. Then Reich went back to passing the ball, completing a short pass to Reed at the Oilers' 17-yard line on third down and two for the first down. With just 3:08 left in the fourth quarter, Reich threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Reed, giving Buffalo its first lead of the game 38\u201335 (after the extra point); for the first time all season, the Houston defense (ninth in fewest points allowed that season) had allowed over 29 points.  But Moon led Houston downfield on a 63-yard drive to score the tying 26-yard field goal from Del Greco to send the game into overtime. A key play on the drive was an 18-yard completion to Slaughter on fourth down and four from the Bills' 34-yard line.\n\n===Overtime===\nHouston won the coin toss and got the ball at its 20-yard line. Moon started out the drive with two completions for 7 yards, but his 50th pass attempt of the day turned out to be his last. On third down and three, Moon threw a pass intended for Ernest Givins five yards downfield.  Givins was not able to get to the ball and it ended up further downfield into the arms of defensive back [[Nate Odomes]] for an interception.  After a 2-yard return, Jeffires committed a 15-yard facemask penalty while making the tackle, giving Buffalo a first down on Houston's 20-yard line.  Game commentators examined the replay and strongly asserted that Givins was held on the play by Darryl Talley.  However, the referees assessed no holding penalty against Buffalo, so they retained possession.  After two runs by Davis, Christie kicked a 32-yard field goal to give Buffalo the win, 41\u201338.\n\nReich finished the game with 21 of 34 pass completions for 289 yards and 4 touchdowns, with 1 interception. Reed had 8 catches for 136 yards and 3 touchdowns. Davis rushed for 68 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 2 passes for 25 yards and returning a kickoff for 33. Moon recorded 36 of 50 completions for 371 yards and 4 touchdowns, with 2 interceptions.  His 36 completions set a playoff record that would stand until broken by [[Drew Brees]]'s 39 completions in 2010 (Brees's [[New Orleans Saints]] also lost that game). Givins caught 9 passes for 117 yards. Jeffires recorded 8 catches for 98 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\n==Aftermath==\nMany left the stadium while the Oilers had the large lead; Tasker recalled \"seeing so many empty seats\" in the third quarter{{r|tasker2013}} and Reich saw \"a big wave of people leaving\", which ''Buffalo News'' reporter Vic Carucci described as \"they're pouring out of the gates, getting in their cars, driving home\". They returned when they heard on the radio of the Bills' comeback; tickets did not permit reentry, so people climbed fences until the stadium reopened the gates. Team general manager [[Bill Polian]] recalled how the same fans who had left in disgust after denouncing to him the Bills' inability to beat the Oilers, ran back to their seats praising the team. Kelly said, \"the old saying was, 'Did you know that 150,000 people went to the Buffalo Bills football game?'\", Levy said \"70,000 people were at that game. I've already met 400,000 of them\", and Tasker joked \"I've met 1.2 million people who say they were in the stadium\".<ref name=\"30for30\">{{cite episode | title=Four Falls of Buffalo | series=30 for 30 | network=ESPN | airdate=2015-12-12 | season=3 | url=http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=fourfalls}}</ref>\n\nTasker said of the game:<ref name=\"tasker2013\">{{Cite book |title=The Buffalo Bills: My Life on a Special Team |last=Tasker |first=Steve |last2=Pitoniak | first2=Scott | publisher=Sports Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-61321-328-5 |chapter=4: It Ain't Over Till It's Over |lccn=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|It's probably bigger in Buffalo than the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|Ice Bowl]] is in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] or the [[Immaculate Reception]] is in [[Pittsburgh]], because those cities have experienced eight Super Bowls between them.

The Rockets went to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] down 0\u20132 in the best-of-seven series. It was feared at the time that the Rockets would follow the same fate as the Oilers did. During this era, no Houston-based professional sports team from an existing sports league (the NFL, NBA, or [[Major League Baseball]]) had won a championship. The Rockets, however, would rally to win the series and go on to [[Clutch City|win NBA championships in 1994 and 1995]].\n\nIn addition, the Oilers' loss marked the beginning of a turbulent period for the franchise. The team suffered a drama-filled 1\u20134 start the [[1993 Houston Oilers season|following season]], including a blowout loss in a rematch with the Bills, before winning the final eleven games of the season to clinch what would become their final playoff appearance in Houston. After losing in the divisional round to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] at home, Oilers owner [[Bud Adams]] cut or traded many of his team's star players, and the Oilers suffered through three losing seasons before deciding to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] (with an interim stop in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in 1997) to eventually become the [[Tennessee Titans]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Houston '93 |series=A Football Life |series-link=A Football Life |network=NFL Network |date=December 10, 2013 |season=3 |number=15}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nChristie's kicking shoe from the game is in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in [[Canton, Ohio]].

Buffalo's no-huddle offense led the league in rushing yards (2,436) and ranked second in the league in total offensive yards (6,114 yards).  The main keys to their success would be their four future hall of fame players on offense: Quarterback [[Jim Kelly]], running back [[Thurman Thomas]], and receivers [[Andre Reed]] and [[James Lofton]].  Buffalo also had a Hall of Fame defensive end, [[Bruce Smith]], who would go on to become the NFL's all time leader in sacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Houston Oilers finished in second place in the [[AFC Central|AFC Central Division]] with a 10\u20136 record. Houston's [[run and shoot offense]] led the league in passing (4,231 yards) and its defense ranked third in the league, allowing only 4,532 total yards. Overall, the team boasted nine pro bowl selections, including their quarterback [[Warren Moon]] (despite missing six games with injuries) and three wide receivers, [[Curtis Duncan]],  [[Haywood Jeffires]], and [[Ernest Givins]].  The Oilers also had a powerful running attack with [[Lorenzo White]], who rushed for 1,226 yards and caught 57 passes.\n\nThe Bills and Oilers had faced each other for the final game of the regular season, with Houston defeating Buffalo, 27\u20133 in Houston. During that game, Kelly suffered strained ligaments in his knee, leaving backup quarterback [[Frank Reich]] to finish the game in his place.  Reich completed a mere 11 of 23 passes for 99 yards, with 2 interceptions and a passer rating of 23.6.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199212270oti.htm</ref> With Kelly out, Reich would take the reins starting in place of Kelly the following week in the wild card game, which Buffalo hosted. Reich would also start the following divisional playoff game in [[Pittsburgh]] in which Buffalo also won 24\u20133 to advance to the AFC Championship game the following week versus the [[Miami Dolphins]].\n\nIn addition to losing Kelly, injuries would also rob Buffalo of one of their best defensive players for the upcoming wildcard game:  linebacker [[Cornelius Bennett]].\n\n===Reich and the biggest comeback in college football history===\nAs the backup quarterback for the [[Maryland Terrapins]], Reich replaced starter [[Stan Gelbaugh]] on November 10, 1984, and led the Terrapins back from a first-half deficit of 31\u20130 to a 42\u201340 victory over the [[University of Miami|Miami Hurricanes]] under [[Bernie Kosar]]. This college record stood until being broken by the [[2006 Michigan State vs. Northwestern football game|2006 Michigan State vs. Northwestern game]].\n\n==Game summary==\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle= {{NFLPrimaryStyle|Buffalo Bills|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=1992\u201393 AFC Wild Card: Houston Oilers at Buffalo Bills \u2013 Game summary\n |date=January 3, 1993\n |time=12:30 p.m. EST\n |road=Oilers\n |R1=7|R2=21|R3=7|R4=3|R5=0\n |home='''Bills'''\n |H1=3|H2=0|H3=28|H4=7|H5=3\n |stadium=[[New Era Field|Rich Stadium]], [[Buffalo, New York]]\n |attendance=75,141\n |weather=34\u00b0F, Sunny\n |referee=[[Gerald Austin]]\n |TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Charlie Jones (sportscaster)|Charlie Jones]] and [[Todd Christensen]]\n |reference=[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199301030buf.htm Boxscore]\n |scoring=\n;First quarter\n*HOU [[Haywood Jeffires]] 3 yard pass from Moon ([[Al Del Greco]] kick)\n*BUF [[Steve Christie]] 36 yard FG\n;Second quarter\n*HOU [[Webster Slaughter]] 7 yard pass from Moon (Del Greco kick)\n*HOU [[Curtis Duncan]] 26 yard pass from Moon (Del Greco kick)\n*HOU Jeffires 27 yard pass from Moon (Del Greco kick)\n;Third quarter\n*HOU [[Bubba McDowell]] 58 yard interception return (Del Greco kick)\n*BUF Davis 1 yard run (Christie kick)\n*BUF [[Don Beebe]] 38 yard pass from Reich (Christie kick)\n*BUF Reed 26 yard pass from Reich (Christie kick)\n*BUF Reed 18 yard pass from Reich (Christie kick)\n;Fourth quarter\n*BUF Reed 17 yard pass from Reich (Christie kick)\n*HOU Del Greco 26 yard FG\n;Overtime\n*BUF Christie 32 yard FG\n |stats=\n;Top passers\n* HOU \u2013 [[Warren Moon]] \u2013 36/50, 371 YDS, 4 TD, 2 INT\n* BUF \u2013 [[Frank Reich]] \u2013 21/34, 289 YDS, 4 TD, INT\n;Top rushers\n* HOU \u2013 [[Lorenzo White]] \u2013 19 CAR, 75 YDS\n* BUF \u2013 [[Kenneth Davis (American football)|Kenneth Davis]] \u2013 13 CAR, 68 YDS, TD\n;Top receivers\n* HOU \u2013 [[Ernest Givins]] \u2013 9 REC, 117 YDS\n* BUF \u2013 [[Andre Reed]] \u2013 8 REC, 136 YDS, 3 TD\n}}\n\n===First half===\n\nHouston dominated the game early, as quarterback [[Warren Moon]] completed 19 of 22 passes for 218 yards and 4 touchdowns in the first half, while the Oilers held the ball for 21:12, keeping the Bills' high-powered offense off the field for most of the first two quarters. On the opening drive of the first quarter, Moon completed 6 of 7 passes on an 80-yard scoring drive that took over 9 minutes off the clock and ended it with his first touchdown throw to wide receiver [[Haywood Jeffires]] for 3 yards to give the Oilers a 7\u20130 lead.  Buffalo responded on their ensuing drive, as [[Kenneth Davis (American football)|Kenneth Davis]] returned the kickoff 33 yards to the 44-yard line.  Reich subsequently led the Bills to the Oilers 18-yard line where [[Steve Christie]] made a 36-yard field goal, to cut the score to 7\u20133.  But Moon struck right back, leading the Oilers on a second quarter scoring drive that was nearly identical to their first one, completing 6 of 7 passes on another 80-yard drive and finishing it with a 7-yard touchdown pass to [[Webster Slaughter]]. Then after forcing the Bills to a [[three-and-out]], Moon threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to [[Curtis Duncan]]. Later on, with 1:15 left in the half, the Oilers drove for another touchdown, aided by an encroachment call against the Bills on fourth down and 1. Moon completed the drive with his second touchdown pass to Jeffires, this one a 27-yarder, and the Oilers went into their locker room with a 28\u20133 halftime lead.\n\n===Second half===\nIn the Bills' locker room, Defensive Coordinator [[Walt Corey]] angrily chided the defense. \"I was hollering the same things the fans were hollering at me when we left the field\", Corey says. \"I can't repeat the words, but the more I talked, the louder I got. The thing that bothered me was their approach. To me, they looked timid. They looked like they were going to get in the right spots, but they weren't going to make anything happen afterward. This is an attitude game. Sometimes you start playing and you're afraid to make things happen or afraid to make a mistake.\" Nose Tackle [[Jeff Wright (defensive tackle)|Jeff Wright]] recalled \"With every word that came out of Walt's mouth, he reached a new temperature level, until he finally just exploded. He had every right to say the things that he said. We were embarrassing him, we were embarrassing ourselves, we were embarrassing Buffalo Bills fans.\"\n\nMeanwhile, head coach [[Marv Levy]] told his team, \"You've got thirty more minutes. Maybe it's the last thirty minutes of your season. When your season's over, you're going to have to live with yourselves and look yourselves in the eyes. You'd well better have reason to feel good about yourselves, regardless of how this game turns out.\"<ref name=billszone>{{cite web|url=http://www.billszone.com/mtlog/archives/2003/10/03/greatest_games_1993_afc_wild_card_gamebills_41_oilers_38_ot.php|title=Greatest Games: 1993 AFC Wild Card Game Bills 41, Oilers 38 (OT)|publisher=Billszone.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608090426/http://www.billszone.com/mtlog/archives/2003/10/03/greatest_games_1993_afc_wild_card_gamebills_41_oilers_38_ot.php|archivedate=2007-06-08}}</ref> [[Steve Tasker]] praised the \"brilliance in his simplicity ... We had been in two Super Bowls, and he appealed to our pride. It wound up working\".{{r|tasker2013}}\n\nReminding Reich about his comeback while at Maryland, Kelly said \"maybe lightning will strike twice\" as the team began the second half.{{r|tasker2013}} The Bills started the 2nd half on their own 36 yard line, and apparently, the words of Corey and Levy did not have any immediate effect, because 1:41 into the third quarter, and on a 3rd and 9, Reich threw a pass that bounced off the hands of tight end [[Keith McKeller]] and went into the arms of defensive back [[Bubba McDowell]], who returned the interception 58 yards for a touchdown. Houston now had a 32-point lead, 35\u20133; it was only the second time all season the Oilers had broken 30 points scored in a game. The Bills' misfortunes were compounded with the loss of [[Thurman Thomas]], who had to leave the game due to a hip injury on the drive, forcing Buffalo to attempt a comeback with a second-string backfield of Reich and Davis.\n \nA Houston radio announcer was immortalized on [[NFL Films]] with the statement \"The lights are on here at Rich Stadium, they've been on since this morning, you could pretty much turn them out on the Bills right now.\"<ref name=billszone/>\n\nThe Bills got a huge assist to start their comeback on the ensuing kickoff. The wind shifted the ball just before it was kicked by [[Al Del Greco]]. As a result, it became an unintentional squib kick that the Bills recovered with great field position at midfield. Buffalo then drove 50 yards in 10 plays, including a pass to [[Pete Metzelaars]] that went right through the hands of linebacker Eddie Robinson, and scored with a 1-yard touchdown run by Davis, cutting the deficit to 35\u201310 when the extra point was added. On the drive, Reich completed a 24-yard pass to tight end Metzelaars and a 16-yard strike to [[Andre Reed]], while Davis kept the drive going with a 5-yard run on fourth down and 2 before finishing it off with a touchdown run with 8:52 left in the 3rd quarter.\n\nThe Bills, still with a 25 point deficit, tried an [[onside kick]]. Steve Christie, Buffalo's kicker and punter recovered his own onside kick and the Bills scored on the fourth play of their ensuing drive with Reich's 38-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Don Beebe]]. One of Beebe's feet went partially out of bounds during the run before he made the catch, and it should have been ruled by the officials as an illegal touching of the football; this was pointed out on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[NFL Primetime]]'' postgame recap as well as by Todd Christensen on the NBC broadcast, but no penalty was called on the play, and at the time the NFL did not have any replay challenge system to challenge the call. The extra point made the score 35\u201317 with 7:46 left in the third quarter.\n\nHouston was then forced to punt for the first time in the game on their next drive, and [[Greg Montgomery]]'s 25-yard kick gave Buffalo the ball at their own 41-yard line. Reich started out the ensuing drive with an 18-yard completion to [[James Lofton]]. Davis gained 20 yards on a screen pass and then Reich threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Reed, trimming the lead (after making the extra point) to 35\u201324. In a span of 10 minutes in the third quarter, the Bills had run 18 plays, gained 176 yards, and scored 21 points, while holding the Oilers' offense to 3 plays for 3 yards.\n\nThe situation did not get any better for Houston. On the first play of the Oilers' ensuing possession, Moon's pass was tipped off the hands of Slaughter; Bills' safety [[Henry Jones (American football)|Henry Jones]] intercepted the pass from Moon and returned it 15 yards to the Houston 23-yard line. Three plays later, Buffalo faced fourth down and five on the 18-yard line. Rather than attempt a field goal, Reich connected with Reed for the touchdown. With the score (including the extra point), the Bills had cut their deficit from 32 points to four in a span of just 6:52. On the Oilers' next drive, linebacker [[Darryl Talley]] forced a fumble from Moon while sacking him. Houston recovered the fumble, but they were forced to punt, and Montgomery's 24-yard kick gave Buffalo the ball at its 48-yard line. In the third quarter, Buffalo had outscored Houston 28\u20137 while holding Moon to 2 of 7 completions for 19 yards.\n\nThis time, the Bills could not take advantage of their excellent starting field position and had to punt. Moon's run and shoot offense began to move the ball effectively again, aided by a roughing the passer penalty on [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]] that negated linebacker [[Carlton Bailey]]'s interception. Despite two sacks by Wright on the drive, Houston reached the Buffalo 14-yard line. [[Al Del Greco]] attempted a field goal to increase the Oilers' lead, but Montgomery fumbled the snap. Talley recovered the ball and returned it 70 yards, but officials ruled him down by contact when he made the initial recovery, giving Buffalo the ball on their own 26-yard line. After two plays, the Bills faced third down and four. With Houston's defense dropping back and expecting a pass, Reich handed the ball off to Davis, who stormed through the line and took off for a 35-yard gain. Only a diving tackle from defensive back [[Steve Jackson (defensive back)|Steve Jackson]] prevented Davis from taking it all the way for a touchdown. Then Reich went back to passing the ball, completing a short pass to Reed at the Oilers' 17-yard line on third down and two for the first down. With just 3:08 left in the fourth quarter, Reich threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Reed, giving Buffalo its first lead of the game 38\u201335 (after the extra point); for the first time all season, the Houston defense (ninth in fewest points allowed that season) had allowed over 29 points.  But Moon led Houston downfield on a 63-yard drive to score the tying 26-yard field goal from Del Greco to send the game into overtime. A key play on the drive was an 18-yard completion to Slaughter on fourth down and four from the Bills' 34-yard line.\n\n===Overtime===\nHouston won the coin toss and got the ball at its 20-yard line. Moon started out the drive with two completions for 7 yards, but his 50th pass attempt of the day turned out to be his last. On third down and three, Moon threw a pass intended for Ernest Givins five yards downfield.  Givins was not able to get to the ball and it ended up further downfield into the arms of defensive back [[Nate Odomes]] for an interception.  After a 2-yard return, Jeffires committed a 15-yard facemask penalty while making the tackle, giving Buffalo a first down on Houston's 20-yard line.  Game commentators examined the replay and strongly asserted that Givins was held on the play by Darryl Talley.  However, the referees assessed no holding penalty against Buffalo, so they retained possession.  After two runs by Davis, Christie kicked a 32-yard field goal to give Buffalo the win, 41\u201338.\n\nReich finished the game with 21 of 34 pass completions for 289 yards and 4 touchdowns, with 1 interception. Reed had 8 catches for 136 yards and 3 touchdowns. Davis rushed for 68 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 2 passes for 25 yards and returning a kickoff for 33. Moon recorded 36 of 50 completions for 371 yards and 4 touchdowns, with 2 interceptions.  His 36 completions set a playoff record that would stand until broken by [[Drew Brees]]'s 39 completions in 2010 (Brees's [[New Orleans Saints]] also lost that game). Givins caught 9 passes for 117 yards. Jeffires recorded 8 catches for 98 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\n==Aftermath==\nMany left the stadium while the Oilers had the large lead; Tasker recalled \"seeing so many empty seats\" in the third quarter{{r|tasker2013}} and Reich saw \"a big wave of people leaving\", which ''Buffalo News'' reporter Vic Carucci described as \"they're pouring out of the gates, getting in their cars, driving home\". They returned when they heard on the radio of the Bills' comeback; tickets did not permit reentry, so people climbed fences until the stadium reopened the gates. Team general manager [[Bill Polian]] recalled how the same fans who had left in disgust after denouncing to him the Bills' inability to beat the Oilers, ran back to their seats praising the team. Kelly said, \"the old saying was, 'Did you know that 150,000 people went to the Buffalo Bills football game?'\", Levy said \"70,000 people were at that game. I've already met 400,000 of them\", and Tasker joked \"I've met 1.2 million people who say they were in the stadium\".<ref name=\"30for30\">{{cite episode | title=Four Falls of Buffalo | series=30 for 30 | network=ESPN | airdate=2015-12-12 | season=3 | url=http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=fourfalls}}</ref>\n\nTasker said of the game:<ref name=\"tasker2013\">{{Cite book |title=The Buffalo Bills: My Life on a Special Team |last=Tasker |first=Steve |last2=Pitoniak | first2=Scott | publisher=Sports Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-61321-328-5 |chapter=4: It Ain't Over Till It's Over |lccn=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|It's probably bigger in Buffalo than the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|Ice Bowl]] is in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] or the [[Immaculate Reception]] is in [[Pittsburgh]], because those cities have experienced eight Super Bowls between them.

The Rockets went to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] down 0\u20132 in the best-of-seven series. It was feared at the time that the Rockets would follow the same fate as the Oilers did. During this era, no Houston-based professional sports team from an existing sports league (the NFL, NBA, or [[Major League Baseball]]) had won a championship. The Rockets, however, would rally to win the series and go on to [[Clutch City|win NBA championships in 1994 and 1995]].\n\nIn addition, the Oilers' loss marked the beginning of a turbulent period for the franchise. The team suffered a drama-filled 1\u20134 start the [[1993 Houston Oilers season|following season]], including a blowout loss in a rematch with the Bills, before winning the final eleven games of the season to clinch what would become their final playoff appearance in Houston.
