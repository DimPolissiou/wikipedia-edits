[[Altriciality|Altricial]] young (marsupials, rodents) are completely helpless and dependent on their mothers, [[Precociality|precocial]] young (elephants, cattle) have highly developed sensory and motor functions at birth, and [[primate]]s who are semi-helpless young, have an intermediate level of  maturation. This variation in maturation at birth requires different maternal care from the mother.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Altricial species ===\n[[Altriciality|Altricial]] young are born deaf, blind, almost completely hairless and have very limited motor functioning.<ref name=\":0\" /> The maternal behavior in these species is primarily focussed on providing warmth for the young since they are unable to thermoregulate.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is achieved through the utilization of pouches in marsupial species,  and the construction of nests in rodents and other altricial species.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because the young are not capable of locomotion, many other maternal behaviors take place at the nest as well, including feeding, nursing and grooming (licking). Members of this species are unable to recognize their own young and therefore will care for all the young in the nest equally, regardless of whether or not it is their own offspring.<ref name=\":1\" /> Once the young reach a point in their sensory, and motor development  and no longer require the nutrients from their mothers milk, they will leave the nest and the mother will discontinue her maternal care behaviors.\n\n=== Precocial species ===\n[[Precociality|Precocial]] young are born with a highly developed sensory and motor system.<ref name=\":0\" /> At birth they are able to see, hear, and most can walk or will learn to walk within the first few days after birth.<ref name=\":1\" /> The females in these species have adapted to be able to recognize their own young, which allows them to be selective about who they choose to care for.<ref name=\":1\" /> They will reject other young who try to nurse from them. The primary focus of these species is to develop an exclusive relationship with their young which allows for the resources and energy expenditure of the mother to be optimized by the offspring and not wasted on other young.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is essential for their success and fitness.\n\n=== Primates ===\nPrimates are born with intermediate maturation of altricial and precocial species. Newborns have limited motor functioning, but have highly developed sensory systems and the ability to thermoregulate. A unique characteristic in the maternal behavior in primates is that the mothers carry their young until their locomotive abilities develop.<ref name=\":1\" /> The mother will either carry the young in their arms, or the young will attach itself to the mother and cling to her. This is known as matricolia.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Birds ==\n''Main article:'' [[Parental care in birds]]\n\n[[Bird]]s belong to a class of vertebrates that are [[Oviparity|oviparous]] and exhibit extensive parental behaviors. These behaviors are called brooding behaviors which include the incubation of the unhatched eggs and the care of the chicks after they have hatched.<ref name=\":2\" /> During incubation, the mother sits on her eggs which keeps them warm while the unhatched chicks are developing in the eggs. Once the eggs hatch, the mother will care for and feed her chicks until they reach maturation. Biparental care is common in birds, where the role of the male involves finding food and defending the nest, and the maternal behaviors involve caring for the chicks in the nest.<ref name=\":3\" /> In many cases, the male will regurgitate partially digested food into the mouth of the female and then the female will distribute the food equally amongst her chicks by regurgitating it for a second time into the mouths of the chicks.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Garc\u00eda-Navas|first=Vicente|last2=Garc\u00eda del Rinc\u00f3n|first2=Amanda|last3=Ferrer|first3=Esperanza\u00a0S.|last4=Fathi|first4=Hicham|date=2013-01-01|title=Mating strategies, parental investment and mutual ornamentation in Iberian Rock Sparrows (Petronia\u00a0petronia)|journal=Behaviour|volume=150|issue=14|pages=1641\u20131663|doi=10.1163/1568539x-00003112|issn=0005-7959|hdl=10261/142861}}</ref>\n\n=== Brood parasitism ===\n{{See also|Brood parasite}}\n{{expand section|date=December 2018}}\n[[Brood parasite|Brood parasitism]] is a reproductive strategy exhibited in some birds where a parasitic bird will lay their eggs in the nest of a host who will care for foreign chick once it is hatched.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-ecology-of-avian-brood-parasitism-14724491/|title=The Ecology of Avian Brood Parasitism {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref> The parasitic birds do not display maternal behaviors and have therefore evolved ways to ensure the success of their offspring by having it be raised by a host.

In a non maternal female, this action in this area of the brain is inhibited by the medial amygdala but during parturition, the inhibition stops which cause the female to exhibit behaviors related to the maternal care of their newly born offspring. During the parturition, the paraventricular nucleus starts to produce oxytocin ( along with other hormones) which aids in the delivery of the young, as well as the behaviors exhibited by the mother after birth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nProlactin and glucorticoides are chemicals that also play a role in the initiation of maternal behavior in both birds and mammals. Prolactin is involved in the interactions between a mother and their offspring, while glucorticoides are released when the mother is expending energy and resources causing her to work harder in order to properly care for her young.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Storey|first=Anne E.|last2=Delahunty|first2=Krista M.|last3=McKay|first3=Donald W.|last4=Walsh|first4=Carolyn J.|last5=Wilhelm|first5=Sabina I.|date=2006|title=Social and hormonal bases of individual differences in the parental behavior of birds and mammals.|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=60|issue=3|pages=237\u2013245|doi=10.1037/cjep2006022|issn=1878-7290}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*\n\n[[Category:Motherhood]]\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Parental care]] is a term which encompasses a series of behaviors displayed by parents when caring for their offspring which are essential for the survival and fitness of the species.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary for Animal Behaviour, 2nd Edition|last=McFarland|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> It is a form of altruism which means that the behaviors involved often require a sacrifice that could put their own survival at risk.<ref name=\":0\" />  Parental care encompasses behaviors that aide in the evolutionary success of the offspring (like nest building), and [[parental investment]], which is a measure of expenditure (time, energy, etc.) exerted by the parent in an attempt to provide evolutionary benefits to the offspring.

This variation in maturation at birth requires different maternal care from the mother.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Altricial species ===\n[[Altriciality|Altricial]] young are born deaf, blind, almost completely hairless and have very limited motor functioning.<ref name=\":0\" /> The maternal behavior in these species is primarily focussed on providing warmth for the young since they are unable to thermoregulate.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is achieved through the utilization of pouches in marsupial species,  and the construction of nests in rodents and other altricial species.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because the young are not capable of locomotion, many other maternal behaviors take place at the nest as well, including feeding, nursing and grooming (licking). Members of this species are unable to recognize their own young and therefore will care for all the young in the nest equally, regardless of whether or not it is their own offspring.<ref name=\":1\" /> Once the young reach a point in their sensory, and motor development  and no longer require the nutrients from their mothers milk, they will leave the nest and the mother will discontinue her maternal care behaviors.\n\n=== Precocial species ===\n[[Precociality|Precocial]] young are born with a highly developed sensory and motor system.<ref name=\":0\" /> At birth they are able to see, hear, and most can walk or will learn to walk within the first few days after birth.<ref name=\":1\" /> The females in these species have adapted to be able to recognize their own young, which allows them to be selective about who they choose to care for.<ref name=\":1\" /> They will reject other young who try to nurse from them. The primary focus of these species is to develop an exclusive relationship with their young which allows for the resources and energy expenditure of the mother to be optimized by the offspring and not wasted on other young.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is essential for their success and fitness.\n\n=== Primates ===\nPrimates are born with intermediate maturation of altricial and precocial species. Newborns have limited motor functioning, but have highly developed sensory systems and the ability to thermoregulate. A unique characteristic in the maternal behavior in primates is that the mothers carry their young until their locomotive abilities develop.<ref name=\":1\" /> The mother will either carry the young in their arms, or the young will attach itself to the mother and cling to her. This is known as matricolia.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Birds ==\n''Main article:'' [[Parental care in birds]]\n\n[[Bird]]s belong to a class of vertebrates that are [[Oviparity|oviparous]] and exhibit extensive parental behaviors. These behaviors are called brooding behaviors which include the incubation of the unhatched eggs and the care of the chicks after they have hatched.<ref name=\":2\" /> During incubation, the mother sits on her eggs which keeps them warm while the unhatched chicks are developing in the eggs. Once the eggs hatch, the mother will care for and feed her chicks until they reach maturation. Biparental care is common in birds, where the role of the male involves finding food and defending the nest, and the maternal behaviors involve caring for the chicks in the nest.<ref name=\":3\" /> In many cases, the male will regurgitate partially digested food into the mouth of the female and then the female will distribute the food equally amongst her chicks by regurgitating it for a second time into the mouths of the chicks.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Garc\u00eda-Navas|first=Vicente|last2=Garc\u00eda del Rinc\u00f3n|first2=Amanda|last3=Ferrer|first3=Esperanza\u00a0S.|last4=Fathi|first4=Hicham|date=2013-01-01|title=Mating strategies, parental investment and mutual ornamentation in Iberian Rock Sparrows (Petronia\u00a0petronia)|journal=Behaviour|volume=150|issue=14|pages=1641\u20131663|doi=10.1163/1568539x-00003112|issn=0005-7959|hdl=10261/142861}}</ref>\n\n=== Brood parasitism ===\n{{See also|Brood parasite}}\n{{expand section|date=December 2018}}\n[[Brood parasite|Brood parasitism]] is a reproductive strategy exhibited in some birds where a parasitic bird will lay their eggs in the nest of a host who will care for foreign chick once it is hatched.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-ecology-of-avian-brood-parasitism-14724491/|title=The Ecology of Avian Brood Parasitism {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref> The parasitic birds do not display maternal behaviors and have therefor evolved ways to ensure the success of their offspring by having it be raised by a host.

Oviparous reptiles often display very little or no maternal behavior after the eggs have hatched, while viviparous reptiles typically exhibit more extensive maternal care.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nile crocodiles however, are the exception to this. The females exhibit maternal care behaviors that involve transporting their young in their mouths shortly after they have hatched, to the waters edge and remain with the young until they have reached further development <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Neurobiological influences on maternal behavior ==\nIn mammals, the medial pre optic area of the brain is responsible for the initiation of maternal behaviors. In a non maternal female, this action in this area of the brain is inhibited by the medial amygdala but during parturition, the inhibition stops which cause the female to exhibit behaviors related to the maternal care of their newly born offspring. During the parturition, the paraventricular nucleus starts to produce oxytocin ( along with other hormones) which aids in the delivery of the young, as well as the behaviors exhibited by the mother after birth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nProlactin and glucorticoides are chemicals that also play a role in the initiation of maternal behavior in both birds and mammals. Prolactin is involved in the interactions between a mother and their offspring, while glucorticoides are released when the mother is expending energy and resources causing her to work harder in order to properly care for her young.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Storey|first=Anne E.|last2=Delahunty|first2=Krista M.|last3=McKay|first3=Donald W.|last4=Walsh|first4=Carolyn J.|last5=Wilhelm|first5=Sabina I.|date=2006|title=Social and hormonal bases of individual differences in the parental behavior of birds and mammals.|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=60|issue=3|pages=237\u2013245|doi=10.1037/cjep2006022|issn=1878-7290}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*\n\n[[Category:Motherhood]]\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBrood parasitism:Typo fixing, replaced: therefor \u2192 therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_behavior_in_vertebrates"}

Hostilities had lulled as leadership on both sides reconsidered their strategies following the stalemate of the [[Race to the Sea]] and the indecisive result of the [[First Battle of Ypres]]. In the week leading up to the 67th, [[French Third Republic|French]], [[German Empire|German]], and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] soldiers crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into [[no man's land]] on [[Christmas Eve]] and [[Christmas Day]] to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing. Men played games of football with one another,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/10455611/England-v-Germany-when-rivals-staged-beautiful-game-on-the-Somme.html \"England v Germany: when rivals staged beautiful game on the Somme\"]</ref> creating one of the most memorable images of the truce. Fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.\n\nThe following year, a few units arranged ceasefires but the truces were not nearly as widespread as in 1984; this was, in part, due to strongly worded orders from the high commands of both sides prohibiting truces. Soldiers were no longer amenable to truce by 1916. The war had become increasingly bitter after devastating human losses suffered during the battles of [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]] and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and the use of [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]].\n\nThe truces were not unique to the Christmas period, and reflected a mood of \"[[live and let live (World War I)|live and let live]]\", where infantry close together would stop overtly aggressive behaviour and often engage in small-scale fraternisation, engaging in conversation or bartering for cigarettes. In some sectors, there were occasional ceasefires to allow soldiers to go between the lines and recover wounded or dead comrades; in others, there was a tacit agreement not to shoot while men rested, exercised or worked in view of the enemy. The Christmas truces were particularly significant due to the number of men involved and the level of their participation\u2014even in very peaceful sectors, dozens of men openly congregating in daylight was remarkable\u2014and are often seen as a symbolic moment of peace and humanity amidst one of the most violent events of human history.\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring the first eight months of [[World War I]], the German attack through [[Belgium]] into France had been repelled outside Paris by French and British troops at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] in early September 1914. The Germans fell back to the [[Aisne river|Aisne valley]], where they dug in. In the [[First Battle of the Aisne|First Battle of the Aisne]], the Franco\u2013British attacks were repulsed and both sides began digging [[trench warfare|trenches]] to economise on manpower and use the surplus to outflank their opponents on their northern flanks. In the [[Race to the Sea], the two sides made reciprocal outflanking manoeuvres and after several weeks, during which the British forces were withdrawn from the Aisne and sent north to [[Flanders]], both sides ran out of room. By November, both sides had built a continuous line of trenches running from the [[North Sea]] to the Swiss frontier.<ref>Brown (2005), pp. 13\u201315</ref>\n\nBefore Christmas 1914, there were several peace initiatives. The [[Open Christmas Letter]] was a public message for [[peace]] addressed \"To the Women of Germany and [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]\", signed by a group of 101 British women [[suffragette]]s at the end of 1914.<ref>Oldfield, Sybil.

Complicated local truces and agreements not to fire at each other were negotiated by men along the front throughout the war. These often began with agreement not to attack each other at tea, meal or washing times. In some places tacit agreements became so common that sections of the front would see few casualties for extended periods of time. This system, Ashworth argues, 'gave soldiers some control over the conditions of their existence'.<ref>Ashworth, Tony. 1980.

The text reads:<br />\"1914 \u2013 The Khaki Chum's Christmas Truce \u2013 1999 \u2013 85 Years \u2013 Lest We Forget\"]]\nThe '''Christmas truce''' ({{lang-de|Weihnachtsfrieden}}; {{lang-fr|Tr\u00eave de No\u00ebl}}) was a series of widespread unofficial ceasefires along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the [[First World War]] around Christmas 1914.\n\nThe truce occurred during the relatively early period of the war (month 5 of 51). Hostilities had lulled as leadership on both sides reconsidered their strategies following the stalemate of the [[Race to the Sea]] and the indecisive result of the [[First Battle of Ypres]]. In the week leading up to the 25th, [[French Third Republic|French]], [[German Empire|German]], and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] soldiers crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into [[no man's land]] on [[Christmas Eve]] and [[Christmas Day]] to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing. Men played games of football with one another,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/10455611/England-v-Germany-when-rivals-staged-beautiful-game-on-the-Somme.html \"England v Germany: when rivals staged beautiful game on the Somme\"]</ref> creating one of the most memorable images of the truce. Fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.\n\nThe following year, a few units arranged ceasefires but the truces were not nearly as widespread as in 1914; this was, in part, due to strongly worded orders from the high commands of both sides prohibiting truces. Soldiers were no longer amenable to truce by 1916. The war had become increasingly bitter after devastating human losses suffered during the battles of [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]] and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and the use of [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]].\n\nThe truces were not unique to the Christmas period, and reflected a mood of \"[[live and let live (World War I)|live and let live]]\", where infantry close together would stop overtly aggressive behaviour and often engage in small-scale fraternisation, engaging in conversation or bartering for cigarettes. In some sectors, there were occasional ceasefires to allow soldiers to go between the lines and recover wounded or dead comrades; in others, there was a tacit agreement not to shoot while men rested, exercised or worked in view of the enemy. The Christmas truces were particularly significant due to the number of men involved and the level of their participation\u2014even in very peaceful sectors, dozens of men openly congregating in daylight was remarkable\u2014and are often seen as a symbolic moment of peace and humanity amidst one of the most violent events of human history.\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring the first eight months of [[World War I]], the German attack through [[Belgium]] into France had been repelled outside Paris by French and British troops at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] in early September 1914. The Germans fell back to the [[Aisne river|Aisne valley]], where they dug in. In the [[First Battle of the Aisne|First Battle of the Aisne]], the Franco\u2013British attacks were repulsed and both sides began digging [[trench warfare|trenches]] to economise on manpower and use the surplus to outflank their opponents on their northern flanks. In the [[Race to the Sea], the two sides made reciprocal outflanking manoeuvres and after several weeks, during which the British forces were withdrawn from the Aisne and sent north to [[Flanders]], both sides ran out of room. By November, both sides had built a continuous line of trenches running from the [[North Sea]] to the Swiss frontier.<ref>Brown (2005), pp. 13\u201315</ref>\n\nBefore Christmas 1914, there were several peace initiatives. The [[Open Christmas Letter]] was a public message for [[peace]] addressed \"To the Women of Germany and [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]\", signed by a group of 101 British women [[suffragette]]s at the end of 1914.<ref>Oldfield, Sybil.

Complicated local truces and agreements not to fire at each other were negotiated by men along the front throughout the war. These often began with agreement not to attack each other at tea, meal or washing times. In some places tacit agreements became so common that sections of the front would see few casualties for extended periods of time. This system, Ashworth argues, 'gave soldiers some control over the conditions of their existence'.<ref>Ashworth, Tony. 1980.

Tope then took his forces towards [[Indore]], but was pursued by the British, now commanded by General [[John Michel]] as he fled towards [[Sironj]]. \nTope, accompanied by Rao Saheb, decided to divide their combined forces so that he could make his way to [[Chanderi]] with a bigger force, and Rao Saheb, on the other hand, with a smaller force to [[Jhansi]]. However, they combined again in October and suffered yet another defeat at [[Chota Udaipur|Chhota Udaipur]]. \nBy January 1859, they arrived to the state of [[Jaipur]] and experienced two more defeats. Tope then escaped alone into the jungles of Paron{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

Man Singh was in dispute with the Maharaja of Gwalior while the British were successful in negotiating with him to hand Tope to them in return for his life and protection of his family from any reprisals by the Maharaja.

A personal adherent of [[Nana Sahib|Nana Saheb]] of [[Bithur]], he progressed with the [[Gwalior]] contingent after the British reoccupied [[Kanpur]] and forced General Windham to retreat from the city. Later on, Tatya Tope came to the relief of [[Rani of Jhansi|Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi]] and with her seized the city of [[Gwalior]]. However, he was defeated by General Napier's British Indian troops at Ranod and after a further defeat at [[Sikar]], he abandoned the campaign.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books; pp. 132-34</ref> \n\nAccording to an official statement, Tatya Tope's father was Panduranga, an inhabitant of Jola Pargannah, Patoda Zilla Nagar, in present-day [[Maharashtra]].{{sfn|Paul|2011|p=53}} Tope was a Mara\u1e6dha Vashista Brahman by birth.{{sfn|Paul|2011|p=53}} In a government letter, he was said to be the minister of Baroda, while he was held identical to Nana Saheb in another communication.{{sfn|Paul|2011|p=53}} A witness at his trial described Tantia Tope as \"a man of middling stature, with a wheat complexion and always wearing a white chukri-dar turban\".\n\nTatya Tope was executed by the British Government at [[Shivpuri]] on 18{{nbsp}}April 1859.\n\n<br />\n\n==Initial engagement at the Indian rebellion of 1857==\nAfter the rebellion in [[Cawnpore]] ([[Kanpur]]) broke out on 5 June 1857, Nana Saheb became the leader of the rebels. \nAs the British forces surrendered on 25 June 1857, Nana was declared Peshwa in late June{{sfn|Paul|2011|p=54}}. General Havelock twice faced Nana's forces in a battle before the latter were finally defeated at the their third encounter. After the defeat, Nana\u2019s troops had to withdraw to Bithur, after which Havelock crossed the Ganges and retreated to Awadh.{{sfn|Paul|2011|p=54}} Tatya Tope began to act in Nana Saheb's name from Bithur.\nTatya Tope was one of the leaders of the [[Bibighar massacre|massacre of Cawnpore]], which occurred on June 27, 1857. Since then, Tope held a good defensive position until he was driven out by the British force led again by Sir Henry Havelock on August 16, 1857. Afterward, he defeated General Charles Ash Windham at Cawnpore II, which started on November 27, 1857 and continued for two days.  However, Tope and his army were later defeated at Cawnpore III, when the British counterattacked under Sir Colin Campbell. Tope and other rebels fled the scene and had to take shelter at the Rani of Jhansi, while aiding her as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galeapps.galegroup.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=tel_a_vanderbilt&origURL=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.galegroup.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Fid%3DGALE%257CA16844629%26v%3D2.1%26u%3Dtel_a_vanderbilt%26it%3Dr%26p%3DITOF%26sw%3Dw&prodId=ITOF|title=Gale - Product Login|website=galeapps.galegroup.com|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n==Clash with Colonel Holmes==\nLater on Tatya and Rao Saheb, after assisting Jhansi during the British assault successfully helped [[Rani Lakshmibai]] escape the attack<ref>{{cite web |title=Tantia Tope and Rani Laxmi Bai |url=https://www.newstrend.news/339697/tatya-tope-ka-jeevan-parichay/ |website=newstrend.news |publisher=Newstrend |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>. Together with [[Rani Lakshmibai]], they took control of Gwalior Fort declaring Hindavi Swaraj (Free Kingdom) under the name of Nana Saheb Peshwa from [[Gwalior]]. After losing [[Gwalior]] to the British, Tope and Rao Saheb, nephew of Nana Saheb, fled to the [[Rajputana]]. He was able to induce the army of [[Tonk district|Tonk]] to join him. \nTope was unable to enter the town of [[Bundi]] though, and while announcing he would go south, he headed west in reality and towards Nimach. A British flying column commanded by Colonel Holmes was in pursuit of him, while the British commander in Rajputana, General Abraham Robert was able to attack the rebel force when they had reached a position between [[Sanganer]] and [[Bhilwara]]. Tope again fled from the field towards [[Udaipur]] and, after visiting a Hindu shrine on 13 August, he drew up his forces on the [[Banas River]]. They were defeated again by Roberts's forces and Tope fled again.
