There are many remains that testify to their skills as sculptors and architects.  Later some [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swati]] entered the area along with Sultans from Kunar and their tribe was styled as Swatis. The originator of the present family of Swat was the Muslim saint Akhund Abdul Gaffur, more commonly known as [[Saidu Baba]]. He was a pious man and the people respected him so greatly that they called him ''Akhund Sahib''.<ref>S.G.

The Lensbury was founded in 1920 as a club for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] employees and was known as the Lensbury Club until the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lensbury Club 1920\u20131990|last = Higdon|first = John|publisher = |year = 1990|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> In May 2019 it was sold by Shell to L+R Hotels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6541237877840334848 |title=L+R Hotels acquires The Lensbury in Teddington, England |publisher=www.linkedin.com |accessdate=3 July 2019 }}</ref> \n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Lensbury Club (\"Lensbury Social and Athletic Club\") was established in 1920 as a sports club for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] staff in the United Kingdom \u2013 one of the driving forces behind its formation was Dutchman [[Henri Deterding]], one of the original founders of the ''Royal Dutch/ Shell Group of Companies'', who was a fitness fanatic. Land was acquired in Broom Road, [[Teddington]], for playing fields and within a year there were active sections in Cricket, Rugby, Football, Rowing, Ladies Hockey, Tennis and Chess. Between 1920 and the beginning of the [[Second World War]] significant additions to the Lensbury estate were made with property and land purchases on both sides of Broom Road.\n\nIn 1933 the club merged with \"Britannic House\", a similar club operated by [[BP]], and created a joint venture known as the \"Lensbury and Britannic House Associated Clubs\" \u2013 an arrangement that lasted for 30 years. In 1938 a new clubhouse was opened which comprised 162 bedrooms, a dining room, a ballroom and many other facilities. During the war years club activities were suspended and Lensbury became a Shell office and some of the sports grounds were ploughed up to grow vegetables.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Postwar years===\nIn the immediate postwar years it took time for the Lensbury clubhouse to be free of its wartime role as a Shell office but by the early 1950s most of the established activities, and many new ones, were in full swing again. By 1956 membership had reached 5,000 and there were 27 active sections. The arrangements with BP came to an end in 1962 and Lensbury became once again a facility exclusively for Shell employees (and those of the UK marketing joint venture [[Shell-Mex and BP]] Ltd). Many new sports and pastimes were introduced including [[sailing]], [[judo]], ballroom dancing and keep-it and membership continued to rise, reaching 7,000 by 1964.\n\nBuilding of additional facilities for training courses took place in 1967 and the role of the Lensbury clubhouse as both a recreational and a training location was established. However financial concerns began to be expressed in the difficult economic climate of the late 1960s and early 1970s and the club's structure changed so that it became a \"members\" club to be governed by members committees and supervised by trustees. However Shell still saw the club unequivocally as a benefit for employees, and the Lensbury continued to receive a [[subsidy]] from Shell to help cover its costs. The club became, as a consequence, more arm's-length from Shell with the intention that Shell's subsidy would gradually reduce.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===1970s and after===\nIn the 1970s Lensbury had active sections in 47 sports and pastimes including tennis, hockey, volleyball, bowls, music, drama (Lensbury Theatre Group,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apvk33.dsl.pipex.com/lenshist.shtml |title= TalkTalk Webspace is closing soon!!|accessdate=2 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604090235/http://www.apvk33.dsl.pipex.com/lenshist.shtml |archivedate=4 June 2007 }}</ref> bridge, sailing, swimming, motor cruising, sub-aqua, mountaineering (now the LMC Mountaineering Club),<ref>{{cite web |first=Kirsty |last=Johns |url=http://www.hillsandvalleys.co.uk/LMC/ |title=LMC Mountaineering Club }}</ref> fishing as well as its core rowing, association football, cricket and rugby football teams. At this time membership was restricted to employees of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell companies in the UK]] although this restriction was relaxed for some of the team sports participants.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe clubhouse was badly damaged by a fire in April 1976; rebuilding was completed in 1977.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Yarranton years===\n[[Image:Peter Yarranton.jpg|100px|thumb|Sir Peter Yarranton]]\nIn 1978 Shell appointed [[Peter Yarranton]] as Lensbury's general manager. Yarranton was himself an accomplished sportsman, notably in rugby in which sport he had been capped five times by [[England Rugby|England]]. An indoor swimming pool was open in the same year and under Yarranton's management the club's status as a world class sporting venue was enhanced. Membership reached 13,000 and many international sporting stars were attracted to use the club's facilities including top tennis players such as [[Steffi Graf]], [[Chris Evert]] and [[John Lloyd (tennis player)|John Lloyd]] during [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. The [[Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the club in 1980. [[Middlesex County Cricket Club]] used the ground for some Second XI matches \u2013 a recognition of the quality of the club's main cricket square, the home of Lensbury Cricket Club.\n\nFrom 1978 until Peter Yarranton's retirement in 1993 Lensbury continued to build on its tradition as primarily a club for team and individual sports. Yarranton became President of the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1991 and Chairman of the UK [[Sports Council]] in 1989 and thus he combined his management of Lensbury with sports representation at the very highest level. It was with some pride that he described the club in 1990 as \"\u2026 the largest sports, leisure, social and training centre in Europe and certainly one of the largest in the world\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===1992 to 2008===\nIn the 1990s Shell decided that Lensbury should be seen not as exclusively a \"staff benefit\" but as a \"[[profit centre]]\". Driven by the Shell Group's new chairman J.S. Jennings, and implemented by the new Chairman of the Club, [[Clive Mather]], changes were instituted that were designed first to reduce and then to eliminate Shell's subsidy. This meant that the decision that had been taken in 1974 to make Lensbury a members club without direct Shell involvement was reversed and all the members committees were abolished. The club became a subsidiary like any of Shell's other assets and like them it was defined as a business whose goal was to maximise its profits. A plan was proposed by members that would have achieved this objective whilst retaining the essential character of the club (including all the team sports) but this was rejected by the Shell directors.

The Lensbury was founded in 1920 as a club for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] employees and was known as the Lensbury Club until the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lensbury Club 1920\u20131990|last = Higdon|first = John|publisher = |year = 1990|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> In May 2019 it was sold by Shell to L+R Hotels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6541237877840334848 |title=L+R Hotels acquires The Lensbury in Teddington, England |publisher=www.linkedin.com |accessdate=3 July 2019 }}</ref> \n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Lensbury Club (\"Lensbury Social and Athletic Club\") was established in 1920 as a sports club for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] staff in the United Kingdom \u2013 one of the driving forces behind its formation was Dutchman [[Henri Deterding]], one of the original founders of the ''Royal Dutch/ Shell Group of Companies'', who was a fitness fanatic. Land was acquired in Broom Road, [[Teddington]], for playing fields and within a year there were active sections in Cricket, Rugby, Football, Rowing, Ladies Hockey, Tennis and Chess. Between 1920 and the beginning of the [[Second World War]] significant additions to the Lensbury estate were made with property and land purchases on both sides of Broom Road.\n\nIn 1933 the club merged with \"Britannic House\", a similar club operated by [[BP]], and created a joint venture known as the \"Lensbury and Britannic House Associated Clubs\" \u2013 an arrangement that lasted for 30 years. In 1938 a new clubhouse was opened which comprised 162 bedrooms, a dining room, a ballroom and many other facilities. During the war years club activities were suspended and Lensbury became a Shell office and some of the sports grounds were ploughed up to grow vegetables.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Postwar years===\nIn the immediate postwar years it took time for the Lensbury clubhouse to be free of its wartime role as a Shell office but by the early 1950s most of the established activities, and many new ones, were in full swing again. By 1956 membership had reached 5,000 and there were 27 active sections. The arrangements with BP came to an end in 1962 and Lensbury became once again a facility exclusively for Shell employees (and those of the UK marketing joint venture [[Shell-Mex and BP]] Ltd). Many new sports and pastimes were introduced including [[sailing]], [[judo]], ballroom dancing and keep-it and membership continued to rise, reaching 7,000 by 1964.\n\nBuilding of additional facilities for training courses took place in 1967 and the role of the Lensbury clubhouse as both a recreational and a training location was established. However financial concerns began to be expressed in the difficult economic climate of the late 1960s and early 1970s and the club's structure changed so that it became a \"members\" club to be governed by members committees and supervised by trustees. However Shell still saw the club unequivocally as a benefit for employees, and the Lensbury continued to receive a [[subsidy]] from Shell to help cover its costs. The club became, as a consequence, more arm's-length from Shell with the intention that Shell's subsidy would gradually reduce.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===1970s and after===\nIn the 1970s Lensbury had active sections in 47 sports and pastimes including tennis, hockey, volleyball, bowls, music, drama (Lensbury Theatre Group,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apvk33.dsl.pipex.com/lenshist.shtml |title= TalkTalk Webspace is closing soon!!|accessdate=2 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604090235/http://www.apvk33.dsl.pipex.com/lenshist.shtml |archivedate=4 June 2007 }}</ref> bridge, sailing, swimming, motor cruising, sub-aqua, mountaineering (now the LMC Mountaineering Club),<ref>{{cite web |first=Kirsty |last=Johns |url=http://www.hillsandvalleys.co.uk/LMC/ |title=LMC Mountaineering Club }}</ref> fishing as well as its core rowing, association football, cricket and rugby football teams. At this time membership was restricted to employees of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell companies in the UK]] although this restriction was relaxed for some of the team sports participants.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe clubhouse was badly damaged by a fire in April 1976; rebuilding was completed in 1977.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Yarranton years===\n[[Image:Peter Yarranton.jpg|100px|thumb|Sir Peter Yarranton]]\nIn 1978 Shell appointed [[Peter Yarranton]] as Lensbury's general manager. Yarranton was himself an accomplished sportsman, notably in rugby in which sport he had been capped five times by [[England Rugby|England]]. An indoor swimming pool was open in the same year and under Yarranton's management the club's status as a world class sporting venue was enhanced. Membership reached 13,000 and many international sporting stars were attracted to use the club's facilities including top tennis players such as [[Steffi Graf]], [[Chris Evert]] and [[John Lloyd (tennis player)|John Lloyd]] during [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. The [[Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the club in 1980. [[Middlesex County Cricket Club]] used the ground for some Second XI matches \u2013 a recognition of the quality of the club's main cricket square, the home of Lensbury Cricket Club.\n\nFrom 1978 until Peter Yarranton's retirement in 1993 Lensbury continued to build on its tradition as primarily a club for team and individual sports. Yarranton became President of the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1991 and Chairman of the UK [[Sports Council]] in 1989 and thus he combined his management of Lensbury with sports representation at the very highest level. It was with some pride that he described the club in 1990 as \"\u2026 the largest sports, leisure, social and training centre in Europe and certainly one of the largest in the world\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===1992 to 2008===\nIn the 1990s Shell decided that Lensbury should be seen not as exclusively a \"staff benefit\" but as a \"[[profit centre]]\". Driven by the Shell Group's new chairman J.S. Jennings, and implemented by the new Chairman of the Club, [[Clive Mather]], changes were instituted that were designed first to reduce and then to eliminate Shell's subsidy. This meant that the decision that had been taken in 1974 to make Lensbury a members club without direct Shell involvement was reversed and all the members committees were abolished. The club became a subsidiary like any of Shell's other assets and like them it was defined as a business whose goal was to maximise its profits. A plan was proposed by members that would have achieved this objective whilst retaining the essential character of the club (including all the team sports) but this was rejected by the Shell directors. Instead they insisted on drastic changes to the club's raison d'\u00eatre.\n\nNon Shell employees were sought, members' subscriptions were substantially increased and the whole basis of the club went through a radical series of changes. Team sports, the life blood of the club since its creation, were gradually phased out and a greatly expanded gymnasium/fitness centre was introduced.
