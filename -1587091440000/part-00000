They may have been [[killed in action|killed]], [[Wounded in action|wounded]], [[prisoner of war|captured]], or [[Desertion|deserted]].

Buried in [[Stanley Military Cemetery]], [[Hong Kong]].]]\nUntil around 1912, service personnel in most countries were not routinely issued with [[Dog tag (identifier)|ID tags]]. As a result, if someone was [[killed in action]] and his body was not recovered until much later, there was little or no chance of identifying the remains. Starting around the time of the [[First World War]], nations began to issue their service personnel with purpose-made ID tags. These were usually made of some form of lightweight metal such as aluminium. However, in the case of the [[British Army]] the material chosen was compressed fiber, which was not very durable. Although wearing ID tags proved to be highly beneficial, the problem remained that bodies could be completely destroyed, burned or buried by the type of high explosive munitions routinely used in [[modern warfare]]. Additionally, the combat environment itself could increase the likelihood of missing combatants such as [[jungle warfare]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/820454--jungle-battlefield-lost-for-68-years-discovered |title=Jungle battlefield \u2018lost\u2019 for 68 years discovered |publisher=thestar.com |accessdate=2012-10-11 |location=Toronto |date=June 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Justin R.

As a result, the remains of missing combatants might not be found for many years, if ever. When missing combatants are recovered and cannot be identified after a thorough forensic examination (including such methods as [[DNA]] testing and comparison of [[dental records]]) the remains are interred with a tombstone which indicates their unknown status.\n\nThe development of [[genetic fingerprinting]] in the late 20th century means that if cell samples from a cheek swab are collected from service personnel prior to deployment to a combat zone, identity can be established using even a small fragment of human remains. Although it is possible to take genetic samples from a close relative of the missing person, it is preferable to collect such samples directly from the subjects themselves. It is a fact of warfare that some combatants are likely to go missing in action and never be found. However, by wearing ID tags and using modern technology the numbers involved can be considerably reduced. In addition to the obvious military advantages, conclusively identifying the remains of missing service personnel is highly beneficial to the surviving relatives. Having positive identification makes it somewhat easier to come to terms with their loss and move on with their lives. Otherwise, some relatives may suspect that the missing person is still alive somewhere and may return someday.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4374611.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Arnhem soldier buried 60 years on | date=March 23, 2005 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4755183.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Family of dead WWII airman found | date=May 9, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4198304.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Funeral for RAF crew, 61 years on | date=September 1, 2005 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/7745635.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Mystery of soldier's grave solved | date=November 24, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | first=Julian | last=Sturdy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/174121.stm |work=BBC News  | title=British War hero finally gets hero's funeral | date=September 18, 1998 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/193380.stm |work=BBC News  | title=German WWII pilot laid to rest on Teesside | date=October 14, 1998 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> However, many of these identifying procedures are not typically used for combatants who are members of militias, mercenary armies, insurrections, and other irregular forces.\n\n==Before the 20th century==\nIt is possible that some of the combatants who took part of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in 480 BC went missing in action. Certainly, the numerous wars which followed over successive centuries created many MIAs. The list is long and includes most battles which have ever been fought by any nation. The usual problems of identification caused by rapid decomposition were exacerbated by the fact that it was common practice to loot the remains of the dead for any valuables e.g. personal items and clothing. This made the already difficult task of identification even harder. Thereafter the dead were routinely buried in [[mass grave]]s and scant official records were retained. Notable examples include such [[medieval]] battles as [[Battle of Towton|Towton]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Armin Schmidt |url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/archsci/depart/resgrp/towton/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907151242/http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/archsci/depart/resgrp/towton/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 7, 2007 |title=brad.ac.uk |publisher=brad.ac.uk |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2011 }}</ref> the [[Hundred Years' War]], The [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] where King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] of Portugal disappeared, the later [[English Civil War]]s, and [[Napoleonic Wars]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/uk-waterloo-skeleton-idUKBRE85E0JM20120615 | work=Reuters | title=Rare remains of soldier found at Waterloo | date=June 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/03/artsandhumanities.research |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=After 190 years the bones of Boney's army are unearthed in a mass grave in Lithuania | first=Ian | last=Traynor | date=September 3, 2002 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> together with any battle taking place until around the middle of the 19th century. Starting around the time of the [[Crimean War]], [[American Civil War]], and [[Franco-Prussian War]], it became more common to make formal efforts to identify individual soldiers. However, since there was no formal system of [[Dog tag (identifier)|ID tags]] at the time, this could be difficult during the process of battlefield clearance. Even so, there had been a notable shift in perceptions e.g. where the remains of a soldier in Confederate uniform were recovered from, say, the [[battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg battlefield]], he would be interred in a single grave with a headstone which stated that he was an unknown [[Confederate soldier]]. This change in attitudes coincided with the [[Geneva Conventions]], the first of which was signed in 1864. Although the [[First Geneva Convention]] did not specifically address the issue of MIAs, the reasoning behind it (which specified the humane treatment of wounded enemy soldiers) was influential.\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Seringes-et-Nesles Oise-Aisne American Cemetery - Unknown Soldier.jpg|thumb|Grave of an unknown American combatant in [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial|Oise-Aisne Cemetery]]. Killed in 1917]]\nThe phenomenon of MIAs became particularly notable during World War I, where the mechanized nature of [[modern warfare]] meant that a single battle could cause astounding numbers of casualties. For example, in 1916 over 300,000 Allied and German combatants were killed in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. A total of 19,240 British and Commonwealth combatants were [[killed in action]] or died of wounds on the [[First day on the Somme|first day of that battle]] alone. It is therefore not surprising that the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]] in France bears the names of 72,090 British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] combatants, all of whom went missing in action during the Battle of the Somme, were never found and who have no known grave. Similarly, the [[Menin Gate]] memorial in [[Belgium]] commemorates 54,896 missing Allied combatants who are known to have been killed in the [[Ypres Salient]]. The [[Douaumont ossuary]], meanwhile, contains 130,000 unidentifiable sets of [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] remains from the [[Battle of Verdun]].\n\nEven in the 21st century, the remains of missing combatants are recovered from the former battlefields of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] every year.<ref>[https://www.cwgc.org/learn/news-and-events/news/2018/07/19/09/58/burial-and-rededication-services-in-august CWGC News accessed 27 July 2018]</ref> These discoveries happen regularly, often during the course of agricultural work or construction projects.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Handmade-tag-offers-clue-to.2267079.jp |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh, UK | title=Hand-made tag offers clue to identity of First World War soldier | date=October 15, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftermathww1.com/laidtorest.asp |title=aftermathww1.com |publisher=aftermathww1.com |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fylde.demon.co.uk/fraser.htm |title=fylde.demon.co.uk |publisher=fylde.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftermathww1.com/pteclarke.asp |title=aftermathww1.com |publisher=aftermathww1.com |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/monchy.htm |title=hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk |publisher=hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927102923/http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/monchy.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/bosisto.htm |title=hellfire-corner |publisher=Hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927102959/http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/bosisto.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daylife.com/photo/07OYcF36Y206d |title=daylife.com |publisher=daylife.com |date=2012-08-23 |accessdate=2012-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318074653/http://www.daylife.com/photo/07OYcF36Y206d |archivedate=March 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Typically, the remains of one or several men are found at a time.

POW/MIA activists played a role in pushing the U.S. government to improve its efforts in resolving the fates of the missing. Progress in doing so was slow until the mid-1980s, when relations between the U.S. and Vietnam began to improve and more cooperative efforts were undertaken. Normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam in the mid-1990s was a culmination of this process.\n\nConsiderable speculation and investigation has gone to a theory that a significant number of these men were captured as [[prisoners of war]] by Communist forces in the two countries and kept as live prisoners after the war's conclusion for the United States in 1973. A vocal group of POW/MIA activists maintains that there has been a concerted conspiracy by the Vietnamese government and every American government since then to hide the existence of these prisoners. The U.S. government has steadfastly denied that prisoners were left behind or that any effort has been made to cover up their existence.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DE1E30F93BA25757C0A965958260 | title=Old M.I.A. Theory Is Given a New Life | author=Engelberg, Stephen |work=The New York Times | date=1993-04-18}}</ref> Popular culture has reflected the \"live prisoners\" theory, most notably in the 1985 film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. Several congressional investigations have looked into the issue, culminating with the largest and most thorough, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]] of 1991\u20131993 led by Senators [[John Kerry]], [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]], and [[John McCain]]. Its unanimous conclusion found \"no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.\"<ref name=\"report-exec\">{{cite web | url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1993_rpt/pow-exec.html | title=Executive Summary | work=Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | date=1993-01-13 | accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThis missing in action issue has been a highly emotional one to those involved, and is often considered the last depressing, divisive aftereffect of the Vietnam War. To skeptics, \"live prisoners\" is a [[conspiracy theory]] unsupported by motivation or evidence, and the foundation for a cottage industry of charlatans who have preyed upon the hopes of the families of the missing. As two skeptics wrote in 1995, \"The conspiracy myth surrounding the Americans who remained missing after Operation Homecoming in 1973 had evolved to baroque intricacy. By 1992, there were thousands of zealots\u2014who believed with cultlike fervor that hundreds of American POWs had been deliberately and callously abandoned in Indochina after the war, that there was a vast conspiracy within the armed forces and the executive branch\u2014spanning five administrations\u2014to cover up all evidence of this betrayal, and that the governments of Communist Vietnam and Laos continued to hold an unspecified number of living American POWs, despite their adamant denials of this charge.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=Malcolm | author2=Schweitzer III | author3=Theodore G | title=Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives: Solving the MIA Mystery | publisher=Simon & Schuster | year=1995 | isbn=0-671-87118-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/insidehanoissecr00mcco }} p. 13.</ref> Believers reject such notions; as one wrote in 1994, \"It is not conspiracy theory, not paranoid myth, not Rambo fantasy. It is only hard evidence of a national disgrace: American prisoners were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War. They were abandoned because six presidents and official Washington could not admit their guilty secret. They were forgotten because the press and most Americans turned away from all things that reminded them of Vietnam.\"<ref name=\"schan94\">{{cite news | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408,schanberg2,51267,1.html | title=Did America Abandon Vietnam War P.O.W.'s? | authorlink=Sydney Schanberg | author=Schanberg, Sydney | work=[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] | date=September 1994 | accessdate=2007-06-01 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321171551/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408%2Cschanberg2%2C51267%2C1.html | archivedate=March 21, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are also a large number of [[North Vietnamese]] and [[Viet Cong]] MIAs from the Vietnam war whose remains have yet to be recovered.

As a result, if someone was [[killed in action]] and his body was not recovered until much later, there was little or no chance of identifying the remains. Starting around the time of the [[First World War]], nations began to issue their service personnel with purpose-made ID tags. These were usually made of some form of lightweight metal such as aluminium. However, in the case of the [[British Army]] the material chosen was compressed fiber, which was not very durable. Although wearing ID tags proved to be highly beneficial, the problem remained that bodies could be completely destroyed, burned or buried by the type of high explosive munitions routinely used in [[modern warfare]]. Additionally, the combat environment itself could increase the likelihood of missing combatants such as [[jungle warfare]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/820454--jungle-battlefield-lost-for-68-years-discovered |title=Jungle battlefield \u2018lost\u2019 for 68 years discovered |publisher=thestar.com |accessdate=2012-10-11 |location=Toronto |date=June 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Justin R.

As a result, the remains of missing combatants might not be found for many years, if ever. When missing combatants are recovered and cannot be identified after a thorough forensic examination (including such methods as [[DNA]] testing and comparison of [[dental records]]) the remains are interred with a tombstone which indicates their unknown status.\n\nThe development of [[genetic fingerprinting]] in the late 20th century means that if cell samples from a cheek swab are collected from service personnel prior to deployment to a combat zone, identity can be established using even a small fragment of human remains. Although it is possible to take genetic samples from a close relative of the missing person, it is preferable to collect such samples directly from the subjects themselves. It is a fact of warfare that some combatants are likely to go missing in action and never be found. However, by wearing ID tags and using modern technology the numbers involved can be considerably reduced. In addition to the obvious military advantages, conclusively identifying the remains of missing service personnel is highly beneficial to the surviving relatives. Having positive identification makes it somewhat easier to come to terms with their loss and move on with their lives. Otherwise, some relatives may suspect that the missing person is still alive somewhere and may return someday.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4374611.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Arnhem soldier buried 60 years on | date=March 23, 2005 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4755183.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Family of dead WWII airman found | date=May 9, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4198304.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Funeral for RAF crew, 61 years on | date=September 1, 2005 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/7745635.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Mystery of soldier's grave solved | date=November 24, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | first=Julian | last=Sturdy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/174121.stm |work=BBC News  | title=British War hero finally gets hero's funeral | date=September 18, 1998 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/193380.stm |work=BBC News  | title=German WWII pilot laid to rest on Teesside | date=October 14, 1998 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> However, many of these identifying procedures are not typically used for combatants who are members of militias, mercenary armies, insurrections, and other irregular forces.\n\n==Before the 20th century==\nIt is possible that some of the combatants who took part of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in 480 BC went missing in action. Certainly, the numerous wars which followed over successive centuries created many MIAs. The list is long and includes most battles which have ever been fought by any nation. The usual problems of identification caused by rapid decomposition were exacerbated by the fact that it was common practice to loot the remains of the dead for any valuables e.g. personal items and clothing. This made the already difficult task of identification even harder. Thereafter the dead were routinely buried in [[mass grave]]s and scant official records were retained. Notable examples include such [[medieval]] battles as [[Battle of Towton|Towton]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Armin Schmidt |url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/archsci/depart/resgrp/towton/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907151242/http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/archsci/depart/resgrp/towton/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 7, 2007 |title=brad.ac.uk |publisher=brad.ac.uk |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2011 }}</ref> the [[Hundred Years' War]], The [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] where King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] of Portugal dissapeared, the later [[English Civil War]]s, and [[Napoleonic Wars]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/uk-waterloo-skeleton-idUKBRE85E0JM20120615 | work=Reuters | title=Rare remains of soldier found at Waterloo | date=June 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/03/artsandhumanities.research |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=After 190 years the bones of Boney's army are unearthed in a mass grave in Lithuania | first=Ian | last=Traynor | date=September 3, 2002 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> together with any battle taking place until around the middle of the 19th century. Starting around the time of the [[Crimean War]], [[American Civil War]], and [[Franco-Prussian War]], it became more common to make formal efforts to identify individual soldiers. However, since there was no formal system of [[Dog tag (identifier)|ID tags]] at the time, this could be difficult during the process of battlefield clearance. Even so, there had been a notable shift in perceptions e.g. where the remains of a soldier in Confederate uniform were recovered from, say, the [[battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg battlefield]], he would be interred in a single grave with a headstone which stated that he was an unknown [[Confederate soldier]]. This change in attitudes coincided with the [[Geneva Conventions]], the first of which was signed in 1864. Although the [[First Geneva Convention]] did not specifically address the issue of MIAs, the reasoning behind it (which specified the humane treatment of wounded enemy soldiers) was influential.\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Seringes-et-Nesles Oise-Aisne American Cemetery - Unknown Soldier.jpg|thumb|Grave of an unknown American combatant in [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial|Oise-Aisne Cemetery]]. Killed in 1917]]\nThe phenomenon of MIAs became particularly notable during World War I, where the mechanized nature of [[modern warfare]] meant that a single battle could cause astounding numbers of casualties. For example, in 1916 over 300,000 Allied and German combatants were killed in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. A total of 19,240 British and Commonwealth combatants were [[killed in action]] or died of wounds on the [[First day on the Somme|first day of that battle]] alone. It is therefore not surprising that the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]] in France bears the names of 72,090 British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] combatants, all of whom went missing in action during the Battle of the Somme, were never found and who have no known grave. Similarly, the [[Menin Gate]] memorial in [[Belgium]] commemorates 54,896 missing Allied combatants who are known to have been killed in the [[Ypres Salient]]. The [[Douaumont ossuary]], meanwhile, contains 130,000 unidentifiable sets of [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] remains from the [[Battle of Verdun]].\n\nEven in the 21st century, the remains of missing combatants are recovered from the former battlefields of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] every year.<ref>[https://www.cwgc.org/learn/news-and-events/news/2018/07/19/09/58/burial-and-rededication-services-in-august CWGC News accessed 27 July 2018]</ref> These discoveries happen regularly, often during the course of agricultural work or construction projects.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Handmade-tag-offers-clue-to.2267079.jp |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh, UK | title=Hand-made tag offers clue to identity of First World War soldier | date=October 15, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftermathww1.com/laidtorest.asp |title=aftermathww1.com |publisher=aftermathww1.com |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fylde.demon.co.uk/fraser.htm |title=fylde.demon.co.uk |publisher=fylde.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftermathww1.com/pteclarke.asp |title=aftermathww1.com |publisher=aftermathww1.com |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/monchy.htm |title=hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk |publisher=hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927102923/http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/monchy.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/bosisto.htm |title=hellfire-corner |publisher=Hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927102959/http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/bosisto.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daylife.com/photo/07OYcF36Y206d |title=daylife.com |publisher=daylife.com |date=2012-08-23 |accessdate=2012-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318074653/http://www.daylife.com/photo/07OYcF36Y206d |archivedate=March 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Typically, the remains of one or several men are found at a time.

POW/MIA activists played a role in pushing the U.S. government to improve its efforts in resolving the fates of the missing. Progress in doing so was slow until the mid-1980s, when relations between the U.S. and Vietnam began to improve and more cooperative efforts were undertaken. Normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam in the mid-1990s was a culmination of this process.\n\nConsiderable speculation and investigation has gone to a theory that a significant number of these men were captured as [[prisoners of war]] by Communist forces in the two countries and kept as live prisoners after the war's conclusion for the United States in 1973. A vocal group of POW/MIA activists maintains that there has been a concerted conspiracy by the Vietnamese government and every American government since then to hide the existence of these prisoners. The U.S. government has steadfastly denied that prisoners were left behind or that any effort has been made to cover up their existence.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DE1E30F93BA25757C0A965958260 | title=Old M.I.A. Theory Is Given a New Life | author=Engelberg, Stephen |work=The New York Times | date=1993-04-18}}</ref> Popular culture has reflected the \"live prisoners\" theory, most notably in the 1985 film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. Several congressional investigations have looked into the issue, culminating with the largest and most thorough, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]] of 1991\u20131993 led by Senators [[John Kerry]], [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]], and [[John McCain]]. Its unanimous conclusion found \"no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.\"<ref name=\"report-exec\">{{cite web | url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1993_rpt/pow-exec.html | title=Executive Summary | work=Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | date=1993-01-13 | accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThis missing in action issue has been a highly emotional one to those involved, and is often considered the last depressing, divisive aftereffect of the Vietnam War. To skeptics, \"live prisoners\" is a [[conspiracy theory]] unsupported by motivation or evidence, and the foundation for a cottage industry of charlatans who have preyed upon the hopes of the families of the missing. As two skeptics wrote in 1995, \"The conspiracy myth surrounding the Americans who remained missing after Operation Homecoming in 1973 had evolved to baroque intricacy. By 1992, there were thousands of zealots\u2014who believed with cultlike fervor that hundreds of American POWs had been deliberately and callously abandoned in Indochina after the war, that there was a vast conspiracy within the armed forces and the executive branch\u2014spanning five administrations\u2014to cover up all evidence of this betrayal, and that the governments of Communist Vietnam and Laos continued to hold an unspecified number of living American POWs, despite their adamant denials of this charge.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=Malcolm | author2=Schweitzer III | author3=Theodore G | title=Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives: Solving the MIA Mystery | publisher=Simon & Schuster | year=1995 | isbn=0-671-87118-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/insidehanoissecr00mcco }} p. 13.</ref> Believers reject such notions; as one wrote in 1994, \"It is not conspiracy theory, not paranoid myth, not Rambo fantasy. It is only hard evidence of a national disgrace: American prisoners were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War. They were abandoned because six presidents and official Washington could not admit their guilty secret. They were forgotten because the press and most Americans turned away from all things that reminded them of Vietnam.\"<ref name=\"schan94\">{{cite news | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408,schanberg2,51267,1.html | title=Did America Abandon Vietnam War P.O.W.'s? | authorlink=Sydney Schanberg | author=Schanberg, Sydney | work=[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] | date=September 1994 | accessdate=2007-06-01 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321171551/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408%2Cschanberg2%2C51267%2C1.html | archivedate=March 21, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are also a large number of [[North Vietnamese]] and [[Viet Cong]] MIAs from the Vietnam war whose remains have yet to be recovered.

The work may be difficult, dangerous, climatically challenging or underpaid. Workers in sweatshops may work long hours with low pay, regardless of laws mandating overtime pay or a [[minimum wage]]; [[child labor]] laws may also be violated.

The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses.

The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective. In 2014 Apple was caught \"failing to protect its workers\" in one of its Pegatron factories. Overwhelmed workers were caught falling asleep during their 12-hour shifts and an undercover reporter had to work 18 days in a row.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463|title=Apple 'failing to protect Chinese factory workers' |website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops in question carry characteristics such as compulsory pregnancy tests for female laborers and terrorization from supervisors into submission.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/leading-article-the-gruesome-reality-of-sweatshops-2094318.html|title=Leading Article: The Gruesome Reality of Sweatshops |work=Independent.co.uk |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> Workers then go into a state of forced labor, if even one day of work is not accounted for, most are immediately fired. These working conditions have been the source of suicidal unrest within factories in the past. Chinese sweatshops known to have increased numbers of suicidal employees have suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop over-worked and stressed employees leaping to their deaths.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Contemporary use of the term==\n\n[[File:Lindintracuay.jpg|thumb|right|A modern-day sweatshop]]\nThe phrase sweatshop was coined in 1850, meaning a factory or workshop where workers are treated unfairly, for example having low wages, working long hours and in poor conditions. Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Contributing factors==\n\n===Fast fashion===\n{{main|Fast fashion}}\nA trend called \"fast fashion\" has contributed to the rise of sweatshops.

Dissent.

To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012),<ref>Zamen, I.

According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004)<ref>Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.</ref> mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour. Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf.</ref> more than 250 million children are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).<ref>Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian. Retrieved from https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/.</ref> Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.\n\n===Environmental pollution===\nNot only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013)<ref>Stanko, N. (2013). Sweatshops. Greeniacs Nation.

Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country in which has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month,<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">The Guardian. (July 18, 2016).

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty.

The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses.

The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective.

Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Contributing factors==\n\n===Fast fashion===\n{{main|Fast fashion}}\nA trend called \"fast fashion\" has contributed to the rise of sweatshops. Fast fashion refers to \"rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time\" (Ross, 2015)<ref>Ross, R. J. S. (2015). The high toll of fast fashion. Dissent. Retrieved September 20, 2017 from Dissent, web site :https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/the-true-cost-review-fastfashion-rana-plaza-accord{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}.</ref> To catch up with the fast-changing fashion trends to satisfy increasing customers\u2019 demand, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012),<ref>Zamen, I. (2012) Corruption and the fate of the people who make your clothes. Transparency International.

For example, labour camps in Dubai, UAE do not have proper conditions for the workers and if they protest they can be deported if they are foreigners.<ref>https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/how-did-new-york-university-uphold-workers-rights-during-construction-of-abu-dhabi-satellite-campus</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/migrants-united-arab-emirates-human-rights-watch</ref>\n\n===Low education level===\nIt is suggested that these workers should fight back and protect their own labour rights, yet a lot of them in developing countries are ignorant about their own right because of low education level. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004)<ref>Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.</ref> mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour. Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf.</ref> more than 250 million children are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).<ref>Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian. Retrieved from https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/.</ref> Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.\n\n===Environmental pollution===\nNot only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013)<ref>Stanko, N. (2013). Sweatshops. Greeniacs Nation.

Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country in which has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month,<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">The Guardian. (July 18, 2016).

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

In Nepal, a carpet manufacturing company closed several sweatshops, resulting in thousands of Nepalese girls turning to prostitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,119125,00.html |title=Third World Workers Need Western Jobs |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=May 6, 2004 |access-date=March 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816030549/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,119125,00.html |archive-date=August 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nA 1996 study of corporate codes of conduct in the apparel industry by the U.S. Department of Labor has concluded that corporate codes of conduct that monitor labor norms in the apparel industry, rather than boycott or eliminate contracts upon the discovery of violations of internationally recognized labor norms, are a more effective way to eliminate child labor and the exploitation of children, provided they provide for effective monitoring that includes the participation of workers and their knowledge of the standards to which their employers are subject.<ref>{{citation |title=The Apparel Industry and Codes of Conduct: A Solution to the International Child Labor Problem? |author=U.S. Department of Labor |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/apparel/overview.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202211838/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/apparel/overview.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nArguably, the United States underwent a similar process during its own industrialization where child labor and the suppression of worker organizations were prevalent.  According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty. According to a November 2001 [[BBC]] article, in the previous two months, 100,000 sweatshop workers in Bangladesh had been put off work.

It is served by the [[E (New York City Subway service)|E]] and [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J]] trains at all times, as well as the [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|Z]] train during rush hours in the peak direction.\n\nThe station was planned as part of the construction of IND and BMT's Archer Avenue Line as outlined in the [[Program for Action]] in 1968. The construction began around 1982 and it was opened to service on December 11, 1988.\n\nThis underground, two-level station was originally named '''Sutphin Boulevard''', and served as a replacement for the former [[Sutphin Boulevard (BMT Jamaica Line)|Sutphin Boulevard elevated station]] on the demolished segment of the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] two blocks north. When the AirTrain opened, the '''JFK Airport''' suffix was added. On [[New Technology Train]]s, this station is announced as '''Sutphin Boulevard-JFK Airport''' on J/Z trains and '''Sutphin Boulevard\u2013Archer Avenue\u2013JFK''' on E trains.

The fishing port is known locally as 'The Broch' hence the club nickname. Fraserburgh currently play in the [[Highland Football League]] in [[Scotland]] and as a senior non-league team in Scottish football, they are eligible to enter the annual [[Scottish Cup]].\n\n==History==\nThe club were formed in 1910 and play at [[Bellslea Park]]. Prior to 1910, they played as a select side made up of the best players from the local amateur league.

Tokyo Tech is organised into 6 schools, within which there are over 40 departments and research centres.<ref>[http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/outline/pdf/2.pdf the number of undergraduates and departments of Tokyo Tech] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929205632/http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/outline/pdf/2.pdf |date=September 29, 2011 }} facts and stats</ref> Tokyo Tech enrolled 4,734 undergraduates and 1,464 graduate students for 2015\u20132016.<ref>[http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/disclosure/pdf/databook2015_2016_en.pdf Data Book 2015-2016], by the TIT</ref> It employs around 1,100 faculty members. Tokyo Institute of Technology produced a [[Nobel Prize]] laureate in Chemistry [[Hideki Shirakawa]] [[Ph.D]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and early years (1881\u20131922)===\nTokyo Institute of Technology was founded by the [[government of Japan]] as the Tokyo Vocational School on May 26, 1881,<ref>\"The history of the Tokyo Institute of Technology\" http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/overview/history.html</ref> 14 years after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. To accomplish the quick catch-up to the West, the government expected this school to cultivate new modernized craftsmen and engineers. In 1890, it was renamed [[Tokyo Technical School]]. In 1901, it changed name to [[Tokyo Higher Technical School]].\n\n===Great Kant\u014d earthquake and World War II (1923\u20131945)===\nIn early days, the school was located in [[Kuramae]], the eastern area of the Greater Tokyo Area, where many craftsmens' workshops had been since the old Sh\u014dgun's era. The buildings in Kuramae campus were destroyed by the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] in 1923. In the following year, the Tokyo Higher Technical School moved from Kuramae to the present site in Ookayama, a south suburb of the Greater Tokyo Area. In 1929 the school became Tokyo Institute of Technology, gaining a status of [[national university]], which allowed the university to award degrees. The university had the Research Laboratory of Building Materials in 1934, and its five years later the Research Laboratory of Resources Utilisation and the Research Laboratory of Precision Machinery were constructed. The Research Laboratory of Ceramic Industry was made in 1943, and one year before the World War Two finished the Research Laboratory of Fuel Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics were made.\n\n===Post-War Era (1946\u2013present)===\nAfter [[World War II]], the new education system was promulgated in 1949 with [[the National School Establishment Law]], and Tokyo Institute of Technology was reorganized. Many three-year courses were turned into four-year courses with the start of the School of Engineering this year. The university started graduate programmes in engineering in 1953. In the following year, the five research laboratories were integrated and reorganised into four new labs: the Research Laboratory of Building Materials, the Research Laboratory of Resources Utilization, the Precision and Intelligence Laboratory and the Research Laboratory of Ceramic Industry, and the School of Engineering was renamed the School of Science and Engineering.\n\nThroughout the post-war reconstruction of the 1950s, the high economic growth era of the 1960s, and the aggressive economic era marching to the Bubble Economy of the 1980s, TIT kept providing Japan its leading engineers, researchers, and business persons. Since April 2004, it has been semi-privatized into the National University Incorporation of Tokyo Institute of Technology under a new law<ref>[http://www.mext.go.jp/english/news/2003/07/03120301.htm ]

Tokyo Institute of Technology produced a [[Nobel Prize]] laureate in Chemistry [[Hideki Shirakawa]] [[Ph.D]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and early years (1881\u20131922)===\nTokyo Institute of Technology was founded by the [[government of Japan]] as the Tokyo Vocational School on May 26, 1881,<ref>\"The history of the Tokyo Institute of Technology\" http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/overview/history.html</ref> 14 years after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. To accomplish the quick catch-up to the West, the government expected this school to cultivate new modernized craftsmen and engineers. In 1890, it was renamed [[Tokyo Technical School]]. In 1901, it changed name to [[Tokyo Higher Technical School]].\n\n===Great Kant\u014d earthquake and World War II (1923\u20131945)===\nIn early days, the school was located in [[Kuramae]], the eastern area of the Greater Tokyo Area, where many craftsmens' workshops had been since the old Sh\u014dgun's era. The buildings in Kuramae campus were destroyed by the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] in 1923. In the following year, the Tokyo Higher Technical School moved from Kuramae to the present site in Ookayama, a south suburb of the Greater Tokyo Area. In 1929 the school became Tokyo Institute of Technology, gaining a status of [[national university]], which allowed the university to award degrees. The university had the Research Laboratory of Building Materials in 1934, and its five years later the Research Laboratory of Resources Utilisation and the Research Laboratory of Precision Machinery were constructed. The Research Laboratory of Ceramic Industry was made in 1943, and one year before the World War Two finished the Research Laboratory of Fuel Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics were made.\n\n===Post-War Era (1946\u2013present)===\nAfter [[World War II]], the new education system was promulgated in 1949 with [[the National School Establishment Law]], and Tokyo Institute of Technology was reorganized. Many three-year courses were turned into four-year courses with the start of the School of Engineering this year. The university started graduate programmes in engineering in 1953. In the following year, the five research laboratories were integrated and reorganised into four new labs: the Research Laboratory of Building Materials, the Research Laboratory of Resources Utilization, the Precision and Intelligence Laboratory and the Research Laboratory of Ceramic Industry, and the School of Engineering was renamed the School of Science and Engineering.\n\nThroughout the post-war reconstruction of the 1950s, the high economic growth era of the 1960s, and the aggressive economic era marching to the Bubble Economy of the 1980s, TIT kept providing Japan its leading engineers, researchers, and business persons. Since April 2004, it has been semi-privatized into the National University Incorporation of Tokyo Institute of Technology under a new law<ref>[http://www.mext.go.jp/english/news/2003/07/03120301.htm ]
