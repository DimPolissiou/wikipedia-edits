The small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide [[effervesce]]s. The gas was often viewed as a by-product, a hazard, and a disposal problem in active oil fields.  The large volumes produced could not be utilized until relatively expensive [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[natural gas storage|storage]] facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets.\n\nUntil the early part of the 20th century, most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or [[Gas flare|burned off]] at oil fields.

It contains a variety of calorific gases including [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and other volatile [[hydrocarbons]], together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]], and is used in a similar way to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.\n\nMost town \"gashouses\" located in the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century.) The [[coal tar]] (or [[asphalt]]) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.\n\n===Biogas===\n{{Main|Biogas}}\n[[Methanogen]]ic ''Archaea'' are responsible for almost all biological sources of methane, though [[methylphosphonate]]-degrading ''Bacteria'' produce an as-yet not fully quantified fraction of biogenic methane, particularly in the oceans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DM Karl, L Beversdorf, KM Bj\u00f6rkman, MJ Church, A Martinez, EF DeLong |year=2008 |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=473\u2013478 |title=Aerobic production of methane in the sea|doi=10.1038/ngeo234 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..473K }}</ref> Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including [[termite]]s, [[ruminant]]s, and cultivated crops. Other sources of [[methane]], the principal component of natural gas, include [[landfill gas]], biogas, and [[methane hydrate]]. When methane-rich gases are produced by the [[anaerobic decay]] of [[organic compound|organic]] matter ([[biomass]]), these are referred to as biogas (or natural biogas). Sources of biogas include [[swamp]]s, [[marsh]]es, and [[landfill]]s, as well as [[agricultural waste]] materials such as [[sewage]] [[sludge]] and [[manure]] by way of [[anaerobic digester]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/manure-management-and-air-quality/manure-treatment/docs/anaerobic-digestion-overview.pdf |author=David Schmidt |title=Anaerobic Digestion Overview |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=2017-11-19}}</ref> in addition to [[enteric fermentation]], particularly in [[cattle]]. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in [[landfill]] sites. Excluding [[water vapor]], about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is [[carbon dioxide]], with small amounts of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]], and variable trace amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[siloxane]]s. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an [[explosion]] hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, [[gas flare|flared]] or burned to produce [[electricity]] or [[heat]]. Biogas can also be produced by separating [[organic material]]s from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. [[Anaerobic lagoon]]s produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.\n\nLandfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3% {{chem|C|O|2}}, and a few parts per million {{chem|H|2|S}}, because {{chem|C|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2|S}} corrode the pipelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |title=Interstate Natural Gas\u2014Quality Specifications & Interchangeability |date= |accessdate=6 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812145240/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The presence of {{chem|C|O|2}} will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-natural-gas/|title=Reading: Natural Gas {{!}} Geology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UyqBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=The+presence+of+CO2+will+lower+the+energy+level+of+the+gas+below+requirements+for+the+pipeline#v=onepage&q=The%20presence%20of%20CO2%20will%20lower%20the%20energy%20level%20of%20the%20gas%20below%20requirements%20for%20the%20pipeline&f=false|title=Handbook of Natural Gas Analysis|last=Speight|first=James G.|date=2018-08-14|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119240280|language=en}}</ref>  Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site.  If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, [[siloxanes]] can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet [[emission standard]]s, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations. Co-firing landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion, which lowers emissions.\n\nBiogas, and especially landfill gas, are already used in some areas, but their use could be greatly expanded.

Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface.

In order to assist consumers in detecting [[leak]]s, an [[odorizer]] with a scent similar to rotten eggs, [[tert-Butylthiol]] (t-butyl mercaptan), is added. Sometimes a related compound, [[tetrahydrothiophene|thiophane]], may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry.  This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Quraishi | first2 = Ali | last3 = Bruno | first3 = Thomas J. | year = 2011| title = Findings and Recommendations From the Joint NIST\u2014AGA Workshop on Odor Masking | journal = Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | volume = 116 | issue = 6| pages = 839\u2013848 | doi=10.6028/jres.116.026| pmid = 26989604 | pmc = 4551224 }}</ref>\n\n===Risk of explosion===\n[[File:Fire engines in Kiev, Ukraine.JPG|thumb|Gas network emergency vehicle responding to a major fire in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n[[List of pipeline accidents|Explosions caused by natural]] [[gas leak]]s occur a few times each year.  Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure.  Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing.  In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries.  Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, disintegrating one or more buildings in the process.   Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls and/or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk.\nThe gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough.  From 1994 through 2013, the United States had 745 serious incidents with gas distribution, causing 278 fatalities and 1059 injuries, with $110,658,083 in property damage.<ref>https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/data-and-statistics-overview</ref>  However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk of using natural gas is very low.\n\n===Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation===\nNatural gas heating systems may cause [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns.

Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of 100 [[standard cubic feet]] (scf). [[Gas meter]]s measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one [[Residential Customer Equivalent]] (RCE). Wholesale transactions are generally done in [[decatherm]]s (Dth), thousand decatherms (MDth), or million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is a trillion BTU, roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet ({{convert|.007|$/cuft|$/m3|disp=out}}) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000&nbsp;BTU per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU or around $7 per [[gigajoule]] (GJ). In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1000 cubic feet ($10/million BTU).<ref>{{cite web|author=James L.

Each contract is for 10,000 million BTU or {{convert|10|e9BTU|GJ|0|abbr=unit}}. Thus, if the price of gas is $10/million BTU on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.\n\n===Canada===\nCanada uses [[metric units|metric]] measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule (GJ), cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>) or thousand cubic meters (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic meter). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m<sup>3</sup> or ft<sup>3</sup>), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.\n\nA [[gigajoule]] (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel (250&nbsp;lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or {{convert|1000|ft3|m3|disp=or|abbr=on}} of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from {{convert|37|to|43|MJ/m3|abbr=on}} depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.\n\n===Elsewhere===\nOutside of the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG ([[liquefied petroleum gas]]) are traded in metric tonnes (1,000&nbsp;kg) or million BTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes. The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized [[LNG carrier|transport ships]], as the gas is liquified at [[cryogenic]] temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, [[Gazprom]] sold approximately {{convert|250|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas in 2008. In 2013 they produced {{convert|487.4|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural and associated gas. Gazprom supplied Europe with {{convert|161.5|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of gas in 2013.\n\nIn August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI. The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a [[Giant oil and gas fields|\"supergiant\" gas field]] in the Mediterranean Sea covering about {{convert|40|sqmi}}.

The small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide [[effervesce]]s. The gas was often viewed as a by-product, a hazard, and a disposal problem in active oil fields.  The large volumes produced could not be utilized until relatively expensive [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[natural gas storage|storage]] facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets.\n\nUntil the early part of the 20th century, most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or [[Gas flare|burned off]] at oil fields. [[Gas venting]] and [[production flaring]] are still practised in modern times, but efforts are ongoing around the world to retire them, and to replace them with other commercially viable and useful alternatives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=1532 |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php/Zero_Routine_Flaring_by_2030 |title=UN Climate Initiatives Platform - Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref>  Unwanted gas (or [[stranded gas reserve|stranded gas]] without a market)  is often returned to the reservoir with 'injection' wells while awaiting a possible future market or to re-pressurize the formation, which can enhance oil extraction rates from other wells.

GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch]] (F\u2013T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and [[syngas to gasoline plus]] (STG+). F\u2013T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas.

The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method to deal with this problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the [[Natural gas processing|gas plant]] is to collect this condensate.

It contains a variety of calorific gases including [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and other volatile [[hydrocarbons]], together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]], and is used in a similar way to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.\n\nMost town \"gashouses\" located in the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century.) The [[coal tar]] (or [[asphalt]]) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.\n\n===Biogas===\n{{Main|Biogas}}\n[[Methanogen]]ic ''Archaea'' are responsible for almost all biological sources of methane, though [[methylphosphonate]]-degrading ''Bacteria'' produce an as-yet not fully quantified fraction of biogenic methane, particularly in the oceans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DM Karl, L Beversdorf, KM Bj\u00f6rkman, MJ Church, A Martinez, EF DeLong |year=2008 |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=473\u2013478 |title=Aerobic production of methane in the sea|doi=10.1038/ngeo234 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..473K }}</ref> Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including [[termite]]s, [[ruminant]]s, and cultivated crops.

Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in [[landfill]] sites. Excluding [[water vapor]], about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is [[carbon dioxide]], with small amounts of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]], and variable trace amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[siloxane]]s. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an [[explosion]] hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, [[gas flare|flared]] or burned to produce [[electricity]] or [[heat]]. Biogas can also be produced by separating [[organic material]]s from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. [[Anaerobic lagoon]]s produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.\n\nLandfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3% {{chem|C|O|2}}, and a few parts per million {{chem|H|2|S}}, because {{chem|C|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2|S}} corrode the pipelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |title=Interstate Natural Gas\u2014Quality Specifications & Interchangeability |date= |accessdate=6 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812145240/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The presence of {{chem|C|O|2}} will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-natural-gas/|title=Reading: Natural Gas {{!}} Geology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UyqBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=The+presence+of+CO2+will+lower+the+energy+level+of+the+gas+below+requirements+for+the+pipeline#v=onepage&q=The%20presence%20of%20CO2%20will%20lower%20the%20energy%20level%20of%20the%20gas%20below%20requirements%20for%20the%20pipeline&f=false|title=Handbook of Natural Gas Analysis|last=Speight|first=James G.|date=2018-08-14|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119240280|language=en}}</ref>  Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site.  If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, [[siloxanes]] can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet [[emission standard]]s, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations.

The high pressure water breaks up or \"fracks\" the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the \"frack,\" oil or gas is extracted and 30\u201370% of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells.

As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Quraishi | first2 = Ali | last3 = Bruno | first3 = Thomas J. | year = 2011| title = Findings and Recommendations From the Joint NIST\u2014AGA Workshop on Odor Masking | journal = Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | volume = 116 | issue = 6| pages = 839\u2013848 | doi=10.6028/jres.116.026| pmid = 26989604 | pmc = 4551224 }}</ref>\n\n===Risk of explosion===\n[[File:Fire engines in Kiev, Ukraine.JPG|thumb|Gas network emergency vehicle responding to a major fire in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n[[List of pipeline accidents|Explosions caused by natural]] [[gas leak]]s occur a few times each year.  Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure.  Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing.  In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries.  Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, disintegrating one or more buildings in the process.   Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls and/or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk.\nThe gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough.  From 1994 through 2013, the United States had 745 serious incidents with gas distribution, causing 278 fatalities and 1059 injuries, with $110,658,083 in property damage.<ref>https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/data-and-statistics-overview</ref>  However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk of using natural gas is very low.\n\n===Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation===\nNatural gas heating systems may cause [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. [[Carbon monoxide detector|Detectors]] are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).<ref>US Consumer Product Safety Commission, [http://www.cpsc.gov/Global/Research-and-Statistics/Injury-Statistics/Carbon-Monoxide-Posioning/NonFireCarbonMonoxideDeathsAssociatedwiththeUseofConsumerProducts2011AnnualEstimatesSept2014.pdf Non-Fire Carbon Monoxide Deaths, 2011 Annual Estimate], September 2014.</ref>\n\n==Energy content, statistics, and pricing==\n{{Main|Natural gas prices}}\n{{see also|Billion cubic metres of natural gas}}\n[[File:Henry hub NG prices.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Natural gas prices]] at the [[Henry Hub]] in US dollars per million BTUs]]\n[[File:Natural Gas Price Comparison.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Comparison of natural gas prices in Japan, United Kingdom, and United States, 2007\u20132011]]\n\nQuantities of natural gas are measured in [[normal cubic meter]]s (cubic meter of gas at \"normal\" temperature {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and pressure {{convert|101.325|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}) or [[Standard cubic foot|standard cubic feet]] (cubic foot of gas at \"standard\" temperature {{convert|60.0|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and pressure {{convert|14.73|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}), {{convert|1|m3|cuft|4|spell=in|sp=us|disp=x|&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;}}.

WSU website. Retrieved 2008-05-19.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, retail sales are often in units of [[therm]]s (th); 1 therm = 100,000&nbsp;BTU. Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of 100 [[standard cubic feet]] (scf). [[Gas meter]]s measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one [[Residential Customer Equivalent]] (RCE). Wholesale transactions are generally done in [[decatherm]]s (Dth), thousand decatherms (MDth), or million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is a trillion BTU, roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet ({{convert|.007|$/cuft|$/m3|disp=out}}) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000&nbsp;BTU per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU or around $7 per [[gigajoule]] (GJ). In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1000 cubic feet ($10/million BTU).<ref>{{cite web|author=James L. Williams |url=http://www.wtrg.com/daily/gasprice.html |title=NYMEX Natural Gas Futures |website=WTRG Economics|date=1998-10-02 |accessdate=2017-11-22}}</ref> The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price.

Each contract is for 10,000 million BTU or {{convert|10|e9BTU|GJ|0|abbr=unit}}. Thus, if the price of gas is $10/million BTU on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.\n\n===Canada===\nCanada uses [[metric units|metric]] measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule (GJ), cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>) or thousand cubic meters (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic meter). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m<sup>3</sup> or ft<sup>3</sup>), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.\n\nA [[gigajoule]] (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel (250&nbsp;lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or {{convert|1000|ft3|m3|disp=or|abbr=on}} of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from {{convert|37|to|43|MJ/m3|abbr=on}} depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.\n\n===Elsewhere===\nOutside of the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG ([[liquefied petroleum gas]]) are traded in metric tonnes (1,000&nbsp;kg) or million BTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes. The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized [[LNG carrier|transport ships]], as the gas is liquified at [[cryogenic]] temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, [[Gazprom]] sold approximately {{convert|250|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas in 2008. In 2013 they produced {{convert|487.4|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural and associated gas. Gazprom supplied Europe with {{convert|161.5|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of gas in 2013.\n\nIn August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI. The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a [[Giant oil and gas fields|\"supergiant\" gas field]] in the Mediterranean Sea covering about {{convert|40|sqmi}}. It was also reported that the gas field could hold a potential {{convert|30|e12cuft|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas. ENI said that the energy is about{{convert|5.5|e9BOE|abbr=~}}. The field was found in the deep waters off the northern coast of Egypt and ENI claims that it will be the largest ever in the Mediterranean and even the world.<ref>{{cite web |website=CNN Money |date=30 August 2015 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/30/news/companies/eni-gas-field/ |title=Natural gas discovery could be largest ever |first=David |last=Goldman}}</ref>\n\n==Natural gas as an asset class for institutional investors==\nResearch conducted by the [[World Pensions Council]] (WPC){{when|date=March 2014}} suggests that large US and Canadian pension funds and Asian and [[MENA]] area [[Sovereign wealth fund|SWF]] investors have become particularly active in the fields of natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, a trend started in 2005 by the formation of [[Scotia Gas Networks]] in the UK by [[OMERS]] and [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Adsorbed natural gas (ANG)==\nNatural gas may be stored by adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents. The optimal condition for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Pressures up to 4 MPa (about 40 times atmospheric pressure) will yield greater storage capacity. The most common sorbent used for ANG is activated carbon (AC), primarily in three forms: Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF), Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), activated carbon monolith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scopewe.com/category/chemical-engineering/ang|title=Adsorbed Natural Gas|work=scopeWe \u2013 a Virtual Engineer|accessdate=11 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109181802/http://scopewe.com/category/chemical-engineering/ang/|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Renewable energy}}\n* [[Associated petroleum gas]]\n* [[Gas oil ratio]]\n* [[Natural gas by country]]\n* [[Peak gas]]\n* [[Power to gas]]\n* [[Renewable natural gas]]\n* [[Thiols]] universally used as the added odorant, mercaptan, to give a foul odor safety signal when gas leaks occur\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mitei.mit.edu/publications/reports-studies/future-natural-gas The future of Natural Gas MIT study]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2341738 A Comparison between Shale Gas in China and Unconventional Fuel Development in the United States: Health, Water and Environmental Risks] by Paolo Farah and Riccardo Tremolada.

The final phase of training is Carrier Qualification (CarQual). Pilots must complete ten daytime 'traps' (arrested landings), with four touch & goes aboard an aircraft carrier at sea.

Student naval aviators or SNAs will also fly approximately 96 hours in aircraft simulators before they complete the syllabus.<ref name=SFCref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/tw1/strike-training.asp|accessdate=16 April 2020|title=Strike Flight Training}}</ref>\n\nFirst the students complete their Ground School and sims, which lasts between 1 to 1.5 months\" (This covers aerodynamics, meteorology, engineering, navigation and emergency procedures). This is followed up by some back-seat rides in the T-45 to cover the instruments. \"Phase 1 then sees them start doing cross-country flights, Fams (familiarisation flights-aerobatics, approaches, stalls, emergency landings) and Field Carrier Landing Practice\".<ref name=NATCref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jetwashaviationphotos.com/us-navy-air-training-command-.html|accessdate=16 April 2020|title=Naval Air Training Command}}</ref>\n\nDuring this stage the students are qualified to fly solo in the T-45C in all weather conditions, day and night, they learn to fly in two and four plane formation flights, and they learn how to land the T-45C the same way they will on an Aircraft Carrier.<ref name=SFCref/> \n\nField Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) is the final Intermediate Jet part of the course and this is where the students really begin to ready themselves to be tail-hookers. FCLP is designed to prepare the students for landing on an aircraft carrier and sees them perform 'touch and goes' on a simulated flight deck painted on the runway, observed by a [[Landing signal officer|Landing Signals Officer (LSO)]] who critiques and grades their performance. A [[Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System]] (known as the Meatball, or ball) on the runway verge, as fitted to all aircraft carriers and is used to assist the pilot in completing a successful trap on the flight deck.<ref name=NATCref/> Most of this phase of training takes place at Naval Outlying Field Joe Williams, approximately 25 miles northwest of [[Naval Air Station Meridian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://report-to-base.com/branch/navy/meridian/|accessdate=16 April 2020|title=Naval Air Station Meridian}}</ref>\n\nThe next phase is tactical flying, this covers [[Air combat manoeuvring]] (ACM), air to surface attacks with inert ordnance and two-ship low-level formation flights. The final phase of training is Carrier Qualification (CarQual). Pilots must complete ten daytime 'traps' (arrested landings), with four touch & goes aboard an aircraft carrier at sea. On successful completion of the course, Student Naval Aviators assigned to TW-1 are designated as Naval Aviators and earn their \"Wings of Gold\".<ref name=NATCref/>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/tw1/] Official site\n\n{{US Navy navbox}}\n{{Naval Air Training Command}}\n\n[[Category:Air wings of the United States Navy]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: between 1 to \u2192 between 1 and", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Air_Wing_One"}
