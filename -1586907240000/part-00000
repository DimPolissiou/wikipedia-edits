The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

Since her debut [[Cantonese]] album in 1985, Sandy is one of the defining figures in Chinese-language music of 20th and 21st centuries. She is known not just for her commercial success; but her ability to transform, and willingness to step outside of the frameworks of the genre and industries in which she operates. Sandy Lam has recorded not only with [[Sony Music|CBS Sony Records]] in the 1980s, but also with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]], [[Rock Records]], [[Virgin Records]], [[Capitol Records]], [[EMI|EMI Music]], and now [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]. \n\n==Early Life==\nBorn in Hong Kong on April 26, 1966 as the eldest of three children, Sandy Lam spent her early years in [[North Point]]. Music had always been a major part of the Lam family. Her father, emigrated from [[Shanghai]], was a professional [[Erhu]] musician with the [[Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra]] and her mother performed [[Yue opera]] at local venues.\n\n==A DJ and an actress==\nIn 1982, while still a secondary school student, Sandy was asked by a classmate to audition for a disc jockey position at the [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]]. Soon after, she started working as a part-time [[DJ]] at Commercial Radio 2 with a stage name \"611\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chu |first1=Yiu-Wai |title=Hong Kong Cantopop: A Concise History |date=5 January 2017 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=9888390570 |pages=86}}</ref> In 1984, she became a full-time DJ and was spotted by Tony Lee of [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS/Sony Records]] for her talent during an outdoor singing performance. She was subsequently signed as a singer that year.<ref name=scmp>{{cite web|website=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/689627/sandy-lam|title=Sandy Lam|date=13 August 2009}}</ref> And her first album was released in 1985. Meanwhile, Sandy acted in the movies \"\u8056\u8a95\u5feb\u6a02\" (1984) and \"\u9f8d\u9cf3\u667a\u591a\u661f\" (1985) and appeared in a television series \"\u5de6\u9130\u53f3\u91cc\" (1984-1985) with [[RTHK]].\n\n==Musical Career==\nSandy's musical career was not a breakout success. Her first two [[Cantonese]] language albums and corresponding imagery were heavily influenced by the Japanese idol craze. Yet despite the popularity of this style in Hong Kong, Sandy failed to strike a chord with the general public. It was not until her fourth album that she truly piqued the interest of locals by introducing Eurodance to a Hong Kong audience on \"[[Grey (album)|Grey]]\" \u7070\u8272 (1987), and evidenced her ability to transcend genres on the jazz-influenced \"Ready\" (1988).\n\n===City Rhythm===\nAt this make-or-break stage of her career, it was the \"City Rhythm\" \u90fd\u5e02\u89f8\u89ba series that really launched her into the big leagues, where she has remained ever since. A trilogy of records released between 1988 and 1990, City Rhythm gave Hong Kongers a taste of her true musical and conceptual capabilities, going platinum in the process. Serving as Executive Producer, the albums were filled with glossy dance-pop bops and ballads originally recorded by Western artists. The records were much more than this though: City Rhythm was the first successful execution of a concept record in [[Cantopop]]. Lyrically daring, the series was profoundly feminist; representing the female experience of life and love on the busy Hong Kong streets, and embodied a woman who refused to compromise her aims and desires, with each song taking on a specific aspect of life. \n\nThe song selection was also interesting: Sandy covered the songs of new artists such as [[Martika]] and [[Taylor Dayne]], positioning her as a fresh and youthful artist. Through this series, Sandy was not only able to encapsulate the glitz & glamour of 1980s Hong Kong and golden-era Cantopop, but also embody its youthfulness and ambition. A collection of corresponding remix records solidified her as Hong Kong\u2019s dancing queen.\n\n===Wildflower===\nIn 1991, Sandy teamed up with [[Singaporean]] composer [[Dick Lee]] and released the coming-of-age album \"[[Wildflower]]\" \u91ce\u82b1. With wildflowers being a metaphorical representation of the mental journey of a modern Asian woman, Wildflower was a stunning collection of contemporary east-meets-west music. Marrying traditional themes and western jazz influences, Wildflower not only made people recognize the versatility and artistic talent of Sandy, but initiated the \u2018Unplugged\u2019 craze of early 90s Cantonese music \u2013 the creation of authentic and raw musical products that connected with the listener more intimately. Although reception was at first lukewarm, it was eventually recognized as a pioneering work in the Cantonese musical canon, and is now rightly regarded as one of the most important and culturally defining albums of Cantopop.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u9999\u6e2f\u6a02\u8a55 \u6e2f\u5a9a\u516d\u5341 1st-10th \u9999\u6e2f\u6d41\u884c\u5973\u8072\u5c08\u8f2f |url=https://www.facebook.com/HKmusiccritics/photos/a.1536244216411604/1504198659616160 |publisher=Hong Kong Music Critics |date=25 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Home Again Without You===\nSimultaneously, Sandy was also developing her Taiwanese market and establishing herself in the world of [[Mandopop]]. Her debut Mandarin language album, \"Home Again Without You\" \u611b\u4e0a\u4e00\u500b\u4e0d\u56de\u5bb6\u7684\u4eba (1990), was not only a huge commercial success selling over 600,000 copies in Taiwan alone, but was seen as a watershed moment in Cantopop: the success prompted many Hong Kong musicians to test the waters of Mandopop, ushering in the start of Taiwan\u2019s regional dominance in pop music.\n\n===Love, Sandy===\nIn 1995 she paired up with Taiwanese music producer [[Jonathan Lee (record producer)|Jonathan Lee]] and released her fourth Mandarin album ''[[Love, Sandy]]''. A ten-track collection of power ballads, love songs and [[R&B]]-inspired pop, the album was a commercial blockbuster selling 800,000 copies in Taiwan and over 3 million across Asia, cementing her in new markets including Singapore and China. Almost every song became a hit record, with many becoming [[Karaoke|KTV]] standards. To date it remains one of the best-selling albums in Mandopop history.\n\nUpon release of 14th Cantopop album \"Feeling Perfect\" \u611f\u89ba\u5b8c\u7f8e (1996), Sandy spent most of her time in Taiwan, China, and Japan. Sandy broke new grounds again in 1997 when she was cast as the female lead in Hong Kong's biggest musical [[Snow.Wolf.Lake]] \u96ea\u00b7\u72fc\u00b7\u6e56, the production went on to play 42 sold out performances in [[Hong Kong Coliseum]].\n\n===At Least I Still Have You===\nAfter a hiatus lasting years following the birth of her daughter, she re-emerged and released a steady stream of Mandarin albums into the mid-00\u2019s, honing her capabilities and continuing to push herself creatively. Works during this time included \"Clang Rose\" \u93d7\u93d8\u73ab\u7470 (1999), critically praised for being avant-garde yet commercially viable, and \"Sandy Lam\u2019s\" \u6797\u61b6\u84ee\u2019S (2000) which included mega-hit \"At Least I Still Have You\" \u81f3\u5c11\u9084\u6709\u4f60. A Korean remake of the song, sung by [[Super Junior-M]], a sub-group of the [[K-Pop]] band [[Super Junior]], was released on their Me album titled ''Dangsinigie'' (\ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774\uae30\uc5d0) in 2008. From a lyrical perspective, Sandy took on a greater song-writing role for the first time on \"Truly\u2026 Sandy\" \u539f\u4f86\u2026\u6797\u61b6\u84ee (2001), where she co-wrote four songs. In the same year, Sandy appeared as cast member of an [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] concert ''Masterpiece'' in [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]], which also featured [[West End theatre|West End]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star [[Elaine Paige]] and China's all-time best-selling recording artist [[Kris Phillips]]. \n\nIn 2005, Sandy released her first Cantonese album in almost ten years: \"True Colour\" \u672c\u8272. Following the Mandarin \"Breathe Me\" \u547c\u5438 (2006) album, it would be over six years until we heard from Sandy again on record. Using this time to tour, Sandy also considered next steps for her music. From 2009, Sandy slowly began working on an album that she wanted to be different from anything she had done previously. Rather than playing safe and being too reliant on other producers and songwriters, Sandy wanted to make a fundamental change to the way she made music.\n\n===Gaia===\nIn 2012 Sandy released \"Gaia\" \u84cb\u4e9e. Titled after the Goddess of earth in [[Greek mythology]], the album was filled with themes of nature, life and faith. The record was boldly experimental in which she experimented with [[New Age]] sounds, adding spice to her repertoire.\n\nGaia was praised not only as a triumphant comeback, but held up as a landmark album in Mandopop. Lauded by critics as a forward-thinking and ground-breaking record, she was awarded several awards at the [[24th Golden Melody Awards]] in 2013, including \"Best Mandarin Female Singer\" as well as \"Best Mandarin Album\", \"Best Album Producer\" and \"Best Musical Arranger\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P3-3013181771/sandy-lam-reigns-at-24th-golden-melody-awards|title=Sandy Lam reigns at 24th Golden Melody Awards|work=[[China Post]]|publisher=[[Questia Online Library|Qiestia]]|date=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nSandy continued to challenge herself in other avenues, for example in 2017 she was a surprise entrant in a [[Hunan Television]] show \"[[Singer 2017]],\" which introduced her as a pop icon to a whole new generation of fans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/sandy-lam-wins-singer-2017-040000871.html|author=Hsia, Heidi|title=Sandy Lam wins 'Singer 2017'|website=Cinema Online|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Vivian|title=Canto-pop diva Sandy Lam emerges with first album in six years|work=South China Morning Post|date=30 August 2012}}</ref> ({{lang|zh|\u6797\u61b6\u84ee}}; born 26 April 1966) is a [[Hong Kong]] singer. Since her debut [[Cantonese]] album in 1985, Sandy is one of the defining figures in Chinese-language music of 20th and 21st centuries. She is known not just for her commercial success; but her ability to transform, and willingness to step outside of the frameworks of the genre and industries in which she operates. Sandy Lam has recorded not only with [[Sony Music|CBS Sony Records]] in the 1980s, but also with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]], [[Rock Records]], [[Virgin Records]], [[Capitol Records]], [[EMI|EMI Music]], and now [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]. \n\n==Early Life==\nBorn in Hong Kong on April 26, 1966 as the eldest of three children, Sandy Lam spent her early years in [[North Point]]. Music had always been a major part of the Lam family. Her father, emigrated from [[Shanghai]], was a professional [[Erhu]] musician with the [[Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra]] and her mother performed [[Yue opera]] at local venues.\n\n==A DJ and an actress==\nIn 1982, while still a secondary school student, Sandy was asked by a classmate to audition for a disc jockey position at the [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]]. Soon after, she started working as a part-time [[DJ]] at Commercial Radio 2 with a stage name \"611\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chu |first1=Yiu-Wai |title=Hong Kong Cantopop: A Concise History |date=5 January 2017 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=9888390570 |pages=86}}</ref> In 1984, she became a full-time DJ and was spotted by Tony Lee of [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS/Sony Records]] for her talent during an outdoor singing performance. She was subsequently signed as a singer that year.<ref name=scmp>{{cite web|website=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/689627/sandy-lam|title=Sandy Lam|date=13 August 2009}}</ref> And her first album was released in 1985. Meanwhile, Sandy acted in the movies \"\u8056\u8a95\u5feb\u6a02\" (1984) and \"\u9f8d\u9cf3\u667a\u591a\u661f\" (1985) and appeared in a television series \"\u5de6\u9130\u53f3\u91cc\" (1984-1985) with [[RTHK]].\n\n==Musical Career==\nSandy's musical career was not a breakout success. Her first two [[Cantonese]] language albums and corresponding imagery were heavily influenced by the Japanese idol craze. Yet despite the popularity of this style in Hong Kong, Sandy failed to strike a chord with the general public. It was not until her fourth album that she truly piqued the interest of locals by introducing Eurodance to a Hong Kong audience on \"[[Grey (album)|Grey]]\" \u7070\u8272 (1987), and evidenced her ability to transcend genres on the jazz-influenced \"Ready\" (1988).\n\n===City Rhythm===\nAt this make-or-break stage of her career, it was the \"City Rhythm\" \u90fd\u5e02\u89f8\u89ba series that really launched her into the big leagues, where she has remained ever since. A trilogy of records released between 1988 and 1990, City Rhythm gave Hong Kongers a taste of her true musical and conceptual capabilities, going platinum in the process. Serving as Executive Producer, the albums were filled with glossy dance-pop bops and ballads originally recorded by Western artists. The records were much more than this though: City Rhythm was the first successful execution of a concept record in [[Cantopop]]. Lyrically daring, the series was profoundly feminist; representing the female experience of life and love on the busy Hong Kong streets, and embodied a woman who refused to compromise her aims and desires, with each song taking on a specific aspect of life. \n\nThe song selection was also interesting: Sandy covered the songs of new artists such as [[Martika]] and [[Taylor Dayne]], positioning her as a fresh and youthful artist. Through this series, Sandy was not only able to encapsulate the glitz & glamour of 1980s Hong Kong and golden-era Cantopop, but also embody its youthfulness and ambition. A collection of corresponding remix records solidified her as Hong Kong\u2019s dancing queen.\n\n===Wildflower===\nIn 1991, Sandy teamed up with [[Singaporean]] composer [[Dick Lee]] and released the coming-of-age album \"[[Wildflower]]\" \u91ce\u82b1. With wildflowers being a metaphorical representation of the mental journey of a modern Asian woman, Wildflower was a stunning collection of contemporary east-meets-west music. Marrying traditional themes and western jazz influences, Wildflower not only made people recognize the versatility and artistic talent of Sandy, but initiated the \u2018Unplugged\u2019 craze of early 90s Cantonese music \u2013 the creation of authentic and raw musical products that connected with the listener more intimately. Although reception was at first lukewarm, it was eventually recognized as a pioneering work in the Cantonese musical canon, and is now rightly regarded as one of the most important and culturally defining albums of Cantopop.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u9999\u6e2f\u6a02\u8a55 \u6e2f\u5a9a\u516d\u5341 1st-10th \u9999\u6e2f\u6d41\u884c\u5973\u8072\u5c08\u8f2f |url=https://www.facebook.com/HKmusiccritics/photos/a.1536244216411604/1504198659616160 |publisher=Hong Kong Music Critics |date=25 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Home Again Without You===\nSimultaneously, Sandy was also developing her Taiwanese market and establishing herself in the world of [[Mandopop]]. Her debut Mandarin language album, \"Home Again Without You\" \u611b\u4e0a\u4e00\u500b\u4e0d\u56de\u5bb6\u7684\u4eba (1990), was not only a huge commercial success selling over 600,000 copies in Taiwan alone, but was seen as a watershed moment in Cantopop: the success prompted many Hong Kong musicians to test the waters of Mandopop, ushering in the start of Taiwan\u2019s regional dominance in pop music.\n\n===Love, Sandy===\nIn 1995 she paired up with Taiwanese music producer [[Jonathan Lee (record producer)|Jonathan Lee]] and released her fourth Mandarin album ''[[Love, Sandy]]''. A ten-track collection of power ballads, love songs and [[R&B]]-inspired pop, the album was a commercial blockbuster selling 800,000 copies in Taiwan and over 3 million across Asia, cementing her in new markets including Singapore and China. Almost every song became a hit record, with many becoming [[Karaoke|KTV]] standards. To date it remains one of the best-selling albums in Mandopop history.\n\nUpon release of 14th Cantopop album \"Feeling Perfect\" \u611f\u89ba\u5b8c\u7f8e (1996), Sandy spent most of her time in Taiwan, China, and Japan. Sandy broke new grounds again in 1997 when she was cast as the female lead in Hong Kong's biggest musical [[Snow.Wolf.Lake]] \u96ea\u00b7\u72fc\u00b7\u6e56, the production went on to play 42 sold out performances in [[Hong Kong Coliseum]].\n\n===At Least I Still Have You===\nAfter a hiatus lasting years following the birth of her daughter, she re-emerged and released a steady stream of Mandarin albums into the mid-00\u2019s, honing her capabilities and continuing to push herself creatively. Works during this time included \"Clang Rose\" \u93d7\u93d8\u73ab\u7470 (1999), critically praised for being avant-garde yet commercially viable, and \"Sandy Lam\u2019s\" \u6797\u61b6\u84ee\u2019S (2000) which included mega-hit \"At Least I Still Have You\" \u81f3\u5c11\u9084\u6709\u4f60. A Korean remake of the song, sung by [[Super Junior-M]], a sub-group of the [[K-Pop]] band [[Super Junior]], was released on their Me album titled ''Dangsinigie'' (\ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774\uae30\uc5d0) in 2008. From a lyrical perspective, Sandy took on a greater song-writing role for the first time on \"Truly\u2026 Sandy\" \u539f\u4f86\u2026\u6797\u61b6\u84ee (2001), where she co-wrote four songs. In the same year, Sandy appeared as cast member of an [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] concert ''Masterpiece'' in [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]], which also featured [[West End theatre|West End]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star [[Elaine Paige]] and China's all-time best-selling recording artist [[Kris Phillips]]. \n\nIn 2005, Sandy released her first Cantonese album in almost ten years: \"True Colour\" \u672c\u8272. Following the Mandarin \"Breathe Me\" \u547c\u5438 (2006) album, it would be over six years until we heard from Sandy again on record. Using this time to tour, Sandy also considered next steps for her music. From 2009, Sandy slowly began working on an album that she wanted to be different from anything she had done previously. Rather than playing safe and being too reliant on other producers and songwriters, Sandy wanted to make a fundamental change to the way she made music.\n\n===Gaia===\nIn 2012 Sandy released \"Gaia\" \u84cb\u4e9e. Titled after the Goddess of earth in [[Greek mythology]], the album was filled with themes of nature, life and faith. The record was boldly experimental in which she experimented with [[New Age]] sounds, adding spice to her repertoire.\n\nGaia was praised not only as a triumphant comeback, but held up as a landmark album in Mandopop. Lauded by critics as a forward-thinking and ground-breaking record, she was awarded several awards at the [[24th Golden Melody Awards]] in 2013, including \"Best Mandarin Female Singer\" as well as \"Best Mandarin Album\", \"Best Album Producer\" and \"Best Musical Arranger\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P3-3013181771/sandy-lam-reigns-at-24th-golden-melody-awards|title=Sandy Lam reigns at 24th Golden Melody Awards|work=[[China Post]]|publisher=[[Questia Online Library|Qiestia]]|date=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nSandy continued to challenge herself in other avenues, for example in 2017 she was a surprise entrant in a [[Hunan Television]] show \"[[Singer 2017]],\" which introduced her as a pop icon to a whole new generation of fans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/sandy-lam-wins-singer-2017-040000871.html|author=Hsia, Heidi|title=Sandy Lam wins 'Singer 2017'|website=Cinema Online|publisher=[[Yahoo!

It formerly operated a self-hosted forum, but now encourages discussion via [[Gitter]].\n\n{{As of|2013|02|15}}, the encyclopedia hosted about 9,289 entries and over 16,258 ''concepts'' (a concept may be for example a specific notion defined within a more general entry).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/|title=PlanetMath Encyclopedia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215215112/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/|archivedate=2013-02-15}}</ref> An overview of the current PlanetMath contents is also available.\n<ref> Tutor City\n\n</ref>\n\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Tutor Agency|url=https://tutorcity.sg|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tutorcity.sg |title=Tutor City |publisher=Tutor City |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-09-06 |}</ref> About 300 Wikipedia entries incorporate text from PlanetMath articles; they are listed in [[:Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from PlanetMath]].\n\nAn all-inclusive PlanetMath ''Free Encyclopedia'' book of 2,300 pages is available for the encyclopedia contents up to 2006 as a free download PDF file.<ref>[http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&from=books&id=207 PlanetMath \"''Free Encyclopedia''\" book] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620044430/http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&from=books&id=207 |date=June 20, 2016 }} based on 2004-2005 content of PlanetMath</ref>\n\n===Content development model===\n\nPlanetMath implements a specific content creation system called ''authority model''.<ref>[http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=collab&id=34 Noosphere's] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034756/http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=collab&id=34 |date=March 4, 2016 }} authority model</ref>.\n\nAn author who starts a new article becomes its ''owner'', that is the only person authorized to edit that article.  Other users may add corrections and discuss improvements but the resulting modifications of the article, if any, are always made by the owner.  However, if there are long lasting unresolved corrections, the ownership can be removed. More precisely, after 2 weeks the system starts to remind the owner by mail; at 6 weeks any user can \"adopt\" the article; at 8 weeks the ownership of the entry is completely removed (and such an entry is called \"orphaned\").\n\nTo make the development more smooth, the owner may also choose to grant editing rights to other individuals or groups.\n\nThe user can explicitly create links to other articles, and the system also automatically turns certain words into  links to the defining articles. The topic area of every article is classified by the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC) of the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS).\n\nThe site is supervised by the Content Committee. Its basic mission is to  ''maintain the integrity and quality of the mathematical content and organization of PlanetMath.''<ref>{{cite web |author=Username * |url=http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=collab&id=130 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126222624/http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=collab&id=130 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-11-26 |title=ContentCommittee Charter |publisher=Planetmath.org |accessdate=2013-09-06 }}</ref> As defined in its Charter, the tasks of the Committee include:\n* Developing/maintaining the standards for PlanetMath content\n* Improving individual PlanetMath entries in its Encyclopedia, Book, Paper, and Exposition)\n* Developing topic areas\n* Developing/improving site and user documentation\n* Managing the PlanetMath Request list and Unproved Theorems list\n* Improving categorization and other meta-attributes of entries.\n* Developing software recommendations for improved content authoring and editorial functions.\n\n===Technical details===\nPlanetMath content is licensed under the [[copyleft]] [[Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License]].\nAll content is written in [[LaTeX]], a typesetting system popular among [[mathematician]]s because of its support of the technical needs of mathematical typesetting and its high-quality output.\n\nThe software running PlanetMath is written in [[Perl]] and runs on [[Linux]] and the web server [[apache server|Apache]].

The lead-glazed, sandy earthenware was produced from kilns along the border between [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]]. There are two classes of Border ware, fine whitewares and fine redwares. \n\n==History==\nBorder ware evolved from a medieval pottery known as [[Surrey whiteware]]. Surrey whiteware consisted of four classes: [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston-type]] ware, Coarse Border ware, [[Cheam]] whiteware  and Tudor Green ware. The earlier whitewares were produced from the 13th to the 16th centuries.{{sfn|Vince|1985|p=76}}{{sfn|Pearce|1988|p=7}}\n\nBorder ware was manufactured in the Surrey-Hampshire border area from the 16th century to the 19th centuries, although the whitewares were produced only during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The pottery is divided into two classes, whitewares and redwares, although the term \"Border ware\" generally refers to the whitewares. The redwares are known as \"Red Border ware.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=1}}\n\n===Fabrics===\nWhiteware fabrics are generally hard with a smooth and fine texture. Fabric colours include off-white, yellow, brown, buff, olive and pinkish grey. Glazes are often [[Crazing|crazed]] and finishes range from thin and spotty to thick and glossy. Glaze colours include yellow, brown, olive clear, and green.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=5}}\n\nRedware fabrics range from smooth to slightly rough in feel. Fabric colours generally range from brick red to reddish-yellow. Finishes range from thin and uneven to thick and glossy. A clear lead glaze was often used, giving the pottery products an orange or reddish-brown colour. Other glaze colours include olive, brown and green. Green glaze was created by potters by adding copper to lead glaze.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=6}}\n\n===Forms===\nPottery products were traditional household items commonly used during the post-medieval period.{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=69}} [[Skillet|Skillets]], saucepans, chafing dishes and [[Pipkin|tripod pipkins]] were common cookware products manufactured by the Border ware pottery industry.\n[[File:Border_ware_porridger_yellow-glaze.jpg|thumb|left||Border ware porringer]]\nBorder ware forms used for serving and storing food begin with dishes, which are divided into flanged dishes and deep dishes. Bowls were manufactured in a wide variety of shapes and sizes: wide bowls, deep bowls, bowls with handles, and [[Porringer|porringers]]. Vessels for storing and serving liquids include drinking [[Jug|jugs]], [[Cup|cups]], goblets and [[Mug|mugs]]. \n\nOther Border ware forms include costrels (portable flasks), which can be divided into two categories, mammiform costrels and bottle shaped costrels. [[Candlestick|Candlesticks]] were two styles: upright and saucer.

Retrieved 5 June 2016</ref> Baine took the performing name Attila the Stockbroker during a short stint as a City stockbroker's clerk between 1980 and 1981 because a colleague accused him of having the eating habits of [[Attila the Hun]].\n\n==Career==\nHaving started performing in the late 1970s after being inspired by the spirit and 'do it yourself' ethos of the [[punk subculture]], particularly [[The Clash]]'s overtly [[Socialism|socialist]] stance, Baine was briefly bass player in punk bands English Disease and Brighton Riot Squad, and spent some time in 1979 in Brussels playing bass in Belgian band Contingent before going solo. (Contingent have now reformed and still gig from time to time)<ref name=\"Strong\" /> He did his first gig as Attila the Stockbroker at Bush Fair Playbarn, [[Harlow, Essex]], on 8 September 1980. At first he performed poems and songs in between bands at [[punk rock]] concerts, accompanying himself on the phased [[electric mandolin]]. After this was smashed over his head by [[Fascism|fascists]] during a fight at a performance in [[North London]] in May 1982, he got a [[mandola]] (a [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] lower) and has played this ever since. He has performed in 24 countries, playing venues ranging from the [[Oxford Union]] in England to [[Squatting|squatted]] punk clubs in Germany, and performs between 80 and 100 shows every year, sometimes more. He toured [[East Germany]] four times before the [[Berlin Wall]] came down, performed in a hotel in [[Enver Hoxha]]'s [[Albania]] and had to turn down the opportunity to perform in North Korea (at the World Festival of Youth & Students in 1989) because he was already booked to tour Canada. He was signed by [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]] in 1982 after recording a session for [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]] show.<ref name=\"Strong\" /> He recorded a second session for Peel in 1983.<ref name=\"KIP\">\"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/a/attilathestockbr/ Attila The Stockbroker]\", ''Keeping It Peel'', [[BBC]], retrieved 2010-10-16</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, he was often the support act for punk bands, including [[The Jam]], [[The Alarm]], [[Newtown Neurotics]], [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]] and performed extensively with fellow punk-inspired ranting poets Swift Nick (Nick Swift), Kool Knotes (Richard Edwards), Porky the Poet ([[Phill Jupitus]]) and Seething Wells ([[Steven Wells]]). [[Manic Street Preachers]] supported him at a performance at [[Swansea University]]. In the 1990s, alongside many other things, he toured with [[John Otway]] as Headbutts and Halibuts, and together they wrote a surreal rock opera called ''Cheryl'', a tale of [[Satanism]], [[Trainspotting (hobby)|trainspotting]], drug abuse and unrequited love. He has performed at every [[Glastonbury Festival]] since 1983,at the Edinburgh Fringe on and off for 35 years,  and continues to write topical, satirical material on all kinds of subjects. He puts on an annual beer and music festival 'Glastonwick', currently held at Coombes Farm, near Shoreham though originally in Southwick, his home town nearby. June 2018 saw the 23rd Glastonwick.\n\nNotable works from the 1980s include the poem \"Contributory Negligence\"; various Russian-themed poems, satirizing the alleged [[Cold War]] Russian threat in the context of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain (such as \"Russians in the [[Department of Health and Social Security|DHSS]]\" and \"Russians in [[McDonald's]]\"). Other political poems include the surreal ''Nigel'' series, such as \"Nigel wants to go to [[C&A]]\". Later pieces include \"Asylum Seeking [[Dalek]]s\", which satirises the [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] press's attitudes to immigration, and \"Hey Celebrity\", which rejects the need for the concept of celebrity.\n\nAttila the Stockbroker formed the band '''Barnstormer''' in 1994, with the initial aim of combining punk rock and early music, which they did to an extent on their debut album ''The Siege of Shoreham'' in 1996. Then Barnstormer's line up changed: they turned into a melodic punk band and for the next 22 years performed regularly across Europe, doing over 500 gigs and releasing three further albums, ''Just One Life'' (2000) ''Zero Tolerance'' (2004) and ''Bankers and Looters'' (2012). In 2018 Attila, who has always been interested in the history of the radical movements spawned in the aftermath of the English Civil War, wrote and recorded an album, ''Restoration Tragedy'' on that theme, combining early music and punk. He changed the name of the band to Barnstormer 1649 (the year of Charles 1st's execution and the  revolutionary uprisings by the [[Levellers]] and [[Diggers]]).\n\n'''Barnstormer 1649''' features Attila on vocals, mandola, violin, viola, crumhorn, cornemuse, shawm, bombarde, rauschpfeife  and recorders; Jason Pegg (formerly of Clearlake) on guitar/backing vocals; M. M. McGhee on drums; Dave Cook (also of Too Many Crooks) on bass/backing vocals and Tim O'Tay on recorders.\n\nAttila now is still doing many solo shows combining his poems and songs. He has released three CDs featuring live recordings of solo gigs: ''Live in Belfast'' (2003) ''Live in Norway'' (2007) and 'Live at the Greys' (2014) His latest book of poems, 'Undaunted' was published in 2017, 'UK Gin Dependence Party and Other Peculiarities' 'in January 2014; ''My Poetic Licence'' came out in 2008. In 2010 he published a pamphlet, ''The Long Goodbye'', containing two poems \u2014 a long one dedicated to and chronicling the life of his mother Muriel, who died in June 2010 after a six-year battle with [[Alzheimer's Disease]], and a shorter one written for his stepfather John Stanford, who died in December 2009. ''The Long Goodbye'' was featured on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' on Mother's Day 2011.  Attila celebrated 30 years of performing in September 2010 with a 27-date tour of the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. In March 2011 he toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in ten years, in 2012 made a return to Albania and in February 2014 toured the UK, Germany and Switzerland to promote his latest poetry book. In 2018 he performed at the Limerick Limerick Festival and continues to tour mainland Europe.\n\nOn 8 September 2015, the 35th anniversary of his first gig, it saw the publication of his autobiography, ''Arguments Yard (35 Years of Ranting Verse and Thrash Mandola)'' by Cherry Red Books.\n\nIn September 2016, Baine performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|Jeremy Corbyn's campaign]] in the [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|Labour Party leadership election]].<ref name=\"doncasterfreepress\">{{cite news |last=Burke|first=Darren|url=https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/tv-star-comedians-line-up-for-jeremy-corbyn-rally-in-doncaster-1-8090226|title=TV star comedians line up for Jeremy Corbyn rally in Doncaster|location=Doncaster|newspaper=[[Doncaster Free Press]]|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 a short documentary ''35 Years A Punk Poet'' about Attila's performance career was produced by film maker Farouq Suleiman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://repeatfanzine.wordpress.com/2017/02/23/attila-the-stockbroker-35-years-a-punk-poet-documentary-and-tour/|title=Attila The Stockbroker \u2013 35 years a punk poet \u2013 documentary and tour|date=23 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://experienceguildford.co.uk/news-article.php?eventid=2284|title=Experience Guildford|website=experienceguildford.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Football support==\nBaine is an supporter of [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.]] and for about 16 years was heavily involved in the successful battle to save the club and secure a new stadium, after the [[Goldstone Ground]] was sold to property developers in 1997. The Seagulls finally moved to their new stadium at [[Falmer]] in August 2011. He has been the team's poet in residence since 2000, and was the stadium announcer and DJ for 14 years, first at Gillingham, where the club spent two seasons playing 'home' games, and then at the club's temporary home at [[Withdean Stadium]].  As the main member of the one-off band Seagulls Ska, he had a single reach No. 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2005, as part of the campaign for the new stadium.  \"[[Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)]]\".\n\nOn 17 August 2016, just before the start of Brighton's debut in the Premier League, he appeared in a Guardian documentary 'From nowhere to the Premier League' about the fans' role in the club's survival and resurgence<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2017/aug/01/brighton-hove-albion-a-journey-from-nowhere-to-the-premier-league-video|title=Brighton & Hove Albion: a journey from nowhere to the Premier League \u2013 video|first1=Tom|last1=Goudsmit|first2=Ryan|last2=Baxter|date=1 August 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>  On 12 August his poem on that theme, 'From Hereford To Here'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.bt.com/video/brighton-from-hereford-to-here-91364203272187|title=Brighton: From Hereford to Here|website=BT.com}}</ref> was broadcast by BT Sport immediately before the coverage of their first game against [[Manchester City F.C|Manchester City]].

He performs solo and as the leader of the band Barnstormer 1649, who combine early music and punk. He has performed over 3,300 concerts, published eight books of poems and an autobiography (which itself has 38 poems in it) and released over forty recordings (albums and singles).<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguide/comedy/story/0,,1872259,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Comedy preview: 16 Sep}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.attilathestockbroker.com/discog.html |title=Discography |publisher=Attila the Stockbroker |date=9 January 2005 |accessdate=2013-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526015103/http://www.attilathestockbroker.com/discog.html |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2015}}\nBaine attended the [[University of Kent]], Darwin College, in [[Canterbury]] between 1975 and 1978 graduating with a 2:2 degree in French and Politics.<ref name=oxfordref>[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095433690 Attila the Stockbroker At Oxford Reference]. Retrieved 5 June 2016</ref> Baine took the performing name Attila the Stockbroker during a short stint as a City stockbroker's clerk between 1980 and 1981 because a colleague accused him of having the eating habits of [[Attila the Hun]].\n\n==Career==\nHaving started performing in the late 1970s after being inspired by the spirit and 'do it yourself' ethos of the [[punk subculture]], particularly [[The Clash]]'s overtly [[Socialism|socialist]] stance, Baine was briefly bass player in punk bands English Disease and Brighton Riot Squad, and spent some time in 1979 in Brussels playing bass in Belgian band Contingent before going solo. (Contingent have now reformed and still gig from time to time)<ref name=\"Strong\" /> He did his first gig as Attila the Stockbroker at Bush Fair Playbarn, [[Harlow, Essex]], on 8 September 1980. At first he performed poems and songs in between bands at [[punk rock]] concerts, accompanying himself on the phased [[electric mandolin]]. After this was smashed over his head by [[Fascism|fascists]] during a fight at a performance in [[North London]] in May 1982, he got a [[mandola]] (a [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] lower) and has played this ever since. He has performed in 24 countries, playing venues ranging from the [[Oxford Union]] in England to [[Squatting|squatted]] punk clubs in Germany, and performs between 80 and 100 shows every year, sometimes more. He toured [[East Germany]] four times before the [[Berlin Wall]] came down, performed in a hotel in [[Enver Hoxha]]'s [[Albania]] and had to turn down the opportunity to perform in North Korea (at the World Festival of Youth & Students in 1989) because he was already booked to tour Canada. He was signed by [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]] in 1982 after recording a session for [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]] show.<ref name=\"Strong\" /> He recorded a second session for Peel in 1983.<ref name=\"KIP\">\"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/a/attilathestockbr/ Attila The Stockbroker]\", ''Keeping It Peel'', [[BBC]], retrieved 2010-10-16</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, he was often the support act for punk bands, including [[The Jam]], [[The Alarm]], [[Newtown Neurotics]], [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]] and performed extensively with fellow punk-inspired ranting poets Swift Nick (Nick Swift), Kool Knotes (Richard Edwards), Porky the Poet ([[Phill Jupitus]]) and Seething Wells ([[Steven Wells]]). [[Manic Street Preachers]] supported him at a performance at [[Swansea University]]. In the 1990s, alongside many other things, he toured with [[John Otway]] as Headbutts and Halibuts, and together they wrote a surreal rock opera called ''Cheryl'', a tale of [[Satanism]], [[Trainspotting (hobby)|trainspotting]], drug abuse and unrequited love. He has performed at every [[Glastonbury Festival]] since 1983,at the Edinburgh Fringe on and off for 35 years,  and continues to write topical, satirical material on all kinds of subjects. He puts on an annual beer and music festival 'Glastonwick', currently held at Coombes Farm, near Shoreham though originally in Southwick, his home town nearby. June 2018 saw the 23rd Glastonwick.\n\nNotable works from the 1980s include the poem \"Contributory Negligence\"; various Russian-themed poems, satirizing the alleged [[Cold War]] Russian threat in the context of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain (such as \"Russians in the [[Department of Health and Social Security|DHSS]]\" and \"Russians in [[McDonald's]]\"). Other political poems include the surreal ''Nigel'' series, such as \"Nigel wants to go to [[C&A]]\". Later pieces include \"Asylum Seeking [[Dalek]]s\", which satirises the [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] press's attitudes to immigration, and \"Hey Celebrity\", which rejects the need for the concept of celebrity.\n\nAttila the Stockbroker formed the band '''Barnstormer''' in 1994, with the initial aim of combining punk rock and early music, which they did to an extent on their debut album ''The Siege of Shoreham'' in 1996. Then Barnstormer's line up changed: they turned into a melodic punk band and for the next 22 years performed regularly across Europe, doing over 500 gigs and releasing three further albums, ''Just One Life'' (2000) ''Zero Tolerance'' (2004) and ''Bankers and Looters'' (2012). In 2018 Attila, who has always been interested in the history of the radical movements spawned in the aftermath of the English Civil War, wrote and recorded an album, ''Restoration Tragedy'' on that theme, combining early music and punk. He changed the name of the band to Barnstormer 1649 (the year of Charles 1st's execution and the  revolutionary uprisings by the [[Levellers]] and [[Diggers]]).\n\n'''Barnstormer 1649''' features Attila on vocals, mandola, violin, viola, crumhorn, cornemuse, shawm, bombarde, rauschpfeife  and recorders; Jason Pegg (formerly of Clearlake) on guitar/backing vocals; M. M. McGhee on drums; Dave Cook (also of Too Many Crooks) on bass/backing vocals and Tim O'Tay on recorders.\n\nAttila now is still doing many solo shows combining his poems and songs. He has released three CDs featuring live recordings of solo gigs: ''Live in Belfast'' (2003) ''Live in Norway'' (2007) and 'Live at the Greys' (2014) His latest book of poems, 'Undaunted' was published in 2017, 'UK Gin Dependence Party and Other Peculiarities' 'in January 2014; ''My Poetic Licence'' came out in 2008. In 2010 he published a pamphlet, ''The Long Goodbye'', containing two poems \u2014 a long one dedicated to and chronicling the life of his mother Muriel, who died in June 2010 after a six-year battle with [[Alzheimer's Disease]], and a shorter one written for his stepfather John Stanford, who died in December 2009. ''The Long Goodbye'' was featured on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' on Mother's Day 2011.  Attila celebrated 30 years of performing in September 2010 with a 27-date tour of the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. In March 2011 he toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in ten years, in 2012 made a return to Albania and in February 2014 toured the UK, Germany and Switzerland to promote his latest poetry book. In 2018 he performed at the Limerick Limerick Festival and continues to tour mainland Europe.\n\nOn 8 September 2015, the 35th anniversary of his first gig, it saw the publication of his autobiography, ''Arguments Yard (35 Years of Ranting Verse and Thrash Mandola)'' by Cherry Red Books.\n\nIn September 2016, Baine performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|Jeremy Corbyn's campaign]] in the [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|Labour Party leadership election]].<ref name=\"doncasterfreepress\">{{cite news |last=Burke|first=Darren|url=https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/tv-star-comedians-line-up-for-jeremy-corbyn-rally-in-doncaster-1-8090226|title=TV star comedians line up for Jeremy Corbyn rally in Doncaster|location=Doncaster|newspaper=[[Doncaster Free Press]]|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 a short documentary ''35 Years A Punk Poet'' about Attila's performance career was produced by film maker Farouq Suleiman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://repeatfanzine.wordpress.com/2017/02/23/attila-the-stockbroker-35-years-a-punk-poet-documentary-and-tour/|title=Attila The Stockbroker \u2013 35 years a punk poet \u2013 documentary and tour|date=23 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://experienceguildford.co.uk/news-article.php?eventid=2284|title=Experience Guildford|website=experienceguildford.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Football support==\nBaine is an supporter of [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.]] and for about 16 years was heavily involved in the successful battle to save the club and secure a new stadium, after the [[Goldstone Ground]] was sold to property developers in 1997. The Seagulls finally moved to their new stadium at [[Falmer]] in August 2011. He has been the team's poet in residence since 2000, and was the stadium announcer and DJ for 14 years, first at Gillingham, where the club spent two seasons playing 'home' games, and then at the club's temporary home at [[Withdean Stadium]].  As the main member of the one-off band Seagulls Ska, he had a single reach No. 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2005, as part of the campaign for the new stadium.  \"[[Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)]]\".\n\nOn 17 August 2016, just before the start of Brighton's debut in the Premier League, he appeared in a Guardian documentary 'From nowhere to the Premier League' about the fans' role in the club's survival and resurgence<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2017/aug/01/brighton-hove-albion-a-journey-from-nowhere-to-the-premier-league-video|title=Brighton & Hove Albion: a journey from nowhere to the Premier League \u2013 video|first1=Tom|last1=Goudsmit|first2=Ryan|last2=Baxter|date=1 August 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>  On 12 August his poem on that theme, 'From Hereford To Here'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.bt.com/video/brighton-from-hereford-to-here-91364203272187|title=Brighton: From Hereford to Here|website=BT.com}}</ref> was broadcast by BT Sport immediately before the coverage of their first game against [[Manchester City F.C|Manchester City]].
