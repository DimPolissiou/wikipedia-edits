Forsyth argues the power of Shakespeare's language was a result of studying formal rhetoric, and highlights their use through Shakespeare's development.\n\n{{toclimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Chapters==\n\n===1: Alliteration===\nRepeating the sound of the first consonant in a series of words. An example of its deliberate overuse given by Forsyth is:\n{{quote\n|text=<poem>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade, \nHe bravely broached his boiling bloody breast;</poem>\n|sign=[[William Shakespeare]]\n|source=''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''}}\n\n===2: Polyptoton===\n{{further|Polyptoton|Antanaclasis}}\nForsyth defines this as the \"use of one word as different parts of speech or in different grammatical forms\". The term applies wherever words derived from the same root (e.g. wretched and wretchedness) are used. Other sources use the related term [[antanaclasis]] when the same word is repeated in a different sense.\n{{quote\n|text=<poem>Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:\nI am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace'\nIn an ungracious mouth is but profane.</poem>\n|sign=[[William Shakespeare]]\n|source=''[[Richard II]]''}}\n\n===3: Antithesis===\nThe use of opposites for contrasting effect. The example quoted by Forsyth is:\n{{Quote|It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.|[[Charles Dickens]]|''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''}}\n\n===4: Merism===\nReference to one thing by an enumeration of its parts, or by a list of synonyms. The chapter focuses on the first definition and provides the following example:\n{{quote|<poem>Cannon to right of them,\nCannon to left of them,\nCannon in front of them</poem>\n|[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]\n|[[The Charge of the Light Brigade]]}}\n\n===5: Blazon===\nThe tradition in poetry of praising a woman by using [[metaphors]] to describe distinct parts of her body. Calling this \"extended merism, the dismemberment of the loved one\", Forsyth quotes: \n{{quote|text=<poem>Her yellow locks exceed the beaten gold; \nHer sparkling eyes in heav'n a place deserve; \nHer forehead high and fair of comely mold</poem>\n|sign=[[Thomas Watson (poet)|Thomas Watson]]\n|source=''Hekatompathia''}}\n\n===6: Synaesthesia===\nWhere one sense is described in terms of another. An example given by Forsyth is [[Eduard Hanslick]]'s criticism of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]] as \"music that stinks to the ear\".\n\n===7: Aposiopesis===\nWhen a sentence is deliberately left unfinished, with the ending to be supplied by the audience's imagination. This makes an impression of unwillingness or inability to continue.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lanham | first = Richard A. | year = 1991 | title = A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley / Los Angeles / London | isbn = 0-520-07669-9 | page = 20}}</ref> Forsyth gives as an example: \n{{quote|text=<poem>I will have such revenges on you both,\nthat the world shall ...  I will do such things... \nWhat they are, yet I know not: but they shall be\nthe terrors of the earth.\n</poem>\n|sign=[[William Shakespeare]]\n|source=''[[King Lear]]''}}\n\n===8: Hyperbaton===\nChanging the logical order of words in a sentence. As an example, Forsyth cites [[Richard Lovelace]]'s line, \"Stone walls do not a prison make\" when the more natural wording would be \"Stone walls do not make a prison\", adding that in any case the statement is \"factually incorrect\".\n\n===9: Anadiplosis===\nRepetition of the last word of a preceding clause. Forsyth give this example:\n{{quote\n|We glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience, experience, and experience, hope, and hope maketh man not ashamed\n|[[Paul the Apostle]]\n|[[Epistle to the Romans]]}}\n\n===10: Periodic Sentences===\nA sentence that is not complete grammatically before the final clause or phrase, such as [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem ''[[If\u2014]]''\n\n===11: Hypotaxis and Parataxis===\nForsyth contrasts [[hypotaxis]], as a complex style of writing using many subordinate clauses, with [[parataxis]], a style of writing in short, simple sentences.\n\n===12: Diacope===\nThe close repetition of a word or phrase, separated by a word or words. Forsyth says the line \"Bond, James Bond\" is memorable only because of diacope, writing,: \"So just to recap, one of the greatest lines in the history of cinema is a man saying a name deliberately designed to be dull. The only possible explanation for the line's popularity is the way it is phrased. ... Wording, pure wording\".\n\n===13: Rhetorical Questions===\nAs described by Forsyth, who admits \"how complicated this all is\", rhetorical questions can be mainly divided into:\n* Questions that asked but for which no answer is expected, such as: \n{{quote\n|text=<poem>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</poem>\n|sign=[[William Shakespeare]]\n|source=[[Sonnet 18]]}}\nand\n{{quote\n|text=<poem>And did those feet in ancient time\nWalk upon England's mountains green?</poem>\n|sign=[[William Blake]]\n|source=[[And did those feet in ancient time]]}}\n*Questions that have a purpose but no real answer, such as \"What's the point? Why go on?\"\n*Questions that are asked which a particular audience will answer in a particular way, such as \"Which party cares about what is best for Britain?\" when asked by the leader of a political party at a rally of their own supporters. However, Forsyth notes the [[overwhelming exception]] when this device is used in [[Monty Python's Life of Brian]].\n*Questions that are asked aloud and then immediately answered by the questioner: \"You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory!\" (Winston Churchill, [[We shall fight on the beaches]])\n*Questions that are asked to which both the questioner and the person asked know the answer, such as a traffic policeman asking a speeding motorist, \"Did you think the speed limit didn\u2019t apply to you?\"\n\n===14: Hendiadys===\nFor emphasis an adjective-noun form is replaced by a noun-and-noun form. As an example, Forsyth writes, \"So instead of saying 'I'm going to the noisy city' you say 'I'm going to the noise and the city'\".\n\n===15: Epistrophe===\nRepetition of a word or words at the end of successive phrases, clauses or sentences for emphasis. Forsyth quotes:{{quote\n|text=<poem> Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy, I'll be there. [\u2026] And when our folk eat the stuff they raise and live in the houses they build \u2013 why, I'll be there.</poem>\n|sign=[[ John Steinbeck]]\n|source=''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''}}\n\n===16: Tricolon===\n{{further|Isocolon}}\nA sentence composed of three equal parts. Forsyth cites France's motto ([[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]).\n\n===17: Epizeuxis===\nRepetition of a word or phrase for emphasis. For example:{{quote\n|text=<poem>The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. </poem>\n|sign=[[Chuck Palahniuk]]\n|source=''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]''}}\n\n===18: Syllepsis===\n{{further|Zeugma}}\nWhere a word, used with two other parts of a sentence, must be understood differently in relation to each.\n\n===19: Isocolon===\n{{further|Isocolon}}\nA sentence is composed of two parts equivalent in structure, length and rhythm. Other sources suggest at least two equivalent parts.\n\n===20: Enallage===\nA deliberate grammatical mistake. \n\nExample: \"Mistah Kurtz\u2014he dead\" from Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''. \n\n===21: Versification===\nForsyth discusses the effect of different verse forms\n\n===22: Zeugma===\nA series of clauses using the same verb.\n\n===23: Paradox===\nA logically false or impossible statement, for emphasis or contrast.\n\n===24: Chiasmus===\nThe symmetrical repetition of structure or wording.\n\n===25: Assonance===\n{{further|Assonance}}\nThe repetition of a vowel sound.\n\n===26: The Fourteenth Rule===\nProviding an unnecessarily specific number for something for emphasis.\n\n===27: Catachresis===\n{{further|Catachresis}}\nThe grammatically incorrect use of words for creative expression.\n\nExample: Hamlet saying \"I will speak daggers\" \u2014 a catachresis since one cannot literally \"speak a dagger.\"\n\n===28: Litotes===\n{{further|Litotes}}\nEmphasizing a point by denying the opposite.\n\n===29: Metonymy and Synecdoche===\n{{further|Metonymy|Synecdoche}}\nUsing something connected to the thing described, or a part of it, in place of the thing itself.\n\n===30: Transferred Epithets===\n{{further|Hypallage}}\nApplying an adjective to the wrong noun, for effect.\n\n===31: Pleonasm===\n{{further|Pleonasm}}\nUsing superfluous or unnecessary words for emphasis.\n\n===32: Epanalepsis===\n{{further|Epanalepsis}}\nRepetition of a word or phrase at the beginning and end of a sentence or clause to emphasize circularity.\n\n===33: Personification===\n{{further|Personification}}\nAscribing human actions or qualities to a non-human thing.\n\n===34: Hyperbole===\n{{further|Hyperbole}}\nExaggeration.\n\n===35: Adynaton===\n{{further|Adynaton}}\nHyperbole so extreme that it is completely impossible.\n\n===36: Prolepsis===\n{{further|Prolepsis (rhetoric)}}\nUsing a pronoun at the start of a sentence, which reverses the normal order.\n\n===37: Congeries===\nA bewildering list of adjectives or nouns.\n\n===38: Scesis Onomaton===\n{{further|Scesis Onomaton}}\nSentences without a main verb.\n\n===39: Anaphora===\n{{further|Anaphora (rhetoric)}}\nStarting each sentence with the same words.\n\n==Critical reception==\nDavid Evans, in ''The Independent'', called it an \"enjoyable, accessible book\".<ref name=Independent_evans /> Christopher Howse in ''The Spectator'' criticised mistakes and wrongly attributed quotes in the book.

It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this dominant tree towers over many others, including some of the large broadleaf hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the [[red crossbill]], and small mammals such as [[squirrel]]s.\n\nEastern white pine forests originally covered much of north-central and north-eastern North America. Only one percent of the [[old-growth forest]]s remain after the extensive logging operations of the 18th century to early 20th century.\n\nOld growth forests, or virgin stands, are protected in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. Other protected areas with known virgin forests, as confirmed by the Eastern Native Tree Society, include [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], [[Quetico Provincial Park]], Algoma Highlands in [[Ontario]], and [[Sainte-Marguerite River Old Forest ]]<nowiki/>in Quebec, Canada; [[Estivant Pines]], [[Huron Mountains]], [[Porcupine Mountains]] State Park, and [[Sylvania Wilderness]] Area in the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]], United States; [[Hartwick Pines State Park]] in the [[Lower Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]; [[Menominee Indian Reservation]] in [[Wisconsin]]; Lost 40 Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) and [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]] in [[Minnesota]]; [[White Pines State Park]], [[Illinois]]; [[Cook Forest State Park]], [[Hearts Content Scenic Area]], and [[Anders Run Natural Area]] in [[Pennsylvania]]; and the [[Linville Gorge Wilderness]] in [[North Carolina]], United States.\n\nSmall [[Grove (nature)|groves]] or individual specimens of old growth eastern white pines are found across the range of the species in the USA, including in Ordway Pines, [[Maine]]; Ice Glen, [[Massachusetts]]; and [[Adirondack Park]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Many sites with conspicuously large specimens represent advanced [[Old field (ecology)|old field]] [[ecological succession]]. The tall stands in [[Mohawk Trail State Forest]] and [[William Cullen Bryant Homestead]] in [[Massachusetts]] are examples.\n\nAs an [[introduced species]], ''Pinus strobus'' is now [[naturalization (biology)|naturalizing]] in the [[Divisions of the Carpathians#Outer Western Carpathians (subprovince)|Outer Western Carpathians]] subdivision of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in [[Czech Republic]] and southern Poland. It has spread from specimens planted as [[ornamental tree]]s.\n\n== Description ==\nLike most members of the [[Pinus subgenus Strobus|white pine group]], ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''Strobus'', the [[leaves]] (\"needles\") are in fascicles (bundles) of 5, or rarely 3 or 4, with a [[deciduous]] [[fascicle sheath|sheath]]. They are flexible, bluish-green, finely [[serrated]], {{convert|5|-|13|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, and persist for 18 months, i.e., from the spring of one season until autumn of the next, when they [[abscission|abscise]].\n\nThe [[seed cones]] are slender, {{convert|8|-|16|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long (rarely longer than that) and {{convert|4|-|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad when open, and have scales with a rounded apex and slightly reflexed tip, often resinous. The [[seed]]s are {{convert|4|-|5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long, with a slender {{convert|15|-|20|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} wing, and are dispersed by wind. Cone production peaks every 3 to 5&nbsp;years.\n\nThe branches are spaced about every 18 inches on the trunk with 5-6 branches appearing like spokes on a wagon wheel.\n\nEastern white pine is self-fertile, but seeds produced this way tend to result in weak, stunted, and malformed seedlings.\n\nMature trees are often 200\u2013250 years old, and some live to over 400 years. A tree growing near [[Syracuse, New York]] was dated to 458 years old in the late 1980s and trees in [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] were dated to approximately 500 years old.\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Pinus strobus needles3.jpg|Leaves (needles) of new shoots in late summer\n|File:Pinus strobus Cone.jpg|A mature seed cone that has opened and released its seeds\n|File:Eastern White Pine Pinus strobus Bark Vertical.JPG|Closeup of bark\n|File:Malecones.jpg|[[Pollen cone]]s and young needles in late June\n|File:Pinus strobus branches.jpg|Branch pattern\n|File:Mature_White_Pine.jpg|Mature White Pine Cook Forest State Park\n}}\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n[[File:Pinus strobus JPG1b.jpg|thumb|right|Measuring the circumference of an eastern white pine]]\n\nThe eastern white pine has the distinction of being the tallest [[tree]] in eastern [[North America]]. In natural pre-[[Colonial America|colonial]] stands it is reported to have grown as tall as {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There is no means of accurately documenting the height of trees from these times, but eastern white pine may have reached this height on rare occasions. Even greater heights have been reported in popular, but unverifiable, accounts such as Robert Pike's \"Tall Trees, Tough Men\".\n\nTotal trunk volumes of the largest specimens are approximately {{convert|28|m3|abbr=on}}, with some past giants possibly reaching {{convert|37|or|40|m3|abbr=on}}. Photographic analysis of giants suggests volumes closer to {{convert|34|m3|abbr=on}}.\n\n==== Height ====\n''Pinus strobus'' grows approximately {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} annually between the ages of 15 and 45 years, with slower height increments before and after that age range.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Beck, D.E. |year=1971 |title=Height-Growth Patterns and Site Index of White Pine in the Southern Appalachians |journal=Forest Science |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=252\u2013260 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/fs/1971/00000017/00000002/art00024}}</ref> The tallest presently living specimens are {{convert|50|\u2013|57.55|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, as determined by the [[Native Tree Society]] (NTS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org/ |title=NTS\u2014Native Tree Society}}</ref> Prior to their exploitation, it was common for white pines in northern Wisconsin to reach heights of over {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=John|title=The Vegetation of Wisconsin: An Ordination of Plant Communities|year=1959|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, WI|pages=[https://archive.org/details/vegetationofwisc0000curt/page/204 204]\u2013205|url=https://archive.org/details/vegetationofwisc0000curt|url-access=registration|isbn=9780299019402}}</ref> Three locations in [[southeastern United States]] and one site in [[northeastern United States]] have trees that are {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. \n\nThe southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] have the most locations and the tallest trees in the present range of ''Pinus strobus''. One survivor is a specimen known as the \"Boogerman Pine\" in the [[Cataloochee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Cataloochee Valley]] of [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. At {{convert|57.55|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, it is the tallest accurately measured tree in North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It has been climbed and measured by tape drop by the Native Tree Society. Before [[Hurricane Opal]] broke its top in October 1995, Boogerman Pine was {{convert|63|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, as determined by Will Blozan and Robert Leverett using ground-based measurements.\n\nThe tallest specimens in [[Hartwick Pines State Park]] in [[Michigan]] are {{convert|45|\u2013|48|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nIn northeastern USA, 8 sites in 4 states currently have trees over {{convert|48|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, as confirmed by the Native Tree Society. The [[Cook Forest State Park]] of [[Pennsylvania]] has the most numerous collection of {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} eastern white pines in the Northeast, with 110 trees measuring that height or more.

In pure stands mature trees usually have no branches on the lower half of the trunk. The [[white pine weevil]] (''[[White pine weevil|Pissodes strobi]]'') and [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), an introduced fungus, can damage or kill these trees.\n\n=== Blister rust ===\nMortality from white pine blister rust in mature pine groves was often 50\u201380% during the early 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its life cycle on alternate hosts of the genus ''[[Ribes]]'', the native gooseberry or wild currant. Foresters proposed that if all the alternate host plants were removed that white pine blister rust might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted and all land owners in commercial pine growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild currant plants.<ref name=ling /><ref name=lombard>{{cite book |last1=Lombard |first1=K. |first2=J. |last2=Bofinger |date=1999 |title=White Pine Blister Rust |publisher=NH Div. of Forests and Lands}}</ref> The ramifications for wildlife and [[habitat]] ecology were of less concern at the time than timber industry protection.\n\nToday native wild currants are relatively rare plants in New England, and planting wild currants or wild gooseberries is strongly discouraged, or even illegal in some jurisdictions. As an alternative, new strains of commercial currants have been developed which are highly resistant to white pine blister rust. Mortality in white pines from rust is only about 3% today.<ref name=lombard />\n\n==Conservation status in the United States==\nOld white pines are treasured in the United States.

Of light weight, it has borne transportation to the farms of the west, where it is used for building purposes in dwellings, barns and corn cribs, while as a fencing material it has no superior. Aside from those conditions which demand a dense strong timber, such as ship-building or in wagon-making, white pine has been found adaptable to all the economic uses in which lumber is required, not excluding its use in coarser articles of furniture. No wood has found greater favor or entered more fully into supplying all those wants of man which could be found in the forest growths.<ref name=\"Hotchkiss 1861 752\" />\n|qalign = left\n|align = center\n|width = 65%\n}}\n\nThe species was imported in 1620 to England by Captain [[George Weymouth]], who planted it for a timber crop, but had little success because of white pine blister rust disease.\n\nOld growth pine in the Americas, of various ''Pinus'' species, was a highly desired wood since huge, knot-free boards were the rule rather than the exception. Pine was common and easy to cut, thus many colonial homes used pine for paneling, floors and furniture. Pine was also a favorite tree of loggers since pine logs can still be processed in a lumber mill a year or more after being cut down. In contrast, most hardwood trees such as cherry, maple, oak, and ash must be cut into 1\" thick boards immediately after felling or large cracks will develop in the trunk which can render the wood worthless.<ref name=ling />\n\nAlthough eastern white pine was frequently used for flooring in buildings constructed before the [[U.S. Civil War]], the wood is soft and will tend to cup over time with wear. [[George Washington]] opted for the much harder [[southern yellow pine]] at Mount Vernon instead.<ref name=ling />\n\n=== Masts ===\nDuring the age of [[square rigger]]s, tall white pines with high quality wood in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were known as ''[[mast (sailing)|mast]] pines''. Marked by agents of [[the Crown]] with the [[Broad arrow#Use in the American colonies|broad arrow]], these \"mast pines\" were reserved for the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]].\n\nSpecial barge-like vessels were built to ship up to 50 pine trunks destined to become masts.<!-- Ship from where to where?

It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this dominant tree towers over many others, including some of the large broadleaf hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the [[red crossbill]], and small mammals such as [[squirrel]]s.\n\nEastern white pine forests originally covered much of north-central and north-eastern North America. Only one percent of the [[old-growth forest]]s remain after the extensive logging operations of the 18th century to early 20th century.\n\nOld growth forests, or virgin stands, are protected in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. Other protected areas with known virgin forests, as confirmed by the Eastern Native Tree Society, include [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], [[Quetico Provincial Park]], Algoma Highlands in [[Ontario]], and [[Sainte-Marguerite River Old Forest ]] in Quebec, Canada; [[Estivant Pines]], [[Huron Mountains]], [[Porcupine Mountains]] State Park, and [[Sylvania Wilderness]] Area in the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]], United States; [[Hartwick Pines State Park]] in the [[Lower Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]; [[Menominee Indian Reservation]] in [[Wisconsin]]; Lost 40 Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) and [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]] in [[Minnesota]]; [[White Pines State Park]], [[Illinois]]; [[Cook Forest State Park]], [[Hearts Content Scenic Area]], and [[Anders Run Natural Area]] in [[Pennsylvania]]; and the [[Linville Gorge Wilderness]] in [[North Carolina]], United States.\n\nSmall [[Grove (nature)|groves]] or individual specimens of old growth eastern white pines are found across the range of the species in the USA, including in Ordway Pines, [[Maine]]; Ice Glen, [[Massachusetts]]; and [[Adirondack Park]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Many sites with conspicuously large specimens represent advanced [[Old field (ecology)|old field]] [[ecological succession]]. The tall stands in [[Mohawk Trail State Forest]] and [[William Cullen Bryant Homestead]] in [[Massachusetts]] are examples.\n\nAs an [[introduced species]], ''Pinus strobus'' is now [[naturalization (biology)|naturalizing]] in the [[Divisions of the Carpathians#Outer Western Carpathians (subprovince)|Outer Western Carpathians]] subdivision of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in [[Czech Republic]] and southern Poland. It has spread from specimens planted as [[ornamental tree]]s.\n\n== Description ==\nLike most members of the [[Pinus subgenus Strobus|white pine group]], ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''Strobus'', the [[leaves]] (\"needles\") are in fascicles (bundles) of 5, or rarely 3 or 4, with a [[deciduous]] [[fascicle sheath|sheath]]. They are flexible, bluish-green, finely [[serrated]], {{convert|5|-|13|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, and persist for 18 months, i.e., from the spring of one season until autumn of the next, when they [[abscission|abscise]].\n\nThe [[seed cones]] are slender, {{convert|8|-|16|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long (rarely longer than that) and {{convert|4|-|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad when open, and have scales with a rounded apex and slightly reflexed tip, often resinous. The [[seed]]s are {{convert|4|-|5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long, with a slender {{convert|15|-|20|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} wing, and are dispersed by wind. Cone production peaks every 3 to 5&nbsp;years.\n\nThe branches are spaced about every 18 inches on the trunk with 5-6 branches appearing like spokes on a wagon wheel.\n\nEastern white pine is self-fertile, but seeds produced this way tend to result in weak, stunted, and malformed seedlings.\n\nMature trees are often 200\u2013250 years old, and some live to over 400 years. A tree growing near [[Syracuse, New York]] was dated to 458 years old in the late 1980s and trees in [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] were dated to approximately 500 years old.\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Pinus strobus needles3.jpg|Leaves (needles) of new shoots in late summer\n|File:Pinus strobus Cone.jpg|A mature seed cone that has opened and released its seeds\n|File:Eastern White Pine Pinus strobus Bark Vertical.JPG|Closeup of bark\n|File:Malecones.jpg|[[Pollen cone]]s and young needles in late June\n|File:Pinus strobus branches.jpg|Branch pattern\n|File:Mature_White_Pine.jpg|Mature White Pine Cook Forest State Park\n}}\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n[[File:Pinus strobus JPG1b.jpg|thumb|right|Measuring the circumference of an eastern white pine]]\n\nThe eastern white pine has the distinction of being the tallest [[tree]] in eastern [[North America]]. In natural pre-[[Colonial America|colonial]] stands it is reported to have grown as tall as {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There is no means of accurately documenting the height of trees from these times, but eastern white pine may have reached this height on rare occasions. Even greater heights have been reported in popular, but unverifiable, accounts such as Robert Pike's \"Tall Trees, Tough Men\".\n\nTotal trunk volumes of the largest specimens are approximately {{convert|28|m3|abbr=on}}, with some past giants possibly reaching {{convert|37|or|40|m3|abbr=on}}.

In pure stands mature trees usually have no branches on the lower half of the trunk. The [[white pine weevil]] (''[[White pine weevil|Pissodes strobi]]'') and [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), an introduced fungus, can damage or kill these trees.\n\n=== Blister rust ===\nMortality from white pine blister rust in mature pine groves was often 50\u201380% during the early 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its life cycle on alternate hosts of the genus ''[[Ribes]]'', the native gooseberry or wild currant. Foresters proposed that if all the alternate host plants were removed that white pine blister rust might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted and all land owners in commercial pine growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild currant plants.<ref name=ling /><ref name=lombard>{{cite book |last1=Lombard |first1=K. |first2=J. |last2=Bofinger |date=1999 |title=White Pine Blister Rust |publisher=NH Div. of Forests and Lands}}</ref> The ramifications for wildlife and [[habitat]] ecology were of less concern at the time than timber industry protection.\n\nToday native wild currants are relatively rare plants in New England, and planting wild currants or wild gooseberries is strongly discouraged, or even illegal in some jurisdictions.

No wood has found greater favor or entered more fully into supplying all those wants of man which could be found in the forest growths.<ref name=\"Hotchkiss 1861 752\" />\n|qalign = left\n|align = center\n|width = 65%\n}}\n\nThe species was imported in 1620 to England by Captain [[George Weymouth]], who planted it for a timber crop, but had little success because of white pine blister rust disease.\n\nOld growth pine in the Americas, of various ''Pinus'' species, was a highly desired wood since huge, knot-free boards were the rule rather than the exception. Pine was common and easy to cut, thus many colonial homes used pine for paneling, floors and furniture. Pine was also a favorite tree of loggers since pine logs can still be processed in a lumber mill a year or more after being cut down. In contrast, most hardwood trees such as cherry, maple, oak, and ash must be cut into 1\" thick boards immediately after felling or large cracks will develop in the trunk which can render the wood worthless.<ref name=ling />\n\nAlthough eastern white pine was frequently used for flooring in buildings constructed before the [[U.S. Civil War]], the wood is soft and will tend to cup over time with wear.  [[George Washington]] opted for the much harder [[southern yellow pine]] at Mount Vernon instead.<ref name=ling />\n\n=== Masts ===\nDuring the age of [[square rigger]]s, tall white pines with high quality wood in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were known as ''[[mast (sailing)|mast]] pines''. Marked by agents of [[the Crown]] with the [[Broad arrow#Use in the American colonies|broad arrow]], these \"mast pines\" were reserved for the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]].\n\nSpecial barge-like vessels were built to ship up to 50 pine trunks destined to become masts.<!-- Ship from where to where? Oceangoing barges? --> The wood was often squared immediately after felling to fit in the holds of ships better.<ref name=ling /> A {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} mast was about {{convert|3|x|3|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} at the butt and {{convert|2|x|2|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} at the top, while a {{convert|120|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} mast was {{convert|4|x|4|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} by {{convert|30|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} on its ends.\n\nMarking of large specimens by the Crown was very controversial in the colonies, leading to the [[Pine Tree Riot]] in 1772; its act of rebellion played a significant role in the events leading to the [[American Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}  During that conflict colonists cut down and hauled off many mast pines.<ref name=nizalowski>Nizalowski, E. 1997.

An unusual large, lone, white pine was found in colonial times in coastal [[South Carolina]] along the [[Black River (South Carolina)|Black River]], far east of its southernmost normal range.

Occasionally one can find light brown pine boards with unusual yellowish-golden or reddish-brown hues. This is the famous \"pumpkin pine\". It is generally thought that slow growing pines in old-growth forests accumulate colored products in the heartwood, but genetic factors and soil conditions may also play a role in rich color development.<ref name=nizalowski />\n\nThis wood is also favored by pattern makers for its easy working.\n\n=== Foods and medicines ===\nEastern white pine needles exceed the amount of [[vitamin C]] of [[lemon]]s and oranges<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durzan|first=Don J|date=2009-02-02|title=Arginine, scurvy and Cartier's \"tree of life\"|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine|volume=5|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1746-4269-5-5|issn=1746-4269|pmc=2647905|pmid=19187550}}</ref> and make an excellent [[herbal tea]]. The [[Vascular cambium|cambium]] is edible. It is also a source of [[resveratrol]]. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] noted in the 18th century that cattle and pigs fed pine [[bark bread]] grew well, but he personally did not like the taste. Caterpillars of Lusk's pinemoth (''[[Coloradia luski]]'') have been found to feed only on ''Pinus strobus''.\n\nPine tar is produced by slowly burning pine roots, branches, or small trunks in a partially smothered flame. Pine tar mixed with beer can be used to remove [[tapeworm]]s (flat worms) or [[nematode]]s (round worms). Pine tar mixed with sulfur is useful to treat dandruff, and marketed in present-day products. Pine tar can also be processed to make [[turpentine]].<ref>Erichsen-Brown, C. 1979. Medicinal and Other Uses of North American Plants.

The [[Chippewa]] also used pine resin to successfully treat infections and even gangrenous wounds.<ref name=umich /> This is because pine resin apparently has a number of quite efficient antimicrobials. Generally a wet pulp from the inner bark, or pine tar mixed with beeswax or butter was applied to wounds and used as a salve to prevent infection.\n\n=== Cultivation ===\n''Pinus strobus'' is cultivated by [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]] as an [[ornamental tree]], for planting in gardens and parks.<ref>{{NPIN |PIST |access-date=2013-01-13}}</ref> The species is low-maintenance and rapid growing as a specimen tree.

Eastern white pines are noted for holding their needles well, even long after being harvested. They also are well suited for people with allergies, as they give little to no aroma. A standard {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip|sp=us}} tree takes approximately 6 to 8 years to grow in ideal conditions. Sheared varieties are usually desired because of their stereotypical [[Christmas tree]] conical shape, as naturally grown ones can become too thick for larger ornaments, or grow bushy in texture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christmastree.org/trees/e_wht_pn.cfm |title=Christmas tree.org}}</ref> The branches of the eastern white pine are also widely used in making holiday wreaths and garland because of their soft, feathery needles.\n\n== Symbolism ==\nEastern white pine is the [[Provincial tree emblems of Canada|Provincial Tree]] of [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sd71.bc.ca/Sd71/Edulinks/Canada/Ontindex.htm |title=Ontario Symbols |access-date=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States it is the [[List of U.S. state trees|State Tree]] of [[Maine]] (as of 1945)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/maine/state-tree/white-pine |title=Maine State Tree {{!}} White Pine}}</ref> and [[Michigan]] (as of 1955).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/michigan/state-tree/eastern-white-pine |title=Michigan State Tree {{!}} Eastern White Pine}}</ref> Its \"pine cone and tassel\" is also the [[List of U.S. state flowers|State Flower]] of Maine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/flowers/me_pine_cone_tassel.htm |website=Netstate.com |title=Maine State Flower}}</ref> Sprigs of eastern white pine were worn as badges as a symbol of [[Vermont]] identity during the [[Vermont Republic]] and are depicted in a stained glass window in the [[Vermont State House]], on the [[Flag of Vermont]], and on the [[naval ensign]] of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] and the state of Maine.

The eastern [[plain]]s and southern coasts of the country consist of fertile lowlands and foothills. They are the location of most of China's agricultural output and human population. The southern areas of the country (South of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]]) consist of hilly and mountainous terrain. The west and north of the country are dominated by sunken [[drainage basin|basin]]s (such as the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and the [[Taklamakan]]), rolling [[plateau]]s, and towering [[massif]]s. It contains part of the highest [[tableland]] on earth, the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and has much lower agricultural potential and population\n\n<!-- Background and nowadays human geography: -->\nTraditionally, the Chinese population centered on the [[Central Plain (China)|Chinese central plain]] and oriented itself toward its own enormous inland market, developing as an imperial power whose center lay in the middle and lower reaches of the [[Yellow River]] on the northern plains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} More recently, the {{convert|18000|km|abbr=on}} coastline has been used extensively for export-oriented trade, causing the coastal provinces to become the leading economic center.\n\n<!-- Area:-->\nThe People's Republic of China has an area of about {{convert|9600000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The exact land area is sometimes challenged by border disputes, most notably about [[Political Status of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Aksai Chin]], the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]], and [[South Tibet]]. The area of the People's Republic of China is {{convert|9596960|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} according to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] ''The World Factbook''.<ref name=\"CIA Factbook China\"/> The People's Republic of China is either the [[Largest countries|third or fourth largest country in the world]], being either slightly larger or slightly smaller than the [[United States]] depending on how the area of the United States is measured.

In general, the land is high in the west and descends to the east coast. Mountains (33 percent), plateaus (26 percent) and hills (10 percent) account for nearly 70 percent of the country's land surface.  Most of the country's arable land and population are based in lowland plains (12 percent) and [[structural basin|basins]] (19 percent), though some of the greatest basins are filled with deserts. The country's rugged terrain presents problems for the construction of [[Transport in China|overland transportation infrastructure]] and requires extensive terracing to sustain [[agriculture in China|agriculture]], but is conducive to the development of [[forestry]], [[mineral]] and [[hydropower]] resources, and [[tourism in China|tourism]].\n\n=== Eastern China ===\n\n;Northeast Plain\nNortheast of Shanhaiguan a narrow sliver of flat coastal land opens up into the vast [[Northeast China Plain]]. The plains extend north to the crown of the \"Chinese rooster,\" near where the [[Greater Khingan|Greater]] and [[Lesser Khingan|Lesser Hinggan]] ranges converge. The [[Changbai Mountains]] to the east divide China from the Korean peninsula. Compared with the rest of the area of China, here live the most Chinese people due to its adequate climate and topography.\n\n;North plain\nThe [[Taihang Mountains]] form the western side of the triangular [[North China Plain]]. The other two sides are the Pacific coast to the east and the Yangtze River to the southwest. The vertices of this triangle are Beijing to the north, Shanghai to the southeast, and Yichang to the southwest. This alluvial plain, fed by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, is one of the most heavily populated regions of China. The only mountains in the plain are the [[Mount Tai|Taishan]] in Shandong and [[Dabie Mountains]] of Anhui.\n\nBeijing, at the north tip of the North China Plain, is shielded by the intersection of the Taihang and [[Yan Mountains]]. Further north are the drier grasslands of the Inner Mongolian Plateau, traditionally home to pastoralists. To the south are agricultural regions, traditionally home to sedentary populations. The Great Wall of China was built in the mountains across the mountains that mark the southern edge of the Inner Mongolian Plateau. The Ming-era walls run over {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} east to west from Shanhaiguan on the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]] coast to the [[Hexi Corridor]] in Gansu.\n\n;South (hills)\n{{multiple image\n | align                                        = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer\n\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    =YangshuoFromTvTower.jpg\n | width1    = 250\n| caption1  = [[Karst]] landscape around [[Yangshuo]] in [[Guangxi]]\n | image2   =Changbai Shan 2008-06-14 IMG 1469 cropped.jpg\n | width2  = 250\n| caption2  = North slope of [[Changbaishan]] in [[Jilin Province]], near the border with [[North Korea]].\n | image3    = Mondsichelsee-06.JPG\n | width3    = 250\n| caption3  = Sand dunes of the [[Gobi Desert]] near [[Dunhuang]], in [[Gansu Province]].\n| image4 = Loess landscape china.jpg\n| width4= 250\n| caption4 = The Loess Plateau near [[Hunyuan]] in [[Datong]], [[Shanxi Province]].}}\nEast of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], deeply folded mountains fan out toward the [[Sichuan Basin]], which is ringed by mountains with 1,000\u20133,000 m elevation. The floor of the basin has an average elevation of {{Convert|500|m|feet|abbr=}} and is home to one of the most densely farmed and populated regions of China. The Sichuan Basin is capped in the north by the eastward continuation of the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun range]], the [[Qinling]], and the [[Daba Mountains|Dabashan]]. The Qinling and Dabashan ranges form a major north\u2013south divide across [[China Proper]], the traditional core area of China. Southeast of the Tibetan Plateau and south of the Sichuan Basin is the [[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]], which occupies much of southwest China. This plateau, with an average elevation of {{Convert|2,000|m|feet|abbr=}}, is known for its limestone [[karst]] landscape.\n\nSouth of the Yangtze, the landscape is more rugged. Like Shanxi Province to the north, [[Hunan]] and [[Jiangxi]] each have a provincial core in a river basin that is surrounded by mountains. The [[Wuling Mountains|Wuling]] range separates Guizhou from Hunan. The Luoxiao and [[Jinggang Mountains|Jinggang]] divide Hunan from Jiangxi, which is separated from Fujian by the [[Wuyi Mountains]]. The southeast coastal provinces, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong, have rugged coasts, with pockets of lowland and mountainous interior. The [[Nanling Mountains|Nanling]], an east\u2013west mountain range across northern Guangdong, seals off Hunan and Jiangxi from Guangdong.\n\n===Xinjiang-Mongolia===\n\nNorthwest of the Tibetan Plateau, between the northern slope of Kunlun and southern slope of Tian Shan, is the vast [[Tarim Basin]] of [[Xinjiang]], which contains the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. The Tarim Basin, the largest in China, measures {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west and {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south at its widest parts. Average elevation in the basin is 1,000 m. To the east, the basin descends into the [[Turpan Depression|Hami-Turpan Depression]] of eastern Xinjiang, where the dried lake bed of [[Lake Ayding]], at 154m below sea level, is the lowest surface point in China and [[List of countries by lowest point|the third-lowest in the world]]. With temperatures that have reached 49.6 C., the lake bed ranks as one of the hottest places in China. North of Tian Shan is Xinjiang's second great basin, the [[Dzungaria|Junggar]], which contains the [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]]. The Junggar Basin is enclosed to the north by the [[Altay Mountains]], which separate Xinjiang from Russia and Mongolia.\n\nNortheast of the Tibetan Plateau, the [[Altun Shan]]-[[Qilian Mountains]] range branches off the Kunlun and creates a parallel mountain range running east\u2013west. In between in northern Qinghai is the [[Qaidam Basin]], with elevations of 2,600\u20133,000 m and numerous brackish and salt lakes. North of the Qilian is [[Hexi Corridor]] of Gansu, a natural passage between Xinjiang and [[China Proper]] that was part of the ancient [[Silk Road]] and traversed by modern highway and rail lines to Xinjiang. Further north, the [[Mongolian Plateau|Inner Mongolian Plateau]], between 900\u20131,500 m in elevation, arcs north up the spine of China and becomes the [[Greater Hinggan]] Range of [[Northeast China]].\n\nBetween the Qinling and the Inner Mongolian Plateau is [[Loess Plateau]], the largest of its kind in the world, covering {{convert|650000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Shaanxi]], parts of [[Gansu]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces, and some of [[Ningxia]]-Hui Autonomous Region. The plateau is 1,000\u20131,500m in elevation and is filled with loess, a yellowish, loose soil that travels easily in the wind. Eroded loess silt gives the [[Yellow River]] its color and name. The Loess Plateau is bound to the east by the Luliang Mountain of Shanxi, which has a narrow basin running north to south along the Fen River. Further east are the [[Taihang Mountains]] of Hebei, the dominant topographical feature of [[North China]].\n[[File:Bayanbulak grassland.jpg|thumb|600px|center|The Bayan Bulak Grasslands in [[Hejing County]] of the [[Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture]] in [[Xinjiang]]]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n| image4 = Shishapangma5.jpg\n| width4= 250\n| caption4 = The tallest peak entirely within China is [[Shishapangma]] (8013m, 14th) of the Tibetan Himalayas in [[Nyalam County]] of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]\n | image5    = Everest North Face toward Base Camp Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg\n | width5    = 250\n | caption5  = The north face of [[Mt.

Everest]] (8848 m) in the [[Himalayas]] on the border with Nepal and the world's second tallest peak, [[K2]] (8611 m) on the border with [[Pakistan]].  From these towering heights in the west, the land descends in steps like a terrace.\n\nNorth of the Himalayas and east of the Karakorum/Pamirs is the vast Tibetan Plateau, the largest and highest plateau in the world, also known as the \"Roof of the World.\" The plateau has an average elevation of 4,000 meters above sea level and covers an area of 2.5 million square kilometers, or about one-fifth of China's land mass. In the north, the plateau is hemmed in by the [[Kunlun Mountains]], which extends eastward from the intersection of the Pamirs, Karakorum and Tian Shan.\n\n;Tallest mountain peaks\nBesides Mt. Everest and K2, the other 9 of the world's 17 tallest peaks on China's western borders are: [[Lhotse]] (8516 m, 4th highest), [[Makalu]] (8485 m, 5th), [[Cho Oyu]] (8188 m, 6th), [[Gyachung Kang]] (7952 m, 15th) of the Himalayas on the border with [[Nepal]] and [[Gasherbrum I]] (8080 m, 11th), [[Broad Peak]] (8051 m, 12th), [[Gasherbrum II]] (8035 m, 13th), [[Gasherbrum III]] (7946 m, 16th) and [[Gasherbrum IV]] (7932 m, 17th) of the Karakorum on the border with [[Pakistan]]. The tallest peak entirely within China is [[Shishapangma]] (8013 m, 14th) of the Tibetan Himalayas in [[Nyalam County]] of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].  In all, 9 of the 14 mountain peaks in the world over 8,000 m are in or on the border of China.  Another notable Himalayan peak in China is [[Namchabarwa]] (7782 m, 28th), near the great bend of the Yarlungtsanpo (upper [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]) River in eastern Tibet, and considered to be the eastern anchor of the Himalayas.\n\nOutside the Himalayas and Karakorum, China's tallest peaks are [[Kongur Tagh]] (7649 m, 37th) and [[Muztagh Ata]] (7546 m, 43rd) in the Pamirs of western [[Xinjiang]], [[Gongga Shan]] (7556 m, 41st) in the [[Daxue Mountain|Great Snowy Mountains]] of western [[Sichuan]]; and [[Jengish Chokusu|T\u00f6m\u00fcr Shan]] (7439 m, 60th), the highest peak of Tian Shan, on the border with [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n\n=== Rivers  ===\n<!--\nOutline to redo : cut into 3-4 sections + make sorter ?\nPossible outline :\n# Mandchuria ;\n# Huanghe ;\n# Yangzi ;\n# Tarim\n# Canals (on in transportation section)\n# Irrigations\n-->\n{{See also|List of rivers of China}}\n[[File:China rivers.svg|thumb|left|Main rivers of Mainland China]]\nChina originally had an estimated number of 50,000 rivers.

The majority of rivers flow west to east into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Yangtze]] (Chang Jiang) rises in [[Tibet]], flows through [[Central China]] and enters the [[East China Sea]] near [[Shanghai]]. The Yangtze is 6,300 kilometers long and has a catchment area of 1.8 million square kilometers. It is the third longest river in the world, after the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and the [[Nile]]. The second longest river in China is the Huang He ([[Yellow River]]). It rises in Tibet and travels circuitously for 5,464 kilometers through [[North China]], it empties into the [[Bo Hai Gulf]] on the north coast of the [[Shandong]] Province. It has a catchment area of 752,000 square kilometers. The [[Heilongjiang]] (Heilong or [[Black Dragon River]]) flows for 3,101 kilometers in [[Northeast China]] and an additional 1,249 kilometers in [[Russia]], where it is known as the [[Amur River|Amur]]. The longest river in [[Northern and southern China|South China]] is the Zhujiang ([[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]]), which is 2,214 kilometers long. Along with its three [[tributaries]], the Xi (West), Dong (East), and Bei (North) rivers, it forms the [[Pearl River Delta]] near [[Guangzhou]], [[Zhuhai]], [[Macau]], and [[Hong Kong]]. Other major rivers are the [[Liaohe]] in the northeast, [[Haihe]] in the north, [[Qiantang River|Qiantang]] in the east, and [[Lancang River|Lancang]] in the southwest.\n\n[[File:West Lake at night in Hangzhou.jpg|thumb|250px|[[West Lake]] in [[Hangzhou]], at night]]\nInland drainage involving upland basins in the north and northeast accounts for 40 percent of the country's total drainage area. Many rivers and streams flow into lakes or diminish in the [[desert]]. Some are used for [[irrigation]].\n\nChina's territorial waters are principally marginal seas of the western Pacific Ocean. These waters lie on the indented [[coastline]] of the mainland and approximately 5,000 [[island]]s. The [[Yellow Sea]], [[East China Sea]], and [[South China Sea]] are marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean. More than half the coastline, predominantly in the south, is rocky; most of the remainder is sandy. The [[Bay of Hangzhou]] roughly divides the two kinds of [[shoreline]].\n\n; Northern plain\nThere is a steep drop in the river level in the [[North China Plain]], where the river continues across the delta, it transports a heavy load of sand and mud which is deposited on the flat plain. The flow is aided by manmade [[Levee|embankments]]. As a result, the river flows on a raised ridge fifty meters above the plain. Waterlogging, floods, and course changes have recurred over the centuries. Traditionally, rulers were judged by their concern for or indifference to preservation of the embankments.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In the modern era, China has undertaken extensive flood control and conservation measures.\n\nFlowing from its source in the Qingzang highlands, the Yellow River courses toward the sea through the North China Plain, the historic center of Chinese expansion and influence. [[Han Chinese]] people have farmed the rich alluvial soils since ancient times, constructing the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] for north\u2013south transport during the [[History of China|Imperial Era]]. The plain is a continuation of the [[Dongbei]] (Manchurian) Plain to the northeast but is separated from it by the [[Bohai Gulf]], an extension of the Yellow Sea.\n\nLike other densely populated areas of China, the plain is subject to floods and earthquakes. The mining and industrial center of [[Tangshan]], {{convert|165|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Beijing, was leveled by an earthquake in July 1976, it was believed to be the largest earthquake of the 20th century by death toll.\n\nThe [[Hai River]], like the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]], flows from west to east. Its upper course consists of five rivers that converge near [[Tianjin]], then flow seventy kilometers before emptying into the [[Bohai Gulf]]. The [[Huai River]], rises in [[Henan]] Province and flows through several lakes before joining the Pearl River near [[Yangzhou]].\n\n; East and Yangtze\nThe [[Qin Mountains]], a continuation of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], divides the North China Plain from the [[Yangtze River Delta]] and is the major physiographic boundary between the two great parts of [[China Proper]]. It is a cultural boundary as it influences the distribution of customs and language. South of the Qinling mountain range divide are the densely populated and highly developed areas of the lower and middle plains of the [[Yangtze River]] and, on its upper reaches, the Sichuan Basin, an area encircled by a high barrier of mountain ranges.\n\nThe country's longest and most important waterway, the Yangtze River, is navigable for the majority of its length and has a vast [[hydroelectric]] potential. Rising on the Qingzang Plateau, the Yangtze River traverses {{convert|6300|km|mi|abbr=on}} through the heart of the country, draining an area of {{convert|1800000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} before emptying into the East China Sea. Roughly 300 million people live along its middle and lower reaches. The area is a large producer of rice and wheat. The Sichuan Basin, due to its mild, humid climate and long growing season, produces a variety of crops. It is a leading [[silk]]-producing area and an important industrial region with substantial [[mineral resources]].\n\nThe [[Nanling Mountains]], the southernmost of the east\u2013west mountain ranges, overlook areas in China with a [[tropical climate]]. The climate allows two crops of rice to be grown per year. Southeast of the mountains lies a coastal, hilly region of small deltas and narrow valley plains. The drainage area of the Pearl River and its associated network of rivers occupies much of the region to the south. West of the Nanling, the [[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]] rises in two steps, averaging 1,200 and 1,800 m in elevation, respectively, toward the precipitous mountain regions of the eastern Qingzang Plateau.\n\n=== Geology and natural resources ===\n{{main|Geology of China}}\n\nChina has substantial [[mineral reserve]]s and is the world's largest producer of [[antimony]], [[natural graphite]], [[tungsten]], and [[zinc]]. Other major minerals are [[aluminum]], [[bauxite]], [[coal]], [[crude petroleum]], [[diamonds]], [[gold]], [[iron ore]], [[lead]], [[magnetite]], [[manganese]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[molybdenum]], [[natural gas]], [[phosphate rock]], [[tin]], [[uranium]], and [[vanadium]]. China's [[hydropower]] potential is the largest in the world.\n\n===Land use===\n{{main|Land use in China}}\nBased on 2005 estimates, 14.86% (about {{convert|1400000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}) of China's total land area is [[arable land|arable]]. About 1.3% (some 116,580&nbsp;km\u00b2) is planted to permanent [[crops]] and the rest planted to temporary crops. With comparatively little land planted to permanent crops, intensive agricultural techniques are used to reap [[harvest]]s that are sufficient to feed the world's largest population and still have surplus for [[export]]. An estimated 544,784&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land were [[irrigated]] in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as [[pasture]], and 17.5% was [[forest]].\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{main|Wildlife of China}}\nChina lies in two of the world's major [[ecozone]]s, the [[Palearctic]] and the [[Indomalaya]]. In the Palearctic zone mammals such as the [[horse]], [[camel]], and [[jerboa]] are found. Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the [[leopard cat]], [[bamboo rat]], [[treeshrew]], and various other species of monkeys and apes. Some overlap exists between the two regions because of natural dispersal and migration, and deer or antelope, bears, wolves, pigs, and rodents are found in all of the diverse climatic and geological environments. The famous [[giant panda]] is found only in a limited area along the [[Yangtze]]. There is a continuing problem with trade in [[endangered species]], although there are now laws to prohibit such activities.\n\n==Human geography==\n\n=== History ===\n[[Image:China-Historic macro areas.svg|left|thumb|300px|The Central plain, visible in dark orange]]\nChinese history is often explained in terms of several strategic areas, defined by particular topographic limits. Starting from the [[Central Plain (China)|Chinese central plain]], the former heart of the Han populations, the Han people expanded militarily and then demographically toward the Loess Plateau, the Sichuan Basin, and the Southern Hills (as defined by the map on the left), not without resistance from local populations. Pushed by its comparatively higher demographic growth, the Han continued their expansion by military and demographic waves. The [[Lingnan|far-south]] of present-day China, the northern parts of today's Vietnam, and the [[Tarim Basin]] were first reached and durably subdued by the [[Han dynasty]]'s armies. The Northern steppes were always the source of invasions into China, which culminated in the 13th century by Mongolian conquest of the whole China and creation of Mongolian Yuan dynasty. [[Manchuria]], much of today's [[Northeast China]], and [[Korean Peninsula]] were usually not under Chinese control, with the exception of some limited periods of occupation. Manchuria became strongly integrated into the Chinese empire during the late [[Qing dynasty]], while the west side of the [[Changbai Mountains]], formerly the home of Korean tribes, thus also entered China.\n\n=== Demographic geography ===\n<!-- Demography: 10-15 sourced lines-->\n[[File:PRC Population Density.svg|thumb|right|300px|A population density map of the territories governed by the PRC. The eastern, coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior because of the historical access to water.]]\n{{see also|Demographics of China#Population density and distribution}}\nThe demographic occupation follows the topography and availability of former arable lands. The [[Heihe\u2013Tengchong Line]], running from [[Heihe]], [[Heilongjiang]] to [[Tengchong County]], [[Yunnan]] divides China into two roughly equal sections\u2013in terms of geographic area, with areas west of the line being sparsely settled and areas east densely populated, in general. Today there are 5 major religions that have been recognized by the state; Buddhism, Taoism, Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam. Buddhism and folk religions account for roughly 21% of the population while Protestants make up 5% and Islam 1.6% of the population.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/religion-china|title=The State of Religion in China|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2018-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014222036/https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/religion-china|archive-date=2018-10-14|url-status=live}}</ref> A substantial number of Buddhists live in the southwestern Tibetan region of the country which borders Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan and most notably India, the birthplace of Buddhism.

They import about four to five million metric tons of wheat per year and they are able to buy the wheat for about $70 per ton, making wheat China's most important agricultural import.

However, the way that the territory has been defined varies between ethnic groups. In relation to the Han Chinese, the homeland has been defined by national borders which are more or less accepted internationally. This is because the Han Chinese are the largest population and have most influence politically than any other ethnic population in China. To the Han Chinese population, the territory of the country is defined by the regions of Tibet, inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and the Xinjiang Province which is the most western land of China. The Chinese territory is the second largest in land area and also has the longest combined land border in the world. However, there are many other ethnic groups in China that have their own definitions of what concerns the territory of China.\n\nOne group of people in China are the Tibetans. Tibetans and the land of Tibet are considered by the Han Chinese government to be part of China and that the territory of Tibet is also part of the country. However, a few of Tibetans disagree and are protesting as well as rallying for freedom in present day. To this ethnic population, the territory of Tibet is not considered part of China and so is not defined as a Chinese territory. However, the Chinese government still consider Tibet as a territory of China which reflects the dispute in definition of Chinese territory between two ethnic groups.\n\nAnother group of people which have a dispute in definition of territory are the Taiwanese. The Taiwanese people inhabit the island of Taiwan and are markedly politically different as the people of Taiwan have a free market capitalist based economy while the mainland Chinese government employ a communistic state run economy. There are disputes in the definition of territory between Taiwan and China as the Chinese government claims ownership over Taiwan while some Taiwanese people maintain that they are a sovereign state completely independent from the mainland Chinese government. These disputes have led to international controversy as many countries such as the United States of America have not officially recognized the sovereignty of Taiwan.<ref name=\"Chung\">{{Cite book|last=Chung|first=Jae Ho|date=2017-09-21|title= Centrifugal Empire|volume= |doi=10.7312/columbia/9780231176200.003.0002|chapter=China Goes Local (Again)|isbn=9780231176200}}</ref>\n\n====Central Asia====\nChina's borders have more than {{convert|20000|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of land frontier shared with nearly all the nations of mainland [[East Asia]], and have been disputed at a number of points. In the western sector, China claimed portions of the {{convert|41000|km\u00b2|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} [[Pamir Mountains]] area, a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier-filled valleys where the borders of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], the former [[Soviet Union]], and China meet in [[Central Asia]]. North and east of this region, some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987. The {{convert|6542|km|0}} frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction. In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own. In the northeast, border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Heilongjiang]] along segments of the [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun River]], [[Amur River]], and [[Ussuri River]]. Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area. In a September 1986 speech in [[Vladivostok]], the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] offered the Chinese a more conciliatory position on Sino-Soviet border issues. In 1987 the two sides resumed border talks that had been broken off after the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] (see [[Sino-Soviet relations]]). Although the border issue remained unresolved as of late 1987, China and the Soviet Union agreed to consider the northeastern sector first. In October 2004, China signed an agreement with [[Russia]] on the [[delimitation]] of their entire {{convert|4300|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}-long border, which had long been in dispute.\n\n====Southern border====\nEastward from [[Bhutan]] and north of the [[Brahmaputra River]] (Yarlung Zangbo Jiang) lies a large area controlled and administered by India but claimed by the Chinese ([[South Tibet]]). The area was demarcated by the British [[McMahon Line]], drawn along the Himalayas in 1914 as the Sino-Indian border; India accepts and China rejects this boundary. In June 1980 China made its first move in twenty years to settle the border disputes with India, proposing that India cede the Aksai Chin area in Jammu and Kashmir to China in return for China's recognition of the McMahon Line; India did not accept the offer, however, preferring a sector-by-sector approach to the problem. In July 1986 China and India held their seventh round of border talks, but they made little headway toward resolving the dispute. Each side, but primarily India, continued to make allegations of incursions into its territory by the other. Most of the mountainous and militarized boundary with India is still in dispute, but Beijing and [[New Delhi]] have committed to begin resolution with discussions on the least disputed middle sector. India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding lands to China in a 1964 boundary agreement.\n\nThe China-Burma border issue was settled October 1, 1960, by the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The first joint inspection of the border was completed successfully in June 1986.\n\nIndia: On May 15, 2015, Mr. Li from China and Mr. Modi from India held talks at the Great Hall of the people during Modi's China tour. The two leaders held talks on border disputes that began in 1914 when the British still controlled India and signed an agreement with Tibet to make the McMahon line the de facto boundary between India and China, even though China had rejected this agreement. Both countries had various claims to disputed territories such as the South Tibetan region of Zangnan which is considered to be part of the Arunachal Pradesh state in India. So far there have been only talks and no solutions and tensions continue to rise as each country continues to increase regional influences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-32747667|title=India and China 'to resolve dispute'|date=2015-05-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126224523/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-32747667|archive-date=2018-11-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Seas====\n\nChina is involved in a complex dispute with [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], and possibly [[Brunei]] over the [[Spratly (Nansha) Islands]] in the South China Sea. The 2002 \"Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea\" eased tensions but fell short of a [[legally binding]] [[code of conduct]] desired by several of the disputants. China also controls the [[Paracel (Xisha) Islands]], which are also claimed by Vietnam, and asserts a claim to the [[Japan]]ese-administered [[Senkaku Islands|Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands]] in the East China Sea.\n\nSouth China Sea: On June 16, 2011, the Chinese government sent out one of its largest patrol ships known as the Haixun-31 which the Chinese government describe as routine. The ship will pass the Paracel and Spratly Islands and make its way up from the Malaysian to Filipino coast. Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia all have competing claims to the Spratlys Islands while Beijing and Hanoi are in dispute over the Paracel islands. Hanoi has proposed a multilateral solution between the Asian countries but China says that it prefers to negotiate with individual states separately.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13796958|title=China sends ship to disputed sea|date=2011-06-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126224542/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13796958|archive-date=2018-11-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Border security ====\nThe security and strength of the Chinese borders vary depending on the location of the section of the border in question. This is due to the nature of the borders as well as the physical geography of the country. China has a large territory, about the same size as the United States, but the actual distribution of population is highly disproportionate. Sixty percent of the population live on the east coast of China which is only 22 percent of its territory while the other 78 percent lying inland is sparsely populated with ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other Chinese Muslim groups. Many of these groups have little to no loyalty to the central government of China further adding to the strained security of China's borders. The regions of Xinjiang and Tibet in particular harbor strong separatist movements<ref name=\"Chung\"/>\n\nTibet: Many Tibetans protest and actively support the Dalai Lama who lives in exile in what he calls \"autonomous Tibet\". The Chinese authorities charge him of promoting Tibetan independence and will not allow him to come back into the country or he will face arrest. In May 2018, a Tibetan activist known as Tashi Wangchuk was sentenced to prison for five years as he voiced his concerns over that Tibetan culture was being destroyed by the Chinese government. Amnesty International denounced this sentencing to be \"beyond absurd\" but his release is still dated to be in 2021.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-44207981|title=Tibet activist jailed after NYT video|date=2018-05-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126224548/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-44207981|archive-date=2018-11-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nXinjiang: In the region of Xinjiang, Uighur separatists have engaged in acts of violence to promote independence. These Chinese Muslims have garnered support from neighboring areas in central Asia and Turkey both politically and economically. However, many of these efforts have been shut down by Chinese officials. The Xinjiang region is facing large scale immigration of Han Chinese people but the Uighurs still make up 8 out of the 19 million inhabitants. In August 2018, a UN human rights panel cited \"creditable reports\" that more than one million people in the region were being held in counter extremism centers in Xinjiang but Chinese officials claimed that only \"religious extremist\" Uighurs were undergoing re-education and resettlement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-16860974|title=Xinjiang profile|date=2018-10-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701074149/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-16860974|archive-date=2018-07-01|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nChina-Russia Relations: China and the Soviet Union signed an alliance in 1950 building on their communist relations that dated back to the 1920s. In the wake of the 1960s Sino-Soviet split, and for 25 years after the split, the border between China and Russia was one of the most unfriendly borders in the world. At one point over \"one and a half million troops armed with nuclear weapons\" were installed along the two sides of the border. Relations improved in the mid 1980s but this is due to Russia's decrease in power and threat to the Chinese government.<ref name=\"Chung\"/>\n\nDue to China's ancient history and central location in the geography of Asia, it is surrounded by potential enemies and many complicated rivalries. The government plays the fine line between domination and cooperation in order to preserve their national identity and borders. However, due to the nature of their political geography, the borders are very much volatile and disputes continue to exist in different areas of the border.\n\nTajikistan: On January 13, 2011, the country of Tajikistan agrees to cede land to the Chinese government. The Tajik parliament voted to ratify a 1999 deal to cede 1000 square kilometers of land in the remote Pamir Mountain range which the Chinese claim thoroughly resolved the century long border dispute. China is the largest investor in the Tajik economy especially in the energy and infrastructure sectors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12180567|title=Tajikistan cedes land to China|date=2011|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206010018/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12180567|archive-date=2018-12-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Government Structure ==\nThe structure of government in China is in the framework of a socialist republic which is run by a single party: the [[Communist Party of China]].

China also has a system of autonomous regions intended to give more control to ethnic minorities who preside in those regions. In practice however, the power still remains with the party secretary while the local chairman is the nominal head.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631657348|doi=10.3726/978-3-653-05128-5/13|title = Local Government Institutionalization in Hungary|year = 2015|chapter = Chapter 4: Local Party Government}}</ref>\n\n== Imperialism ==\n\n=== Japan ===\nHistorically there have been instances of imperialism in China. Japan had invaded and conquered much of Manchuria and Coastal cities in China in the Sino-Japanese war. Cities such as Nanjing and Hong Kong were devastated by Japanese forces with actions such as massacre and rape of civilians was rampant. This imperialism and invasion of Japanese forces still leads to tensions in modern day. For example, in April 2005, a Japanese junior high textbook minimized the atrocities of Nanjing stating that the massacre was an \"incident\". The textbooks transgression sent thousands of Chinese citizens out to protest and three weeks of state sanctioned protest led to rising tensions between Japan and China.<ref>{{Citation|last=MISSING-VALUE|first=MISSING-VALUE|pages=9\u201336|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315568379|doi=10.4324/9781315568379-2|title=Australia\u2014China Relations post 1949|year=2016|chapter=The pre-recognition period (1949\u20131972)}}</ref>\n\n=== Hong Kong and Britain ===\nDue to the opium wars between the British from 1839 to 1842, the British were able to make demands to the Chinese government before removing blockades and stopping bombardment on key ports. The Chinese agreed to cede the island of Hong Kong which in the control of the British, witnessed phenomenal growth. The population grew from 1,500 to 19,000 by 1844. In 1860 in the wake of the Second Opium war, the Peking convention was signed which ceded to Britain the Kowloon peninsula (up to Boundary Street) and Ngon Sun Chau, which was a part of mainland China. With the end of World War 2 however, the British lost control of the colonies and in 1997, the colony of Hong Kong was returned to the control of communist mainland China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/hongkong.htm|title=Hong Kong Colony|website=www.britishempire.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104101624/https://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/hongkong.htm|archive-date=2019-01-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Trade Agreements ==\nChina has bilateral investment agreements with 100 plus countries and economies. China's bilateral investment agreements cover expropriation, arbitration, and other investment related issues. These bilateral agreements are generally much weaker than investment treaties that the United States would want to negotiate. China also maintains fourteen free trade agreements(FTA's) and is currently implementing an additional eight FTA's. China's FTA partners are ASEAN, Singapore, Pakistan, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Costa Rica, Iceland, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Australia, and Korea.

[[Monsoon]] winds, caused by differences in the heat-absorbing capacity of the continent and the ocean, dominate the climate. During the summer, the [[East Asian Monsoon]] carries warm and moist air from the south and delivers the vast majority of the annual precipitation in much of the country. Conversely, the [[Siberian anticyclone]] dominates during winter, bringing cold and comparatively dry conditions. The advance and retreat of the monsoons account in large degree for the timing of the rainy season throughout the country. Although most of the country lies in the temperate belt, its climatic patterns are complex.\n\nThe northern extremities of both [[Heilongjiang]] and [[Inner Mongolia]] have a subarctic climate; in contrast, most of [[Hainan Island]] and parts of the extreme southern fringes of [[Yunnan]] have a tropical climate. Temperature differences in winter are considerable, but in summer the variance is considerably less. For example, [[Mohe County]], Heilongjiang has a 24-hour average temperature in January approaching {{convert|\u221230|\u00b0C}}, while the corresponding figure in July exceeds {{convert|18|\u00b0C|0}}. By contrast, most of Hainan has a January mean in excess of {{convert|17|\u00b0C|0}}, while the July mean there is generally above {{convert|28|\u00b0C}}.\n\n[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is almost invariably concentrated in the warmer months, though annual totals range from less than {{convert|20|mm|1}} in northwestern [[Qinghai]] and the [[Turpan Depression]] of Xinjiang to easily exceeding {{convert|2000|mm|0}} in [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], and Hainan. Only in some pockets of the [[Dzungaria]] region of Xinjiang is the conspicuous seasonal variation in precipitation that defines Chinese (and, to a large extent, East Asian) climate absent.\n\nAnnual sunshine duration ranges from less than 1,100 hours in parts of [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]] to over 3,400 hours in northwestern Qinghai. Seasonal patterns in sunshine vary considerably by region, but overall, [[Northern and southern China|the north]] and the Tibetan Plateau are sunnier than the south of the country.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:China_average_annual_precipitation_(en).png|The average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in [[Mainland China]] \nFile:Snow in China.jpg|Early-season [[snow]] covering part of the North China Plain near [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]\nFile:Heavy Snow in Eastern China.jpg|Snow encircling the area around the [[Bohai Sea|Bo Hai]]\nFile:Spring Sandstorm Scours China.jpg|The first day of spring 2010 brought a massive sandstorm blowing from [[Inner Mongolia]]\nFile:2010 Sandstorm over Eastern China.jpg|On November 11, 2010, a wall of sand blew across northern China, covering much of the North China Plain and [[Shandong Peninsula]].\nFile:Haze over China.jpg|[[Haze]] over the [[North China Plain]] and the [[L\u00fcliang Mountains]] of [[Shanxi]]\nFile:2010 Smog over China.jpg|Natural color satellite image of a [[smog]] event in the heart of northern China\nFile:Feb 2011 Haze over China.jpg|Dense smog settled over the North China Plain on February 20, 2011.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Environment ===\n{{main|Environment of China}}\n[[Air pollution]] ([[sulfur dioxide]] particulates) from reliance on [[coal]] is a major issue, along with [[water pollution]] from untreated wastes and use of debated standards of pollutant concentration rather than [[Total Maximum Daily Load]]. There are water shortages, particularly in the north. The eastern part of China often experiences smoke and dense fog in the atmosphere as a result of industrial pollution. Heavy [[deforestation]] with an estimated loss of one-fifth of agricultural land since 1949 to [[soil erosion]] and economic development is occurring with resulting [[desertification]]. \nChina is a party to the [[Antarctic-Environmental Protocol]], the [[Antarctic Treaty]], the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Global warming|Climate Change]] treaty, the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]], the [[Endangered Species]] treaty, the Hazardous Wastes treaty, the [[Admiralty law|Law of the Sea]], the International Tropical Timber Agreements of [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]] and [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], and agreements on Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, [[MARPOL 73/78|Ship Pollution]], and Wetlands protection.

The eastern [[plain]]s and southern coasts of the country consist of fertile lowlands and foothills. They are the location of most of China's agricultural output and human population. The southern areas of the country (South of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]]) consist of hilly and mountainous terrain. The west and north of the country are dominated by sunken [[drainage basin|basin]]s (such as the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and the [[Taklamakan]]), rolling [[plateau]]s, and towering [[massif]]s. It contains part of the highest [[tableland]] on earth, the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and has much lower agricultural potential and population\n\n<!-- Background and nowadays human geography: -->\nTraditionally, the Chinese population centered on the [[Central Plain (China)|Chinese central plain]] and oriented itself toward its own enormous inland market, developing as an imperial power whose center lay in the middle and lower reaches of the [[Yellow River]] on the northern plains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} More recently, the {{convert|18000|km|abbr=on}} coastline has been used extensively for export-oriented trade, causing the coastal provinces to become the leading economic center.\n\n<!-- Area:-->\nThe People's Republic of China has an area of about {{convert|9600000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The exact land area is sometimes challenged by border disputes, most notably about [[Political Status of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Aksai Chin]], the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]], and [[South Tibet]].

In general, the land is high in the west and descends to the east coast. Mountains (33 percent), plateaus (26 percent) and hills (10 percent) account for nearly 70 percent of the country's land surface.  Most of the country's arable land and population are based in lowland plains (12 percent) and [[structural basin|basins]] (19 percent), though some of the greatest basins are filled with deserts. The country's rugged terrain presents problems for the construction of [[Transport in China|overland transportation infrastructure]] and requires extensive terracing to sustain [[agriculture in China|agriculture]], but is conducive to the development of [[forestry]], [[mineral]] and [[hydropower]] resources, and [[tourism in China|tourism]].\n\n=== Eastern China ===\n\n;Northeast Plain\nNortheast of Shanhaiguan a narrow sliver of flat coastal land opens up into the vast [[Northeast China Plain]]. The plains extend north to the crown of the \"Chinese rooster,\" near where the [[Greater Khingan|Greater]] and [[Lesser Khingan|Lesser Hinggan]] ranges converge. The [[Changbai Mountains]] to the east divide China from the Korean peninsula. Compared with the rest of the area of China, here live the most Chinese people due to its adequate climate and topography.\n\n;North plain\nThe [[Taihang Mountains]] form the western side of the triangular [[North China Plain]]. The other two sides are the Pacific coast to the east and the Yangtze River to the southwest. The vertices of this triangle are Beijing to the north, Shanghai to the southeast, and Yichang to the southwest. This alluvial plain, fed by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, is one of the most heavily populated regions of China. The only mountains in the plain are the [[Mount Tai|Taishan]] in Shandong and [[Dabie Mountains]] of Anhui.\n\nBeijing, at the north tip of the North China Plain, is shielded by the intersection of the Taihang and [[Yan Mountains]]. Further north are the drier grasslands of the Inner Mongolian Plateau, traditionally home to pastoralists. To the south are agricultural regions, traditionally home to sedentary populations. The Great Wall of China was built in the mountains across the mountains that mark the southern edge of the Inner Mongolian Plateau. The Ming-era walls run over {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} east to west from Shanhaiguan on the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]] coast to the [[Hexi Corridor]] in Gansu.\n\n;South (hills)\n{{multiple image\n | align                                        = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer\n\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    =YangshuoFromTvTower.jpg\n | width1    = 250\n| caption1  = [[Karst]] landscape around [[Yangshuo]] in [[Guangxi]]\n | image2   =Changbai Shan 2008-06-14 IMG 1469 cropped.jpg\n | width2  = 250\n| caption2  = North slope of [[Changbaishan]] in [[Jilin Province]], near the border with [[North Korea]].\n | image3    = Mondsichelsee-06.JPG\n | width3    = 250\n| caption3  = Sand dunes of the [[Gobi Desert]] near [[Dunhuang]], in [[Gansu Province]].\n| image4 = Loess landscape china.jpg\n| width4= 250\n| caption4 = The Loess Plateau near [[Hunyuan]] in [[Datong]], [[Shanxi Province]].}}\nEast of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], deeply folded mountains fan out toward the [[Sichuan Basin]], which is ringed by mountains with 1,000\u20133,000 m elevation. The floor of the basin has an average elevation of {{Convert|500|m|feet|abbr=}} and is home to one of the most densely farmed and populated regions of China. The Sichuan Basin is capped in the north by the eastward continuation of the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun range]], the [[Qinling]], and the [[Daba Mountains|Dabashan]]. The Qinling and Dabashan ranges form a major north\u2013south divide across [[China Proper]], the traditional core area of China. Southeast of the Tibetan Plateau and south of the Sichuan Basin is the [[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]], which occupies much of southwest China. This plateau, with an average elevation of {{Convert|2,000|m|feet|abbr=}}, is known for its limestone [[karst]] landscape.\n\nSouth of the Yangtze, the landscape is more rugged. Like Shanxi Province to the north, [[Hunan]] and [[Jiangxi]] each have a provincial core in a river basin that is surrounded by mountains. The [[Wuling Mountains|Wuling]] range separates Guizhou from Hunan. The Luoxiao and [[Jinggang Mountains|Jinggang]] divide Hunan from Jiangxi, which is separated from Fujian by the [[Wuyi Mountains]]. The southeast coastal provinces, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong, have rugged coasts, with pockets of lowland and mountainous interior. The [[Nanling Mountains|Nanling]], an east\u2013west mountain range across northern Guangdong, seals off Hunan and Jiangxi from Guangdong.\n\n===Xinjiang-Mongolia===\n\nNorthwest of the Tibetan Plateau, between the northern slope of Kunlun and southern slope of Tian Shan, is the vast [[Tarim Basin]] of [[Xinjiang]], which contains the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. The Tarim Basin, the largest in China, measures {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west and {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south at its widest parts. Average elevation in the basin is 1,000 m. To the east, the basin descends into the [[Turpan Depression|Hami-Turpan Depression]] of eastern Xinjiang, where the dried lake bed of [[Lake Ayding]], at 154m below sea level, is the lowest surface point in China and [[List of countries by lowest point|the third-lowest in the world]]. With temperatures that have reached 49.6 C., the lake bed ranks as one of the hottest places in China. North of Tian Shan is Xinjiang's second great basin, the [[Dzungaria|Junggar]], which contains the [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]]. The Junggar Basin is enclosed to the north by the [[Altay Mountains]], which separate Xinjiang from Russia and Mongolia.\n\nNortheast of the Tibetan Plateau, the [[Altun Shan]]-[[Qilian Mountains]] range branches off the Kunlun and creates a parallel mountain range running east\u2013west. In between in northern Qinghai is the [[Qaidam Basin]], with elevations of 2,600\u20133,000 m and numerous brackish and salt lakes. North of the Qilian is [[Hexi Corridor]] of Gansu, a natural passage between Xinjiang and [[China Proper]] that was part of the ancient [[Silk Road]] and traversed by modern highway and rail lines to Xinjiang. Further north, the [[Mongolian Plateau|Inner Mongolian Plateau]], between 900\u20131,500 m in elevation, arcs north up the spine of China and becomes the [[Greater Hinggan]] Range of [[Northeast China]].\n\nBetween the Qinling and the Inner Mongolian Plateau is [[Loess Plateau]], the largest of its kind in the world, covering {{convert|650000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Shaanxi]], parts of [[Gansu]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces, and some of [[Ningxia]]-Hui Autonomous Region. The plateau is 1,000\u20131,500m in elevation and is filled with loess, a yellowish, loose soil that travels easily in the wind. Eroded loess silt gives the [[Yellow River]] its color and name. The Loess Plateau is bound to the east by the Luliang Mountain of Shanxi, which has a narrow basin running north to south along the Fen River. Further east are the [[Taihang Mountains]] of Hebei, the dominant topographical feature of [[North China]].\n[[File:Bayanbulak grassland.jpg|thumb|600px|center|The Bayan Bulak Grasslands in [[Hejing County]] of the [[Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture]] in [[Xinjiang]]]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n| image4 = Shishapangma5.jpg\n| width4= 250\n| caption4 = The tallest peak entirely within China is [[Shishapangma]] (8013m, 14th) of the Tibetan Himalayas in [[Nyalam County]] of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]\n | image5    = Everest North Face toward Base Camp Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg\n | width5    = 250\n | caption5  = The north face of [[Mt.

Eleven of the seventeen tallest mountain peaks on Earth are located on China's western borders. They include the world's tallest peak [[Mt. Everest]] (8848 m) in the [[Himalayas]] on the border with Nepal and the world's second tallest peak, [[K2]] (8611 m) on the border with [[Pakistan]].  From these towering heights in the west, the land descends in steps like a terrace.\n\nNorth of the Himalayas and east of the Karakorum/Pamirs is the vast Tibetan Plateau, the largest and highest plateau in the world, also known as the \"Roof of the World.\" The plateau has an average elevation of 4,000 meters above sea level and covers an area of 2.5 million square kilometers, or about one-fifth of China's land mass. In the north, the plateau is hemmed in by the [[Kunlun Mountains]], which extends eastward from the intersection of the Pamirs, Karakorum and Tian Shan.\n\n;Tallest mountain peaks\nBesides Mt. Everest and K2, the other 9 of the world's 17 tallest peaks on China's western borders are: [[Lhotse]] (8516 m, 4th highest), [[Makalu]] (8485 m, 5th), [[Cho Oyu]] (8188 m, 6th), [[Gyachung Kang]] (7952 m, 15th) of the Himalayas on the border with [[Nepal]] and [[Gasherbrum I]] (8080 m, 11th), [[Broad Peak]] (8051 m, 12th), [[Gasherbrum II]] (8035 m, 13th), [[Gasherbrum III]] (7946 m, 16th) and [[Gasherbrum IV]] (7932 m, 17th) of the Karakorum on the border with [[Pakistan]]. The tallest peak entirely within China is [[Shishapangma]] (8013 m, 14th) of the Tibetan Himalayas in [[Nyalam County]] of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].  In all, 9 of the 14 mountain peaks in the world over 8,000 m are in or on the border of China.  Another notable Himalayan peak in China is [[Namchabarwa]] (7782 m, 28th), near the great bend of the Yarlungtsanpo (upper [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]) River in eastern Tibet, and considered to be the eastern anchor of the Himalayas.\n\nOutside the Himalayas and Karakorum, China's tallest peaks are [[Kongur Tagh]] (7649 m, 37th) and [[Muztagh Ata]] (7546 m, 43rd) in the Pamirs of western [[Xinjiang]], [[Gongga Shan]] (7556 m, 41st) in the [[Daxue Mountain|Great Snowy Mountains]] of western [[Sichuan]]; and [[Jengish Chokusu|T\u00f6m\u00fcr Shan]] (7439 m, 60th), the highest peak of Tian Shan, on the border with [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n\n=== Rivers  ===\n<!--\nOutline to redo : cut into 3-4 sections + make sorter ?\nPossible outline :\n# Mandchuria ;\n# Huanghe ;\n# Yangzi ;\n# Tarim\n# Canals (on in transportation section)\n# Irrigations\n-->\n{{See also|List of rivers of China}}\n[[File:China rivers.svg|thumb|left|Main rivers of Mainland China]]\nChina originally had an estimated number of 50,000 rivers.

The majority of rivers flow west to east into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Yangtze]] (Chang Jiang) rises in [[Tibet]], flows through [[Central China]] and enters the [[East China Sea]] near [[Shanghai]]. The Yangtze is 6,300 kilometers long and has a catchment area of 1.8 million square kilometers. It is the third longest river in the world, after the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and the [[Nile]]. The second longest river in China is the Huang He ([[Yellow River]]). It rises in Tibet and travels circuitously for 5,464 kilometers through [[North China]], it empties into the [[Bo Hai Gulf]] on the north coast of the [[Shandong]] Province. It has a catchment area of 752,000 square kilometers. The [[Heilongjiang]] (Heilong or [[Black Dragon River]]) flows for 3,101 kilometers in [[Northeast China]] and an additional 1,249 kilometers in [[Russia]], where it is known as the [[Amur River|Amur]]. The longest river in [[Northern and southern China|South China]] is the Zhujiang ([[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]]), which is 2,214 kilometers long. Along with its three [[tributaries]], the Xi (West), Dong (East), and Bei (North) rivers, it forms the [[Pearl River Delta]] near [[Guangzhou]], [[Zhuhai]], [[Macau]], and [[Hong Kong]]. Other major rivers are the [[Liaohe]] in the northeast, [[Haihe]] in the north, [[Qiantang River|Qiantang]] in the east, and [[Lancang River|Lancang]] in the southwest.\n\n[[File:West Lake at night in Hangzhou.jpg|thumb|250px|[[West Lake]] in [[Hangzhou]], at night]]\nInland drainage involving upland basins in the north and northeast accounts for 40 percent of the country's total drainage area. Many rivers and streams flow into lakes or diminish in the [[desert]]. Some are used for [[irrigation]].\n\nChina's territorial waters are principally marginal seas of the western Pacific Ocean. These waters lie on the indented [[coastline]] of the mainland and approximately 5,000 [[island]]s. The [[Yellow Sea]], [[East China Sea]], and [[South China Sea]] are marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean. More than half the coastline, predominantly in the south, is rocky; most of the remainder is sandy. The [[Bay of Hangzhou]] roughly divides the two kinds of [[shoreline]].\n\n; Northern plain\nThere is a steep drop in the river level in the [[North China Plain]], where the river continues across the delta, it transports a heavy load of sand and mud which is deposited on the flat plain. The flow is aided by manmade [[Levee|embankments]]. As a result, the river flows on a raised ridge fifty meters above the plain. Waterlogging, floods, and course changes have recurred over the centuries. Traditionally, rulers were judged by their concern for or indifference to preservation of the embankments.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In the modern era, China has undertaken extensive flood control and conservation measures.\n\nFlowing from its source in the Qingzang highlands, the Yellow River courses toward the sea through the North China Plain, the historic center of Chinese expansion and influence. [[Han Chinese]] people have farmed the rich alluvial soils since ancient times, constructing the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] for north\u2013south transport during the [[History of China|Imperial Era]]. The plain is a continuation of the [[Dongbei]] (Manchurian) Plain to the northeast but is separated from it by the [[Bohai Gulf]], an extension of the Yellow Sea.\n\nLike other densely populated areas of China, the plain is subject to floods and earthquakes. The mining and industrial center of [[Tangshan]], {{convert|165|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Beijing, was leveled by an earthquake in July 1976, it was believed to be the largest earthquake of the 20th century by death toll.\n\nThe [[Hai River]], like the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]], flows from west to east. Its upper course consists of five rivers that converge near [[Tianjin]], then flow seventy kilometers before emptying into the [[Bohai Gulf]]. The [[Huai River]], rises in [[Henan]] Province and flows through several lakes before joining the Pearl River near [[Yangzhou]].\n\n; East and Yangtze\nThe [[Qin Mountains]], a continuation of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], divides the North China Plain from the [[Yangtze River Delta]] and is the major physiographic boundary between the two great parts of [[China Proper]]. It is a cultural boundary as it influences the distribution of customs and language. South of the Qinling mountain range divide are the densely populated and highly developed areas of the lower and middle plains of the [[Yangtze River]] and, on its upper reaches, the Sichuan Basin, an area encircled by a high barrier of mountain ranges.\n\nThe country's longest and most important waterway, the Yangtze River, is navigable for the majority of its length and has a vast [[hydroelectric]] potential. Rising on the Qingzang Plateau, the Yangtze River traverses {{convert|6300|km|mi|abbr=on}} through the heart of the country, draining an area of {{convert|1800000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} before emptying into the East China Sea. Roughly 300 million people live along its middle and lower reaches. The area is a large producer of rice and wheat. The Sichuan Basin, due to its mild, humid climate and long growing season, produces a variety of crops. It is a leading [[silk]]-producing area and an important industrial region with substantial [[mineral resources]].\n\nThe [[Nanling Mountains]], the southernmost of the east\u2013west mountain ranges, overlook areas in China with a [[tropical climate]]. The climate allows two crops of rice to be grown per year. Southeast of the mountains lies a coastal, hilly region of small deltas and narrow valley plains. The drainage area of the Pearl River and its associated network of rivers occupies much of the region to the south. West of the Nanling, the [[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]] rises in two steps, averaging 1,200 and 1,800 m in elevation, respectively, toward the precipitous mountain regions of the eastern Qingzang Plateau.\n\n=== Geology and natural resources ===\n{{main|Geology of China}}\n\nChina has substantial [[mineral reserve]]s and is the world's largest producer of [[antimony]], [[natural graphite]], [[tungsten]], and [[zinc]]. Other major minerals are [[aluminum]], [[bauxite]], [[coal]], [[crude petroleum]], [[diamonds]], [[gold]], [[iron ore]], [[lead]], [[magnetite]], [[manganese]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[molybdenum]], [[natural gas]], [[phosphate rock]], [[tin]], [[uranium]], and [[vanadium]]. China's [[hydropower]] potential is the largest in the world.\n\n===Land use===\n{{main|Land use in China}}\nBased on 2005 estimates, 14.86% (about {{convert|1400000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}) of China's total land area is [[arable land|arable]]. About 1.3% (some 116,580&nbsp;km\u00b2) is planted to permanent [[crops]] and the rest planted to temporary crops. With comparatively little land planted to permanent crops, intensive agricultural techniques are used to reap [[harvest]]s that are sufficient to feed the world's largest population and still have surplus for [[export]]. An estimated 544,784&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land were [[irrigated]] in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as [[pasture]], and 17.5% was [[forest]].\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{main|Wildlife of China}}\nChina lies in two of the world's major [[ecozone]]s, the [[Palearctic]] and the [[Indomalaya]]. In the Palearctic zone mammals such as the [[horse]], [[camel]], and [[jerboa]] are found. Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the [[leopard cat]], [[bamboo rat]], [[treeshrew]], and various other species of monkeys and apes. Some overlap exists between the two regions because of natural dispersal and migration, and deer or antelope, bears, wolves, pigs, and rodents are found in all of the diverse climatic and geological environments. The famous [[giant panda]] is found only in a limited area along the [[Yangtze]]. There is a continuing problem with trade in [[endangered species]], although there are now laws to prohibit such activities.\n\n==Human geography==\n\n=== History ===\n[[Image:China-Historic macro areas.svg|left|thumb|300px|The Central plain, visible in dark orange]]\nChinese history is often explained in terms of several strategic areas, defined by particular topographic limits. Starting from the [[Central Plain (China)|Chinese central plain]], the former heart of the Han populations, the Han people expanded militarily and then demographically toward the Loess Plateau, the Sichuan Basin, and the Southern Hills (as defined by the map on the left), not without resistance from local populations. Pushed by its comparatively higher demographic growth, the Han continued their expansion by military and demographic waves. The [[Lingnan|far-south]] of present-day China, the northern parts of today's Vietnam, and the [[Tarim Basin]] were first reached and durably subdued by the [[Han dynasty]]'s armies. The Northern steppes were always the source of invasions into China, which culminated in the 13th century by Mongolian conquest of the whole China and creation of Mongolian Yuan dynasty. [[Manchuria]], much of today's [[Northeast China]], and [[Korean Peninsula]] were usually not under Chinese control, with the exception of some limited periods of occupation. Manchuria became strongly integrated into the Chinese empire during the late [[Qing dynasty]], while the west side of the [[Changbai Mountains]], formerly the home of Korean tribes, thus also entered China.\n\n=== Demographic geography ===\n<!-- Demography: 10-15 sourced lines-->\n[[File:PRC Population Density.svg|thumb|right|300px|A population density map of the territories governed by the PRC.

The [[Heihe\u2013Tengchong Line]], running from [[Heihe]], [[Heilongjiang]] to [[Tengchong County]], [[Yunnan]] divides China into two roughly equal sections\u2013in terms of geographic area, with areas west of the line being sparsely settled and areas east densely populated, in general. Today there are 5 major religions that have been recognized by the state; Buddhism, Taoism, Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam. Buddhism and folk religions account for roughly 21% of the population while Protestants make up 5% and Islam 1.6% of the population.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/religion-china|title=The State of Religion in China|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2018-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014222036/https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/religion-china|archive-date=2018-10-14|url-status=live}}</ref> A substantial number of Buddhists live in the southwestern Tibetan region of the country which borders Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan and most notably India, the birthplace of Buddhism.

However, the way that the territory has been defined varies between ethnic groups. In relation to the Han Chinese, the homeland has been defined by national borders which are more or less accepted internationally. This is because the Han Chinese are the largest population and have most influence politically than any other ethnic population in China. To the Han Chinese population, the territory of the country is defined by the regions of Tibet, inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and the Xinjiang Province which is the most western land of China. The Chinese territory is the second largest in land area and also has the longest combined land border in the world. However, there are many other ethnic groups in China that have their own definitions of what concerns the territory of China.\n\nOne group of people in China are the Tibetans. Tibetans and the land of Tibet are considered by the Han Chinese government to be part of China and that the territory of Tibet is also part of the country. However, a few of Tibetans disagree and are protesting as well as rallying for freedom in present day. To this ethnic population, the territory of Tibet is not considered part of China and so is not defined as a Chinese territory. However, the Chinese government still consider Tibet as a territory of China which reflects the dispute in definition of Chinese territory between two ethnic groups.\n\nAnother group of people which have a dispute in definition of territory are the Taiwanese. The Taiwanese people inhabit the island of Taiwan and are markedly politically different as the people of Taiwan have a free market capitalist based economy while the mainland Chinese government employ a communistic state run economy. There are disputes in the definition of territory between Taiwan and China as the Chinese government claims ownership over Taiwan while some Taiwanese people maintain that they are a sovereign state completely independent from the mainland Chinese government. These disputes have led to international controversy as many countries such as the United States of America have not officially recognized the sovereignty of Taiwan.<ref name=\"Chung\">{{Cite book|last=Chung|first=Jae Ho|date=2017-09-21|title= Centrifugal Empire|volume= |doi=10.7312/columbia/9780231176200.003.0002|chapter=China Goes Local (Again)|isbn=9780231176200}}</ref>\n\n====Central Asia====\nChina's borders have more than {{convert|20000|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of land frontier shared with nearly all the nations of mainland [[East Asia]], and have been disputed at a number of points. In the western sector, China claimed portions of the {{convert|41000|km\u00b2|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} [[Pamir Mountains]] area, a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier-filled valleys where the borders of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], the former [[Soviet Union]], and China meet in [[Central Asia]]. North and east of this region, some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987. The {{convert|6542|km|0}} frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction. In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own. In the northeast, border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Heilongjiang]] along segments of the [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun River]], [[Amur River]], and [[Ussuri River]]. Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area. In a September 1986 speech in [[Vladivostok]], the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] offered the Chinese a more conciliatory position on Sino-Soviet border issues. In 1987 the two sides resumed border talks that had been broken off after the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] (see [[Sino-Soviet relations]]). Although the border issue remained unresolved as of late 1987, China and the Soviet Union agreed to consider the northeastern sector first. In October 2004, China signed an agreement with [[Russia]] on the [[delimitation]] of their entire {{convert|4300|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}-long border, which had long been in dispute.\n\n====Southern border====\nEastward from [[Bhutan]] and north of the [[Brahmaputra River]] (Yarlung Zangbo Jiang) lies a large area controlled and administered by India but claimed by the Chinese ([[South Tibet]]). The area was demarcated by the British [[McMahon Line]], drawn along the Himalayas in 1914 as the Sino-Indian border; India accepts and China rejects this boundary. In June 1980 China made its first move in twenty years to settle the border disputes with India, proposing that India cede the Aksai Chin area in Jammu and Kashmir to China in return for China's recognition of the McMahon Line; India did not accept the offer, however, preferring a sector-by-sector approach to the problem. In July 1986 China and India held their seventh round of border talks, but they made little headway toward resolving the dispute. Each side, but primarily India, continued to make allegations of incursions into its territory by the other. Most of the mountainous and militarized boundary with India is still in dispute, but Beijing and [[New Delhi]] have committed to begin resolution with discussions on the least disputed middle sector. India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding lands to China in a 1964 boundary agreement.\n\nThe China-Burma border issue was settled October 1, 1960, by the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The first joint inspection of the border was completed successfully in June 1986.\n\nIndia: On May 15, 2015, Mr. Li from China and Mr. Modi from India held talks at the Great Hall of the people during Modi's China tour. The two leaders held talks on border disputes that began in 1914 when the British still controlled India and signed an agreement with Tibet to make the McMahon line the de facto boundary between India and China, even though China had rejected this agreement. Both countries had various claims to disputed territories such as the South Tibetan region of Zangnan which is considered to be part of the Arunachal Pradesh state in India. So far there have been only talks and no solutions and tensions continue to rise as each country continues to increase regional influences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-32747667|title=India and China 'to resolve dispute'|date=2015-05-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126224523/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-32747667|archive-date=2018-11-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Seas====\n\nChina is involved in a complex dispute with [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], and possibly [[Brunei]] over the [[Spratly (Nansha) Islands]] in the South China Sea. The 2002 \"Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea\" eased tensions but fell short of a [[legally binding]] [[code of conduct]] desired by several of the disputants. China also controls the [[Paracel (Xisha) Islands]], which are also claimed by Vietnam, and asserts a claim to the [[Japan]]ese-administered [[Senkaku Islands|Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands]] in the East China Sea.\n\nSouth China Sea: On June 16, 2011, the Chinese government sent out one of its largest patrol ships known as the Haixun-31 which the Chinese government describe as routine. The ship will pass the Paracel and Spratly Islands and make its way up from the Malaysian to Filipino coast. Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia all have competing claims to the Spratlys Islands while Beijing and Hanoi are in dispute over the Paracel islands. Hanoi has proposed a multilateral solution between the Asian countries but China says that it prefers to negotiate with individual states separately.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13796958|title=China sends ship to disputed sea|date=2011-06-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126224542/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13796958|archive-date=2018-11-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Border security ====\nThe security and strength of the Chinese borders vary depending on the location of the section of the border in question. This is due to the nature of the borders as well as the physical geography of the country. China has a large territory, about the same size as the United States, but the actual distribution of population is highly disproportionate. Sixty percent of the population live on the east coast of China which is only 22 percent of its territory while the other 78 percent lying inland is sparsely populated with ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other Chinese Muslim groups. Many of these groups have little to no loyalty to the central government of China further adding to the strained security of China's borders. The regions of Xinjiang and Tibet in particular harbor strong separatist movements<ref name=\"Chung\"/>\n\nTibet: Many Tibetans protest and actively support the Dalai Lama who lives in exile in what he calls \"autonomous Tibet\". The Chinese authorities charge him of promoting Tibetan independence and will not allow him to come back into the country or he will face arrest. In May 2018, a Tibetan activist known as Tashi Wangchuk was sentenced to prison for five years as he voiced his concerns over that Tibetan culture was being destroyed by the Chinese government. Amnesty International denounced this sentencing to be \"beyond absurd\" but his release is still dated to be in 2021.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-44207981|title=Tibet activist jailed after NYT video|date=2018-05-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126224548/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-44207981|archive-date=2018-11-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nXinjiang: In the region of Xinjiang, Uighur separatists have engaged in acts of violence to promote independence. These Chinese Muslims have garnered support from neighboring areas in central Asia and Turkey both politically and economically. However, many of these efforts have been shut down by Chinese officials. The Xinjiang region is facing large scale immigration of Han Chinese people but the Uighurs still make up 8 out of the 19 million inhabitants. In August 2018, a UN human rights panel cited \"creditable reports\" that more than one million people in the region were being held in counter extremism centers in Xinjiang but Chinese officials claimed that only \"religious extremist\" Uighurs were undergoing re-education and resettlement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-16860974|title=Xinjiang profile|date=2018-10-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701074149/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-16860974|archive-date=2018-07-01|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nChina-Russia Relations: China and the Soviet Union signed an alliance in 1950 building on their communist relations that dated back to the 1920s. In the wake of the 1960s Sino-Soviet split, and for 25 years after the split, the border between China and Russia was one of the most unfriendly borders in the world. At one point over \"one and a half million troops armed with nuclear weapons\" were installed along the two sides of the border. Relations improved in the mid 1980s but this is due to Russia's decrease in power and threat to the Chinese government.<ref name=\"Chung\"/>\n\nDue to China's ancient history and central location in the geography of Asia, it is surrounded by potential enemies and many complicated rivalries. The government plays the fine line between domination and cooperation in order to preserve their national identity and borders. However, due to the nature of their political geography, the borders are very much volatile and disputes continue to exist in different areas of the border.\n\nTajikistan: On January 13, 2011, the country of Tajikistan agrees to cede land to the Chinese government. The Tajik parliament voted to ratify a 1999 deal to cede 1000 square kilometers of land in the remote Pamir Mountain range which the Chinese claim thoroughly resolved the century long border dispute. China is the largest investor in the Tajik economy especially in the energy and infrastructure sectors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12180567|title=Tajikistan cedes land to China|date=2011|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206010018/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12180567|archive-date=2018-12-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Government Structure ==\nThe structure of government in China is in the framework of a socialist republic which is run by a single party: the [[Communist Party of China]]. The party wishes to control and manage the ideology of their subjects to maintain their political dominance in China. For example, [[Document Number Nine]], or the [[Communiqu\u00e9]] on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere, was a document circulated in China in 2013 to warn the citizens of China against some western values such as media freedom. [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] is [[Leader of the Communist Party of China|leader]] of the Chinese Communist Party.

Under the Chinese constitution, the National Peoples congress holds the most power and meets annually for two weeks to discuss and review legislative policies.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Studi Literasi Menggunakan Endnote Dan Aplikasi Pembantu (Google Translator, Google Cendikia, Google Sites, Chemoffice 2008, e-learning, dan Snipping Tool)|last=Zainul|first=Rahadian|date=2018-08-16|doi=10.31227/osf.io/5ncpe|url=http://osf.io/5ncpe/|journal=|access-date=2018-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209165448/https://osf.io/5ncpe/|archive-date=2018-12-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs China has only one dominant party, the spatial patterns of voting and election results are favoring the dominant communist party. However, the country still has some other variables and variations in the divisions of administration. Local government is divided into four levels of hierarchy. Local government includes township, county, prefecture or municipality, and the province as the scope of government increases. China also has a system of autonomous regions intended to give more control to ethnic minorities who preside in those regions. In practice however, the power still remains with the party secretary while the local chairman is the nominal head.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631657348|doi=10.3726/978-3-653-05128-5/13|title = Local Government Institutionalization in Hungary|year = 2015|chapter = Chapter 4: Local Party Government}}</ref>\n\n== Imperialism ==\n\n=== Japan ===\nHistorically there have been instances of imperialism in China. Japan had invaded and conquered much of Manchuria and Coastal cities in China in the Sino-Japanese war. Cities such as Nanjing and Hong Kong were devastated by Japanese forces with actions such as massacre and rape of civilians was rampant. This imperialism and invasion of Japanese forces still leads to tensions in modern day. For example, in April 2005, a Japanese junior high textbook minimized the atrocities of Nanjing stating that the massacre was an \"incident\". The textbooks transgression sent thousands of Chinese citizens out to protest and three weeks of state sanctioned protest led to rising tensions between Japan and China.<ref>{{Citation|last=MISSING-VALUE|first=MISSING-VALUE|pages=9\u201336|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315568379|doi=10.4324/9781315568379-2|title=Australia\u2014China Relations post 1949|year=2016|chapter=The pre-recognition period (1949\u20131972)}}</ref>\n\n=== Hong Kong and Britain ===\nDue to the opium wars between the British from 1839 to 1842, the British were able to make demands to the Chinese government before removing blockades and stopping bombardment on key ports. The Chinese agreed to cede the island of Hong Kong which in the control of the British, witnessed phenomenal growth. The population grew from 1,500 to 19,000 by 1844. In 1860 in the wake of the Second Opium war, the Peking convention was signed which ceded to Britain the Kowloon peninsula (up to Boundary Street) and Ngon Sun Chau, which was a part of mainland China. With the end of World War 2 however, the British lost control of the colonies and in 1997, the colony of Hong Kong was returned to the control of communist mainland China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/hongkong.htm|title=Hong Kong Colony|website=www.britishempire.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104101624/https://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/hongkong.htm|archive-date=2019-01-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Trade Agreements ==\nChina has bilateral investment agreements with 100 plus countries and economies. China's bilateral investment agreements cover expropriation, arbitration, and other investment related issues. These bilateral agreements are generally much weaker than investment treaties that the United States would want to negotiate. China also maintains fourteen free trade agreements(FTA's) and is currently implementing an additional eight FTA's. China's FTA partners are ASEAN, Singapore, Pakistan, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Costa Rica, Iceland, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Australia, and Korea. These trade agreements exist to maintain and organize business and trade with various countries in order to improve and expand the economy of China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.export.gov/article|title=export.gov|website=www.export.gov|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127064722/https://www.export.gov/article|archive-date=2018-11-27|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Population ==\nChina in 2017, was reported to have a population of 1,379,302,711.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|title=East Asia/Southeast Asia :: China \u2014 The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2018-11-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|archive-date=2016-10-13|url-status=live}}</ref> In October 2015, China changed the long-standing 1979 law that allowed each couple to have \"one child\". So that there would be enough youth to support the old, the government began to allow couples to have 2 children.

[[Monsoon]] winds, caused by differences in the heat-absorbing capacity of the continent and the ocean, dominate the climate. During the summer, the [[East Asian Monsoon]] carries warm and moist air from the south and delivers the vast majority of the annual precipitation in much of the country. Conversely, the [[Siberian anticyclone]] dominates during winter, bringing cold and comparatively dry conditions. The advance and retreat of the monsoons account in large degree for the timing of the rainy season throughout the country. Although most of the country lies in the temperate belt, its climatic patterns are complex.\n\nThe northern extremities of both [[Heilongjiang]] and [[Inner Mongolia]] have a subarctic climate; in contrast, most of [[Hainan Island]] and parts of the extreme southern fringes of [[Yunnan]] have a tropical climate. Temperature differences in winter are considerable, but in summer the variance is considerably less. For example, [[Mohe County]], Heilongjiang has a 24-hour average temperature in January approaching {{convert|\u221230|\u00b0C}}, while the corresponding figure in July exceeds {{convert|18|\u00b0C|0}}. By contrast, most of Hainan has a January mean in excess of {{convert|17|\u00b0C|0}}, while the July mean there is generally above {{convert|28|\u00b0C}}.\n\n[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is almost invariably concentrated in the warmer months, though annual totals range from less than {{convert|20|mm|1}} in northwestern [[Qinghai]] and the [[Turpan Depression]] of Xinjiang to easily exceeding {{convert|2000|mm|0}} in [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], and Hainan. Only in some pockets of the [[Dzungaria]] region of Xinjiang is the conspicuous seasonal variation in precipitation that defines Chinese (and, to a large extent, East Asian) climate absent.\n\nAnnual sunshine duration ranges from less than 1,100 hours in parts of [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]] to over 3,400 hours in northwestern Qinghai. Seasonal patterns in sunshine vary considerably by region, but overall, [[Northern and southern China|the north]] and the Tibetan Plateau are sunnier than the south of the country.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:China_average_annual_precipitation_(en).png|The average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in [[Mainland China]] \nFile:Snow in China.jpg|Early-season [[snow]] covering part of the North China Plain near [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]\nFile:Heavy Snow in Eastern China.jpg|Snow encircling the area around the [[Bohai Sea|Bo Hai]]\nFile:Spring Sandstorm Scours China.jpg|The first day of spring 2010 brought a massive sandstorm blowing from [[Inner Mongolia]]\nFile:2010 Sandstorm over Eastern China.jpg|On November 11, 2010, a wall of sand blew across northern China, covering much of the North China Plain and [[Shandong Peninsula]].\nFile:Haze over China.jpg|[[Haze]] over the [[North China Plain]] and the [[L\u00fcliang Mountains]] of [[Shanxi]]\nFile:2010 Smog over China.jpg|Natural color satellite image of a [[smog]] event in the heart of northern China\nFile:Feb 2011 Haze over China.jpg|Dense smog settled over the North China Plain on February 20, 2011.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Environment ===\n{{main|Environment of China}}\n[[Air pollution]] ([[sulfur dioxide]] particulates) from reliance on [[coal]] is a major issue, along with [[water pollution]] from untreated wastes and use of debated standards of pollutant concentration rather than [[Total Maximum Daily Load]]. There are water shortages, particularly in the north. The eastern part of China often experiences smoke and dense fog in the atmosphere as a result of industrial pollution. Heavy [[deforestation]] with an estimated loss of one-fifth of agricultural land since 1949 to [[soil erosion]] and economic development is occurring with resulting [[desertification]]. \nChina is a party to the [[Antarctic-Environmental Protocol]], the [[Antarctic Treaty]], the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Global warming|Climate Change]] treaty, the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]], the [[Endangered Species]] treaty, the Hazardous Wastes treaty, the [[Admiralty law|Law of the Sea]], the International Tropical Timber Agreements of [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]] and [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], and agreements on Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, [[MARPOL 73/78|Ship Pollution]], and Wetlands protection. China has signed, but not ratified, the [[Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] (but is not yet required to reduce its carbon emission under the agreement, as is India) and the [[Nuclear Test Ban]] treaty.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Geography}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Chinese geography]]\n* [[History of human geography in China]]\n* [[Environment of China]]\n* [[List of islands of China]]\n* [[List of peninsulas of China]]\n* [[List of rivers in China]]\n* [[List of mountains in China]]\n* [[Lakes in China]]\n* [[North China Plain]]\n* [[Geography of Hong Kong]]\n* [[Geography of Macau]]\n* [[Geographic information systems in China]]\n* [[Zomia (geography)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Fitzpatrick, John. 1992. \u201cThe Middle Kingdom, the Middle Sea, and the Geographical Pivot of History\u201d.

The primary goal of '''collections maintenance''' is to prevent further decay of cultural heritage by ensuring proper storage and upkeep including performing regular housekeeping of the spaces and objects and monitoring and controlling storage environments. Collections maintenance is closely linked to [[collections care]] and [[collections management (museum)|collections management]]. The professionals most influenced by collections maintenance include [[collection manager]]s, [[registrar (museum)|registrars]], and [[archivist]]s.\n\n==Environmental Control==\nThere are four main environmental agents of deterioration which should be monitored on a regular basis as part of maintenance. These are temperature, relative humidity, light and dust. It is important to recognize the type of damage each agent may present as well as ways to mitigate any harm.\n\n===Temperature===\nTemperature as an agent of deterioration acts primarily in conjunction with relative humidity but can trigger damage in its own right.

The possible amount of moisture held at a given time is directly related to temperature; warm air holds more humidity than cold. Collecting institutions aim to keep the RH constant in exhibitions and storage areas because many organic objects expand and contract as both temperature and RH change.<ref name=\"Basics ch3\">{{cite book|last =Ambrose|first =Timothy|last2 =Paine|first2 =Crispin |title =Museum Basics|place =London|publisher =Routledge|year =2006|edition =2|chapter =3: The Development and Care of the Museum\u2019s Collections}}</ref> Furniture will swell and stick with high moisture, but may crack or shrink if there is too little. \u201cRapidly fluctuating temperature and relative humidity compound all of these effects.\u201d <ref name=\"Concerns pg15\">{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Control of Temperature and Humidity in Small Collections|page =15}}</ref> High humidity may accelerate mold growth and some chemical changes, like metal corrosion, if not properly maintained.<ref name=\"Housekeeping chp10\">{{cite book|last =Staniforth|first =Sarah|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =10: Relative Humidity as an Agent of Deterioration}}</ref>\n\nSome changes undergone by objects are reversible by adjusting the RH, but damage like cracks are more permanent. Keeping the RH within a reasonable span for the type of object and as consistent as possible will prevent most RH based damage. It is important to measure the RH of spaces regularly by using a number of tools including humidity strips, [[thermo-hygrograph]]s, [[hygrometer]]s, psychrometer and [[data logger]]s. Once the per cent humidity identified, there are a number of ways to adjust it by using humidifiers, dehumidifiers, improve heating and air conditioning systems and adjust the temperature of the space.\n\n===Light===\nLight, as it relates to collections maintenance, consists of visual and [[ultraviolet]] light (UV). Both types of light can cause damage as \u201clight radiation falling on a surface provides energy to induce chemical changes in the molecules of the material.\u201d <ref>{{cite book|last =Bullock|first =Linda|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =9: Light as an Agent of Deterioration|page =93}}</ref> Damage from light, including loss of color and strength, is cumulative and irreversible. It is therefore crucial that light levels are monitored.\n\nPreventing light damage is difficult because it is necessary for visitors as well as people who are working with the objects. Exposure, however, can be diminished by ensuring lights are only on when people are present, either by vigilant staff members turning on and off lights, timer switches or with motion sensors.  Natural light from windows should be reduced or eliminated in all spaces by covering them with curtains, shades or UV absorbing filters.<ref name=\"Concerns\">{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}</ref>  Where lights frequently on, like in galleries and office areas, a [[light meter]] should be used to determine how much exposure the collections are getting at least once a year and adjustments should be made accordingly.<ref name=\"NPS,Chp4\">{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 4: Museum Collections Environment|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Dust and Dirt===\nDust can contain a number of materials including skin, mold and inorganic fragments like silica or sulfur.

Inorganic dust particles may have tough sharp edges which can cause a number of types of damage from tearing fibers to [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrading]] softer surfaces if not properly removed. Wiping a clean cloth over a surface dusty with these inorganic particles may result in irreversible abrasions.\n\nThe best way to prevent damage from dust is to control and prevent substantial buildup of dust in the first place. This can be done by using air filters in the heating and air conditioning systems as well as using vacuum cleaners equipped with [[HEPA]] filters when possible. Limiting the amount of exposed surface areas of collections can also prevent dust from settling on objects. This can be done by storing objects in acid-free boxes, object specific enclosures, in drawers or covering open shelves with a [[polyethylene]] sheet.<ref name=\"Concerns\">{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}</ref><ref name=\"Winterthur chp1\"/>\n\n==Storage and Upkeep==\nMaintaining a clean and orderly spaces ensures not only ease of accessibility but also the safety of the collections and those who work with them.\n\n===Organization===\n[[File:Archival collection.JPG|thumbnail|Example of two \"layers;\" the boxes and the shelves they rest upon]]\nIt is essential that collections have an organizational system to store and house objects.

Each new layer should provide further protection by creating a microclimate buffer between an object and environmental fluctuations, light, dust and pollutants.\n\n===Housekeeping===\nKeeping spaces clean and clear of debris is crucial to the preservation of object in several ways. Primarily it ensures that objects don't become over exposed to detrimental agents like dust, but it also ensures that the areas are safe for people and objects to move within, unobstructed by potential hazards. Tasks that fall under this purview include routine inspection and dusting of work areas and objects, and general cleaning of work areas.

Storage areas probably need less frequent attention, but should still have the floors cleaned and exposed surfaces of storage furniture like shelves wiped down. Objects themselves may sometimes need dusting if they are not boxed or wrapped up. Prior to dusting an object, the condition and stability needs to be considered, and a conservator should be consulted before any attempt is made. Research should also be done into how best to clean a particular type of medium or object.<ref name=\"Housekeeping chp12\">{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141008134733/http://unfacilitated.preservation101.org/session5/expl_maint.asp Collection Maintenance]\n* [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.2-monitoring-temperature-and-relative-humidity/ NDCC Monitoring Temperature and Relative Humidity]\n* [http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/ National Park Service Museum Handbook]\n* [http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/cons_toc.html/ National Park Service Conserve O Grams]\n* [http://resource.aaslh.org/view/community-webinar-live-question-and-answer-session-on-housekeeping-for-historic-sites/ Connecting to Collections Housekeeping Webinar]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140327062815/http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/manual-0102.pdf Minnesota Historical Society Housekeeping Handbook]\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Category:Collections care]]\n[[Category:Museology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Visual storage at V&A - 1 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|250px|Visual storage at the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]]]\nCollection maintenance is a form of [[collections care]] that consists of the day-to-day hands on care of collections and cultural heritage.

The system may be grounded in relations to size, material, cultural or historical grouping as it makes sense to the collection.<ref name=\"Concerns\">{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}</ref><ref name=\"NPS,Chp7\">{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 7: Museum Collections Storage|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP7.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}</ref> Structured organizational systems make identifying object locations straightforward and consistent which will help locating and returning an object to its proper space.\n\nPart of a system is the use of \u201csuccessive layers of protective envelopes and enclosures.\u201d <ref name=\"NPS,Chp7\">{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 7: Museum Collections Storage|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP7.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}</ref> Types of \u201clayers\u201d include nearly everything from storage spaces, padded shelves, non-acidic archival boxes and individual packaging. Each new layer should provide further protection by creating a microclimate buffer between an object and environmental fluctuations, light, dust and pollutants.\n\n===Housekeeping===\nKeeping spaces clean and clear of debris is crucial to the preservation of object in several ways. Primarily it ensures that objects don't become over exposed to detrimental agents like dust, but it also ensures that the areas are safe for people and objects to move within, unobstructed by potential hazards. Tasks that fall under this purview include routine inspection and dusting of work areas and objects, and general cleaning of work areas. Spaces and objects should be monitored and inspected regularly to ensure that any problem is caught and resolved quickly or note any condition change.<ref name=\"Housekeeping chp12\">{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}</ref>\n\nThe regularity of dusting and cleaning will differ institution to institution, and will depend upon factors like foot-traffic, how well the space is sealed off from the outside, and how long it takes for dust to build up. As a general rule, work areas should be cleaned frequently, storage areas and furniture less so, and objects dusted occasionally and only after consulting a conservator.<ref name=\"NPS,Chp13\">{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 13: Museum Housekeeping|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP13.pdf |accessdate= April 29, 2014}}</ref>  Inside work areas, floors should be swept or vacuumed and work surfaces should be cleared off and dusted. Storage areas probably need less frequent attention, but should still have the floors cleaned and exposed surfaces of storage furniture like shelves wiped down. Objects themselves may sometimes need dusting if they are not boxed or wrapped up. Prior to dusting an object, the condition and stability needs to be considered, and a conservator should be consulted before any attempt is made. Research should also be done into how best to clean a particular type of medium or object.<ref name=\"Housekeeping chp12\">{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141008134733/http://unfacilitated.preservation101.org/session5/expl_maint.asp Collection Maintenance]\n* [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.2-monitoring-temperature-and-relative-humidity/ NDCC Monitoring Temperature and Relative Humidity]\n* [http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/ National Park Service Museum Handbook]\n* [http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/cons_toc.html/ National Park Service Conserve O Grams]\n* [http://resource.aaslh.org/view/community-webinar-live-question-and-answer-session-on-housekeeping-for-historic-sites/ Connecting to Collections Housekeeping Webinar]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140327062815/http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/manual-0102.pdf Minnesota Historical Society Housekeeping Handbook]\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Category:Collections care]]\n[[Category:Museology]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collections_maintenance"}
