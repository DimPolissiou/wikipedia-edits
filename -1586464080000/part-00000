His ideas continue to influence [[family values]], education and [[management]] in China and East Asia. In his ''[[Great Learning]]'' Confucius wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.<ref>\nConfucius, ''Great Learning'', translated by James Legge.

See especially chapter 3 on Finalism and Fiction and chapter 7 on the Style of Life.\n</ref>\nHe also originated the concepts of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] (1929\u2014he defined \"lifestyle\" as an individual's characteristic approach to life, in facing problems) and of [[self image]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} a concept that influenced management under the heading of [[work-life balance]].{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}\n\nCarl Gustav Jung made contributions to personal development with his concept of [[individuation]],  which he saw as the drive of the individual to achieve the wholeness and balance of the [[self (psychology)|Self]].<ref>\nJung saw individuation as a process of [[psychological differentiation]], having for its goal the development of the individual personality.

Levinson proposed that personal development comes under the influence\u2014throughout [[personal life|life]]\u2014of aspirations, which he called \"the Dream\":\n\n<blockquote>\nWhatever the nature of his Dream, a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out.  It makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is consonant with and infused by the Dream, or opposed to it.  If the Dream remains unconnected to his life it may simply die, and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose.<ref>\nDaniel Levinson, Seasons of a Man's Life, Ballantine Press, 1978, page 91-92\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nResearch on success in reaching goals, as undertaken by [[Albert Bandura]] (born 1925), suggested that [[self-efficacy]]<ref>Albert Bandura (1997).
