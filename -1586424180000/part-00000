This design feature is necessary to accommodate the unique ammunition feed mechanism. The AN-94 is chambered in the same [[5.45\u00d739mm|5.45\u00d739mm M74]] [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] as the [[AK-74]], and it utilizes a [[rotating bolt]] to lock the action. Gennadiy Nikonov and his engineers used the Russian term ''\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0441 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430'' (''smeschyonnyy impuls svobodnogo zatvora'') to describe the rifle's method of operation, meaning \"recoil shifted pulse.\"\n\nWhen a round is fired, residual energy from the propellant charge in the cartridge acts upon the safely locked breech and bolt carrier. Simultaneously, a quantity of powder gases driving the bullet through the barrel is tapped and acts upon the piston in the gas tube located above and parallel to the barrel. The movement of the piston and its connecting rod acts upon the locking bolt, causing it to rotate and allow the breech to safely open. This initiates the extraction and ejection cycle for the first spent cartridge. After the first round has been fired, the bolt and carrier group move toward the rear, ejecting the first casing towards the front of the ejection window. The movement of the Carrier is directly connected to a pulley system which is connected to a small metal rod on the rear side of the magazine well. The rod pushes a second round into the firing position. Once this action has completed the bolt and carrier group will stop and move back towards the front of the gun before it has hit the rear of the receiver. When the bolt has fully locked it will fire the second round. This whole process happens very quickly and it is how the 2 round burst works. For any follow-up rounds, the pulley is disengaged to prevent the gun from firing at the extremely high rate continuously. This means that after every bullet the bolt and carrier group will travel the whole distance of possible travel, resulting in a more manageable rate of 600 RPM.<ref name=\"armamentresearch.com\"/>\n\nThe AN-94 is similar to the [[Heckler & Koch G11]] in that the barrel, gas tube, receiver, and bolt carrier all exist as a single component group moving back and forth along an axis parallel to the bore, suspended within what the Russian manufacturers call an ''Effect-Envelope''\u2014the external composite fibre/polymer stock. This configuration separates the events inside the rifle from what the person operating the weapon actually experiences (i.e. low recoil). Note that the tube below the barrel is not the gas tube but a spring housing that returns the barrel and receiver forward into battery.\n\nThe motion described is also employed by design to drive the unique lifter mechanism that performs the separate ammunition pre-feeding cycle that is key to the extremely rapid two-round burst function that defines the AN-94 system. This offers the operator the unique tactical advantage of trigger-controlled fire selection.\n\nThe rear [[peep sight]] is a noted improvement over the standard Kalashnikov notch and post. The [[muzzle brake]] is intended to significantly reduce weapon report and muzzle flash as well as delay the recoil of the rifle to aid in its 2 shot burst capabilities. The AN-94 design is stated to be vastly more accurate than the AK-74M. And unlike the AK-74M, it can mount a [[GP-25]] family [[grenade launcher]] and [[bayonet]] simultaneously.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.
