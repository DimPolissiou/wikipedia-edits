Borchetta's father, Mike Borchetta, worked in Nashville as a country promoter who courted radio stations with music he transported in the trunk of his car. Mike Borchetta was married to an aspiring country singer at the time, as he had divorced Scott's mother. Borchetta did not leave Nashville after a 1981 visit.<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite web|author1=Devin Leonard|title=Taylor Swift Is the Music Industry|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-11-12/taylor-swift-and-big-machine-are-the-music-industry|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|accessdate=January 10, 2015|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBorchetta worked in the mailroom of his father's music company and eventually became a promotions staff member in 1991 for [[Universal Music Group]]'s [[MCA Records]]. According to ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', Borchetta was an \"involved manager\" at MCA, \"choosing singles and dispensing advice.\" After he was fired from MCA in 1997, Borchetta accepted a role at the Nashville division of [[DreamWorks Records]], but later decided to start his own label after Universal acquired the division.<ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nBefore he left DreamWorks, Borchetta approached [[Taylor Swift]] and her family after the musician performed at the [[Bluebird Caf\u00e9]] in Nashville, Tennessee after first meeting her in 2004. At the time, Borchetta had no infrastructure or financing. He made an offer to Swift and her parents, whereby he would recruit her to the new label's roster after it was established. Swift eventually recontacted Borchetta around two weeks later, telling him: \"I'm waiting for you.\"<ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAfter he formed the label in 2005, Big Machine released Swift's first ever recording, the single \"[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]\" and her debut album ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]''. Keith dropped his affiliation with the label in 2006, but he was reported as an equity holder in November 2014, alongside the Swift family and Borchetta (the latter reportedly owned 60 percent of the business at the time). In October 2012, Borchetta told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: \"[Taylor Swift\u2019s father] Scott Swift owns three percent of Big Machine.\"<ref name=\"Stark\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" /><ref>{{cite web|author1=Brian Hiatt|title=Taylor Swift in Wonderland|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-in-wonderland-20121025|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 10, 2015|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBy March 2009, Big Machine artist [[Danielle Peck]] had left the label.

The terms of the deal state that Zac Brown Band will work with Big Machine Label Group for marketing and distribution, while Southern Ground Artists will work on radio promotion, Republic will provide support in the area of non-country radio formats and international promotion, and Varvatos will oversee branding and styling. Borchetta was quoted in the Big Machine press release as saying that there is \"literally no ceiling\" to what can be achieved by the new partnership, and also spoke of \"moments when our best artists hit a global stride and a deeper sense of engagement that speaks a clearer musical language\".<ref name=\"Zac\">{{cite web|author1=Nate Rau|title=Zac Brown Band aligns with Big Machine|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/music/2015/01/12/zac-brown-band-aligns-big-machine/21649505/|website=The Tennessean|publisher=The Tennessean|accessdate=January 17, 2015|date=January 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn a February 2015 interview, Borchetta refused to comment on the status of the label's distribution deal with [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG), which was up for renegotiation at the time. He confirmed that the label would release the next ''American Idol'' album, in partnership with 19 Entertainment and UMG\u2014Borchetta would be one of the mentors on the reality program's next series. Borchetta also disclosed that Swift agreed to the withdrawal of her catalog from Spotify after he first suggested the idea to her, and that he would remove the music of all Big Machine artists if it was within his power.<ref name=\"New\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the label branched out into the [[alcoholic beverage]] industry by launching Big Machine Vodka, a premium brand distilled in [[Lynnville, Tennessee]].

[[Country music|country]] and [[Pop music|pop]] artists. Big Machine is based on Music Row in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The label was founded in September 2005<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Caulfiend|first1=Keith|last2=Tucker|first2=Ken|title=Valory Unveiled|journal=Billboard|date=November 10, 2007|volume=119|issue=45|page=8}}</ref> by former [[DreamWorks Records]] executive [[Scott Borchetta]] and became a joint venture between Borchetta and country singer [[Toby Keith]].<ref name=\"Stark\">{{cite journal|last=Stark|first=Phyllis|date=March 11, 2006|title=The Honeymoon's Hardly Over, but Show Dog and Big Machine split|journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12}}</ref> The company concentrates on publishing, management, and merchandising and oversees imprints, such as Valory Music, that are part of the [[Big Machine Records#Imprints|Big Machine Label Group]].\n\n==History==\n[[Scott Borchetta]] is originally from Los Angeles, California's [[San Fernando Valley]] area (\"The Valley\"), and he played bass guitar in [[punk rock]] bands in his younger years. Borchetta's father, Mike Borchetta, worked in Nashville as a country promoter who courted radio stations with music he transported in the trunk of his car. Mike Borchetta was married to an aspiring country singer at the time, as he had divorced Scott's mother. Borchetta did not leave Nashville after a 1981 visit.<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite web|author1=Devin Leonard|title=Taylor Swift Is the Music Industry|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-11-12/taylor-swift-and-big-machine-are-the-music-industry|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|accessdate=January 10, 2015|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBorchetta worked in the mailroom of his father's music company and eventually became a promotions staff member in 1991 for [[Universal Music Group]]'s [[MCA Records]]. According to ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', Borchetta was an \"involved manager\" at MCA, \"choosing singles and dispensing advice.\" After he was fired from MCA in 1997, Borchetta accepted a role at the Nashville division of [[DreamWorks Records]], but later decided to start his own label after Universal acquired the division.<ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nBefore he left DreamWorks, Borchetta approached [[Taylor Swift]] and her family after the musician performed at the [[Bluebird Caf\u00e9]] in Nashville, Tennessee after first meeting her in 2004. At the time, Borchetta had no infrastructure or financing. He made an offer to Swift and her parents, whereby he would recruit her to the new label's roster after it was established. Swift eventually recontacted Borchetta around two weeks later, telling him: \"I'm waiting for you.\"<ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAfter he formed the label in 2005, Big Machine released Swift's first ever recording, the single \"[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]\" and her debut album ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]''. Keith dropped his affiliation with the label in 2006, but he was reported as an equity holder in November 2014, alongside the Swift family and Borchetta (the latter reportedly owned 60 percent of the business at the time). In October 2012, Borchetta told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: \"[Taylor Swift\u2019s father] Scott Swift owns three percent of Big Machine.\"<ref name=\"Stark\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" /><ref>{{cite web|author1=Brian Hiatt|title=Taylor Swift in Wonderland|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-in-wonderland-20121025|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 10, 2015|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBy March 2009, Big Machine artist [[Danielle Peck]] had left the label.

Three years after the deal was signed, Borchetta said that the revenue streams were \"very meaningful.\"<ref name=\"New\" />\n\nOn November 3, 2014, Swift removed all but one of her songs from Spotify after indications of her disapproval of the streaming service emerged in July of the same year.

The terms of the deal state that Zac Brown Band will work with Big Machine Label Group for marketing and distribution, while Southern Ground Artists will work on radio promotion, Republic will provide support in the area of non-country radio formats and international promotion, and Varvatos will oversee branding and styling. Borchetta was quoted in the Big Machine press release as saying that there is \"literally no ceiling\" to what can be achieved by the new partnership, and also spoke of \"moments when our best artists hit a global stride and a deeper sense of engagement that speaks a clearer musical language\".<ref name=\"Zac\">{{cite web|author1=Nate Rau|title=Zac Brown Band aligns with Big Machine|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/music/2015/01/12/zac-brown-band-aligns-big-machine/21649505/|website=The Tennessean|publisher=The Tennessean|accessdate=January 17, 2015|date=January 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn a February 2015 interview, Borchetta refused to comment on the status of the label's distribution deal with [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG), which was up for renegotiation at the time. He confirmed that the label would release the next ''American Idol'' album, in partnership with 19 Entertainment and UMG\u2014Borchetta would be one of the mentors on the reality program's next series. Borchetta also disclosed that Swift agreed to the withdrawal of her catalog from Spotify after he first suggested the idea to her, and that he would remove the music of all Big Machine artists if it was within his power.<ref name=\"New\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the label branched out into the [[alcoholic beverage]] industry by launching Big Machine Vodka, a premium brand distilled in [[Lynnville, Tennessee]].

To support [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by a [[Nazi Germany]] [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The flooding of hold 1 and 2 caused the [[bow (ship)|bow]] to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax).

She was operated by the Mississippi Shipping Company for the [[War Shipping Administration]] as a [[United States Merchant Marine]] ship.  She was a [[Maritime Commission]] design. Like other Liberty ships, she was 441 feet (134&nbsp;m) long and 56 feet (17&nbsp;m) wide, carried 9000 tons of cargo and had a top speed of 11 knots (20&nbsp;km/h).

To support [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by a [[Nazi Germany]] [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The flooding of hold 1 and 2 caused the [[bow (ship)|bow]] to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots.

He flew [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bomber from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|''S\u014dry\u016b'']] during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] and the [[Battle of Midway]]. He was shot down during the [[Solomon Islands Campaign]] while flying from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']] but survived the crash and was eventually evacuated to Japan.\n\n==Early career==\nJ\u016bz\u014d Mori was born in on 9 February 1917 in a small town in [[Saitama Prefecture]] to a poor farmer family. He wanted to become a teacher but the family could not afford the entrance fee for the school. He then moved to [[Tokyo]] to live with his uncle. He found him a job in the department store, while at the same time he attended a night school. However, in January 1935 his father died and he was forced to return to his home town in order to support the family. In August he noticed a navy recruiting poster and decided to join the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. He passed the entrance test in January 1936 but almost failed the physical exam as his chest measurement was to small. He enlisted the navy as a navy and in June left for [[Yokosuka]] naval base to start the basic training. In November he transferred to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near [[Tokyo]] to begin pilot training. He graduated from the 38th class in 1938 and specialized for torpedo bombing.\n\nIn April 1938, Mori was assigned to the 12th Air Group based near [[Nanjing]] in [[Central China]]. He flew [[Aichi D1A]] bomber and participated in various operations along [[Yangtze River]]. In September, the unit transitioned to the new [[Nakajima B5N]] bombers. During one of the September mission on near [[Jiujiang]], Mori experienced an engine failure in the new aircraft and was forced to land in a nearby field controlled by [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA). In November, while flying a mission from [[Hankou]], his B5N ran out of fuel due to a problem and he again was forced to land in a field near [[Yangtze River]]. This time he and his crew ended up in enemy territory but they were rescued the next day. He left China in December 1938 and in January 1939 he was transferred back to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] NAS to serve as an instructor. In May he was promoted to [[Petty Officer Third Class]].\n\nIn September 1941 he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'' and started the training in preparation for the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].\n\n==Pacific War==\nDuring the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Petty Officer Mori was part of the first wave. As his division of [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers they reached the harbor they lined up to attack the [[United States Navy]] (USN) battleship row. However, his division leader lined them up on a cruiser instead of a battleship. Mori realized the error before relasing the torpedo and went around for another pass. He then lined up on a battleship [[USS California (BB-44)|California]] and hit it with his torpedo.\n\nPetty Officer Mori was not directly involved in the [[Attack on Darwin]] since he was assigned to a patrol duty in the vicinity of INJ carriers.\n\nOn the return journey from Pearl Harbor, the Second Carrier Division (consisting of carriers ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|Hiry\u016b]]'' and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'') was detached to assist in [[Battle of Wake Island|capturing]] of [[Wake Island]]. On 22 December, Petty Officer Mori and his group of B5N level bombers attacked artillery emplacements and fortifications on the island. The next day, they flew again to support the landings on the islands. When he arrived to the island, the defence already garrison surrendered as he noticed the white flag flying above their headquarters. However, while flying around the islands, one of the rouge AA emplacements opened fire and hit his fuel tank. Infuriated about it, he considered doping the remaining bombs on their position, however, he decided not risk running out of fuel and returned to the IJN fleet instead.\n\nIn April 1942, Petty Officer Mori participated in [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was not directly involved in actions on 5 April as he was part of a reserve force waiting on the carriers. However, on 9 April he was part of strike against [[Trincomalee]] military harbor on [[Ceylon]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb and his division performed a low-level bombing attack on hrabor installation. On their back, they encountered a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and evaded it by hiding into a cloud before safely returning to the carrier.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942, Petty Officer Mori was part of the strike force against the USN airfield and installations on [[Midway Atoll]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb for level bombing. On the way to the atoll, they were intercepted by a large group of Midway-based [[United States Marines|Marine]] fighters (six [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s and 20 [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]s) led by Major [[Floyd B. Parks]]. His aircraft was attacked by the Marine fighters, however the escorting [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s drove them away. Mori and his division of six level bombers attacked the Midway airfield. Four bombs landed and detonated on the runway, while two of them missed and hit the forest nearby. However, those two bombs appeared to have hit AA emplacement and ammo depot, since they cause a series of secondary explosions. After the attack he headed back to IJN fleet where he witnessed the unsuccessful attack on IJN carriers by the Midway-based [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] high-altitude bombers on [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiry\u016b'']] and [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] torpedo bombers on ''S\u014dry\u016b''. He landed on ''S\u014dry\u016b'', which was preparing its [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers for a strike against USN carrier detected in the North-East. However, before the preparation could be finished, ''S\u014dry\u016b'' was hit and set her ablaze by three bombs dropped by dive bombers of [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']] led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Max Leslie]]. Mori was in the ready room at the time of attack and had to fight through the smoke and fire to reach the deck of the carrier. As the fires intensified, he had to jump 60 from the deck into the sea and was eventually picked up by destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Makigumo (1941)|Makigumo]].\n\nAfter the Battle of Midway, Petty Officer Mori was transferred to the new carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']], which sailed from Japan to Guadalcanal in early October 1942. On 16 October, He participated in the hastily organized and ill-fated air strike to attack enemy position around [[Lunga Point]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. The strike consisted of 18 B5N bombers (equipped with 800 kilogram bombs) and 18 Zero fighters, under over all command of Lieutenant Commander [[Yoshio Shiga]]. [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiy\u014d|''Hiy\u014d'']] bombers were led by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Irikiin, while ''Jun'y\u014d'' bombers were led by inexperienced Lieutenant Tadao It\u014d. As they approached Lunga Point, It\u014d broke off the bombing run of the entire ''Jun'y\u014d'' group in order to make another attempt, which infuriated Mori. During the second attempt the group was ambushed by numerous Wildcat fighters from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. In the attack three ''Hiy\u014d'' bombers were shot down and three were damaged, while six ''Jun'y\u014d'' bombers were shot down and two were damaged. The escorting Zeros claimed several Wildcats, however ''Hiy\u014d'' ace [[Kaname Harada]] was wounded and had to ditch at [[Rekata Bay]]. Petty Officer Mori lost his right hand and was forced to ditch his bomber in the water near [[Cape Esperance]], which was held by IJA. He then endured starvation on [[Guadalcanal]] before being evacuated to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in November.\n\n==Later life==\nAs a result of the injury, Mori was discharged from the navy and survived the war. He later opened a bar near [[Nishi-Ogikubo Station]] in Tokyo, where he also worked as a bartender.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n* {{cite book \n |last=\u68ee\n |first=\u62fe\u4e09\n |year=2004\n |edition=new\n |language=Japanese\n |title=\u5947\u8e5f\u306e\u96f7\u6483\u968a\u2015\u3042\u308b\u96f7\u6483\u6a5f\u64cd\u7e26\u54e1\u306e\u751f\u9084\n |publisher=\u5149\u4eba\u793e\n |location= \n |isbn=476982064X\n}}\n\n* {{cite book \n |last=Mori\n |first=J\u016bz\u014d\n |year=2015\n |translator= Nicholas Voge\n |title=The Miraculous Torpedo Squadron\n |publisher=\n |location= \n |isbn=\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mori, J\u016bz\u014d}}\n[[Category:1917 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= J\u016bz\u014d Mori\n|birth_date={{Birth date|df=y|1917|2|9}}\n|death_date=\n|birth_place=[[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Petty Officer]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12th Air Group<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]''<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Mori}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''J\u016bz\u014d Mori'''|\u68ee \u62fe\u4e09|Mori J\u016bz\u014d|}} was a [[torpedo bomber]] pilot in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].

He then lined up on a battleship [[USS California (BB-44)|California]] and hit it with his torpedo.\n\nPetty Officer Mori was not directly involved in the [[Attack on Darwin]] since he was assigned to a patrol duty in the vicinity of INJ carriers.\n\nOn the return journey from Pearl Harbor, the Second Carrier Division (consisting of carriers ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|Hiry\u016b]]'' and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'') was detached to assist in [[Battle of Wake Island|capturing]] of [[Wake Island]]. On 22 December, Petty Officer Mori and his group of B5N level bombers attacked artillery emplacements and fortifications on the island. The next day, they flew again to support the landings on the islands. When he arrived to the island, the defence already garrison surrendered as he noticed the white flag flying above their headquarters. However, while flying around the islands, one of the rouge AA emplacements opened fire and hit his fuel tank. Infuriated about it, he considered doping the remaining bombs on their position, however, he decided not risk running out of fuel and returned to the IJN fleet instead.\n\nIn April 1942, Petty Officer Mori participated in [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was not directly involved in actions on 5 April as he was part of a reserve force waiting on the carriers. However, on 9 April he was part of strike against [[Trincomalee]] military harbor on [[Ceylon]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb and his division performed a low-level bombing attack on hrabor installation. On their back, they encountered a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and evaded it by hiding into a cloud before safely returning to the carrier.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942, Petty Officer Mori was part of the strike force against the USN airfield and installations on [[Midway Atoll]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb for level bombing. On the way to the atoll, they were intercepted by a large group of Midway-based [[United States Marines|Marine]] fighters (six [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s and 20 [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]s) led by Major [[Floyd B. Parks]]. His aircraft was attacked by the Marine fighters, however the escorting [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s drove them away. Mori and his division of six level bombers attacked the Midway airfield. Four bombs landed and detonated on the runway, while two of them missed and hit the forest nearby. However, those two bombs appeared to have hit AA emplacement and ammo depot, since they cause a series of secondary explosions. After the attack he headed back to IJN fleet where he witnessed the unsuccessful attack on IJN carriers by the Midway-based [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] high-altitude bombers on [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiry\u016b'']] and [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] torpedo bombers on ''S\u014dry\u016b''. He landed on ''S\u014dry\u016b'', which was preparing its [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers for a strike against USN carrier detected in the North-East. However, before the preparation could be finished, ''S\u014dry\u016b'' was hit and set her ablaze by three bombs dropped by dive bombers of [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']] led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Max Leslie]]. Mori was in the ready room at the time of attack and had to fight through the smoke and fire to reach the deck of the carrier. As the fires intensified, he had to jump 60 from the deck into the sea and was eventually picked up by destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Makigumo (1941)|Makigumo]].\n\nAfter the Battle of Midway, Petty Officer Mori was transferred to the new carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']], which sailed from Japan to Guadalcanal in early October 1942. On 16 October, He participated in the hastily organized and ill-fated air strike to attack enemy position around [[Lunga Point]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. The strike consisted of 18 B5N bombers (equipped with 800 kilogram bombs) and 18 Zero fighters, under over all command of Lieutenant Commander [[Yoshio Shiga]]. [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiy\u014d|''Hiy\u014d'']] bombers were led by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Irikiin, while ''Jun'y\u014d'' bombers were led by inexperienced Lieutenant Tadao It\u014d. As they approached Lunga Point, It\u014d broke off the bombing run of the entire ''Jun'y\u014d'' group in order to make another attempt, which infuriated Mori. During the second attempt the group was ambushed by numerous Wildcat fighters from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. In the attack three ''Hiy\u014d'' bombers were shot down and three were damaged, while six ''Jun'y\u014d'' bombers were shot down and two were damaged. The escorting Zeros claimed several Wildcats, however ''Hiy\u014d'' ace [[Kaname Harada]] was wounded and had to ditch at [[Rekata Bay]]. Petty Officer Mori lost his right hand and was forced to ditch his bomber in the water near [[Cape Esperance]], which was held by IJA. He then endured starvation on [[Guadalcanal]] before being evacuated to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in November.\n\n==Later life==\nAs a result of the injury, Mori was discharged from the navy and survived the war. He later opened a bar near [[Nishi-Ogikubo Station]] in Tokyo, where he also worked as a bartender.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n* {{cite book \n |last=\u68ee\n |first=\u62fe\u4e09\n |year=2004\n |edition=new\n |language=Japanese\n |title=\u5947\u8e5f\u306e\u96f7\u6483\u968a\u2015\u3042\u308b\u96f7\u6483\u6a5f\u64cd\u7e26\u54e1\u306e\u751f\u9084\n |publisher=\u5149\u4eba\u793e\n |location= \n |isbn=476982064X\n}}\n\n* {{cite book \n |last=Mori\n |first=J\u016bz\u014d\n |year=2015\n |translator= Nicholas Voge\n |title=The Miraculous Torpedo Squadron\n |publisher=\n |location= \n |isbn=\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mori, J\u016bz\u014d}}\n[[Category:1917 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: and and \u2192 and", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%ABz%C5%8D_Mori"}

He has been previously known as both '''Baby''' and '''Babyeator'''.\n\n==Career==\n\nTerry \"BIG\" Chuong was born in [[Rosemead, California]]. He started playing games when he was eight years old, and has played several titles, including StarCraft, Maplestory, and, of course, League of Legends, which he started playing in the game's beta, enjoying the champion  Heimerdinger in particular. Terry was introduced to the competitive League scene when a friend asked him to jungle for a team, which happened to be with Frank. He performed well then, and the team offered him a tryout, which he passed. He stayed with the team when the roster was acquired by Wazabi Gaming but then was replaced on July 6, 2014. In the eleventh week of the [[2014 NA LCS summer split]], he subbed for [[Counter Logic Gaming]] when the main roster was training in Korea.\n\n===2015 Preseason===\n\nOn September 3, 2014 Babyeator became one of the founding members of Storm, along with Lourlo, Hairyabs, mandatorycloud, and xPecake. The team was initially formed to attempt to qualify for the 2015 spring LCS via the Expansion Tournament. However, because their top laner Lourlo would not be 17 years old in time, they decided to wait until he would be eligible to compete to attempt to qualify. In December, they competed in the NACL New Year's Kick-off Tournament. They made it to round 4 of the tournament in the winner's bracket along with Enemy eSports but never played their final matches.\n\n===2015 Season===\n\nStorm participated in the NACS Spring Qualifier in January 2015. They defeated Zenith eSports in the first round but then lost to Team Dragon Knights and did not qualify for the spring season. In April, they competed in the AlphaDraft Challenger League, but Babyeator left the team partway through the tournament. He joined Frank Fang Gaming before the finals of the tournament, where they came in second place. In the NACS Summer Qualifier, Frank Fang Gaming lost to Cloud9 Tempest in the first round of their bracket and were eliminated. Three days after their defeat, the team disbanded.\n\nBaby played for Team Dragon Knights for the first three games of the NA LCS Summer Season along with former FFG teammate LattmaN. He later joined Team Imagine after the second week of the NACS Summer Season. Imagine finished fourth in the regular season, with a 6-4 record. In the 2015 NACS Summer Playoffs, they lost in the semifinals to eventual tournament winner Renegades, but won the third place match against Cloud 9 Tempest to secure a spot in the 2016 LCS Promotion Tournament.

The best time for the expedition would be, in ordinary seasons, in the month of August. The rocks are sound and are peculiarly unlike those of other mountains. From the moment the glacier is left, hard climbing begins, and the hands as well as the feet are continuously employed.
