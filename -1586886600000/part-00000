It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]] (sometimes called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\") are classified in the genus [[Pan (genus)|''Pan'']]. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.\n\nThe chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|\u2013|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|\u2013|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.\n\nThe chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength and aggressiveness makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as [[American Sign Language]] to chimpanzees, with limited success.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English name \"chimpanzee\" is first recorded in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chimpanzee |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> It is derived from [[Vili language|Vili]] ''ci-mpenze''<ref>{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary |date=2011 |edition=5th |chapter-url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chimpanzee |access-date=31 August 2018 |chapter=chimpanzee |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}</ref> or [[Tshiluba language]] ''chimpenze'', with a meaning of \"[[ape]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/chimpanzee#etymonline_v_11268 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref> The colloquialism \"chimp\" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chimp |title=chimp definition &#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2009-06-06}}</ref> The genus name ''Pan'' derives from the [[Pan (god)|Greek god]], while the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''troglodytes'' was taken from the [[Troglodytae]], a mythical race of cave-dwellers.<ref name=\"Corbey\"/><ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy and genetics==\nThe first great ape known to Western science in the 17th century was the \"[[orangutan|orang-outang]]\" (genus ''Pongo''), the local [[Malay language|Malay]] name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician [[Jacobus Bontius]].

In the reanalysis, Terrace and Bever concluded that Nim's utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. \"Much of the apes' behavior is pure drill\", he said. \"Language still stands as an important definition of the human species.\" In this reversal, Terrace now argued Nim's use of ASL was not like human [[language acquisition]]. Nim never initiated conversations himself, rarely introduced new words, and simply imitated what the humans did.

Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations, and may allow [[poacher]]s more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans. Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nChimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nInfectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans, because the two species are so similar.

It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]] (sometimes called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\") are classified in the genus [[Pan (genus)|''Pan'']]. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.\n\nThe chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|\u2013|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|\u2013|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.\n\nThe chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength and aggressiveness makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as [[American Sign Language]] to chimpanzees, with limited success.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English name \"chimpanzee\" is first recorded in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chimpanzee |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> It is derived from [[Vili language|Vili]] ''ci-mpenze''<ref>{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary |date=2011 |edition=5th |chapter-url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chimpanzee |access-date=31 August 2018 |chapter=chimpanzee |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}</ref> or [[Tshiluba language]] ''chimpenze'', with a meaning of \"[[ape]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/chimpanzee#etymonline_v_11268 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref> The colloquialism \"chimp\" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chimp |title=chimp definition &#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2009-06-06}}</ref> The genus name ''Pan'' derives from the [[Pan (god)|Greek god]], while the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''troglodytes'' was taken from the [[Troglodytae]], a mythical race of cave-dwellers.<ref name=\"Corbey\"/><ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy and genetics==\nThe first great ape known to Western science in the 17th century was the \"[[orangutan|orang-outang]]\" (genus ''Pongo''), the local [[Malay language|Malay]] name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician [[Jacobus Bontius]].

In the reanalysis, Terrace and Bever concluded that Nim's utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. \"Much of the apes' behavior is pure drill\", he said. \"Language still stands as an important definition of the human species.\" In this reversal, Terrace now argued Nim's use of ASL was not like human [[language acquisition]]. Nim never initiated conversations himself, rarely introduced new words, and simply imitated what the humans did.

Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations, and may allow [[poacher]]s more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans. Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nChimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nInfectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans, because the two species are so similar. As human populations grow, so does the risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Animals |Mammals |Primates |Africa}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropopithecus|''Anthropopithecus''}}\n* {{annotated link|Bili ape}}\n* {{annotated link|List of individual apes}}\n* {{annotated link|Prostitution among animals}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory of mind}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General sources===\n*{{cite book | last=Goodall | first=Jane | authorlink=Jane Goodall | year=1986 | title=The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior | publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-11649-8 | ref=harv | url=https://archive.org/details/chimpanzeesofgom00good}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category |Pan_troglodytes |Common chimpanzee}}\n{{Wikispecies |Pan troglodytes |Common Chimpanzee}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124001529/http://www.discoverchimpanzees.org/ DiscoverChimpanzees.org]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/chimp/ Chimpanzee Genome resources]\n* [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/chimpanzee Primate Info Net ''Pan troglodytes'' Factsheets]\n* [http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.SpeciesProfile?spcode=A06C U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Species Profile]\n* View the [http://www.ensembl.org/Pan_troglodytes/Info/Index/ common chimpanzee genome] in [[Ensembl]]\n* [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive Human Timeline (Interactive)] \u2013 [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], [[National Museum of Natural History]] (August 2016).\n{{Hominidae nav}}\n{{Apes}}\n\n{{Taxonbar |from=Q4126704}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:chimpanzee, common}}\n[[Category:Chimpanzees|common chimpanzee]]\n[[Category:Tool-using mammals]]\n[[Category:Primates of Africa]]\n[[Category:Extant Pliocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1775|common chimpanzee]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]\n", "name_user": "172.250.186.37", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee"}

However, with demand so high, and many of the horses Ward had previously used to transport his goods around Sheffield conscripted by the military he had an increasingly difficult time to match supply with demand. Lizzie the Elephant was brought in as a solution to this problem.<ref name=\"shef.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/jungle/index4d3.htmll|title=University of Sheffield project page|author=|date=|website=shef.ac.uk|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nLizzie the Elephant was drafted in from Sedgwick's Menagerie, a travelling circus ran by William Sedgwick (1841\u20131927), after work horses from Thomas Ward's were sent or requisitioned to the front in the [[First World War]]. The elephant was said to be able to do the work of three of Ward's horses and soon got herself the name 'Tommy Ward's Elephant' as she became a familiar sight carrying or hauling goods around [[Sheffield]], controlled by her trainer Richard Sedgwick (1875\u20131931) (son of the circus ringleader William Sedgwick).<ref name=\"shef.ac.uk\"/> Lizzie was said to have inspired other Sheffield firms to creative means with their wartime transportation and a company in the [[Wicker]] area of the city was said to have used camels also from Sedgwick's Menagerie in place of their own horses.<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Tuesday 18 February 2914, page 6</ref> Unfortunately, walking around the [[cobblestone]]d streets of Sheffield damaged Lizzie's feet, and although she continued to work for Ward's firm for sometime after the end of the first world war she was eventually returned to the circus.\n\nLizzie has gone down in Sheffield legend, and many stories and legends surround her adventures. She also gave name to the popular Sheffield sayings \"done up like Tommy Ward's elephant\" - meaning someone carrying much weight, and the self-explanatory \"like trying to shift Tommy Ward's elephant\". A [[Sheffield Community Transport]] bus was named \"Lizzie Ward\" after her and is an [[Optare Solo]] model.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Publications==\n*{{colledge}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Thomas_W._Ward Gracesguide.co.uk: Information on Thos W Ward yard]\n*[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/muck/ Liverpoolmuseums.org: Information on Thos W Ward company]\n*[http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/jungle/index4d3.html Sheffield Educated - Lizzie the Elephant]\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog13d.shtml Information on the elephant]\n{{Commons category|position=left|Thos W Ward Limited}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ward, Thos W}}\n[[Category:Ship breaking]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Sheffield]]\n[[Category:British companies established in 1873]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1982]]\n[[Category:Energy companies established in 1873]]\n[[Category:Waste management companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1982 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:1982 disestablishments in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:The Bailey Bridge (geograph 3669971).jpg|thumb|Bailey Bridge, erected in 2006 at the rear of Albion Works, Sheffield|alt=]]\n[[File:Field with power lines, Ketton, Rutland - geograph.org.uk - 1074132.jpg|thumb|Cement kiln 8, Ketton, Rutland]]\n'''Thos. W. Ward Ltd''' was a [[Sheffield]], Yorkshire, steel, engineering and cement business which began as coal and coke merchants then expanded to recycling metal for Sheffield's steel industry, engineering and the supply of machinery.\n\nIn 1894 as part of the scrap metal operation Ward's began to set up substantial [[Ship breaking|shipbreaking]] yards in different parts of England and in Scotland and Wales. By 1953 Thos W  Ward employed 11,500 people.\n\nWard's business was reorganised at the end of the 1970s when it moved from being an engineering group with a motley assortment of subsidiaries to being principally dependent on [[cement]].

However, with demand so high, and many of the horses Ward had previously used to transport his goods around Sheffield conscripted by the military he had an increasingly difficult time to match supply with demand. Lizzie the Elephant was brought in as a solution to this problem.<ref name=\"shef.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/jungle/index4d3.htmll|title=University of Sheffield project page|author=|date=|website=shef.ac.uk|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nLizzie the Elephant was drafted in from Sedgwick's Menagerie, a travelling circus ran by William Sedgwick (1841\u20131927), after work horses from Thomas Ward's were sent or requisitioned to the front in the [[First World War]]. The elephant was said to be able to do the work of three of Ward's horses and soon got herself the name 'Tommy Ward's Elephant' as she became a familiar sight carrying or hauling goods around [[Sheffield]], controlled by her trainer Richard Sedgwick (1875\u20131931) (son of the circus ringleader William Sedgwick).<ref name=\"shef.ac.uk\"/> Lizzie was said to have inspired other Sheffield firms to creative means with their wartime transportation and a company in the [[Wicker]] area of the city was said to have used camels also from Sedgwick's Menagerie in place of their own horses.<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Tuesday 18 February 2914, page 6</ref> Unfortunately, walking around the [[cobblestone]]d streets of Sheffield damaged Lizzie's feet, and although she continued to work for Ward's firm for sometime after the end of the first world war she was eventually returned to the circus.\n\nLizzie has gone down in Sheffield legend, and many stories and legends surround her adventures. She also gave name to the popular Sheffield sayings \"done up like Tommy Ward's elephant\" - meaning someone carrying much weight, and the self-explanatory \"like trying to shift Tommy Ward's elephant\". A [[Sheffield Community Transport]] bus was named \"Lizzie Ward\" after her and is an [[Optare Solo]] model.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Publications==\n*{{colledge}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Thomas_W._Ward Gracesguide.co.uk: Information on Thos W Ward yard]\n*[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/muck/ Liverpoolmuseums.org: Information on Thos W Ward company]\n*[http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/jungle/index4d3.html Sheffield Educated - Lizzie the Elephant]\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog13d.shtml Information on the elephant]\n{{Commons category|position=left|Thos W Ward Limited}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ward, Thos W}}\n[[Category:Ship breaking]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Sheffield]]\n[[Category:British companies established in 1873]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1982]]\n[[Category:Energy companies established in 1873]]\n[[Category:Waste management companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1982 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:1982 disestablishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toGrays(link changed toGrays, Essex; link changed toGrays, Essex) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thos_W_Ward"}

It is the result of a merger in 2005 of Poettering's original mDNS/DNS-SD implementation called \"FlexMDNS\", and Lloyd's original code called \"Avahi\". While most of today's code originates from the former project, the name of the latter was used for the joint project. Development on \"FlexMDNS\" started in late 2004, and work on the original \"Avahi\" began in early 2004.\n\nAvahi was originally developed under the [[freedesktop.org]] umbrella, but has now become a separate project. Avahi, however, makes use of freedesktop.org's [[D-Bus]] IPC layer.\n\nThe name ''Avahi'' is the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] native name and scientific Latin name of a genus of [[woolly lemur]], a family of [[primate]]s indigenous to [[Madagascar]]. Trent Lloyd found the name, liked it, and it stuck. The logo reflects this.<ref>{{cite video\n | title       = Using Avahi The \"Right Way\"\n | date        = 2007\n | location    = linux.conf.au\n | url         = http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2007/video/monday/monday_1150_GNOME.ogg\n | format      = ogg\n | medium      = Presentation\n | people      = Trent Lloyd, [[Lennart Poettering]]\n}}</ref> Perhaps in coincidence, Avahi backwards is \"I-hav-a\", a description of a discovery advertisement.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Linux on the desktop]]\n* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]]\n* [[Network Information Service]]\n* [[OSGi]] Alliance\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|//www.avahi.org}}\n* [http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2007/video/monday/monday_1150_GNOME.ogg Talk] and [http://lathiat.net/files/avahi-lca2007.pdf slides] by Poettering/Lloyd at [[linux.conf.au]] 2007\n\n{{Freedesktop.org}}\n\n[[Category:Freedesktop.org]]\n[[Category:Applications using D-Bus]]\n[[Category:Free network-related software]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in C]]\n[[Category:GNOME]]\n[[Category:KDE]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox software\n| name                   = Avahi\n| logo                   = Avahi-logo.svg\n| screenshot             = Avahi.png\n| caption                = Avahi Discovery GUI showing discovered services\n| collapsible            =\n| author                 =\n| developer              = [[Lennart Poettering]], Trent Lloyd, Sjoerd Simons\n| released               =\n| latest release version = 0.8\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2020|02|18}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/lathiat/avahi/releases/tag/v0.8|title=Avahi 0.8, the 'Dobro Jutro' release|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n| latest preview version =\n| latest preview date    =\n| programming language   = [[C (programming language)|C]]\n| operating system       = [[Linux]], [[BSD]]\n| platform               =\n| size                   =\n| language               =\n| genre                  = {{ubl|[[Computer networking|Networking]]|[[Service discovery]]|[[Linux on the desktop]]}}\n| license                = [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPLv2.1]]\n| website                = {{URL|//www.avahi.org}}\n}}\n\n'''Avahi''' is a [[free software|free]] [[zero-configuration networking]] (zeroconf) implementation, including a system for [[multicast DNS]]/[[DNS-SD]] [[service discovery]].

In 2006 Apple [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] parts of Bonjour under the [[Apache License]].<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.apple.com/archives/bonjour-dev/2006/Aug/msg00005.html |title=Fwd: Apple Opens Up: Bonjour now under Apache license |date=2006-08-07 |accessdate=18 March 2015 |mailing-list=bonjour-dev |last=Prabhakar |first=Ernest Prabhakar |authorlink= }}</ref>\n\nAvahi's performance resembles that of Bonjour, sometimes exceeding it; however Avahi can lose services when managing large numbers of requests simultaneously.<ref>[http://lipn.fr/~cerin/documents/PresentationSGS08heithem.pdf Analysis of Peer-to-Peer Protocols Performance for Establishing a Decentralized Desktop Grid Middleware]</ref>\n\n==History==\nAvahi was developed by [[Lennart Poettering]] and Trent Lloyd. It is the result of a merger of Poettering's original mDNS/DNS-SD implementation called \"FlexMDNS\", and Lloyd's original code called \"Avahi\" that happened in 2005. While most of today's code originates from the former project, the name of the latter was used for the joint project. Development on \"FlexMDNS\" started in late 2004, and work on the original \"Avahi\" began in early 2004.\n\nAvahi was originally developed under the [[freedesktop.org]] umbrella, but has now become a separate project. Avahi, however, makes use of freedesktop.org's [[D-Bus]] IPC layer.\n\nThe name ''Avahi'' is the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] native name and scientific Latin name of a genus of [[woolly lemur]], a family of [[primate]]s indigenous to [[Madagascar]]. Trent Lloyd found the name, liked it, and it stuck. The logo reflects this.<ref>{{cite video\n | title       = Using Avahi The \"Right Way\"\n | date        = 2007\n | location    = linux.conf.au\n | url         = http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2007/video/monday/monday_1150_GNOME.ogg\n | format      = ogg\n | medium      = Presentation\n | people      = Trent Lloyd, [[Lennart Poettering]]\n}}</ref> Perhaps in coincidence, Avahi backwards is \"I-hav-a\", a description of a discovery advertisement.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Linux on the desktop]]\n* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]]\n* [[Network Information Service]]\n* [[OSGi]] Alliance\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|//www.avahi.org}}\n* [http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2007/video/monday/monday_1150_GNOME.ogg Talk] and [http://lathiat.net/files/avahi-lca2007.pdf slides] by Poettering/Lloyd at [[linux.conf.au]] 2007\n\n{{Freedesktop.org}}\n\n[[Category:Freedesktop.org]]\n[[Category:Applications using D-Bus]]\n[[Category:Free network-related software]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in C]]\n[[Category:GNOME]]\n[[Category:KDE]]\n", "name_user": "Mjshulman", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:simplified syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_(software)"}

Small prey are taken where large [[ungulate]]s are less common. The known prey of leopards ranges from [[dung beetle]]s to adult [[Eland (genus)|eland]]s, which can reach {{convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"nowell96\"/> In sub-Saharan Africa, at least 92 prey species have been documented in leopard scat, including [[rodent]]s, [[bird]]s, small and large [[antelope]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[hare]]s, and [[arthropod]]s. They generally focus their hunting activity on locally abundant medium-sized ungulates in the {{convert|20|to|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} range, while opportunistically taking other prey. Average intervals between ungulate kills range from seven<ref name=\"Bailey1993\"/> to 12\u201313 days.<ref name=\"Hamilton1976\"/>\nLeopards often hide large kills in trees, a behavior for which great strength is required.

Their hunting at night was difficult to watch; the best time for observing them was after dawn. Of their 64 daytime hunts, only three were successful. In this woodland area, they preyed mostly on impala, both adult and young, and caught some [[Thomson's gazelle]]s in the dry season. Occasionally, they successfully hunted [[warthog]], [[dik-dik]], [[reedbuck]], [[duiker]], [[steenbok]], [[wildebeest]] and [[topi]] calves, [[jackal]], [[Cape hare]], [[guineafowl]] and [[starling]]. They were less successful in hunting [[zebra]]s, [[Coke's hartebeest]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[mongoose]]s, [[Genet (animal)|genet]]s, [[hyrax]]es and small birds.

Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool and dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as [[computer server]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, and to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.\n\nAir conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an enclosed space such as a building or a [[car]] to improve [[thermal comfort]] and [[indoor air quality]]. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. The [[cooling]] is typically achieved through a [[refrigeration cycle]], but sometimes [[evaporative cooler|evaporation]] or [[free cooling]] is used.

The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate.

Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids (such as alcohol and ether) could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed up the [[evaporation]]. They lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to {{convert|-14|C|0}} while the ambient temperature was {{convert|18|C|0}}. Franklin noted that, soon after they passed the freezing point of water {{convert|0|C|0}}, a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching {{convert|-14|C|0}}.

In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \"Ice King\", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced {{convert|3,000|kg}} of ice per day.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice-refrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: \"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Electrical air conditioning===\n[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]\nThe creation of the modern electrical air conditioning unit and industry is credited to the American inventor [[Willis Carrier|Willis H.

There, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The first air conditioner, designed and built in [[Buffalo, New York]] by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.<ref>http://www.williscarrier.com/m/1876-1902.php</ref>\n\nDesigned to improve manufacturing [[process control]] in a [[printing]] plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte]] was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \"air conditioning\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \"water conditioning\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \"condition\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company.<ref>{{citation|title=Apparatus for treating air |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US808897A/en |date=16 September 1904|accessdate=31 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, the first private home to have air conditioning was built in Minneapolis in 1914, owned by [[Charles Gilbert Gates|Charles Gates]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7951/a-brief-history-of-air-conditioning-10720229/ |title=A Brief History of Air Conditioning |publisher=Popular Mechanics |first=Amanda |last=Green |date=January 1, 2015 |accessdate=31 January 2020}}</ref> Realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes, particularly in regions with warmer climate, David St. Pierre DuBose (1898-1994) designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home ''Meadowmont'', all disguised behind intricate and attractive Georgian-style open moldings.{{when|date=September 2015}} This building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the United States equipped for [[central air conditioning]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rizzoconferencecenter.com/PDFs/History-of-Meadowmont.pdf |title=Early University Benefactors |publisher=Rizzoconferencecenter.com |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Robert Sherman of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] invented a portable, in-window air conditioner that cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and filtered the air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://navlog.org/patent_1.html|title=Unsung Engineering Heros: Robert Sherman |publisher=Navlog.org|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Refrigerant development===\n{{Main|Refrigerant}}\n[[File:Embraco compressor.jpg|thumb|A modern [[R-134a]] hermetic refrigeration [[gas compressor|compressor]]]]\nThe first air conditioners and [[refrigerator]]s employed toxic or flammable gases, such as [[ammonia]], [[methyl chloride]], or [[propane]], that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'' (R-12), in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).\n\n[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional \"shot\" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all \"R-134a\" systems whether \"converted\" or \"factory\", even $50-$100 per pound of R-12 is considered \"cheap\" by many individuals.\n\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] ([[R-134a]], historically used in most cars, refrigerators and chillers) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/blog/air-conditioners-dehumidifiers-r-410-a-refrigerant/|website=Sylvane|title=Air Conditioners & Dehumidifiers|date=July 2011}}</ref> HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems.

R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.\n\n==Operating principles==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Refrigeration cycle===\n{{Main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}\n[[File:Heatpump.svg|thumb|A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1)&nbsp;[[condensing coil]], 2)&nbsp;[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&nbsp;[[evaporator coil]], 4)&nbsp;[[Gas compressor|compressor]]]]\n[[File:Capilliary metering device.jpg|thumb|upright|Capillary expansion valve connection to evaporator inlet. Notice [[frost]] formation.]]\n\nCooling in traditional AC systems is accomplished using the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] cycle, which uses the forced circulation and [[phase transition|phase change]] of a [[refrigerant]] between gas and liquid to transfer heat.\n\nThe vapor-compression cycle can occur within a unitary, or packaged piece of equipment; or within a [[chiller]] that is connected to terminal cooling equipment (such as a [[variable refrigerant flow]] terminal or [[fan coil unit]]) on its evaporator side and [[Waste heat|heat rejection]] equipment on its condenser side.\n\n==== Heat pump ====\nMain article: [[Heat pump]]\n\nSome air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the [[refrigeration cycle]] and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as \"reverse cycle air conditioner\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\n\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4\u201313 \u00b0C (40\u201355 \u00b0F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.\n\nThe icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a [[natural gas]], [[Heating oil|oil]] or [[tree]] [[fireplace]] or [[central heating]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\n\n===Evaporative cooling===\n{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}\n[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\n\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hotdealsproduct.com/best-air-conditioners-in-india/|title=Top 16 Best Air Conditioners in India [2020]-Review and Buying Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace|edition=2nd |first=Shane |last=Smith |publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-55591-450-9|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&pg=PA62&dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window}}</ref> These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\n\n===Free cooling===\n{{Main|Free cooling}}\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water-[[glycol]] mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\n\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Snijders|first=Aart|date=2008|url= http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf|title=ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe |publisher=IFTech International|website=Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Humidity control==\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, reducing [[relative humidity]] can promote occupant comfort. An air conditioner designed for an occupied space typically will create a 30% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space to balance comfort, microbial growth, and other [[indoor air quality]] factors.<ref name=\"Dristeem1\">{{cite web|title=Dristeem: Humidity and Comfort|url=http://www.dristeem-media.com/literature/Web_HumidityAndComfort.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Dehumidification and cooling===\nAir conditioning equipment will reduce the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system if the surface of the evaporator coil is significantly cooler than the [[dewpoint]] of the surrounding air. Moisture from the air will condense on the coil and must be disposed of or recycled.\n\n===Dehumidification program===\n\nMost modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} to reduce the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops;{{clarify|date=October 2017}} this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the temperature rises again,{{clarify|reason=temperature of what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.\n\nOccasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nInverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold,{{clarify|reason=too cold for what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Dehumidifier===\n{{main|Dehumidifier}}\n[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\n\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\n\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].\n\n==Energy transfer==\n{{globalize section|date=March 2020}}\nIn a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Jan F.|editor-last=Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-9584-0}}</ref> To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \"efficiency\" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&nbsp;W of power.\n\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \"efficiencies\" of significantly greater than 100%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winnick |first= J. |title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-05590-7}}</ref> However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\n\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \"[[ton of refrigeration|tons of refrigeration]]\", with each approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=18 May 2007|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|archivedate=28 May 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18&nbsp;kW) in capacity.\n\n===Seasonal energy efficiency ratio===\n{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|European seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (W\u00b7h) during the same period.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S |title=Energy Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 S|accessdate=2 July 2006|work=Energy Glossary|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}</ref>\n\n: '''SEER = BTU \u00f7 (W\u00b7h) '''\nthis can also be rewritten as:\n: '''SEER = (BTU / h) \u00f7 W''', where \"W\" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.\n\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\n\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\n\n: '''500 W \u00d7 1000 h = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 [[kWh]]'''\n\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\n\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\n\n: '''5000 BTU/h \u00d7 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''\n\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\n\n: '''5,000,000 BTU \u00f7 10 = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 kWh'''\n\nSEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric].

The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\n\nIn 1971, [[General Electric]] introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/13/bright-ideas/B8Fuvbgy021GG95bydrHgM/story.html |title=Timeline: Bright ideas |work=The Boston Globe |date=13 January 2016|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/packaged-terminal-air-conditioner-buying-guide.html |website=Sylvane|title=PTAC Buying Guide}}</ref> They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a [[heat pump]]. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\n\nThe first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Room-size air conditioner fits under window sill |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=63 |issue=6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA885 |page=885 |date=June 1935 |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Split systems===\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems.

Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's. Large systems are known as VRF ([[Variable refrigerant flow]]) systems. Mini split ductless systems were invented by [[Daikin]] in 1973, and VRF systems were also invented by Daikin in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/corporate/overview/summary/history/digest/|title=History of Daikin Innovation |website=daikin.com |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh|title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Cooling & Heating &#124; HVAC|publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |date=17 February 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150603025417/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |archivedate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\"<ref name=doe20120809>{{cite web|title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy|date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems.

In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.\n\nA large Multi Split System is called a [[Variable refrigerant flow]] system and can be used instead of a central air conditioner system, as it allows for higher energy efficiency but it is more expensive to purchase and install.\n\n''Difference between split system and multi-split system'':\n\nOther common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.\n\nIts unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.\n\n=====Multi-split system installation considerations=====\nBefore selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.\n\nThe main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.\n\nThe selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.\n\n===Air-only central air conditioning===\nCentral [[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]] A/C provides temperature control and ventilation to an area by conditioning air within an [[air handler]] and distributing it to one or more zones. The temperature of individual zones can be controlled by varying the airflow to each zone and/or reheating the air.\n\n===Central plant cooling===\n{{see also|Chiller}}\n[[File:Industrial air conditioning unit (DFdB).JPG|thumb|A central chilled water plant using air-cooled chillers, water-cooled chillers are cooled by a cooling tower]]\nCentral cooling plants are used to condition large commercial, industrial, or campus loads. At larger scales, the ductwork required to move conditioned air to and from the plant would be impractically large, so an intermediate fluid such as chilled water is used instead. The plant circulates cold water to terminal chilled water devices such as air handlers or fan/coil units.\n\n===Portable units===\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\n\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\n\n====Portable split system====\nA portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit. The portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single duct. Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as dehumidification function.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canstarblue.com.au/appliances/portable-or-split-system-air-conditioning-the-pros-and-cons/|title=Portable Vs Split System Air Conditioning &#124; Pros & Cons|date=August 14, 2018|website=Canstar Blue}}</ref>\n\n====Portable hose system====\nHose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\n\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose |publisher=Experts123.com|date=|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\n\n====Portable evaporative system====\n[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called \"swamp coolers\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].\n\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.\n\n==Uses==\nAir-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into ''comfort'' and ''process'' applications.\n\n===Comfort applications===\n[[File:ACFujitsu2.jpg|thumb|An array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building]]\nComfort applications aim to provide a [[Building science|building indoor environment]] that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.\n\nAir conditioning makes [[deep plan]] buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with [[light well]]s so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via [[natural ventilation]].

Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool and dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as [[computer server]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, and to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.\n\nAir conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an enclosed space such as a building or a [[car]] to improve [[thermal comfort]] and [[indoor air quality]]. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building.

In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \"Ice King\", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced {{convert|3,000|kg}} of ice per day.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice-refrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: \"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Electrical air conditioning===\n[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]\nThe creation of the modern electrical air conditioning unit and industry is credited to the American inventor [[Willis Carrier|Willis H.

There, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The first air conditioner, designed and built in [[Buffalo, New York]] by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.<ref>http://www.williscarrier.com/m/1876-1902.php</ref>\n\nDesigned to improve manufacturing [[process control]] in a [[printing]] plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte]] was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \"air conditioning\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \"water conditioning\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \"condition\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants.

[[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'' (R-12), in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).\n\n[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional \"shot\" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all \"R-134a\" systems whether \"converted\" or \"factory\", even $50-$100 per pound of R-12 is considered \"cheap\" by many individuals.\n\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] ([[R-134a]], historically used in most cars, refrigerators and chillers) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/blog/air-conditioners-dehumidifiers-r-410-a-refrigerant/|website=Sylvane|title=Air Conditioners & Dehumidifiers|date=July 2011}}</ref> HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems.

Notice [[frost]] formation.]]\n\nCooling in traditional AC systems is accomplished using the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] cycle, which uses the forced circulation and [[phase transition|phase change]] of a [[refrigerant]] between gas and liquid to transfer heat.\n\nThe vapor-compression cycle can occur within a unitary, or packaged piece of equipment; or within a [[chiller]] that is connected to terminal cooling equipment (such as a [[variable refrigerant flow]] terminal or [[fan coil unit]]) on its evaporator side and [[Waste heat|heat rejection]] equipment on its condenser side.\n\n==== Heat pump ====\nMain article: [[Heat pump]]\n\nSome air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the [[refrigeration cycle]] and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as \"reverse cycle air conditioner\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\n\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4\u201313 \u00b0C (40\u201355 \u00b0F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.\n\nThe icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a [[natural gas]], [[Heating oil|oil]] or [[tree]] [[fireplace]] or [[central heating]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\n\n===Evaporative cooling===\n{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}\n[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\n\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace|edition=2nd |first=Shane |last=Smith |publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-55591-450-9|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&pg=PA62&dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window}}</ref> These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\n\n===Free cooling===\n{{Main|Free cooling}}\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water-[[glycol]] mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\n\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Snijders|first=Aart|date=2008|url= http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf|title=ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe |publisher=IFTech International|website=Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Humidity control==\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, reducing [[relative humidity]] can promote occupant comfort. An air conditioner designed for an occupied space typically will create a 30% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space to balance comfort, microbial growth, and other [[indoor air quality]] factors.<ref name=\"Dristeem1\">{{cite web|title=Dristeem: Humidity and Comfort|url=http://www.dristeem-media.com/literature/Web_HumidityAndComfort.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Dehumidification and cooling===\nAir conditioning equipment will reduce the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system if the surface of the evaporator coil is significantly cooler than the [[dewpoint]] of the surrounding air. Moisture from the air will condense on the coil and must be disposed of or recycled.\n\n===Dehumidification program===\n\nMost modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} to reduce the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops;{{clarify|date=October 2017}} this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the temperature rises again,{{clarify|reason=temperature of what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.\n\nOccasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nInverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold,{{clarify|reason=too cold for what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Dehumidifier===\n{{main|Dehumidifier}}\n[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\n\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\n\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].\n\n==Energy transfer==\n{{globalize section|date=March 2020}}\nIn a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Jan F.|editor-last=Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-9584-0}}</ref> To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \"efficiency\" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&nbsp;W of power.\n\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \"efficiencies\" of significantly greater than 100%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winnick |first= J. |title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-05590-7}}</ref> However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\n\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \"[[ton of refrigeration|tons of refrigeration]]\", with each approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=18 May 2007|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|archivedate=28 May 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18&nbsp;kW) in capacity.\n\n===Seasonal energy efficiency ratio===\n{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|European seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (W\u00b7h) during the same period.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S |title=Energy Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 S|accessdate=2 July 2006|work=Energy Glossary|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}</ref>\n\n: '''SEER = BTU \u00f7 (W\u00b7h) '''\nthis can also be rewritten as:\n: '''SEER = (BTU / h) \u00f7 W''', where \"W\" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.\n\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\n\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\n\n: '''500 W \u00d7 1000 h = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 [[kWh]]'''\n\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\n\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\n\n: '''5000 BTU/h \u00d7 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''\n\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\n\n: '''5,000,000 BTU \u00f7 10 = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 kWh'''\n\nSEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric].

The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\n\nIn 1971, [[General Electric]] introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/13/bright-ideas/B8Fuvbgy021GG95bydrHgM/story.html |title=Timeline: Bright ideas |work=The Boston Globe |date=13 January 2016|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/packaged-terminal-air-conditioner-buying-guide.html |website=Sylvane|title=PTAC Buying Guide}}</ref> They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a [[heat pump]]. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\n\nThe first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Room-size air conditioner fits under window sill |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=63 |issue=6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA885 |page=885 |date=June 1935 |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Split systems===\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) [[heat exchanger]] is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.\n\n====Mini-split (ductless) system====\n[[File:Splitklimaanlage IMGP9925 unbranded.jpg|thumb|Condenser side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\n[[File:GALANZ II.jpg|thumb|right|Evaporator, or terminal, side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\nA mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |title=Mitsubishi Contractors Guide |page=16 |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020149/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's. Large systems are known as VRF ([[Variable refrigerant flow]]) systems. Mini split ductless systems were invented by [[Daikin]] in 1973, and VRF systems were also invented by Daikin in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/corporate/overview/summary/history/digest/|title=History of Daikin Innovation |website=daikin.com |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh|title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Cooling & Heating &#124; HVAC|publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |date=17 February 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150603025417/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |archivedate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\"<ref name=doe20120809>{{cite web|title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy|date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems. However, lower operating costs and [[rebate (marketing)|rebates]] or other financial incentives\u2014offered in some areas\u2014can help offset the initial expense.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ductless, mini-Split Heat Pumps|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps |publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Multi-split system====\nA multi-split system<ref>{{cite book|title=Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning|last=Trott|first=A.R. |last2=Welch |first2=T. |publisher=Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd|year=2000|isbn=0-7506-4219-X|location=Great Britain|page=312}}</ref> is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts ([[evaporator]] and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.\n\nA large Multi Split System is called a [[Variable refrigerant flow]] system and can be used instead of a central air conditioner system, as it allows for higher energy efficiency but it is more expensive to purchase and install.\n\n''Difference between split system and multi-split system'':\n\nOther common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.\n\nIts unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.\n\n=====Multi-split system installation considerations=====\nBefore selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.\n\nThe main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.\n\nThe selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.\n\n===Air-only central air conditioning===\nCentral [[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]] A/C provides temperature control and ventilation to an area by conditioning air within an [[air handler]] and distributing it to one or more zones. The temperature of individual zones can be controlled by varying the airflow to each zone and/or reheating the air.\n\n===Central plant cooling===\n{{see also|Chiller}}\n[[File:Industrial air conditioning unit (DFdB).JPG|thumb|A central chilled water plant using air-cooled chillers, water-cooled chillers are cooled by a cooling tower]]\nCentral cooling plants are used to condition large commercial, industrial, or campus loads. At larger scales, the ductwork required to move conditioned air to and from the plant would be impractically large, so an intermediate fluid such as chilled water is used instead. The plant circulates cold water to terminal chilled water devices such as air handlers or fan/coil units.\n\n===Portable units===\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\n\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\n\n====Portable split system====\nA portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit. The portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single duct. Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as dehumidification function.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canstarblue.com.au/appliances/portable-or-split-system-air-conditioning-the-pros-and-cons/|title=Portable Vs Split System Air Conditioning &#124; Pros & Cons|date=August 14, 2018|website=Canstar Blue}}</ref>\n\n====Portable hose system====\nHose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\n\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose |publisher=Experts123.com|date=|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\n\n====Portable evaporative system====\n[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called \"swamp coolers\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].\n\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable.

Her mother had suffered many miscarriages.<ref>Waller, p. 16; Whitelock, p. 9</ref> Before Mary's birth, four previous pregnancies had resulted in a [[stillborn]] daughter and three short-lived or stillborn sons, including [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]].<ref>Loades, pp. 12\u201313; Weir, pp. 152\u2013153</ref> \n\nMary was baptised into the Catholic faith at the Church of the Observant Friars in Greenwich three days after her birth.<ref>Porter, p. 13; Waller, p. 16; Whitelock, p. 7</ref> Her godparents included [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Wolsey]]; her great-aunt [[Catherine of York|Catherine of York, Countess of Devon]]; and [[Agnes Howard, Duchess of Norfolk]].<ref>Porter, pp. 13, 37; Waller, p. 17</ref> Henry VIII's cousin once removed, [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]], stood sponsor for Mary's [[confirmation]], which was held immediately after the baptism.<ref>Porter, p. 13; Waller, p. 17; Whitelock, p. 7</ref> The following year, Mary became a godmother herself when she was named as one of the sponsors of her cousin [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]].<ref>Loades, p. 28; Porter, p. 15</ref> In 1520, the Countess of Salisbury was appointed Mary's [[governess]].<ref>Loades, p. 29; Porter, p. 16; Waller, p. 20; Whitelock, p. 21</ref> [[John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford|Sir John Hussey]], later Lord Hussey, was her [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] from 1530, and his wife, Lady Anne, daughter of [[George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent]], was one of Mary's attendants.<ref>Hoyle, p. 407</ref>\n\n==Education and early marriage plans==\n[[File:Mary Tudor by Horenbout.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mary as a snub-nosed girl with red hair|Mary at the time of her engagement to Charles V. She is wearing a rectangular brooch inscribed with \"The Emperour\".<ref>Whitelock, p. 23</ref>]]\n\nMary was a precocious child.<ref>Whitelock, p. 27</ref> In July 1520, when scarcely four and a half years old, she entertained a visiting French delegation with a performance on the [[virginals]] (a type of [[harpsichord]]).<ref>Loades, pp. 19\u201320; Porter, p. 21</ref> A great part of her early education came from her mother, who consulted the Spanish [[humanism|humanist]] [[Juan Luis Vives]] for advice and commissioned him to write ''De Institutione Feminae Christianae'', a treatise on the education of girls.<ref>Loades, p. 31; Porter, p. 30</ref> By the age of nine, Mary could read and write Latin.<ref>Porter, p. 28; Whitelock, p. 27</ref> She studied French, Spanish, music, dance, and perhaps Greek.<ref>Loades, pp. 32, 43</ref> Henry VIII doted on his daughter and boasted to the Venetian ambassador Sebastian Giustiniani, \"This girl never cries\".<ref>''Domine Orator, per Deum immortalem, ista puella nunquam plorat'', quoted in Whitelock, p. 17</ref> Also, as the miniature portrait of her shows, Mary had, like both her parents, a very fair complexion, pale blue eyes and red or reddish-golden hair. She was also ruddy-cheeked, a trait she inherited from her father.<ref>Giles Tremlett, \"Catherine of Aragon, Henry's Spanish Queen\" p.244</ref>\n\nDespite his affection for Mary, Henry was deeply disappointed that his marriage had produced no sons.<ref>Tittler, p. 1</ref> By the time Mary was nine years old, it was apparent that Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir.<ref>Loades, p. 37; Porter, pp. 38\u201339; Whitelock, pp. 32\u201333</ref> In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of [[Wales]] to preside, presumably in name only, over the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]].<ref>Porter, pp. 38\u201339; Whitelock, pp. 32\u201333</ref> She was given her own [[Court (royal)|court]] based at [[Ludlow Castle]] and many of the [[royal prerogative]]s normally reserved for the [[Prince of Wales]]. Vives and others called her the [[Princess of Wales]], although she was never technically invested with the title.<ref>Waller, p. 23</ref> She appears to have spent three years in the [[Welsh Marches]], making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the [[home counties]] around London in mid-1528.<ref>Loades, pp. 41\u201342, 45</ref>\n\nThroughout Mary's childhood, Henry negotiated potential future marriages for her. When she was only two years old, she was promised to [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]], the infant son of [[King Francis I of France]], but the contract was repudiated after three years.<ref>Porter, pp. 20\u201321; Waller, pp. 20\u201321; Whitelock, pp. 18\u201323</ref> In 1522, at the age of six, she was instead contracted to marry her 22-year-old first cousin, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].<ref>Loades, pp. 22\u201323; Porter, pp. 21\u201324; Waller, p. 21; Whitelock, p. 23</ref> However, the engagement was broken off within a few years by Charles with Henry's agreement.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 30\u201331</ref> [[Cardinal Wolsey]], Henry's chief adviser, then resumed marriage negotiations with the French, and Henry suggested that Mary marry the Dauphin's father, King Francis I himself, who was eager for an alliance with England.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 36\u201337</ref> A marriage treaty was signed which provided that Mary marry either Francis I or his second son [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orleans]],<ref>Whitelock, pp. 37\u201338</ref> but Wolsey secured an alliance with France without the marriage. In 1528 Wolsey's agent [[Thomas Magnus]] discussed the idea of her marriage to [[James V of Scotland]] with the Scottish diplomat [[Adam Otterburn]].<ref>''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 4 part IV (London, 1836), p. 545.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Mario Savorgnano, by this time Mary was developing into a pretty, well-proportioned young lady with a fine complexion.<ref>Mario Savorgnano, 25 August 1531, ''Calendar of State Papers, Venetian'', vol. IV, p. 682, quoted in Loades, p. 63</ref>\n\n==Adolescence==\nMeanwhile, the marriage of Mary's parents was in jeopardy. Disappointed at the lack of a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine [[annulment|annulled]], but [[Pope Clement VII]] refused his request. Henry claimed, citing biblical passages ([[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 20:21), that his marriage to Catherine was unclean because she was the widow of his brother [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]] (Mary's uncle). Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never [[consummate]]d and so was not a valid marriage. Her first marriage had been annulled by a previous pope, [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]], on that basis. Clement may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had [[Sack of Rome (1527)|surrounded and occupied Rome]] in the [[War of the League of Cognac]].<ref>Porter, pp. 56, 78; Whitelock, p. 40</ref>\n\nFrom 1531, Mary was often sick with irregular menstruation and depression, although it is not clear whether this was caused by stress, puberty or a more deep-seated disease.<ref>Waller, p. 27</ref> She was not permitted to see her mother, who had been sent to live away from court by Henry.<ref>Porter, p. 76; Whitelock, p. 48</ref> In early 1533, Henry married [[Anne Boleyn]], who was pregnant with his child, and in May [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], formally declared the marriage with Catherine void, and the marriage to Anne valid. Henry repudiated the authority of the Pope, declaring himself Supreme Head of the [[Church of England]]. Catherine was demoted to Dowager Princess of Wales (a title she would have held as the widow of Arthur), and Mary was deemed illegitimate. She was styled \"The Lady Mary\" rather than Princess, and her place in the line of succession was transferred to her newborn half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], Anne's daughter.<ref>Porter, p. 92; Whitelock, pp. 55\u201356</ref> Mary's own household was dissolved;<ref>Loades, p. 77; Porter, p. 92; Whitelock, p. 57</ref> her servants (including the Countess of Salisbury) were dismissed and in December 1533 she was sent to join the household of the infant Elizabeth at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]].<ref>Loades, p. 78; Whitelock, p. 57</ref>\n\nMary determinedly refused to acknowledge that Anne was the queen or that Elizabeth was a princess, further enraging King Henry.<ref>Porter, pp. 97\u2013101; Whitelock, pp. 55\u201369</ref> Under strain and with her movements restricted, Mary was frequently ill, which the royal physician attributed to her \"ill treatment\".<ref>Dr [[William Butts]], quoted in Waller, p. 31</ref> The Imperial ambassador [[Eustace Chapuys]] became her close adviser, and interceded, unsuccessfully, on her behalf at court.<ref>Loades, pp. 84\u201385</ref> The relationship between Mary and her father worsened; they did not speak to each other for three years.<ref>Porter, p. 100</ref> Although both she and her mother were ill, Mary was refused permission to visit Catherine.<ref>Porter, pp. 103\u2013104; Whitelock, pp. 67\u201369, 72</ref> When Catherine died in 1536, Mary was \"inconsolable\".<ref>Letter from Emperor Charles V to [[Isabella of Portugal|Empress Isabella]], quoted in Whitelock, p. 75</ref> Catherine was interred in [[Peterborough Cathedral]], while Mary grieved in semi-seclusion at [[Hunsdon]] in Hertfordshire.<ref>Porter, p. 107; Whitelock, p. 76\u201377</ref>\n\n==Adulthood==\nIn 1536, Queen Anne fell from the king's favour and was beheaded. Elizabeth, like Mary, was declared illegitimate and stripped of her [[Second Succession Act|succession rights]].<ref>Whitelock, p. 91</ref> Within two weeks of Anne's execution, Henry married [[Jane Seymour]], who urged her husband to make peace with Mary.<ref>Porter, p. 121; Waller, p. 33; Whitelock, p. 81</ref> Henry insisted that Mary recognise him as head of the Church of England, repudiate [[papal authority]], acknowledge that the marriage between her parents was unlawful, and accept her own illegitimacy. She attempted to reconcile with him by submitting to his authority as far as \"God and my conscience\" permitted, but she was eventually bullied into signing a document agreeing to all of Henry's demands.<ref>Porter, pp. 119\u2013123; Waller, pp. 34\u201336; Whitelock, pp. 83\u201389</ref> Reconciled with her father, Mary resumed her place at court.<ref>Porter, pp. 119\u2013123; Waller, pp. 34\u201336; Whitelock, pp. 90\u201391</ref> Henry granted her a household (which included the reinstatement of Mary's favourite [[Susan Clarencieux]]).<ref>Loades, p. 105</ref> Mary's privy purse expenses for this period show that [[Hatfield House]], the [[Palace of Beaulieu]] (also called Newhall), [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] and [[Hunsdon]] were among her principal places of residence, as well as Henry's palaces at Greenwich, [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court]].<ref>Madden, F. (ed.) (1831) ''The Privy Purse Expenses of the Princess Mary'', quoted in Loades, p. 111</ref> Her expenses included fine clothes and gambling at cards, one of her favourite pastimes.<ref>Porter, pp. 129\u2013132; Whitelock, p. 28</ref> Rebels in the North of England, including Lord Hussey, Mary's former chamberlain, campaigned against Henry's religious reforms, and one of their demands was that Mary be made legitimate. The rebellion, known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], was ruthlessly suppressed.<ref>Porter, pp. 124\u2013125</ref> Along with other rebels, Hussey was executed, but there was no suggestion that Mary was directly involved.<ref>Loades, p. 108</ref> The following year, 1537, Jane died after giving birth to a son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]]. Mary was made godmother to her half-brother and acted as chief mourner at the queen's funeral.<ref>Loades, p. 114; Porter, pp. 126\u2013127; Whitelock, pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n[[File:Mary I by Master John.jpg|thumb|alt=Mary as a young woman|Mary in 1544]]\nMary was courted by [[Philip, Count Palatine|Duke Philip of Bavaria]] from late 1539, but he was [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and his suit for her hand was unsuccessful.<ref>Loades, pp. 127\u2013129; Porter, pp. 135\u2013136; Waller, p. 39; Whitelock, p. 101</ref> Over 1539, the king's chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], negotiated a potential alliance with the [[Duchy of Cleves]]. Suggestions that Mary marry the [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of Cleves]], who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister [[Anne of Cleves|Anne]] was agreed.<ref>Loades, pp. 126\u2013127; Whitelock, p. 101</ref> When the king saw Anne for the first time in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find himself attracted to her but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 103\u2013104</ref> Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against him was that he had plotted to marry Mary himself.<ref>Whitelock, p. 105</ref> Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 105\u2013106</ref>\n\nIn 1541, Henry had the Countess of Salisbury, Mary's old governess and godmother, executed on the pretext of a Catholic plot, in which her son ([[Reginald Pole]]) was implicated.<ref>Loades, p. 122; Porter, p. 137</ref> Her executioner was \"a wretched and blundering youth\" who \"literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces\".<ref>Contemporary Spanish and English reports, quoted in Whitelock, p. 108</ref> In 1542, following the execution of Henry's fifth wife, [[Catherine Howard]], the unmarried Henry invited Mary to attend the royal Christmas festivities.<ref>Porter, p. 143</ref> At court, while her father was between marriages and without a consort, Mary acted as hostess.<ref>Waller, p. 37</ref> In 1543, Henry married his sixth and last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], who was able to bring the family closer together.<ref>Porter, pp. 143\u2013144; Whitelock, p. 110</ref> Henry returned Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, through the [[Third Succession Act|Act of Succession 1544]], placing them after Edward. However, both remained legally illegitimate.<ref>Loades, p. 120; Waller, p. 39; Whitelock, p. 112</ref>\n\nHenry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary inherited estates in [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Essex]], and was granted [[Hunsdon]] and [[Palace of Beaulieu|Beaulieu]] as her own.<ref>Loades, pp. 137\u2013138; Whitelock, p. 130</ref> Since Edward was still a child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the [[Act of Uniformity 1549]] prescribed Protestant rites for church services, such as the use of [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s new ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practise her religion.<ref>Loades, pp. 143\u2013147; Porter, pp. 160\u2013162; Whitelock, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nFor most of Edward's reign, Mary remained on her own estates and rarely attended court.<ref>Porter, p. 154; Waller, p. 40</ref> A plan between May and July 1550 to smuggle her out of England to the safety of the European mainland came to nothing.<ref>Loades, pp. 153\u2013157; Porter, pp. 169\u2013176; Waller, pp. 41\u201342; Whitelock, pp. 144\u2013147</ref> Religious differences between Mary and Edward continued. When Mary was in her thirties, she attended a reunion with Edward and Elizabeth for Christmas 1550, where the 13-year-old Edward embarrassed Mary, and reduced both her and himself to tears in front of the court, by publicly reproving her for ignoring his laws regarding worship.<ref>Porter, p. 178; Whitelock, p. 149</ref> Mary repeatedly refused Edward's demands that she abandon Catholicism, and Edward persistently refused to drop his demands.<ref>Porter, pp. 179\u2013182; Whitelock, pp. 148\u2013160</ref>\n\n==Accession==\nOn 6 July 1553, at the age of 15, Edward VI died from a lung infection, possibly tuberculosis.<ref>Porter, p. 187</ref> He did not want the crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms as well as those of Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers, however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his half-sisters: he would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]], and perhaps others, Edward excluded both from the line of succession in his will.<ref>Porter, pp. 188\u2013189</ref>\n\nContradicting the [[Third Succession Act|Succession Act]], which restored Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, Edward named Dudley's daughter-in-law [[Lady Jane Grey]], the granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister, [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]], as his successor. Lady Jane's mother was [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]], Mary's cousin and goddaughter. Just before Edward VI's death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother. She was warned, however, that the summons was a pretext on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Lady Jane's accession to the throne.<ref>Waller, pp. 48\u201349; Whitelock, p. 165</ref> Therefore, instead of heading to London from her residence at Hunsdon, Mary fled into [[East Anglia]], where she owned extensive estates and Dudley had ruthlessly put down [[Kett's Rebellion]]. Many adherents to the Catholic faith, opponents of Dudley's, lived there.<ref>Waller, pp. 51\u201353; Whitelock, p. 165, 138</ref> On 9 July, from [[Kenninghall]], Norfolk, she wrote to the privy council with orders for her proclamation as Edward's successor.<ref>Loades, p. 176; Porter, p. 195; Tittler, pp. 8, 81\u201382; Whitelock, p. 168</ref>\n\nOn 10 July 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by Dudley and his supporters, and on the same day Mary's letter to the council arrived in London. By 12 July, Mary and her supporters had assembled a military force at [[Framlingham Castle]], Suffolk.<ref>Porter, p. 203; Waller, p. 52</ref> Dudley's support collapsed,<ref>Loades, pp. 176\u2013181; Porter, pp. 213\u2013214; Waller, p. 54; Whitelock, pp. 170\u2013174</ref> and Jane was deposed on 19 July.<ref>Porter, p. 210; Weir, pp. 159\u2013160</ref> She and Dudley were imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. Mary rode triumphantly into London on 3 August 1553, on a wave of popular support. She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth and a procession of over 800 nobles and gentlemen.<ref>Waller, pp. 57\u201359</ref>\n\nOne of Mary's first actions as queen was to order the release of the Roman Catholic [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] and [[Stephen Gardiner]] from imprisonment in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1553 creation)|Edward Courtenay]].<ref>Waller, p. 59; Whitelock, p. 181</ref> Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley's scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for [[high treason]] in the immediate aftermath of the coup. Lady Jane and her husband, [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], was released.<ref>Waller, pp. 59\u201360; Whitelock, pp. 185\u2013186</ref> Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Counsellors]] had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne.<ref>Whitelock, p. 182</ref> She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both [[Bishop of Winchester]] and [[Lord Chancellor]], offices he held until his death in November 1555.

Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, [[Philip II of Spain|Prince Philip of Spain]].<ref>Loades, pp. 199\u2013201; Porter, pp. 265\u2013267</ref> Philip had a [[Charles, Prince of Asturias|son]] from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World.

[[Thomas Wyatt the younger]] led a force from [[Kent]] to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as [[Wyatt's rebellion]], which also involved the [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]], the father of Lady Jane.<ref>Porter, pp. 288\u2013299; Whitelock, pp. 212\u2013213</ref> Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it.<ref>Porter, p. 300; Waller, pp. 74\u201375; Whitelock, p. 216</ref> On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband [[Guildford Dudley]] were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled.

Further, under the English common law doctrine of ''[[jure uxoris]]'', the property and titles belonging to a woman became her husband's upon marriage, and it was feared that any man she married would thereby become King of England in fact and in name.<ref>Waller, pp. 84\u201385; Whitelock, pp. 202, 227</ref> While Mary's grandparents, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]], had retained sovereignty of their own realms during their marriage, there was no precedent to follow in England.<ref>Porter, p. 269; Waller, p. 85</ref> Under the terms of [[Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain|Queen Mary's Marriage Act]], Philip was to be styled \"King of England\", all official documents (including [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]) were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple, for Mary's lifetime only. England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip's father in any war, and Philip could not act without his wife's consent or appoint foreigners to office in England.<ref>Porter, pp. 291\u2013292; Waller, p. 85; Whitelock, pp. 226\u2013227</ref> Philip was unhappy at the conditions imposed, but he was ready to agree for the sake of securing the marriage.<ref>Porter, pp. 308\u2013309; Whitelock, p. 229</ref> He had no amorous feelings toward Mary and sought the marriage for its political and strategic gains; Philip's aide [[Ruy G\u00f3mez de Silva]] wrote to a correspondent in Brussels, \"the marriage was concluded for no fleshly consideration, but in order to remedy the disorders of this kingdom and to preserve the [[Low Countries]].\"<ref>Letter of 29 July 1554 in the ''Calendar of State Papers, Spanish'', volume XIII, quoted in Porter, p. 320 and Whitelock, p. 244</ref>\n[[File:Felipe of Spain and MariaTudor.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Interior scene of the royal couple with Mary seated beneath a coat of arms and Philip stood beside her|Mary and her husband, Philip]]\nTo elevate his son to Mary's rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Philip the crown of Naples as well as his claim to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].

For these reasons, almost the entirety of her court, including her doctors, believed her to be pregnant.<ref>Porter, p. 333; Waller, pp. 92\u201393</ref> Parliament passed an [[Treason Act 1554|act making Philip regent]] in the event of Mary's death in childbirth.<ref>Loades, pp. 234\u2013235</ref> In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently.<ref>Porter, p. 338; Waller, p. 95; Whitelock, p. 255</ref> According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth,<ref>Waller, p. 96</ref> but in a letter to his brother-in-law, [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]], Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.<ref>\"The queen's pregnancy turns out not to have been as certain as we thought\": Letter of 25 April 1554, quoted in Porter, p. 337 and Whitelock, p. 257</ref>\n\nThanksgiving services in the [[diocese of London]] were held at the end of April after false rumours that Mary had given birth to a son spread across Europe.<ref>Waller, p. 95; Whitelock, p. 256</ref> Through May and June, the apparent delay in delivery fed gossip that Mary was not pregnant.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 257\u2013259</ref> [[Susan Clarencieux]] revealed her doubts to the French ambassador, [[Antoine de Noailles]].<ref>Whitelock, p. 258</ref> Mary continued to exhibit signs of pregnancy until July 1555, when her abdomen receded. Michieli dismissively ridiculed the pregnancy as more likely to \"end in wind rather than anything else\".<ref>Waller, p. 97; Whitelock, p. 259</ref> It was most likely a [[false pregnancy]], perhaps induced by Mary's overwhelming desire to have a child.<ref>Porter, pp. 337\u2013338; Waller, pp. 97\u201398</ref> In August, soon after the disgrace of the false pregnancy, which Mary considered to be \"God's punishment\" for her having \"tolerated [[Heresy|heretics]]\" in her realm,<ref>PBS Video</ref> Philip left England to command his armies against France in [[Flanders]].<ref>Porter, p. 342</ref> Mary was heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. Michieli was touched by the queen's grief; he wrote she was \"extraordinarily in love\" with her husband, and was disconsolate at his departure.<ref>Waller, pp. 98\u201399; Whitelock, p. 268</ref>\n\nElizabeth remained at court until October, apparently restored to favour.<ref>Antoine de Noailles quoted in Whitelock, p. 269</ref> In the absence of any children, Philip was concerned that one of the next claimants to the English throne after his sister-in-law was the [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen of Scots]], who was betrothed to the [[Francis II of France|Dauphin of France]]. Philip persuaded his wife that Elizabeth should marry his cousin [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]], to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to comply and parliamentary consent was unlikely.<ref>Whitelock, p. 284</ref>\n\n===Religious policy===\n[[File:1555 gold medal Queen Mary I of England.jpg|thumb|right|Gold medal showing Mary as \"Defender of the Faith\", 1555]]\n[[File:Mary1 by Eworth 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mary in an ornate dress|Mary by [[Hans Eworth]], 1554. She wears a jewelled pendant bearing a [[Mary Tudor pearl|pearl]] set beneath two diamonds.]]\nIn the month following her accession, Mary issued a proclamation that she would not compel any of her subjects to follow her religion, but by the end of September leading Protestant churchmen\u2014including [[John Bradford]], [[John Rogers (Bible editor and martyr)|John Rogers]], [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]], [[Hugh Latimer]], and [[Thomas Cranmer]]\u2014were imprisoned.<ref>Tittler, pp. 23\u201324; Whitelock, p. 187</ref> Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October 1553, declared the marriage of her parents valid and [[First Statute of Repeal|abolished Edward's religious laws]].<ref>Loades, pp. 207\u2013208; Waller, p. 65; Whitelock, p. 198</ref> Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]], which (among other things) re-affirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their [[benefice]]s.<ref>Porter, p. 241; Whitelock, pp. 200\u2013201</ref>\n\nMary had always rejected the break with Rome instituted by her father and the establishment of Protestantism by her brother's regents. Philip persuaded Parliament to [[Second Statute of Repeal|repeal Henry's religious laws]], thus returning the English church to Roman jurisdiction. Reaching an agreement took many months and Mary and [[Pope Julius III]] had to make a major concession: the monastery lands [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|confiscated under Henry]] were not returned to the church but remained in the hands of their influential new owners.<ref>Porter, p. 331</ref> By the end of 1554, the pope had approved the deal, and the [[Revival of the Heresy Acts|Heresy Acts were revived]].<ref>Loades, pp. 235\u2013242</ref>\n\nUnder the Heresy Acts, numerous Protestants were executed in the [[Marian persecutions]]. Around 800 rich Protestants, including [[John Foxe]], [[Marian exiles|chose exile]] instead.<ref>Waller, p. 113</ref> The first executions occurred over a period of five days in early February 1555: John Rogers on 4 February, [[Laurence Saunders]] on 8 February, and [[Rowland Taylor]] and John Hooper on 9 February.<ref>Whitelock, p. 262</ref> Thomas Cranmer, the imprisoned [[archbishop of Canterbury]], was forced to watch Bishops [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]] and [[Hugh Latimer|Latimer]] being [[burned at the stake]]. Cranmer recanted, repudiated Protestant theology, and rejoined the Catholic faith.<ref>Loades, p. 325; Porter, pp. 355\u2013356; Waller, pp. 104\u2013105</ref> Under the normal process of the law, he should have been absolved as a repentant. Mary, however, refused to reprieve him. On the day of his burning, he dramatically withdrew his recantation.<ref>Loades, p. 326; Waller, pp. 104\u2013105; Whitelock, p. 274</ref> In total, 283<!--Ridley and Waller say 283: 227 men and 56 women--> were executed, most by burning.<ref>Duffy, p. 79; Waller, p. 104</ref> The burnings proved so unpopular that even [[Alfonso de Castro]], one of Philip's own ecclesiastical staff, condemned them<ref>Porter, pp. 358\u2013359; Waller, p. 103; Whitelock, p. 266</ref> and another adviser, [[Simon Renard]], warned him that such \"cruel enforcement\" could \"cause a revolt\".<ref>Waller, p. 102</ref> Mary persevered with the policy, which continued until her death and exacerbated anti-Catholic and anti-Spanish feeling among the English people.<ref>Waller, pp. 101, 103, 105; Whitelock, p. 266</ref> The victims of the persecutions became lauded as [[List of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation|martyrs]].<ref>See for example, the [[Oxford Martyrs]]</ref>\n\n[[Reginald Pole]], the son of Mary's executed governess and once considered a suitor, arrived as papal legate in November 1554.<ref>Loades, p. 238; Waller, p. 94</ref> He was ordained a priest and appointed Archbishop of Canterbury immediately after Cranmer's execution in March 1556.<ref>Porter, p. 357</ref><ref>Although he was in deacon's orders and prominent in the church, Pole was not ordained until the day before his consecration as archbishop (Loades, p. 319).</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nFurthering the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]], under Mary and Philip's reign English colonists were settled in the [[Irish Midlands]]. [[County Laois|Queen's]] and [[County Offaly|King's Counties]] (now Counties Laois and Offaly) were founded, and their [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]] began.<ref>Tittler, p. 66</ref> Their principal towns were respectively named Maryborough (now [[Portlaoise]]) and Philipstown (now [[Daingean]]).\n\nIn January 1556, Mary's father-in-law abdicated. Mary and Philip were still apart; he was declared King of Spain in Brussels, but she stayed in England. Philip negotiated an unsteady truce with the French in February 1556. The following month, the French ambassador in England, [[Antoine de Noailles]], was implicated in a plot against Mary when Sir [[Henry Sutton Dudley|Henry Dudley]], a second cousin of the executed [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], attempted to assemble an invasion force in France. The plot, known as the Dudley conspiracy, was betrayed, and the conspirators in England were rounded up. Dudley remained in exile in France, and Noailles prudently left Britain.<ref>Porter, pp. 381\u2013387</ref>\n\nPhilip returned to England from March to July 1557 to persuade Mary to support Spain in a [[Italian War of 1551\u201359|renewed war against France]]. Mary was in favour of declaring war, but her councillors opposed it because French trade would be jeopardised, it contravened the marriage treaty, and a bad economic legacy from Edward VI's reign and a series of poor harvests meant England lacked supplies and finances.<ref>Whitelock, p. 288</ref> War was only declared in June 1557 after Reginald Pole's nephew, [[Thomas Stafford (rebel)|Thomas Stafford]], invaded England and seized [[Scarborough Castle]] with French help in a failed attempt to depose Mary.<ref>Porter, p. 389; Waller, p. 111; Whitelock, p. 289</ref> As a result of the war, relations between England and the Papacy became strained, since [[Pope Paul IV]] was allied with [[Henry II of France]].<ref>Whitelock, pp. 293\u2013295</ref> In August, English forces were victorious in the aftermath of the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of Saint Quentin]], with one eyewitness stating \"Both sides fought most choicely, and the English best of all.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/vol13/pp308-318|title=Spain: August 1557 {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> Celebrations however, were brief, as in January 1558 French forces [[Siege of Calais (1558)|took Calais]], England's sole remaining possession on the European mainland. Although the territory was financially burdensome, it was an ideological loss that damaged Mary's prestige.<ref>Loades, pp. 295\u2013297; Porter, pp. 392\u2013395; Whitelock, pp. 291\u2013292</ref> According to [[Holinshed's Chronicles]], Mary later lamented, \"When I am dead and opened, you shall find 'Calais' lying in my heart\", although this may be apocryphal.<ref>Porter, p. 393</ref>\n\n===Commerce and revenue===\n\n[[File:Post Medieval coin, Sixpence of Phillip and Mary (FindID 662681).jpg|thumb|Philip and Mary [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]]]]\n\nThe years of Mary's reign were consistently wet. The persistent rain and subsequent flooding led to famine.<ref>Porter, pp. 229, 375; Whitelock, p. 277</ref> Another problem was the decline of the [[Antwerp]] cloth trade.<ref>Tittler, p. 48</ref> Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]'s enormously lucrative trade with the [[Spanish Empire|New World]].<ref>Tittler, p. 49</ref> The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone [[smuggling|illicit trade]] or [[piracy]] against her husband.<ref>Tittler, pp. 49\u201350</ref> In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Northumberland]]'s policy of seeking out new commercial opportunities. She granted a [[royal charter]] to the [[Muscovy Company]], whose first governor was [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]],<ref>Porter, p. 371</ref> and commissioned a world atlas from [[Diogo Homem]].<ref>Porter, p. 373</ref> Adventurers such as [[John Lok]] and [[William Towerson]] sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa.<ref>Porter, p. 372</ref>\n\nFinancially, Mary's regime tried to reconcile a modern form of government\u2014with correspondingly higher spending\u2014with a medieval system of collecting taxation and dues.<ref>Porter, p. 375; Tittler, p. 51</ref> Mary retained the Edwardian appointee [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester]], as [[Lord High Treasurer]] and assigned him to oversee the revenue collection system. A failure to apply new [[tariff]]s to new forms of imports meant that a key source of revenue was neglected. To solve this problem, Mary's government published a revised \"Book of Rates\" (1558), which listed the tariffs and [[duty|duties]] for every import. This publication was not extensively reviewed until 1604.<ref>Porter, p. 376</ref>\n\nEnglish coinage was [[The Great Debasement|debased under both Henry VIII and Edward VI]]. Mary drafted plans for currency reform but they were not implemented until after her death.<ref>Porter, p. 376; Tittler, p. 53</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Mary1 by Eworth 3.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Hans Eworth]]]]\nAfter Philip's visit in 1557, Mary thought she was pregnant again, with a baby due in March 1558.<ref>Porter, p.398; Waller, pp. 106, 112; Whitelock, p. 299</ref> She decreed in her will that her husband would be the regent during the minority of their child.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 299\u2013300</ref> However, no child was born, and Mary was forced to accept that Elizabeth would be her lawful successor.<ref>Whitelock, p. 301</ref>\n\nMary was weak and ill from May 1558.<ref>Loades, p. 305; Whitelock, p. 300</ref> In pain, possibly from [[ovarian cyst]]s or [[uterine cancer]],<ref>Waller, p. 108</ref> she died on 17 November 1558, aged 42, at [[St James's Palace]], during an [[influenza]] epidemic that also claimed the life of [[Reginald Pole]] later the same day. She was succeeded by her half-sister Elizabeth. Philip, who was in Brussels, wrote to his sister [[Joan of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Joan]]: \"I felt a reasonable regret for her death.\"<ref>Letter from the King of Spain to the [[Joan of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Princess of Portugal]], 4 December 1558, in ''Calendar of State Papers, Spanish'', volume XIII, quoted in Loades, p. 311; Waller, p. 109 and Whitelock, p. 303</ref>\n\nAlthough Mary's will stated that she wished to be buried next to her mother, she was interred in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 14 December, in a tomb she would eventually share with Elizabeth. The Latin inscription on their tomb, ''Regno consortes et urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis'' (affixed there by [[James I of England|James I]] when he succeeded Elizabeth), translates to: \"Consorts in realm and tomb, we, sisters Elizabeth and Mary, here lie down to sleep in hope of resurrection.\"<ref>Porter, p. 410; Whitelock, p. 1</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{See also|Cultural depictions of Mary I of England}}\nAt her funeral service, [[John White (bishop)|John White]], [[bishop of Winchester]], praised Mary: \"She was a king's daughter; she was a king's sister; she was a king's wife. She was a queen, and by the same title a king also.\"<ref>Loades, p. 313; Whitelock, p. 305</ref> She was the first woman to successfully claim the throne of England, despite competing claims and determined opposition, and enjoyed popular support and sympathy during the earliest parts of her reign, especially from the Roman Catholics of England.<ref>Waller, p. 116</ref> \n\nMary's attempts to undo the reforming work of her brother's reign faced major obstacles. Despite her belief in the papal supremacy, she ruled constitutionally as the Supreme Head of the English Church, a contradiction under which she bridled.<ref>Elton (1977) pp. 378, 383</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}} She found herself entirely unable to restore the vast number of ecclesiastical properties handed over or sold to private landowners.<ref>Elton (1962) pp. 216\u2013219</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nProtestant writers at the time, and since, have often taken a highly negative view of Mary's reign. By the 17th century, the memory of her religious persecutions had led to the adoption of her [[sobriquet]] \"Bloody Mary\".<ref>Waller, p. 115</ref> [[John Knox]] attacked her in his ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women|First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]'' (1558), and she was prominently vilified in ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (1563), by [[John Foxe]]. Subsequent editions of Foxe's book remained popular throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant.<ref>Porter, pp. 361\u2013362, 418; Waller, pp. 113\u2013115</ref>\n\nMary is remembered in the 21st century for her vigorous efforts to restore the primacy of Roman Catholicism in England after the rise of Protestant influence during the short-lived reign of her half-brother, Edward. Protestant historians have long denigrated her reign, emphasizing that in just five years she burned several hundred Protestants at the stake in the [[Marian persecutions]]. In the mid-20th century, [[H. F. M. Prescott]] attempted to redress the tradition that Mary was intolerant and authoritarian, and scholarship since then has tended to view the older, simpler assessments of Mary with increasing reservations.<ref>Weikel</ref> A historiographical revisionism since the 1980s has to some degree improved her reputation among scholars.<ref>Loades, David (1989). \"The Reign of Mary Tudor: Historiography and Research.\" ''Albion'' '''21''' (4) : 547\u2013558.

Failed harvests increased public discontent.<ref>Loades, pp. 340\u2013343</ref> Philip spent most of his time abroad, while his wife remained in England, leaving her depressed at his absence and undermined by their inability to have children. After Mary's death, Philip sought to marry Elizabeth but she refused him.<ref>Porter, p. 400</ref> Although Mary's rule was ultimately ineffectual and unpopular, the policies of fiscal reform, naval expansion, and colonial exploration that were later lauded as Elizabethan accomplishments were started in Mary's reign.<ref>Tittler, p. 80; Weikel</ref>\n\n==Titles, style, and arms==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of England (1554-1558).svg|thumb|Arms of Mary I, [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] with [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|those of her husband]], Philip II of Spain|alt=Shield bearing many quarterings held between a black eagle and a lion and surmounted by a crowned helm]]\n\nWhen Mary ascended the throne, she was proclaimed under the same official style as Henry VIII and Edward VI: \"Mary, [[by the Grace of God]], [[List of English monarchs|Queen of England]], [[British claims to the French throne|France]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]], and of the [[Church of England]] and of [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]] on Earth Supreme Head\". The title Supreme Head of the Church was repugnant to Mary's Catholicism, and she omitted it after Christmas 1553.<ref>Loades, pp. 217, 323</ref>\n\nUnder Mary's marriage treaty with Philip, the official joint style reflected not only Mary's but also Philip's dominions and claims: \"Philip and Mary, by the grace of God, King and Queen of England, France, [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of Spain and [[Sicily]], [[Archduke]]s of [[Austria]], Dukes of [[Rulers of Milan|Milan]], [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Duke of Brabant|Brabant]], Counts of [[Habsburg]], [[Count of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]\".<ref name=waller90/> This style, which had been in use since 1554, was replaced when Philip inherited the Spanish Crown in 1556 with \"Philip and Mary, by the Grace of God King and Queen of England, Spain, France, both the Sicilies, Jerusalem and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Burgundy, Milan and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tyrol\".<ref>e.g. Waller, p. 106</ref>\n\nMary I's [[heraldry|coat of arms]] was the same as those used by all her predecessors since [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]: [[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]], [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] three [[fleurs-de-lys]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] [for France] and [[Gules]] three lions [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant guardant]] in [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]] Or ([[Royal Arms of England|for England]]).

She is best known for her vigorous attempt to reverse the [[English Reformation]], which had begun during the reign of her father, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Her attempt to restore to the Church the property confiscated in the previous two reigns was largely thwarted by parliament, but during her five-year reign, Mary had over 280<!--estimates vary but all say over 280--> religious dissenters [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] in the [[Marian persecutions]], which led to her denunciation as \"'''Bloody Mary'''\" by her [[Protestant]] opponents.\n\nMary was the only child of Henry VIII by his first wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], to survive to adulthood. Her younger half-brother [[Edward VI]] succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine. When Edward became mortally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he supposed, correctly, that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had begun during his reign. Upon his death, leading politicians proclaimed [[Lady Jane Grey]] as queen. Mary speedily assembled a force in [[East Anglia]] and deposed Jane, who was ultimately beheaded. Mary was\u2014excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the [[Empress Matilda]]\u2014the first [[queen regnant]] of England. In 1554, Mary married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], becoming [[queen consort]] of [[Habsburg Spain]] on his accession in 1556.\n\nAfter Mary's death in 1558, her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism was [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|reversed]] by her younger half-sister and successor, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n==Birth and family==\nMary was born on 18 February 1516 at the [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich, England]]. She was the only child of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] and his first wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] to survive infancy. Her mother had suffered many miscarriages.<ref>Waller, p. 16; Whitelock, p. 9</ref> Before Mary's birth, four previous pregnancies had resulted in a [[stillborn]] daughter and three short-lived or stillborn sons, including [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]].<ref>Loades, pp. 12\u201313; Weir, pp. 152\u2013153</ref> \n\nMary was baptised into the Catholic faith at the Church of the Observant Friars in Greenwich three days after her birth.<ref>Porter, p. 13; Waller, p. 16; Whitelock, p. 7</ref> Her godparents included [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Wolsey]]; her great-aunt [[Catherine of York|Catherine of York, Countess of Devon]]; and [[Agnes Howard, Duchess of Norfolk]].<ref>Porter, pp. 13, 37; Waller, p. 17</ref> Henry VIII's cousin once removed, [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]], stood sponsor for Mary's [[confirmation]], which was held immediately after the baptism.<ref>Porter, p. 13; Waller, p. 17; Whitelock, p. 7</ref> The following year, Mary became a godmother herself when she was named as one of the sponsors of her cousin [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]].<ref>Loades, p. 28; Porter, p. 15</ref> In 1520, the Countess of Salisbury was appointed Mary's [[governess]].<ref>Loades, p. 29; Porter, p. 16; Waller, p. 20; Whitelock, p. 21</ref> [[John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford|Sir John Hussey]], later Lord Hussey, was her [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] from 1530, and his wife, Lady Anne, daughter of [[George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent]], was one of Mary's attendants.<ref>Hoyle, p. 407</ref>\n\n==Education and early marriage plans==\n[[File:Mary Tudor by Horenbout.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mary as a snub-nosed girl with red hair|Mary at the time of her engagement to Charles V. She is wearing a rectangular brooch inscribed with \"The Emperour\".<ref>Whitelock, p. 23</ref>]]\n\nMary was a precocious child.<ref>Whitelock, p. 27</ref> In July 1520, when scarcely four and a half years old, she entertained a visiting French delegation with a performance on the [[virginals]] (a type of [[harpsichord]]).<ref>Loades, pp. 19\u201320; Porter, p. 21</ref> A great part of her early education came from her mother, who consulted the Spanish [[humanism|humanist]] [[Juan Luis Vives]] for advice and commissioned him to write ''De Institutione Feminae Christianae'', a treatise on the education of girls.<ref>Loades, p. 31; Porter, p. 30</ref> By the age of nine, Mary could read and write Latin.<ref>Porter, p. 28; Whitelock, p. 27</ref> She studied French, Spanish, music, dance, and perhaps Greek.<ref>Loades, pp. 32, 43</ref> Henry VIII doted on his daughter and boasted to the Venetian ambassador Sebastian Giustiniani, \"This girl never cries\".<ref>''Domine Orator, per Deum immortalem, ista puella nunquam plorat'', quoted in Whitelock, p. 17</ref> Also, as the miniature portrait of her shows, Mary had, like both her parents, a very fair complexion, pale blue eyes and red or reddish-golden hair. She was also ruddy-cheeked, a trait she inherited from her father.<ref>Giles Tremlett, \"Catherine of Aragon, Henry's Spanish Queen\" p.244</ref>\n\nDespite his affection for Mary, Henry was deeply disappointed that his marriage had produced no sons.<ref>Tittler, p. 1</ref> By the time Mary was nine years old, it was apparent that Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir.<ref>Loades, p. 37; Porter, pp. 38\u201339; Whitelock, pp. 32\u201333</ref> In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of [[Wales]] to preside, presumably in name only, over the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]].<ref>Porter, pp. 38\u201339; Whitelock, pp. 32\u201333</ref> She was given her own [[Court (royal)|court]] based at [[Ludlow Castle]] and many of the [[royal prerogative]]s normally reserved for the [[Prince of Wales]]. Vives and others called her the [[Princess of Wales]], although she was never technically invested with the title.<ref>Waller, p. 23</ref> She appears to have spent three years in the [[Welsh Marches]], making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the [[home counties]] around London in mid-1528.<ref>Loades, pp. 41\u201342, 45</ref>\n\nThroughout Mary's childhood, Henry negotiated potential future marriages for her. When she was only two years old, she was promised to [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]], the infant son of [[King Francis I of France]], but the contract was repudiated after three years.<ref>Porter, pp. 20\u201321; Waller, pp. 20\u201321; Whitelock, pp. 18\u201323</ref> In 1522, at the age of six, she was instead contracted to marry her 22-year-old first cousin, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].<ref>Loades, pp. 22\u201323; Porter, pp. 21\u201324; Waller, p. 21; Whitelock, p. 23</ref> However, the engagement was broken off within a few years by Charles with Henry's agreement.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 30\u201331</ref> [[Cardinal Wolsey]], Henry's chief adviser, then resumed marriage negotiations with the French, and Henry suggested that Mary marry the Dauphin's father, King Francis I himself, who was eager for an alliance with England.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 36\u201337</ref> A marriage treaty was signed which provided that Mary marry either Francis I or his second son [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orleans]],<ref>Whitelock, pp. 37\u201338</ref> but Wolsey secured an alliance with France without the marriage. In 1528 Wolsey's agent [[Thomas Magnus]] discusses the idea of her marriage to [[James V of Scotland]] with the Scottish diplomat [[Adam Otterburn]].<ref>''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 4 part IV (London, 1836), p. 545.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Mario Savorgnano, by this time Mary was developing into a pretty, well-proportioned young lady with a fine complexion.<ref>Mario Savorgnano, 25 August 1531, ''Calendar of State Papers, Venetian'', vol. IV, p. 682, quoted in Loades, p. 63</ref>\n\n==Adolescence==\nMeanwhile, the marriage of Mary's parents was in jeopardy. Disappointed at the lack of a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine [[annulment|annulled]], but [[Pope Clement VII]] refused his request. Henry claimed, citing biblical passages ([[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 20:21), that his marriage to Catherine was unclean because she was the widow of his brother [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]] (Mary's uncle). Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never [[consummate]]d and so was not a valid marriage. Her first marriage had been annulled by a previous pope, [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]], on that basis. Clement may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had [[Sack of Rome (1527)|surrounded and occupied Rome]] in the [[War of the League of Cognac]].<ref>Porter, pp. 56, 78; Whitelock, p. 40</ref>\n\nFrom 1531, Mary was often sick with irregular menstruation and depression, although it is not clear whether this was caused by stress, puberty or a more deep-seated disease.<ref>Waller, p. 27</ref> She was not permitted to see her mother, who had been sent to live away from court by Henry.<ref>Porter, p. 76; Whitelock, p. 48</ref> In early 1533, Henry married [[Anne Boleyn]], who was pregnant with his child, and in May [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], formally declared the marriage with Catherine void, and the marriage to Anne valid. Henry repudiated the authority of the Pope, declaring himself Supreme Head of the [[Church of England]]. Catherine was demoted to Dowager Princess of Wales (a title she would have held as the widow of Arthur), and Mary was deemed illegitimate. She was styled \"The Lady Mary\" rather than Princess, and her place in the line of succession was transferred to her newborn half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], Anne's daughter.<ref>Porter, p. 92; Whitelock, pp. 55\u201356</ref> Mary's own household was dissolved;<ref>Loades, p. 77; Porter, p. 92; Whitelock, p. 57</ref> her servants (including the Countess of Salisbury) were dismissed and in December 1533 she was sent to join the household of the infant Elizabeth at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]].<ref>Loades, p. 78; Whitelock, p. 57</ref>\n\nMary determinedly refused to acknowledge that Anne was the queen or that Elizabeth was a princess, further enraging King Henry.<ref>Porter, pp. 97\u2013101; Whitelock, pp. 55\u201369</ref> Under strain and with her movements restricted, Mary was frequently ill, which the royal physician attributed to her \"ill treatment\".<ref>Dr [[William Butts]], quoted in Waller, p. 31</ref> The Imperial ambassador [[Eustace Chapuys]] became her close adviser, and interceded, unsuccessfully, on her behalf at court.<ref>Loades, pp. 84\u201385</ref> The relationship between Mary and her father worsened; they did not speak to each other for three years.<ref>Porter, p. 100</ref> Although both she and her mother were ill, Mary was refused permission to visit Catherine.<ref>Porter, pp. 103\u2013104; Whitelock, pp. 67\u201369, 72</ref> When Catherine died in 1536, Mary was \"inconsolable\".<ref>Letter from Emperor Charles V to [[Isabella of Portugal|Empress Isabella]], quoted in Whitelock, p. 75</ref> Catherine was interred in [[Peterborough Cathedral]], while Mary grieved in semi-seclusion at [[Hunsdon]] in Hertfordshire.<ref>Porter, p. 107; Whitelock, p. 76\u201377</ref>\n\n==Adulthood==\nIn 1536, Queen Anne fell from the king's favour and was beheaded. Elizabeth, like Mary, was declared illegitimate and stripped of her [[Second Succession Act|succession rights]].<ref>Whitelock, p. 91</ref> Within two weeks of Anne's execution, Henry married [[Jane Seymour]], who urged her husband to make peace with Mary.<ref>Porter, p. 121; Waller, p. 33; Whitelock, p. 81</ref> Henry insisted that Mary recognise him as head of the Church of England, repudiate [[papal authority]], acknowledge that the marriage between her parents was unlawful, and accept her own illegitimacy. She attempted to reconcile with him by submitting to his authority as far as \"God and my conscience\" permitted, but she was eventually bullied into signing a document agreeing to all of Henry's demands.<ref>Porter, pp. 119\u2013123; Waller, pp. 34\u201336; Whitelock, pp. 83\u201389</ref> Reconciled with her father, Mary resumed her place at court.<ref>Porter, pp. 119\u2013123; Waller, pp. 34\u201336; Whitelock, pp. 90\u201391</ref> Henry granted her a household (which included the reinstatement of Mary's favourite [[Susan Clarencieux]]).<ref>Loades, p. 105</ref> Mary's privy purse expenses for this period show that [[Hatfield House]], the [[Palace of Beaulieu]] (also called Newhall), [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] and [[Hunsdon]] were among her principal places of residence, as well as Henry's palaces at Greenwich, [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court]].<ref>Madden, F. (ed.) (1831) ''The Privy Purse Expenses of the Princess Mary'', quoted in Loades, p. 111</ref> Her expenses included fine clothes and gambling at cards, one of her favourite pastimes.<ref>Porter, pp. 129\u2013132; Whitelock, p. 28</ref> Rebels in the North of England, including Lord Hussey, Mary's former chamberlain, campaigned against Henry's religious reforms, and one of their demands was that Mary be made legitimate. The rebellion, known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], was ruthlessly suppressed.<ref>Porter, pp. 124\u2013125</ref> Along with other rebels, Hussey was executed, but there was no suggestion that Mary was directly involved.<ref>Loades, p. 108</ref> The following year, 1537, Jane died after giving birth to a son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]]. Mary was made godmother to her half-brother and acted as chief mourner at the queen's funeral.<ref>Loades, p. 114; Porter, pp. 126\u2013127; Whitelock, pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n[[File:Mary I by Master John.jpg|thumb|alt=Mary as a young woman|Mary in 1544]]\nMary was courted by [[Philip, Count Palatine|Duke Philip of Bavaria]] from late 1539, but he was [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and his suit for her hand was unsuccessful.<ref>Loades, pp. 127\u2013129; Porter, pp. 135\u2013136; Waller, p. 39; Whitelock, p. 101</ref> Over 1539, the king's chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], negotiated a potential alliance with the [[Duchy of Cleves]]. Suggestions that Mary marry the [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of Cleves]], who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister [[Anne of Cleves|Anne]] was agreed.<ref>Loades, pp. 126\u2013127; Whitelock, p. 101</ref> When the king saw Anne for the first time in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find himself attracted to her but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 103\u2013104</ref> Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against him was that he had plotted to marry Mary himself.<ref>Whitelock, p. 105</ref> Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 105\u2013106</ref>\n\nIn 1541, Henry had the Countess of Salisbury, Mary's old governess and godmother, executed on the pretext of a Catholic plot, in which her son ([[Reginald Pole]]) was implicated.<ref>Loades, p. 122; Porter, p. 137</ref> Her executioner was \"a wretched and blundering youth\" who \"literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces\".<ref>Contemporary Spanish and English reports, quoted in Whitelock, p. 108</ref> In 1542, following the execution of Henry's fifth wife, [[Catherine Howard]], the unmarried Henry invited Mary to attend the royal Christmas festivities.<ref>Porter, p. 143</ref> At court, while her father was between marriages and without a consort, Mary acted as hostess.<ref>Waller, p. 37</ref> In 1543, Henry married his sixth and last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], who was able to bring the family closer together.<ref>Porter, pp. 143\u2013144; Whitelock, p. 110</ref> Henry returned Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, through the [[Third Succession Act|Act of Succession 1544]], placing them after Edward. However, both remained legally illegitimate.<ref>Loades, p. 120; Waller, p. 39; Whitelock, p. 112</ref>\n\nHenry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary inherited estates in [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Essex]], and was granted [[Hunsdon]] and [[Palace of Beaulieu|Beaulieu]] as her own.<ref>Loades, pp. 137\u2013138; Whitelock, p. 130</ref> Since Edward was still a child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the [[Act of Uniformity 1549]] prescribed Protestant rites for church services, such as the use of [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s new ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practise her religion.<ref>Loades, pp. 143\u2013147; Porter, pp. 160\u2013162; Whitelock, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nFor most of Edward's reign, Mary remained on her own estates and rarely attended court.<ref>Porter, p. 154; Waller, p. 40</ref> A plan between May and July 1550 to smuggle her out of England to the safety of the European mainland came to nothing.<ref>Loades, pp. 153\u2013157; Porter, pp. 169\u2013176; Waller, pp. 41\u201342; Whitelock, pp. 144\u2013147</ref> Religious differences between Mary and Edward continued. When Mary was in her thirties, she attended a reunion with Edward and Elizabeth for Christmas 1550, where the 13-year-old Edward embarrassed Mary, and reduced both her and himself to tears in front of the court, by publicly reproving her for ignoring his laws regarding worship.<ref>Porter, p. 178; Whitelock, p. 149</ref> Mary repeatedly refused Edward's demands that she abandon Catholicism, and Edward persistently refused to drop his demands.<ref>Porter, pp. 179\u2013182; Whitelock, pp. 148\u2013160</ref>\n\n==Accession==\nOn 6 July 1553, at the age of 15, Edward VI died from a lung infection, possibly tuberculosis.<ref>Porter, p. 187</ref> He did not want the crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms as well as those of Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers, however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his half-sisters: he would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]], and perhaps others, Edward excluded both from the line of succession in his will.<ref>Porter, pp. 188\u2013189</ref>\n\nContradicting the [[Third Succession Act|Succession Act]], which restored Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, Edward named Dudley's daughter-in-law [[Lady Jane Grey]], the granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister, [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]], as his successor. Lady Jane's mother was [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]], Mary's cousin and goddaughter. Just before Edward VI's death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother. She was warned, however, that the summons was a pretext on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Lady Jane's accession to the throne.<ref>Waller, pp. 48\u201349; Whitelock, p. 165</ref> Therefore, instead of heading to London from her residence at Hunsdon, Mary fled into [[East Anglia]], where she owned extensive estates and Dudley had ruthlessly put down [[Kett's Rebellion]]. Many adherents to the Catholic faith, opponents of Dudley's, lived there.<ref>Waller, pp. 51\u201353; Whitelock, p. 165, 138</ref> On 9 July, from [[Kenninghall]], Norfolk, she wrote to the privy council with orders for her proclamation as Edward's successor.<ref>Loades, p. 176; Porter, p. 195; Tittler, pp. 8, 81\u201382; Whitelock, p. 168</ref>\n\nOn 10 July 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by Dudley and his supporters, and on the same day Mary's letter to the council arrived in London. By 12 July, Mary and her supporters had assembled a military force at [[Framlingham Castle]], Suffolk.<ref>Porter, p. 203; Waller, p. 52</ref> Dudley's support collapsed,<ref>Loades, pp. 176\u2013181; Porter, pp. 213\u2013214; Waller, p. 54; Whitelock, pp. 170\u2013174</ref> and Jane was deposed on 19 July.<ref>Porter, p. 210; Weir, pp. 159\u2013160</ref> She and Dudley were imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. Mary rode triumphantly into London on 3 August 1553, on a wave of popular support. She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth and a procession of over 800 nobles and gentlemen.<ref>Waller, pp. 57\u201359</ref>\n\nOne of Mary's first actions as queen was to order the release of the Roman Catholic [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] and [[Stephen Gardiner]] from imprisonment in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1553 creation)|Edward Courtenay]].<ref>Waller, p. 59; Whitelock, p. 181</ref> Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley's scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for [[high treason]] in the immediate aftermath of the coup. Lady Jane and her husband, [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], was released.<ref>Waller, pp. 59\u201360; Whitelock, pp. 185\u2013186</ref> Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Counsellors]] had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne.<ref>Whitelock, p. 182</ref> She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both [[Bishop of Winchester]] and [[Lord Chancellor]], offices he held until his death in November 1555. [[Susan Clarencieux]] became [[Mistress of the Robes]].<ref>Whitelock, p. 183</ref> On 1 October 1553, Gardiner [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] Mary at [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Porter, pp. 257\u2013261; Whitelock, pp. 195\u2013197</ref>\n\n===Spanish marriage===\n[[File:Philip II.jpg|thumb|right|Philip of Spain by [[Titian]]]]\nAt age 37, Mary turned her attention to finding a husband and producing an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line under the terms of [[Henry VIII's will]] and the [[Act of Succession of 1544]]) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, [[Philip II of Spain|Prince Philip of Spain]].<ref>Loades, pp. 199\u2013201; Porter, pp. 265\u2013267</ref> Philip had a [[Charles, Prince of Asturias|son]] from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by [[Titian]], was sent to her in the latter half of 1553.<ref>Porter, p. 310</ref>\n\nLord Chancellor Gardiner and the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] unsuccessfully petitioned her to consider marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would be relegated to a dependency of the [[Habsburg]]s.<ref>Porter, pp. 279\u2013284; Waller, p. 72; Whitelock, pp. 202\u2013209</ref> The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner and his allies opposed it on the basis of patriotism, while Protestants were motivated by a fear of Catholicism.<ref>Waller, p. 73</ref> When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out. [[Thomas Wyatt the younger]] led a force from [[Kent]] to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as [[Wyatt's rebellion]], which also involved the [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]], the father of Lady Jane.<ref>Porter, pp. 288\u2013299; Whitelock, pp. 212\u2013213</ref> Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it.<ref>Porter, p. 300; Waller, pp. 74\u201375; Whitelock, p. 216</ref> On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband [[Guildford Dudley]] were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled. Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then was put under house arrest at [[Woodstock Palace]].<ref>Porter, pp. 311\u2013313; Whitelock, pp. 217\u2013225</ref>\n\nMary was\u2014excluding the brief, disputed reigns of the [[Empress Matilda]] and Lady Jane Grey\u2014England's first [[queen regnant]]. Further, under the English common law doctrine of ''[[jure uxoris]]'', the property and titles belonging to a woman became her husband's upon marriage, and it was feared that any man she married would thereby become King of England in fact and in name.<ref>Waller, pp. 84\u201385; Whitelock, pp. 202, 227</ref> While Mary's grandparents, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]], had retained sovereignty of their own realms during their marriage, there was no precedent to follow in England.<ref>Porter, p. 269; Waller, p. 85</ref> Under the terms of [[Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain|Queen Mary's Marriage Act]], Philip was to be styled \"King of England\", all official documents (including [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]) were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple, for Mary's lifetime only. England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip's father in any war, and Philip could not act without his wife's consent or appoint foreigners to office in England.<ref>Porter, pp. 291\u2013292; Waller, p. 85; Whitelock, pp. 226\u2013227</ref> Philip was unhappy at the conditions imposed, but he was ready to agree for the sake of securing the marriage.<ref>Porter, pp. 308\u2013309; Whitelock, p. 229</ref> He had no amorous feelings toward Mary and sought the marriage for its political and strategic gains; Philip's aide [[Ruy G\u00f3mez de Silva]] wrote to a correspondent in Brussels, \"the marriage was concluded for no fleshly consideration, but in order to remedy the disorders of this kingdom and to preserve the [[Low Countries]].\"<ref>Letter of 29 July 1554 in the ''Calendar of State Papers, Spanish'', volume XIII, quoted in Porter, p. 320 and Whitelock, p. 244</ref>\n[[File:Felipe of Spain and MariaTudor.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Interior scene of the royal couple with Mary seated beneath a coat of arms and Philip stood beside her|Mary and her husband, Philip]]\nTo elevate his son to Mary's rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Philip the crown of Naples as well as his claim to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].

She gained weight, and felt nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the entirety of her court, including her doctors, believed her to be pregnant.<ref>Porter, p. 333; Waller, pp. 92\u201393</ref> Parliament passed an [[Treason Act 1554|act making Philip regent]] in the event of Mary's death in childbirth.<ref>Loades, pp. 234\u2013235</ref> In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently.<ref>Porter, p. 338; Waller, p. 95; Whitelock, p. 255</ref> According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth,<ref>Waller, p. 96</ref> but in a letter to his brother-in-law, [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]], Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.<ref>\"The queen's pregnancy turns out not to have been as certain as we thought\": Letter of 25 April 1554, quoted in Porter, p. 337 and Whitelock, p. 257</ref>\n\nThanksgiving services in the [[diocese of London]] were held at the end of April after false rumours that Mary had given birth to a son spread across Europe.<ref>Waller, p. 95; Whitelock, p. 256</ref> Through May and June, the apparent delay in delivery fed gossip that Mary was not pregnant.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 257\u2013259</ref> [[Susan Clarencieux]] revealed her doubts to the French ambassador, [[Antoine de Noailles]].<ref>Whitelock, p. 258</ref> Mary continued to exhibit signs of pregnancy until July 1555, when her abdomen receded. Michieli dismissively ridiculed the pregnancy as more likely to \"end in wind rather than anything else\".<ref>Waller, p. 97; Whitelock, p. 259</ref> It was most likely a [[false pregnancy]], perhaps induced by Mary's overwhelming desire to have a child.<ref>Porter, pp. 337\u2013338; Waller, pp. 97\u201398</ref> In August, soon after the disgrace of the false pregnancy, which Mary considered to be \"God's punishment\" for her having \"tolerated [[Heresy|heretics]]\" in her realm,<ref>PBS Video</ref> Philip left England to command his armies against France in [[Flanders]].<ref>Porter, p. 342</ref> Mary was heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. Michieli was touched by the queen's grief; he wrote she was \"extraordinarily in love\" with her husband, and was disconsolate at his departure.<ref>Waller, pp. 98\u201399; Whitelock, p. 268</ref>\n\nElizabeth remained at court until October, apparently restored to favour.<ref>Antoine de Noailles quoted in Whitelock, p. 269</ref> In the absence of any children, Philip was concerned that one of the next claimants to the English throne after his sister-in-law was the [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen of Scots]], who was betrothed to the [[Francis II of France|Dauphin of France]]. Philip persuaded his wife that Elizabeth should marry his cousin [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]], to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to comply and parliamentary consent was unlikely.<ref>Whitelock, p. 284</ref>\n\n===Religious policy===\n[[File:1555 gold medal Queen Mary I of England.jpg|thumb|right|Gold medal showing Mary as \"Defender of the Faith\", 1555]]\n[[File:Mary1 by Eworth 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mary in an ornate dress|Mary by [[Hans Eworth]], 1554. She wears a jewelled pendant bearing a [[Mary Tudor pearl|pearl]] set beneath two diamonds.]]\nIn the month following her accession, Mary issued a proclamation that she would not compel any of her subjects to follow her religion, but by the end of September leading Protestant churchmen\u2014including [[John Bradford]], [[John Rogers (Bible editor and martyr)|John Rogers]], [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]], [[Hugh Latimer]], and [[Thomas Cranmer]]\u2014were imprisoned.<ref>Tittler, pp. 23\u201324; Whitelock, p. 187</ref> Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October 1553, declared the marriage of her parents valid and [[First Statute of Repeal|abolished Edward's religious laws]].<ref>Loades, pp. 207\u2013208; Waller, p. 65; Whitelock, p. 198</ref> Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]], which (among other things) re-affirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their [[benefice]]s.<ref>Porter, p. 241; Whitelock, pp. 200\u2013201</ref>\n\nMary had always rejected the break with Rome instituted by her father and the establishment of Protestantism by her brother's regents. Philip persuaded Parliament to [[Second Statute of Repeal|repeal Henry's religious laws]], thus returning the English church to Roman jurisdiction. Reaching an agreement took many months and Mary and [[Pope Julius III]] had to make a major concession: the monastery lands [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|confiscated under Henry]] were not returned to the church but remained in the hands of their influential new owners.<ref>Porter, p. 331</ref> By the end of 1554, the pope had approved the deal, and the [[Revival of the Heresy Acts|Heresy Acts were revived]].<ref>Loades, pp. 235\u2013242</ref>\n\nUnder the Heresy Acts, numerous Protestants were executed in the [[Marian persecutions]]. Around 800 rich Protestants, including [[John Foxe]], [[Marian exiles|chose exile]] instead.<ref>Waller, p. 113</ref> The first executions occurred over a period of five days in early February 1555: John Rogers on 4 February, [[Laurence Saunders]] on 8 February, and [[Rowland Taylor]] and John Hooper on 9 February.<ref>Whitelock, p. 262</ref> Thomas Cranmer, the imprisoned [[archbishop of Canterbury]], was forced to watch Bishops [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]] and [[Hugh Latimer|Latimer]] being [[burned at the stake]]. Cranmer recanted, repudiated Protestant theology, and rejoined the Catholic faith.<ref>Loades, p. 325; Porter, pp. 355\u2013356; Waller, pp. 104\u2013105</ref> Under the normal process of the law, he should have been absolved as a repentant. Mary, however, refused to reprieve him. On the day of his burning, he dramatically withdrew his recantation.<ref>Loades, p. 326; Waller, pp. 104\u2013105; Whitelock, p. 274</ref> In total, 283<!--Ridley and Waller say 283: 227 men and 56 women--> were executed, most by burning.<ref>Duffy, p. 79; Waller, p. 104</ref> The burnings proved so unpopular that even [[Alfonso de Castro]], one of Philip's own ecclesiastical staff, condemned them<ref>Porter, pp. 358\u2013359; Waller, p. 103; Whitelock, p. 266</ref> and another adviser, [[Simon Renard]], warned him that such \"cruel enforcement\" could \"cause a revolt\".<ref>Waller, p. 102</ref> Mary persevered with the policy, which continued until her death and exacerbated anti-Catholic and anti-Spanish feeling among the English people.<ref>Waller, pp. 101, 103, 105; Whitelock, p. 266</ref> The victims of the persecutions became lauded as [[List of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation|martyrs]].<ref>See for example, the [[Oxford Martyrs]]</ref>\n\n[[Reginald Pole]], the son of Mary's executed governess and once considered a suitor, arrived as papal legate in November 1554.<ref>Loades, p. 238; Waller, p. 94</ref> He was ordained a priest and appointed Archbishop of Canterbury immediately after Cranmer's execution in March 1556.<ref>Porter, p. 357</ref><ref>Although he was in deacon's orders and prominent in the church, Pole was not ordained until the day before his consecration as archbishop (Loades, p. 319).</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nFurthering the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]], under Mary and Philip's reign English colonists were settled in the [[Irish Midlands]]. [[County Laois|Queen's]] and [[County Offaly|King's Counties]] (now Counties Laois and Offaly) were founded, and their [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]] began.<ref>Tittler, p. 66</ref> Their principal towns were respectively named Maryborough (now [[Portlaoise]]) and Philipstown (now [[Daingean]]).\n\nIn January 1556, Mary's father-in-law abdicated. Mary and Philip were still apart; he was declared King of Spain in Brussels, but she stayed in England. Philip negotiated an unsteady truce with the French in February 1556. The following month, the French ambassador in England, [[Antoine de Noailles]], was implicated in a plot against Mary when Sir [[Henry Sutton Dudley|Henry Dudley]], a second cousin of the executed [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], attempted to assemble an invasion force in France. The plot, known as the Dudley conspiracy, was betrayed, and the conspirators in England were rounded up. Dudley remained in exile in France, and Noailles prudently left Britain.<ref>Porter, pp. 381\u2013387</ref>\n\nPhilip returned to England from March to July 1557 to persuade Mary to support Spain in a [[Italian War of 1551\u201359|renewed war against France]]. Mary was in favour of declaring war, but her councillors opposed it because French trade would be jeopardised, it contravened the marriage treaty, and a bad economic legacy from Edward VI's reign and a series of poor harvests meant England lacked supplies and finances.<ref>Whitelock, p. 288</ref> War was only declared in June 1557 after Reginald Pole's nephew, [[Thomas Stafford (rebel)|Thomas Stafford]], invaded England and seized [[Scarborough Castle]] with French help in a failed attempt to depose Mary.<ref>Porter, p. 389; Waller, p. 111; Whitelock, p. 289</ref> As a result of the war, relations between England and the Papacy became strained, since [[Pope Paul IV]] was allied with [[Henry II of France]].<ref>Whitelock, pp. 293\u2013295</ref> In August, English forces were victorious in the aftermath of the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of Saint Quentin]], with one eyewitness stating \"Both sides fought most choicely, and the English best of all.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/vol13/pp308-318|title=Spain: August 1557 {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> Celebrations however, were brief, as in January 1558 French forces [[Siege of Calais (1558)|took Calais]], England's sole remaining possession on the European mainland. Although the territory was financially burdensome, it was an ideological loss that damaged Mary's prestige.<ref>Loades, pp. 295\u2013297; Porter, pp. 392\u2013395; Whitelock, pp. 291\u2013292</ref> According to [[Holinshed's Chronicles]], Mary later lamented, \"When I am dead and opened, you shall find 'Calais' lying in my heart\", although this may be apocryphal.<ref>Porter, p. 393</ref>\n\n===Commerce and revenue===\n\n[[File:Post Medieval coin, Sixpence of Phillip and Mary (FindID 662681).jpg|thumb|Philip and Mary [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]]]]\n\nThe years of Mary's reign were consistently wet. The persistent rain and subsequent flooding led to famine.<ref>Porter, pp. 229, 375; Whitelock, p. 277</ref> Another problem was the decline of the [[Antwerp]] cloth trade.<ref>Tittler, p. 48</ref> Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]'s enormously lucrative trade with the [[Spanish Empire|New World]].<ref>Tittler, p. 49</ref> The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone [[smuggling|illicit trade]] or [[piracy]] against her husband.<ref>Tittler, pp. 49\u201350</ref> In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Northumberland]]'s policy of seeking out new commercial opportunities. She granted a [[royal charter]] to the [[Muscovy Company]], whose first governor was [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]],<ref>Porter, p. 371</ref> and commissioned a world atlas from [[Diogo Homem]].<ref>Porter, p. 373</ref> Adventurers such as [[John Lok]] and [[William Towerson]] sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa.<ref>Porter, p. 372</ref>\n\nFinancially, Mary's regime tried to reconcile a modern form of government\u2014with correspondingly higher spending\u2014with a medieval system of collecting taxation and dues.<ref>Porter, p. 375; Tittler, p. 51</ref> Mary retained the Edwardian appointee [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester]], as [[Lord High Treasurer]] and assigned him to oversee the revenue collection system. A failure to apply new [[tariff]]s to new forms of imports meant that a key source of revenue was neglected. To solve this problem, Mary's government published a revised \"Book of Rates\" (1558), which listed the tariffs and [[duty|duties]] for every import. This publication was not extensively reviewed until 1604.<ref>Porter, p. 376</ref>\n\nEnglish coinage was [[The Great Debasement|debased under both Henry VIII and Edward VI]]. Mary drafted plans for currency reform but they were not implemented until after her death.<ref>Porter, p. 376; Tittler, p. 53</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Mary1 by Eworth 3.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Hans Eworth]]]]\nAfter Philip's visit in 1557, Mary thought she was pregnant again, with a baby due in March 1558.<ref>Porter, p.398; Waller, pp. 106, 112; Whitelock, p. 299</ref> She decreed in her will that her husband would be the regent during the minority of their child.<ref>Whitelock, pp. 299\u2013300</ref> However, no child was born, and Mary was forced to accept that Elizabeth would be her lawful successor.<ref>Whitelock, p. 301</ref>\n\nMary was weak and ill from May 1558.<ref>Loades, p. 305; Whitelock, p. 300</ref> In pain, possibly from [[ovarian cyst]]s or [[uterine cancer]],<ref>Waller, p. 108</ref> she died on 17 November 1558, aged 42, at [[St James's Palace]], during an [[influenza]] epidemic that also claimed the life of [[Reginald Pole]] later the same day. She was succeeded by her half-sister Elizabeth.

The Latin inscription on their tomb, ''Regno consortes et urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis'' (affixed there by [[James I of England|James I]] when he succeeded Elizabeth), translates to: \"Consorts in realm and tomb, we, sisters Elizabeth and Mary, here lie down to sleep in hope of resurrection.\"<ref>Porter, p. 410; Whitelock, p. 1</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{See also|Cultural depictions of Mary I of England}}\nAt her funeral service, [[John White (bishop)|John White]], [[bishop of Winchester]], praised Mary: \"She was a king's daughter; she was a king's sister; she was a king's wife.

By the 17th century, the memory of her religious persecutions had led to the adoption of her [[sobriquet]] \"Bloody Mary\".<ref>Waller, p. 115</ref> [[John Knox]] attacked her in his ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women|First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]'' (1558), and she was prominently vilified in ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (1563), by [[John Foxe]]. Subsequent editions of Foxe's book remained popular throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant.<ref>Porter, pp. 361\u2013362, 418; Waller, pp. 113\u2013115</ref>\n\nMary is remembered in the 21st century for her vigorous efforts to restore the primacy of Roman Catholicism in England after the rise of Protestant influence during the short-lived reign of her half-brother, Edward. Protestant historians have long denigrated her reign, emphasizing that in just five years she burned several hundred Protestants at the stake in the [[Marian persecutions]]. In the mid-20th century, [[H. F. M. Prescott]] attempted to redress the tradition that Mary was intolerant and authoritarian, and scholarship since then has tended to view the older, simpler assessments of Mary with increasing reservations.<ref>Weikel</ref> A historiographical revisionism since the 1980s has to some degree improved her reputation among scholars.<ref>Loades, David (1989). \"The Reign of Mary Tudor: Historiography and Research.\" ''Albion'' '''21''' (4) : 547\u2013558.

Failed harvests increased public discontent.<ref>Loades, pp. 340\u2013343</ref> Philip spent most of his time abroad, while his wife remained in England, leaving her depressed at his absence and undermined by their inability to have children. After Mary's death, Philip sought to marry Elizabeth but she refused him.<ref>Porter, p. 400</ref> Although Mary's rule was ultimately ineffectual and unpopular, the policies of fiscal reform, naval expansion, and colonial exploration that were later lauded as Elizabethan accomplishments were started in Mary's reign.<ref>Tittler, p. 80; Weikel</ref>\n\n==Titles, style, and arms==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of England (1554-1558).svg|thumb|Arms of Mary I, [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] with [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|those of her husband]], Philip II of Spain|alt=Shield bearing many quarterings held between a black eagle and a lion and surmounted by a crowned helm]]\n\nWhen Mary ascended the throne, she was proclaimed under the same official style as Henry VIII and Edward VI: \"Mary, [[by the Grace of God]], [[List of English monarchs|Queen of England]], [[British claims to the French throne|France]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]], and of the [[Church of England]] and of [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]] on Earth Supreme Head\". The title Supreme Head of the Church was repugnant to Mary's Catholicism, and she omitted it after Christmas 1553.<ref>Loades, pp. 217, 323</ref>\n\nUnder Mary's marriage treaty with Philip, the official joint style reflected not only Mary's but also Philip's dominions and claims: \"Philip and Mary, by the grace of God, King and Queen of England, France, [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of Spain and [[Sicily]], [[Archduke]]s of [[Austria]], Dukes of [[Rulers of Milan|Milan]], [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Duke of Brabant|Brabant]], Counts of [[Habsburg]], [[Count of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]\".<ref name=waller90/> This style, which had been in use since 1554, was replaced when Philip inherited the Spanish Crown in 1556 with \"Philip and Mary, by the Grace of God King and Queen of England, Spain, France, both the Sicilies, Jerusalem and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Burgundy, Milan and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tyrol\".<ref>e.g. Waller, p. 106</ref>\n\nMary I's [[heraldry|coat of arms]] was the same as those used by all her predecessors since [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]: [[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]], [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] three [[fleurs-de-lys]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] [for France] and [[Gules]] three lions [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant guardant]] in [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]] Or ([[Royal Arms of England|for England]]). Sometimes, her arms were [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] (depicted side-by-side) with [[Coat of arms of Spain|those of her husband]]. She adopted \"Truth, the Daughter of Time\" ({{lang-la|Veritas Temporis Filia}}) as her personal motto.<ref>Waller, p. 60; Whitelock, p. 310</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\nBoth Mary and Philip were descended from [[John of Gaunt]], the Duke of Lancaster, a relationship that was used to portray Philip as an English king.<ref>Whitelock, p. 242</ref> They descended from Lancaster and his first two wives: [[Blanche of Lancaster]] (grandmother of [[John, Constable of Portugal]]) and [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance of Castile]] (mother of [[Catherine of Lancaster]]).
