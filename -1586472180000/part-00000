Elements of the character's personality were inspired by the [[fennec fox]], including its trickiness, stealthiness, maneuverability, and ability to survive. The fox also influenced the design of Fennec's costume and hairstyle. Costume designer Joseph Porro incorporated orange accents into Fennec's black costume, and Wen recommended the character's hair include braids inspired by the fennec fox.\n\nFennec Shand has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike, and has been described as a fan favorite. Several reviewers felt the character was eliminated too quickly and did not get the chance to live up to her potential.

I was talking a lot about it with Dave and Jon, and just really liked that idea, that she's this assassin and that she's tricky and yet she's able to maneuver and survive and be stealth. And very, very graceful and agile. I just loved that whole image with the name. And whether that's her real name or her nickname because of it, it just started spawning all these ideas.}}</ref> Anthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' noted the fennec fox is a particularly appropriate model for the character because, like Fennec Shand, it is both predator and prey.
