The original books were also made into an [[OVA]], [[animated cartoon|animated feature-length films]], [[anime]], and comic.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Kaiketsu Zorori characters}}\n\nSet in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji'''''|\u304b\u3044\u3051\u3064\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u305f\u3044\u3058||\"The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer\"}} and has published about two issues per year, totaling 50 issues as of December 2011. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] on January 4, 2010. \n\nZorori was originally a villain for the series {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3||\"Spinach Man\"}} written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when H\u014drens\u014d Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u3086\u3046\u308c\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046||\"Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle\"}} (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, \"Zorori Castle Part 2\" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Y\u014dkai Gakk\u014d no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the H\u014drens\u014d Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.\n\nUsing clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult [[kanji]] or any [[furigana]], instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school \"children's book\", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).\n\nAt the time of publication, '''{{nihongo|''The Zorori League''|\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0|Zororiigu}}''' and '''{{nihongo|''Stupid Monster''|\u30dc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Bokeetto Monsutaa}}''' (a play on [[Pok\u00e9mon]]) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.\n\nFurthermore, the Spanish word for fox is \"zorro\", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble [[Zorro]].\n\n==List of volumes==\nThe first Zorori book was released in November 1987 and has seen two releases per year ever since. The first 39 volumes have been used as source material for the anime, while volumes 40 and beyond are book only, due to being printed after the anime's cancellation. \n{{Graphic novel list/header\n |

Out of desperation he eats an entire room filled with garlic, leaving him with a terrible smell.

An officer comes by and tells him the toy plane was stolen and the boars said they took it by mistake. They run from the police and end up on Money's plane, but partway through the flight the plane has engine trouble and crashes into a snowy mountain. Zorori builds a new plane from the remains and they fly off. They are low on gas when a red plane comes out of nowhere and points them to a nearby city. The red plane quickly vanishes and they get Money back home safely. Zorori is left wondering if the pilot was his father.

The original books were also made into an [[OVA]], [[animated cartoon|animated feature-length films]], [[anime]], and comic.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Kaiketsu Zorori characters}}\n\nSet in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji'''''|\u304b\u3044\u3051\u3064\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u305f\u3044\u3058||\"The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer\"}} and has published about two issues per year, totaling 50 issues as of December 2011. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] on January 4, 2010. \n\nZorori was originally a villain for the series {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3||\"Spinach Man\"}} written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when H\u014drens\u014d Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u3086\u3046\u308c\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046||\"Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle\"}} (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, \"Zorori Castle Part 2\" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Y\u014dkai Gakk\u014d no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the H\u014drens\u014d Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.\n\nUsing clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult [[kanji]] or any [[furigana]], instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school \"children's book\", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).\n\nAt the time of publication, '''{{nihongo|''The Zorori League''|\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0|Zororiigu}}''' and '''{{nihongo|''Stupid Monster''|\u30dc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Bokeetto Monsutaa}}''' (a play on [[Pok\u00e9mon]]) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.\n\nFurthermore, the Spanish word for fox is \"zorro\", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble [[Zorro]].\n\n==List of volumes==\nThe first Zorori book was released in November 1987 and has seen two releases per year ever since. The first 39 volumes have been used as source material for the anime, while volumes 40 and beyond are book only, due to being printed after the anime's cancellation. \n{{Graphic novel list/header\n |

Out of desperation he eats an entire room filled with garlic, leaving him with a terrible smell.

An officer comes by and tells him the toy plane was stolen and the boars said they took it by mistake. They run from the police and end up on Money's plane, but partway through the flight the plane has engine trouble and crashes into a snowy mountain. Zorori builds a new plane from the remains and they fly off. They are low on gas when a red plane comes out of nowhere and points them to a nearby city. The red plane quickly vanishes and they get Money back home safely. Zorori is left wondering if the pilot was his father.

His intermittent episcopacy spanned 45 years (c. 8 June 328 \u2013 2 May 373), of which over 17 encompassed five exiles, when he was replaced on the order of four different [[Roman emperors]]. Athanasius was a [[Christian theologian]], a [[Church Father]], the chief defender of [[Trinitarianism]] against [[Arianism]], and a noted [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]ian leader of the fourth century.\n\nConflict with [[Arius]] and Arianism as well as successive Roman emperors shaped Athanasius' career. In 325, at the age of 27, Athanasius began his leading role against the Arians as a deacon and assistant to Bishop [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]] during the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]] had convened the council in May\u2013August 325 to address the Arian position that the [[Son of God]], [[Jesus of Nazareth]], is of a distinct substance from the Father.<ref name=\"CC\">[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. ''Caesar and Christ''. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972.</ref> Three years after that council, Athanasius succeeded his mentor as archbishop of Alexandria. In addition to the conflict with the Arians (including powerful and influential Arian churchmen led by [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]]), he struggled against the Emperors Constantine, [[Constantius II]], [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] and [[Valens]]. He was known as '''''Athanasius Contra Mundum''''' (Latin for ''Athanasius Against the World'').\n\nNonetheless, within a few years after his death, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] called him the \"Pillar of the Church\". His writings were well regarded by all following Church fathers in the West and the East, who noted their rich devotion to the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word-become-man]], great pastoral concern and profound interest in monasticism. Athanasius is counted as one of the four great Eastern [[Doctors of the Church]] in the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"Doctors\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05075a.htm Chapman, John. \"Doctors of the Church\". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 December 2015</ref> In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], he is labeled as the \"Father of Orthodoxy\". Athanasius is the first person to identify the same 27 books of the New Testament that are in use today. He is venerated as a Christian [[saint]], whose [[feast day]] is 2 May in [[Western Christianity]], 15 May in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], and 18 January in the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. He is venerated by the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Catholic Church, the Lutheran churches, and the Anglican Communion.\n\nThe Council of Nicaea (325), \"passed twenty disciplinary canons for the better government of the Church. By one, C. 6, of these the Bishops of [[Bishop of Rome|Rome]], Alexandria, and [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], were declared to possess jurisdiction over the Churches in their respective provinces\". Hence, the Alexandrian Bishop was declared with the authority of Patriarch. <ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:2896 - Catania - Cattedrale - G. Nicoli - S.

The earlier date is sometimes assigned due to the maturity revealed in his two earliest treatises ''Contra Gentes'' (''Against the Heathens'') and ''De Incarnatione'' (''On the Incarnation''), which were admittedly written about the year 318 before Arianism had begun to make itself felt, as those writings do not show an awareness of Arianism.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nHowever Cornelius Clifford places his birth no earlier than 296 and no later than 298, based on the fact that Athanasius indicates no first hand recollection of the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Maximian persecution]] of 303, which he suggests Athanasius would have remembered if he had been ten years old at the time. Secondly, the ''Festal Epistles'' state that the Arians had accused Athanasius, among other charges, of not having yet attained the canonical age (30) and thus could not have been properly ordained as Patriarch of Alexandria in 328.

After questioning Athanasius, Bishop Alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine, as both the [[Sacramental matter and form|form and matter of the sacrament]] had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water, and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly [[Catechesis|catechized]]. He invited Athanasius and his playfellows to prepare for clerical careers.<ref name=\"Clifford1930\"/>\n\n[[Alexandria]] was the most important trade center in the whole empire during Athanasius's boyhood.

His successor as bishop of Alexandria was [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]] (312\u2013328). According to [[Sozomen]]; \"the Bishop Alexander 'invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen' \".(Soz., II, xvii) <ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nAthanasius' earliest work, ''Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation'' (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting [[Plato]] and using a definition from [[Aristotle]]'s ''Organon'') but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of [[Neo-Platonism]]. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes [[Homer]] more than once (''Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29''). In his letter to [[Constantius II|Emperor Constantius]], he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of [[Demosthenes]] ''de Corona''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:Athanasius Frederikskirken.JPG|thumb|upright|''St. Athanasius'' (1883\u201384), by [[Carl Rohl-Smith]], [[Frederik's Church]], [[Copenhagen, Denmark]].|alt=]]\nAthanasius knew [[Greek language|Greek]] and admitted not knowing [[Hebrew]] [see, e.g., the 39th Festal Letter of St. Athan.].

He was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him. The clergy and people were determined to have him as their bishop, Patriarch of Alexandria, and refused to accept any excuses. He at length consented to accept a responsibility that he sought in vain to escape, and was consecrated in 326, when he was about thirty years of age.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">T.

Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nDuring his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] and [[Libya in the Roman era|Libya]]. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including [[Pachomius]], which proved very valuable to him over the years. <ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\n\"During the forty-eight years of his episcopate, his history is told in the history of the controversies in which he was constantly engaged with the Arians, and of the sufferings he had to endure in defence of the Nicene faith. \nWe have seen that when Arius was allowed to return from exile in 328, Athanasius refused to remove the sentence of excommunication.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> \n\n====First exile====\nAthanasius' first problem lay with [[Meletius of Lycopolis]] and his followers, who had failed to abide by the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. That council also [[anathematized]] Arius. Accused of mistreating Arians and Meletians, Athanasius answered those charges at a gathering of bishops in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], the [[First Synod of Tyre]], in 335. There, [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] and other supporters of Arius deposed Athanasius.<ref name=\"EA\"/> On 6 November, both sides of the dispute met with Emperor [[Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].<ref>Barnes, Timothy D., ''Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1993), 23</ref> At that meeting, the Arians claimed Athanasius would try to cut off essential Egyptian grain supplies to Constantinople.

'Within a few weeks he set out for Rome to lay his case before the Church at large. He had made his appeal to Pope Julius, who took up his cause with whole-heartedness that never wavered down to the day of that holy pontiff's death.

During this time, [[Gregory of Cappadocia]] was installed as the Patriarch of Alexandria, usurping the absent Athanasius. Athanasius did, however, remain in contact with his people through his annual ''Festal Letters'', in which he also announced on which date [[Easter]] would be celebrated that year.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nIn 339 or 340, nearly one hundred bishops met at Alexandria, declared in favor of Athanasius,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_VJAwAAQBAJ&lpg=RA1-PA50&dq=athanasius%20alexandria%20council%20340&pg=RA1-PA47#v=onepage&q=339%20or%20340&f=false | title=A History of the Councils of the Church: from the Original Documents, to the close of the Second Council of Nicaea A.D. 787 | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | author=Clark, William R. | year=2007 | page=47 | isbn=9781556352478}}</ref> and vigorously rejected the criticisms of the Eusebian faction at Tyre.

They even produced Arsenius' severed hand.<ref name=\"Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999\"/>).<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nThe Council was convoked for the purpose of inquiring into the charges against Athanasius and other bishops, on account of which they were deposed from their sees by the Semi-Arian Synod of Antioch (341), and went into exile. It was called according to Socrates, (E. H. ii. 20) by the two Emperors, Constans and Constantius; but, according to Baronius by Pope Julius (337\u2013352), (Ad an. 343). One hundred and seventy six attended. Eusebian bishops objected to the admission of Athanasius and other deposed bishops to the Council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them. Their objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops, about a hundred were orthodox, who were the majority. The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to Philoppopolis in Thrace, [[Philippopolis (Thracia)]], where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the Synod of Antioch.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAthanasius' innocence was reaffirmed at the [[Council of Serdica]]. Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the Council was made known. Meanwhile, the Eusebian party had gone to Philippopolis, where they issued an anathema against Athanasius and his supporters. The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and Constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. Orders were given that if Athanasius attempted to re-enter his see, he should be put to death. Athanasius, accordingly, withdrew from [[Serdica]] to [[Naissus]] in Mysia, where he celebrated the Easter festival of the year 344.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/> It was Hosius who presided over the [[Council of Serdica]], as he did for the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which like the 341 synod, found Athanasius innocent.<ref name=\"EB1878\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/athanasius|title=St. Athanasius - Christian Classics Ethereal Library - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org|language=en|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref> &.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> He celebrated his last Easter in exile in [[Aquileia]] in April 345, received by bishop Fortunatianus.<ref>Barnes, Timothy David, ''Athanasius and Constantius'', Harvard 2001, p. 66</ref>\n\nEastern Bishop [[Gregory of Cappadocia]] died, probably of violence in June of 345. (Gregory, an Arian bishop, had taken over the See of Alexandria.) The emissary to the Emperor Constantius sent by the bishops of the [[Council of Serdica]] to report the finding of the Council, who had been met at first with most insulting treatment, now received a favourable hearing. Constantius was forced to reconsider his decision, owing to a threatening letter from his brother Constans and the uncertain conditions of affairs on the Persian border, and he accordingly made up his mind to yield. But three separate letters were needed to overcome the natural hesitation of Athanasius. He passed rapidly from [[Aquileia]] to [[Treves]], from Treves to Rome and from Rome by way of the northern route to Adrianople, [[Edirne]], and Antioch, [[Ankara]], where he met Constantius. He was accorded a gracious interview by the Emperor, and sent back to his See in triumph, and began his memorable ten years of peace, which lasted to the third exile, 356.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nPope Julius died in April 352, and was succeeded by [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]]. For two years Liberius had been favourable to the cause of Athanasius; but driven at last into exile, he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula, from which the great Nicene text, the \"homoousion\", had been studiously omitted. In 355 a council was held at Milan, where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops, a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world. With his friends scattered, Hosius in exile, and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies, Athanasius could hardly hope to escape. On the night of 8 February 356, while engaged in services in the Church of St. Thomas, a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest. It was the beginning of his third exile.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nT. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: By Constantius' order, the sole ruler of The Roman Empire at the death of his brother Constans, the [[Council of Arles (353)|Council of Arles in 353]], was held, which was presided over by Vincent, Bishop of [[Capua]], in the name of Pope Liberius. The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius. The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated. To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control the Council in Milan.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThree hundred bishops assembled in Milan, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355. They met in the Church of Milan. Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death. All, with the exception of [[Dionysius (bishop of Milan)]], and the two Papal Legates, viz., [[Eusebius of Vercelli]] and [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius. Those who refused were sent into exile. The decrees were forwarded to the Pope for approval, but were rejected, because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Third exile====\n[[File:Saint Athanasius.jpg|thumb|Athanasius at the Council of Nicea, [[William of Tyre]] manuscripts.|alt=]]\nThrough the influence of the Eusebian faction at Constantinople, an Arian bishop, [[George of Cappadocia]], was now appointed to rule the see of Alexandria. Athanasius, after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city, finally withdrew into the desert of [[Upper Egypt]], where he remained for a period of six years, living the life of the monks, devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings; \"Apology to Constantius\", the \"Apology for his Flight\", the \"Letter to the Monks\", and the \"History of the Arians\".<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nConstantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service.<ref>Graves, Dan.

Retrieved 8 March 2016.</ref> Athanasius fled to [[Upper Egypt]], where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work ''Four Orations against the Arians'' and defended his own recent conduct in the ''Apology to Constantius'' and ''Apology for His Flight''. Constantius' persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop [[George of Laodicea]], prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional ''History of the Arians'', in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the [[Antichrist]].<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nConstantius ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to [[Stara Zagora|Beroea]], in Thrace. He sent expensive presents if he were to accept the Arian position, which Liberius refused. He sent him five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" which Liberius refused, saying he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where in a conference recorded by Theodore, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Serdica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nLiberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at [[Sirmium]]. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Niceae]], as Theodoret testifies. ([[Theodoret]], Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.).<ref>Butler, Albin, Butler's Lives of The Saints 1860, Volume 1</ref> The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed.<ref name=\"Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999\"/> Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nT. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII:\n<blockquote>The Arians sought the approval of an Ecumenical Council. They sought to hold two councils. Constantius, summoned the bishops of the East to meet at [[Seleucia in Isauria]], and those of the West to [[Rimini]] in Italy. A preliminary conference was held by the Arians at [[Sirmium]], to agree a formula of faith. A \"Homoeon\" creed was adopted, declaring The Son to be \"like the Father\". The two met in autumn of 359. At Seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of which one hundred and five were semi-Arian. The semi-Arians refused to accept anything less than the \"Homoiousion\", (see: [[Homoiousian]]), formulary of faith. The Imperial Prefect was obliged to disband, without agreeing on any creed.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/></blockquote>\n\nAcacius, the leader of the \"Homoean\" party went to Constantinople, where the Sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the \"Home Synod\", (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the Court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-Arians. At Rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were Arian, the rest were orthodox. The orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the Nicene, while the others were equally in favour of the Sirmian. Each party sent a deputation to the Emperor to say there was no probability to agreement, and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses. For the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops; (Sulpitius Severius says), Constantius delayed his answer for several months, and finally prevailed on them to accept the Sirmian creed. It was after this Council that [[Jerome]] said: \" ...the whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself Arian.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe Arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents. The Emperor Constantius, who had been the cause of so much trouble, died on 4 November 361 and was succeeded by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]. The proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant Arian faction in Alexandria. George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered. An obscure presbyter of the name of Pistus was immediately chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope. An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the \"Galileans\" to return to their \"towns and provinces\". Athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 February 362.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nIn 362 he convened a council at Alexandria, and presided over it with [[Eusebius of Vercelli]]. Athanasius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in Christianity, even if they differed on matters of terminology. This prepared the groundwork for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. However, the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the human soul of Christ, and Christ's divinity. Mild measures were agreed on for those heretic bishops who repented, but severe penance was decreed for the chief leaders of the major heresies.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Alexandria}}</ref>\n\nWith characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty. To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies. In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the \"Chronicon Athanasianum\" (XXXV) as a \"philosopher\", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\n====Fourth exile====\n\nIn 362, the new Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], noted for his opposition to Christianity, ordered Athanasius to leave Alexandria once again. Athanasius left for [[Upper Egypt]], remaining there with the [[Desert Fathers]] until Julian's death on 26 June 363. Athanasius returned in secret to Alexandria, where he soon received a document from the new emperor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], reinstating him once more in his episcopal functions.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nHis first act was to convene a council which reaffirmed the terms of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Early in September 363 he set out for [[Antioch on the Orontes]], bearing a synodal letter, in which the pronouncements of this council had been embodied. At Antioch he had an interview with the new emperor, who received him graciously and even asked him to prepare an exposition of the orthodox faith. The following February Jovian died; and in October, 364, Athanasius was once more an exile.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\n====Fifth exile====\n\nTwo years later, the Emperor [[Valens]], who favored the Arian position, in his turn exiled Athanasius. This time Athanasius simply left for the outskirts of Alexandria, where he stayed for only a few months before the local authorities convinced Valens to retract his order of exile.<ref name=\"EB\"/> Some early reports state that Athanasius spent this period of exile at his family's ancestral tomb<ref name=\"EA\"/> in a Christian cemetery. It was during this period, the final exile, that he is said to have spent four months in hiding in his father's tomb. (Soz., \"Hist. Eccl.\", VI, xii; Soc., \"Hist. Eccl.\", IV, xii).<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nThe accession of Valens gave a fresh lease of life to the Arian party. He issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by Constantius, but who had been permitted by Jovian to return to their sees. The news created the greatest consternation in the city of Alexandria itself, and the prefect, in order to prevent a serious outbreak, gave public assurance that the very special case of Athanasius would be laid before the emperor. But Athanasius seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him. He quietly withdrew from Alexandria, 5 October, and took up his abode in a country house outside the city. Valens, who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak, within a few weeks issued orders allowing Athanasius to return to his [[episcopal see]].<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nIn 366 Pope Liberius died and was succeeded by Pope Damasus, a man of strong character and holy life. Two years later, in a council of the Church, it was decreed that no Bishop should be consecrated unless he held the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Nicea]]. (F. A. Forbes).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Final years and death====\nAfter returning to Alexandria in early 366, Athanasius spent his final years repairing all the damage done during the earlier years of violence, dissent, and exile. He resumed writing and preaching undisturbed, and characteristically re-emphasized the view of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] which had been defined at [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]]. On 2 May 373, having consecrated [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter II]], one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters.<ref name=\"Clifford1930\" />\n\n== Works ==\nIn [[Coptic literature]], Athanasius is the first patriarch of Alexandria to use [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as well as Greek in his writings.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Coptic literature |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026215/Coptic-literature |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Polemical and theological works ===\nAthanasius was not a speculative theologian. As he stated in his ''First Letters to Serapion'', he held on to \"the tradition, teaching, and faith proclaimed by the apostles and guarded by the fathers.\"<ref name=\"EA\"/> He held that not only was the Son of God [[consubstantiality|consubstantial]] with the Father, but so was the [[Holy Spirit]], which had a great deal of influence in the development of later doctrines regarding the Trinity.<ref name=\"EA\"/>\n\nAthanasius' ''\"Letter Concerning the Decrees of the Council of Nicaea\"'' (''De Decretis''), is an important historical as well as theological account of the proceedings of that council, and another letter from 367 is the first known listing of all those books now accepted as the New Testament.<ref name=\"EA\"/> ([[Development of the New Testament canon|Earlier similar lists]] vary by the omission or addition of a few books.)\n\nExamples of Athanasius' polemical writings against his theological opponents include ''Orations Against the Arians'', his defence of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]] (''Letters to Serapion'' in the 360s, and ''On the Holy Spirit''), against [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonianism]] and ''On the Incarnation''.\n\nAthanasius also authored a two-part work, ''Against the Heathen'' and ''The Incarnation of the Word of God''. Completed probably early in his life, before the Arian controversy,<ref>Justo L. Gonzalez in ''A History of Christian Thought'' notes (p. 292) that E. Schwartz places this work later, around 335, but \"his arguments have not been generally accepted\". The introduction to the CSMV translation of ''On the Incarnation'' places the work in 318, around the time Athanasius was ordained to the diaconate (''St Athanasius On the Incarnation'', Mowbray, England 1953)</ref> they constitute the first classic work of developed Orthodox theology. In the first part, Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs. The second part presents teachings on the redemption.<ref name=\"EA\"/> Also in these books, Athanasius put forward the belief, referencing {{bibleref2|John|1:1\u20134}}, that the [[Son of God]], the eternal Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) through whom God created the world, entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away.\n\nHis other important works include his ''Letters to Serapion'', which defends the [[divinity]] of the [[Holy Spirit]]. In a letter to Epictetus of Corinth, Athanasius anticipates future controversies in his defense of the humanity of Christ. Another of his letters, to Dracontius, urges that monk to leave the desert for the more active duties of a bishop.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nAthanasius also wrote several works of [[Biblical exegesis]], primarily on [[Old Testament]] materials. The most important of these is his ''Epistle to Marcellinus'' (PG 27:12\u201345) on how to incorporate Psalm saying into one's spiritual practice. Excerpts remain of his discussions concerning the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Song of Solomon]], and [[Psalms]].\n\nPerhaps his most notable letter was his Festal Letter, written to his Church in Alexandria when he was in exile, as he could not be in their presence.  This letter clearly shows his stand that accepting Jesus as the Divine Son of God is not optional but necessary: {{quote|I know moreover that not only this thing saddens you, but also the fact that while others have obtained the churches by violence, you are meanwhile cast out from your places. For they hold the places, but you the Apostolic Faith. They are, it is true, in the places, but outside of the true Faith; while you are outside the places indeed, but the Faith, within you.

The establishment of the canon was not a unilateral decision by a bishop in Alexandria, but the result of a process of careful investigation and deliberation, as documented in a codex of the Greek Bible and, twenty-seven years later, in his festal letter.<ref name=Thiede/>\n\n[[Pope Damasus I]], the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] in 382, promulgated a list of books which contained a New Testament canon identical to that of Athanasius. A [[Synod of Hippo|synod in Hippo]] in 393 repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' New Testament list (without the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]), and the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' complete New Testament list.<ref>Von Dehsen, Christian.

M. Forbes' research and reference to [[Pope Gregory I]]'s writings, it would appear that Athanasius was constrained to be Bishop: She writes that when the Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made Bishop. \"When the Bishops of the Church assembled to elect their new Patriarch, the whole Catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to Heaven and crying; \"Give us Athanasius!\" The Bishops had nothing better. Athanasius was thus elected, as Gregory tells us...\" ([[Pope Gregory I]], would have full access to the Vatican Archives).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlban Butler, writes on the subject: \"Five months after this great Council, Nicae, St Alexander lying on his death-bed, recommended to his clergy and people the choice of Athanasius for his successor, thrice repeating his name. In consequence of his recommendation, the bishops of all Egypt assembled at Alexandria, and finding the people and clergy unanimous in their choice of Athanasius for patriarch, they confirmed the election about the middle of year 326. He seems, then, to have been about thirty years of age.\"<ref name=\"Butler1860\"/>\n\n=== Supporters ===\n[[File:Athanasius_and_Cyril.jpg|left|thumb|Athanasius (left) and his supporter [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. 17th century depiction.]]\n\nChristian denominations worldwide revere Athanasius as a saint, teacher, and father. They cite his defense of the Christology described in the first chapter of the Gospel of St. John{{bibleref2c-nb|John|1:1\u20134}} and his significant theological works ([[C. S. Lewis]] calls ''On the Incarnation of the Word of God'' a \"masterpiece\")<ref>Introduction to St. Athanasius on the Incarnation. Translated and edited by Sister Penelope Lawson, published by Mowbray 1944. p. 9</ref> as evidence of his righteousness. They also emphasize his close relationship with [[Anthony the Great]], the ancient monk who was one of the founders of the Christian monastic movement.\n\nThe Gospel of St. John and particularly the first chapter demonstrates the Divinity of Jesus. This Gospel in itself is the greatest support of Athanasius' stand. The Gospel of St. John's first chapter began to be said at the end of Mass, we believe as a result of Athanasius, and his life's stand, but quietly, and was later - together with some other originally private devotions - absorbed by the liturgical service proper as so-called ''Last Gospel''{{bibleref2c-nb|John|1:1\u201314}}. The beginning of John's Gospel was much used as an object of special devotion throughout the Middle Ages; the practice of saying it at the altar grew, and eventually [[Pius V]] made this practice universal for the Roman Rite in his edition of the Missal (1570).<ref name=\"Fortescue1907\">Fortescue, Adrian, Catholic Encyclopedia 1907, Volume 6, pp. 662\u2013663 \"Gospel\"</ref> It became a firm custom with exceptions in using another Gospel in use from 1920. <ref name=\"Pope Benedict XV\">Pope Benedict XV, Missale Romanum, IX Additions & Variations of the Rubrics of The Missal</ref><ref name=\"Jungmann\">See also: Jungmann, El Sacrificio de la Misa, No. 659, 660</ref>\n\n[[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (330\u2013390) begins Or. 21 with: \"When I praise Athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for I name every virtue as often as I mention him who was possessed of all virtues. He was the true pillar of the church. His life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith.\"<ref name=\"Clifford1930\" />\n\n[[Cyril of Alexandria]] (370\u2013444) in the first letter says: \"Athanasius is one who can be trusted: he would not say anything that is not in accord with sacred scripture.\" (Ep 1).\n\nMany modern historians point out that such a hostile attitude towards Athanasius is based on an unfair judgment of historical sources.<ref>Arnold, 24\u201399; Ng, 273\u2013292.</ref>\n\n[[Pope Pius X]] said in a letter to philosopher-friend and correspondent in the closing years of his life, (Epist. lxxi, ad Max.): \"Let what was confessed by the fathers of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] prevail\".<ref name=\"Clifford1930\" />\n\n=== Critics ===\nThroughout most of his career, Athanasius had many detractors. Classics scholar [[Timothy Barnes]] recounts ancient allegations against Athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent.<ref name = \"wxdxek\">Barnes, Timothy D., Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1993), 37</ref> Athanasius used \"Arian\" to describe both followers of Arius, and as a derogatory polemical term for Christians who disagreed with his formulation of the Trinity.<ref>Barnes \"Athanasius and Constantius\", 14, 128</ref> Athanasius called many of his opponents \"Arian\", except for [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletius]] (Miletus).<ref>Barnes \"Athanasius and Constantius\",135</ref>\n\nScholars now believe that the [[Arianism|Arian Party]] was not monolithic,<ref>Haas, Christopher, \"The Arians of Alexandria\", Vigiliae Christianae Vol. 47, no. 3 (1993), 239</ref> but held drastically different theological views that spanned the early Christian theological spectrum.<ref>Chadwick, Henry, \"Faith and Order at the Council of Nicaea\", ''Harvard Theological Review'' LIII (Cambridge Mass: 1960),173</ref><ref>Williams, 63</ref><ref>Kannengiesser \"Alexander and Arius\", 403</ref> They supported the tenets of [[Origenism|Origenist]] thought and [[subordinationism|subordinationist]] theology,<ref>Kannengiesser, \"Athanasius of Alexandria vs. Arius: The Alexandrian Crisis\", in The Roots of Egyptian Christianity (Studies in Antiquity and Christianity), ed. Birger A. Pearson and James E. Goehring (1986),208</ref> but had little else in common. Moreover, many labelled \"Arian\" did not consider themselves followers of Arius.<ref>Williams, 82</ref> In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops.<ref>Rubinstein, Richard, ''When Jesus Became God, The Struggle to Define Christianity during the Last Days of Rome'', 1999</ref> \n\nThe old allegations continue to be made against Athanasius however many centuries later. For example, [[Richard E. Rubenstein]] suggests that Athanasius ascended to the rank of bishop in [[Alexandria]] under questionable circumstances because some questioned whether he had reached the minimum age of 30 years, and further that Athanasius employed force when it suited his cause or personal interests. Thus, he argues that a small number of bishops who supported Athanasius held a private consecration to make him bishop.<ref>Rubenstein, Richard E., ''When Jesus Became God: The Epic Fight over Christ's Divinity in the Last Days of Rome'' (New York: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1999), 105\u2013106</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Athanasius.

His intermittent episcopacy spanned 45 years (c. 8 June 328 \u2013 2 May 373), of which over 17 encompassed five exiles, when he was replaced on the order of four different [[Roman emperors]]. Athanasius was a [[Christian theologian]], a [[Church Father]], the chief defender of [[Trinitarianism]] against [[Arianism]], and a noted [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]ian leader of the fourth century.\n\nConflict with [[Arius]] and Arianism as well as successive Roman emperors shaped Athanasius' career.

Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]] had convened the council in May\u2013August 325 to address the Arian position that the [[Son of God]], [[Jesus of Nazareth]], is of a distinct substance from the Father.<ref name=\"CC\">[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. ''Caesar and Christ''. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972.</ref> Three years after that council, Athanasius succeeded his mentor as archbishop of Alexandria. In addition to the conflict with the Arians (including powerful and influential Arian churchmen led by [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]]), he struggled against the Emperors Constantine, [[Constantius II]], [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] and [[Valens]]. He was known as '''''Athanasius Contra Mundum''''' (Latin for ''Athanasius Against the World'').\n\nNonetheless, within a few years after his death, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] called him the \"Pillar of the Church\". His writings were well regarded by all following Church fathers in the West and the East, who noted their rich devotion to the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word-become-man]], great pastoral concern and profound interest in monasticism. Athanasius is counted as one of the four great Eastern [[Doctors of the Church]] in the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"Doctors\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05075a.htm Chapman, John. \"Doctors of the Church\".

Athanasius is the first person to identify the same 27 books of the New Testament that are in use today. He is venerated as a Christian [[saint]], whose [[feast day]] is 2 May in [[Western Christianity]], 15 May in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], and 18 January in the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. He is venerated by the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Catholic Church, the Lutheran churches, and the Anglican Communion.\n\nThe Council of Nicaea (325), \"passed twenty disciplinary canons for the better government of the Church. By one, C. 6, of these the Bishops of [[Bishop of Rome|Rome]], Alexandria, and [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], were declared to possess jurisdiction over the Churches in their respective provinces\".

Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of [[Neo-Platonism]]. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\".

'Within a few weeks he set out for Rome to lay his case before the Church at large. He had made his appeal to Pope Julius, who took up his cause with whole-heartedness that never wavered down to the day of that holy pontiff's death.

Together they set out for Serdica, [[Sofia]]. A full Council of the Church was convened / summoned there in deference to the Roman pontiff's wishes. The travel was a mammoth task in itself. At this great gathering of prelates, leaders of the Church, the case of Athanasius was taken up once more, that is, Athanasius was formally questioned over misdemeanours and even murder, (a man called Arsenius and using his body for magic \u2013 an absurd charge. They even produced Arsenius' severed hand.<ref name=\"Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999\"/>).<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nThe Council was convoked for the purpose of inquiring into the charges against Athanasius and other bishops, on account of which they were deposed from their sees by the Semi-Arian Synod of Antioch (341), and went into exile. It was called according to Socrates, (E. H. ii. 20) by the two Emperors, Constans and Constantius; but, according to Baronius by Pope Julius (337\u2013352), (Ad an. 343). One hundred and seventy six attended. Eusebian bishops objected to the admission of Athanasius and other deposed bishops to the Council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them. Their objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops, about a hundred were orthodox, who were the majority. The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to Philoppopolis in Thrace, [[Philippopolis (Thracia)]], where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the Synod of Antioch.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAthanasius' innocence was reaffirmed at the [[Council of Serdica]]. Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the Council was made known. Meanwhile, the Eusebian party had gone to Philippopolis, where they issued an anathema against Athanasius and his supporters. The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and Constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. Orders were given that if Athanasius attempted to re-enter his see, he should be put to death. Athanasius, accordingly, withdrew from [[Serdica]] to [[Naissus]] in Mysia, where he celebrated the Easter festival of the year 344.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/> It was Hosius who presided over the [[Council of Serdica]], as he did for the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which like the 341 synod, found Athanasius innocent.<ref name=\"EB1878\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/athanasius|title=St. Athanasius - Christian Classics Ethereal Library - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org|language=en|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref> &.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> He celebrated his last Easter in exile in [[Aquileia]] in April 345, received by bishop Fortunatianus.<ref>Barnes, Timothy David, ''Athanasius and Constantius'', Harvard 2001, p. 66</ref>\n\nEastern Bishop [[Gregory of Cappadocia]] died, probably of violence in June of 345. (Gregory, an Arian bishop, had taken over the See of Alexandria.) The emissary to the Emperor Constantius sent by the bishops of the [[Council of Serdica]] to report the finding of the Council, who had been met at first with most insulting treatment, now received a favourable hearing. Constantius was forced to reconsider his decision, owing to a threatening letter from his brother Constans and the uncertain conditions of affairs on the Persian border, and he accordingly made up his mind to yield. But three separate letters were needed to overcome the natural hesitation of Athanasius. He passed rapidly from [[Aquileia]] to [[Treves]], from Treves to Rome and from Rome by way of the northern route to Adrianople, [[Edirne]], and Antioch, [[Ankara]], where he met Constantius. He was accorded a gracious interview by the Emperor, and sent back to his See in triumph, and began his memorable ten years of peace, which lasted to the third exile, 356.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nPope Julius died in April 352, and was succeeded by [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]]. For two years Liberius had been favourable to the cause of Athanasius; but driven at last into exile, he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula, from which the great Nicene text, the \"homoousion\", had been studiously omitted. In 355 a council was held at Milan, where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops, a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world. With his friends scattered, Hosius in exile, and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies, Athanasius could hardly hope to escape. On the night of 8 February 356, while engaged in services in the Church of St. Thomas, a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest. It was the beginning of his third exile.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nT. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: By Constantius' order, the sole ruler of The Roman Empire at the death of his brother Constans, the [[Council of Arles (353)|Council of Arles in 353]], was held, which was presided over by Vincent, Bishop of [[Capua]], in the name of Pope Liberius. The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius. The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated. To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control the Council in Milan.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThree hundred bishops assembled in Milan, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355. They met in the Church of Milan. Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death. All, with the exception of [[Dionysius (bishop of Milan)]], and the two Papal Legates, viz., [[Eusebius of Vercelli]] and [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius.

During this period, Athanasius completed his work ''Four Orations against the Arians'' and defended his own recent conduct in the ''Apology to Constantius'' and ''Apology for His Flight''. Constantius' persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop [[George of Laodicea]], prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional ''History of the Arians'', in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the [[Antichrist]].<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nConstantius ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to [[Stara Zagora|Beroea]], in Thrace. He sent expensive presents if he were to accept the Arian position, which Liberius refused. He sent him five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" which Liberius refused, saying he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where in a conference recorded by Theodore, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Serdica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nLiberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at [[Sirmium]]. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Niceae]], as Theodoret testifies. ([[Theodoret]], Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.).<ref>Butler, Albin, Butler's Lives of The Saints 1860, Volume 1</ref> The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed.<ref name=\"Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999\"/> Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nT. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII:\n<blockquote>The Arians sought the approval of an Ecumenical Council. They sought to hold two councils. Constantius, summoned the bishops of the East to meet at [[Seleucia in Isauria]], and those of the West to [[Rimini]] in Italy. A preliminary conference was held by the Arians at [[Sirmium]], to agree a formula of faith. A \"Homoeon\" creed was adopted, declaring The Son to be \"like the Father\". The two met in autumn of 359. At Seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of which one hundred and five were semi-Arian. The semi-Arians refused to accept anything less than the \"Homoiousion\", (see: [[Homoiousian]]), formulary of faith. The Imperial Prefect was obliged to disband, without agreeing on any creed.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/></blockquote>\n\nAcacius, the leader of the \"Homoean\" party went to Constantinople, where the Sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the \"Home Synod\", (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the Court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-Arians. At Rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were Arian, the rest were orthodox. The orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the Nicene, while the others were equally in favour of the Sirmian. Each party sent a deputation to the Emperor to say there was no probability to agreement, and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses. For the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops; (Sulpitius Severius says), Constantius delayed his answer for several months, and finally prevailed on them to accept the Sirmian creed. It was after this Council that [[Jerome]] said: \" ...the whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself Arian.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe Arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents. The Emperor Constantius, who had been the cause of so much trouble, died on 4 November 361 and was succeeded by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]. The proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant Arian faction in Alexandria. George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered. An obscure presbyter of the name of Pistus was immediately chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope. An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the \"Galileans\" to return to their \"towns and provinces\". Athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 February 362.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nIn 362 he convened a council at Alexandria, and presided over it with [[Eusebius of Vercelli]]. Athanasius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in Christianity, even if they differed on matters of terminology. This prepared the groundwork for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. However, the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the human soul of Christ, and Christ's divinity. Mild measures were agreed on for those heretic bishops who repented, but severe penance was decreed for the chief leaders of the major heresies.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Alexandria}}</ref>\n\nWith characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty. To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies. In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the \"Chronicon Athanasianum\" (XXXV) as a \"philosopher\", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\n====Fourth exile====\n\nIn 362, the new Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], noted for his opposition to Christianity, ordered Athanasius to leave Alexandria once again. Athanasius left for [[Upper Egypt]], remaining there with the [[Desert Fathers]] until Julian's death on 26 June 363. Athanasius returned in secret to Alexandria, where he soon received a document from the new emperor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], reinstating him once more in his episcopal functions.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nHis first act was to convene a council which reaffirmed the terms of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Early in September 363 he set out for [[Antioch on the Orontes]], bearing a synodal letter, in which the pronouncements of this council had been embodied. At Antioch he had an interview with the new emperor, who received him graciously and even asked him to prepare an exposition of the orthodox faith. The following February Jovian died; and in October, 364, Athanasius was once more an exile.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\n====Fifth exile====\n\nTwo years later, the Emperor [[Valens]], who favored the Arian position, in his turn exiled Athanasius. This time Athanasius simply left for the outskirts of Alexandria, where he stayed for only a few months before the local authorities convinced Valens to retract his order of exile.<ref name=\"EB\"/> Some early reports state that Athanasius spent this period of exile at his family's ancestral tomb<ref name=\"EA\"/> in a Christian cemetery. It was during this period, the final exile, that he is said to have spent four months in hiding in his father's tomb. (Soz., \"Hist. Eccl.\", VI, xii; Soc., \"Hist. Eccl.\", IV, xii).<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nThe accession of Valens gave a fresh lease of life to the Arian party. He issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by Constantius, but who had been permitted by Jovian to return to their sees. The news created the greatest consternation in the city of Alexandria itself, and the prefect, in order to prevent a serious outbreak, gave public assurance that the very special case of Athanasius would be laid before the emperor. But Athanasius seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him. He quietly withdrew from Alexandria, 5 October, and took up his abode in a country house outside the city. Valens, who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak, within a few weeks issued orders allowing Athanasius to return to his [[episcopal see]].<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nIn 366 Pope Liberius died and was succeeded by Pope Damasus, a man of strong character and holy life. Two years later, in a council of the Church, it was decreed that no Bishop should be consecrated unless he held the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Nicea]]. (F. A. Forbes).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Final years and death====\nAfter returning to Alexandria in early 366, Athanasius spent his final years repairing all the damage done during the earlier years of violence, dissent, and exile. He resumed writing and preaching undisturbed, and characteristically re-emphasized the view of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] which had been defined at [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]]. On 2 May 373, having consecrated [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter II]], one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters.<ref name=\"Clifford1930\" />\n\n== Works ==\nIn [[Coptic literature]], Athanasius is the first patriarch of Alexandria to use [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as well as Greek in his writings.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Coptic literature |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026215/Coptic-literature |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Polemical and theological works ===\nAthanasius was not a speculative theologian. As he stated in his ''First Letters to Serapion'', he held on to \"the tradition, teaching, and faith proclaimed by the apostles and guarded by the fathers.\"<ref name=\"EA\"/> He held that not only was the Son of God [[consubstantiality|consubstantial]] with the Father, but so was the [[Holy Spirit]], which had a great deal of influence in the development of later doctrines regarding the Trinity.<ref name=\"EA\"/>\n\nAthanasius' ''\"Letter Concerning the Decrees of the Council of Nicaea\"'' (''De Decretis''), is an important historical as well as theological account of the proceedings of that council, and another letter from 367 is the first known listing of all those books now accepted as the New Testament.<ref name=\"EA\"/> ([[Development of the New Testament canon|Earlier similar lists]] vary by the omission or addition of a few books.)\n\nExamples of Athanasius' polemical writings against his theological opponents include ''Orations Against the Arians'', his defence of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]] (''Letters to Serapion'' in the 360s, and ''On the Holy Spirit''), against [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonianism]] and ''On the Incarnation''.\n\nAthanasius also authored a two-part work, ''Against the Heathen'' and ''The Incarnation of the Word of God''. Completed probably early in his life, before the Arian controversy,<ref>Justo L. Gonzalez in ''A History of Christian Thought'' notes (p. 292) that E. Schwartz places this work later, around 335, but \"his arguments have not been generally accepted\". The introduction to the CSMV translation of ''On the Incarnation'' places the work in 318, around the time Athanasius was ordained to the diaconate (''St Athanasius On the Incarnation'', Mowbray, England 1953)</ref> they constitute the first classic work of developed Orthodox theology. In the first part, Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs. The second part presents teachings on the redemption.<ref name=\"EA\"/> Also in these books, Athanasius put forward the belief, referencing {{bibleref2|John|1:1\u20134}}, that the [[Son of God]], the eternal Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) through whom God created the world, entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away.\n\nHis other important works include his ''Letters to Serapion'', which defends the [[divinity]] of the [[Holy Spirit]]. In a letter to Epictetus of Corinth, Athanasius anticipates future controversies in his defense of the humanity of Christ. Another of his letters, to Dracontius, urges that monk to leave the desert for the more active duties of a bishop.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nAthanasius also wrote several works of [[Biblical exegesis]], primarily on [[Old Testament]] materials. The most important of these is his ''Epistle to Marcellinus'' (PG 27:12\u201345) on how to incorporate Psalm saying into one's spiritual practice. Excerpts remain of his discussions concerning the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Song of Solomon]], and [[Psalms]].\n\nPerhaps his most notable letter was his Festal Letter, written to his Church in Alexandria when he was in exile, as he could not be in their presence.  This letter clearly shows his stand that accepting Jesus as the Divine Son of God is not optional but necessary: {{quote|I know moreover that not only this thing saddens you, but also the fact that while others have obtained the churches by violence, you are meanwhile cast out from your places. For they hold the places, but you the Apostolic Faith. They are, it is true, in the places, but outside of the true Faith; while you are outside the places indeed, but the Faith, within you.

Up until then, various similar lists of works to be read in churches were in use. Athanasius compiled the list to resolve questions about such texts as ''The Epistle of Barnabas''. Athanasius includes the [[Book of Baruch]] and the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] and places the [[Book of Esther]] among the \"7 books not in the canon but to be read\" along with the [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], [[Ben Sira|Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)]], [[Book of Judith|Judith]], [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], the [[Didache]], and [[the Shepherd of Hermas]].<ref name=Robt>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cEloBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA280&lpg=PA280&dq=Athanasius+of+Alexandria+%2B+the+new+testament+canon#v=onepage&q=Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria%20%2B%20the%20new%20testament%20canon&f=false Aboagye-Mensah, Robert. \"Bishop Athanasius: His Life, Ministry and Legacy to African Christianity and the Global Church\", ''Seeing New Facets of the Diamond'', (Gillian Mary Bediako, Bernhardt Quarshie, J.

M. Forbes' research and reference to [[Pope Gregory I]]'s writings, it would appear that Athanasius was constrained to be Bishop: She writes that when the Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made Bishop. \"When the Bishops of the Church assembled to elect their new Patriarch, the whole Catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to Heaven and crying; \"Give us Athanasius!\" The Bishops had nothing better. Athanasius was thus elected, as Gregory tells us...\" ([[Pope Gregory I]], would have full access to the Vatican Archives).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlban Butler, writes on the subject: \"Five months after this great Council, Nicae, St Alexander lying on his death-bed, recommended to his clergy and people the choice of Athanasius for his successor, thrice repeating his name. In consequence of his recommendation, the bishops of all Egypt assembled at Alexandria, and finding the people and clergy unanimous in their choice of Athanasius for patriarch, they confirmed the election about the middle of year 326. He seems, then, to have been about thirty years of age.\"<ref name=\"Butler1860\"/>\n\n=== Supporters ===\n[[File:Athanasius_and_Cyril.jpg|left|thumb|Athanasius (left) and his supporter [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. 17th century depiction.]]\n\nChristian denominations worldwide revere Athanasius as a saint, teacher, and father. They cite his defense of the Christology described in the first chapter of the Gospel of St. John{{bibleref2c-nb|John|1:1\u20134}} and his significant theological works ([[C. S. Lewis]] calls ''On the Incarnation of the Word of God'' a \"masterpiece\")<ref>Introduction to St. Athanasius on the Incarnation. Translated and edited by Sister Penelope Lawson, published by Mowbray 1944. p. 9</ref> as evidence of his righteousness. They also emphasize his close relationship with [[Anthony the Great]], the ancient monk who was one of the founders of the Christian monastic movement.\n\nThe Gospel of St. John and particularly the first chapter demonstrates the Divinity of Jesus. This Gospel in itself is the greatest support of Athanasius' stand. The Gospel of St. John's first chapter began to be said at the end of Mass, we believe as a result of Athanasius, and his life's stand, but quietly, and was later - together with some other originally private devotions - absorbed by the liturgical service proper as so-called ''Last Gospel''{{bibleref2c-nb|John|1:1\u201314}}. The beginning of John's Gospel was much used as an object of special devotion throughout the Middle Ages; the practice of saying it at the altar grew, and eventually [[Pius V]] made this practice universal for the Roman Rite in his edition of the Missal (1570).<ref name=\"Fortescue1907\">Fortescue, Adrian, Catholic Encyclopedia 1907, Volume 6, pp. 662\u2013663 \"Gospel\"</ref> It became a firm custom with exceptions in using another Gospel in use from 1920. <ref name=\"Pope Benedict XV\">Pope Benedict XV, Missale Romanum, IX Additions & Variations of the Rubrics of The Missal</ref><ref name=\"Jungmann\">See also: Jungmann, El Sacrificio de la Misa, No. 659, 660</ref>\n\n[[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (330\u2013390) begins Or. 21 with: \"When I praise Athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for I name every virtue as often as I mention him who was possessed of all virtues.

Moreover, many labelled \"Arian\" did not consider themselves followers of Arius.<ref>Williams, 82</ref> In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops.<ref>Rubinstein, Richard, ''When Jesus Became God, The Struggle to Define Christianity during the Last Days of Rome'', 1999</ref> \n\nThe old allegations continue to be made against Athanasius however many centuries later. For example, [[Richard E. Rubenstein]] suggests that Athanasius ascended to the rank of bishop in [[Alexandria]] under questionable circumstances because some questioned whether he had reached the minimum age of 30 years, and further that Athanasius employed force when it suited his cause or personal interests. Thus, he argues that a small number of bishops who supported Athanasius held a private consecration to make him bishop.<ref>Rubenstein, Richard E., ''When Jesus Became God: The Epic Fight over Christ's Divinity in the Last Days of Rome'' (New York: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1999), 105\u2013106</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Athanasius.

In reality, these surnames may also derive from the medieval name Tagliaferro, that is, the Italianization of the French name Taillefer, made famous by the [[Taillefer|chivalric epic]] (the name Tagliaferro, on the other hand, is also mentioned in the eighteenth-century drama [[La Cecchina]], by [[Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni]]).<ref>Rossoni, Ettore, L'Origine dei Cognomi Italiani, Storia ed Etimologia, Melegnano, (2014), p. 3034</ref>\n\n==People with the name==\n===Given name===\nIt is the [[first name]] of the following persons:\n* Toliver Craig, Jr., representative in the [[Kentucky General Assembly]]\n* [[Toliver Craig, Sr.]] (first called Taliaferro Craig), 18th-century frontiersman and militia officer\n* Taliaferro Sidney Evans, Major, 11th Mississippi Regiment, CSA: died in the Cornfield Charge at Sharpsburg, 17 Sept. 1862.\n* [[Taliaferro Preston Shaffner]], 19th-century self-proclaimed colonel, inventor and publisher.\n\n===Middle name===\nIt is the [[middle name]] of the following persons:\n*[[William Close]] (William Taliaferro Close), late surgeon who worked in Africa, father of actress Glenn Close\n*[[Robert M.

The party became increasingly dominant after the [[1800 United States elections|1800 elections]] as the opposing [[Federalist Party]] collapsed. The Democratic-Republicans later splintered during the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]]. One faction of the Democratic-Republicans eventually coalesced into the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|modern Democratic Party]], while the other faction ultimately formed the core of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party originated as a faction in Congress that opposed the centralizing policies of [[Alexander Hamilton]], who served as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under President [[George Washington]]. The Democratic-Republicans and the opposing Federalist Party each became more cohesive during Washington's second term, partly as a result of the debate over the [[Jay Treaty]]. Though he was defeated by Federalist [[John Adams]] in the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 presidential election]], Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican allies came into power following the [[1800 United States elections|1800 elections]]. As president, Jefferson presided over a reduction in the national debt and government spending, and completed the [[Louisiana Purchase]] with [[France]].\n\nMadison succeeded Jefferson as president in 1809 and led the country during the largely-inconclusive [[War of 1812]] with [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. After the war, Madison and his congressional allies established the [[Second Bank of the United States]] and implemented protective [[tariffs in United States history|tariffs]], marking a move away from the party's earlier emphasis on [[states' rights]] and a strict construction of the [[United States Constitution]]. The Federalists collapsed after 1815, beginning a period known as the [[Era of Good Feelings]]. Lacking an effective opposition, the Democratic-Republicans split into groups after the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]]; one faction supported President [[John Quincy Adams]], while the other faction backed General [[Andrew Jackson]]. Jackson's faction eventually coalesced into the Democratic Party, while supporters of Adams became known as the [[National Republican Party]], which itself later merged into the Whig Party.\n\nDemocratic-Republicans were deeply committed to the principles of republicanism, which they feared were threatened by the supposed monarchical tendencies of the Federalists. During the 1790s, the party strongly opposed Federalist programs, including the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]]. After the War of 1812, Madison and many other party leaders came to accept the need for a national bank and federally-funded infrastructure projects. In foreign affairs, the party advocated western expansion and tended to favor France over Britain, though the party's pro-French stance faded after [[Napoleon]] took power. The Democratic-Republicans were strongest in the [[Southern United States|South]] and the [[American frontier|western frontier]], and weakest in [[New England]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding, 1789\u20131796 ===\n{{Further|Presidency of George Washington|Anti-Administration party}}\n{{multiple image|align=right|total_width=300|image2=Unsuccessful 1796.jpg|image1=James Madison (cropped 3x4 close).jpg|caption2=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|caption1=[[James Madison]]}}\n\nIn the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1788\u201389 presidential election]], the first such election following the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788, [[George Washington]] won the votes of every member of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].<ref name=GWelections>{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/washington/campaigns-and-elections| title=George Washington: Campaigns and Elections| last=Knott| first=Stephen| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=July 14, 2017| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728033729/https://millercenter.org/president/washington/campaigns-and-elections| archivedate=July 28, 2017| date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> His unanimous victory in part reflected the fact that no formal political parties had formed at the national level in the United States prior to 1789, though the country had been broadly polarized between the Federalists, who supported ratification of the Constitution, and the Anti-Federalists, who opposed ratification.<ref>Reichley (2000), pp. 25, 29</ref> Washington selected [[Thomas Jefferson]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]],<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 282\u2013284</ref> and he relied on [[James Madison]] as a key adviser and ally in Congress.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 292\u2013293</ref>\n\nHamilton implemented an expansive economic program, establishing the [[First Bank of the United States]],<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 293\u2013298</ref> and convincing Congress to [[Funding Act of 1790|assume the debts]] of state governments.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 244\u2013252</ref> Hamilton pursued his programs in the belief that they would foster a prosperous and stable country.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 44\u201345</ref> His policies engendered an opposition, chiefly concentrated in the [[Southern United States]], that objected to Hamilton's [[anglophilia]] and accused him of unduly favoring well-connected wealthy Northern merchants and speculators.

The failure of talks, and the French demand for bribes in what became known as the [[XYZ Affair]], outraged the American public and led to the [[Quasi-War]], an undeclared naval war between France and the United States.

Reichley writes that \"the issue that most sharply divided the Jeffersonians from the Federalists was not states rights, nor the national debt, nor the national Bank... but the question of social equality.\"<ref>Reichley (2000), p. 52</ref> In a world in which few believed in democracy or egalitarianism, Jefferson's belief in political equality for white men stood out from many of the other [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], who held that the rich and powerful should lead society. Jefferson advocated a philosophy that historians would later call [[Jeffersonian democracy]], which was marked by his belief in [[agrarianism]] and [[limited government|strict limits on the national government]].<ref>Appleby, 2003, pp. 1\u20135</ref> Influenced by the Jeffersonian belief in equality, by 1824 all but three states had removed property-owning requirements for voting.<ref>Reichley (2000), p. 57</ref>\n\nThough open to some redistributive measures, Jefferson saw a strong centralized government as a threat to freedom.<ref>Reichley (2000), p. 55\u201356</ref> Thus, the Democratic-Republicans opposed Federalist efforts to build a strong, centralized state, and resisted the establishment of a national bank, the build-up of the army and the navy, and passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts.<ref>Reichley (2000), pp. 51\u201352</ref> Jefferson was especially averse to a national debt, which he believed to be inherently dangerous and immoral.<ref>McDonald, 1976, pp. 42\u201343</ref> After the party took power in 1800, Jefferson became increasingly concerned about foreign intervention and more open to programs of economic development conducted by the federal government. In an effort to promote economic growth and the development of a diversified economy, Jefferson's Democratic-Republican successors would oversee the construction of numerous federally-funded infrastructure projects and implement protective tariffs.<ref>Brown (1999), pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\nWhile economic policies were the original catalyst to the partisan split between the Democratic-Republicans and the Federalists, foreign policy was also a major factor that divided the parties. Most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the [[Execution of Louis XVI]] in 1793, but Federalists began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 299\u2013302, 309\u2013311</ref> Jefferson and other Democratic-Republicans defended the French Revolution.<ref>Reichley (2000), pp. 35\u201336</ref> until [[Napoleon]] ascended to power between 1797 and 1803.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 108</ref> Democratic-Republican foreign policy was marked by support for expansionism, as Jefferson championed the concept of an \"[[Empire of Liberty]]\" that centered on the acquisition and settlement of western territories.<ref>Wood (2009), pp. 357\u2013358</ref> Under Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, the United States completed the Louisiana Purchase, acquired [[Spanish Florida]], and reached a treaty with Britain providing for shared sovereignty over [[Oregon Country]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} In 1823, the Monroe administration promulgated the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which reiterated the traditional [[United States non-interventionism|U.S. policy of neutrality]] with regard to European wars and conflicts, but declared that the United States would not accept the recolonization of any country by its former European master.<ref name=JMforeign>{{cite web|title=James Monroe: Foreign Affairs|url=https://millercenter.org/president/monroe/foreign-affairs|publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia|accessdate=February 25, 2017|date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> The Monroe Doctrine would be the cornerstone of American foreign policy for several decades.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Slavery===\n\nFrom the foundation of the party, slavery divided the Democratic-Republicans. Many Southern Democratic-Republicans, especially from the Deep South, defended the institution. Jefferson and many other Democratic-Republicans from Virginia held an ambivalent view on slavery; Jefferson believed it was an immoral institution, but he opposed the immediate emancipation of all slaves on economic grounds.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 136\u2013137</ref>  Meanwhile, Northern Democratic-Republicans often took stronger anti-slavery positions than their Federalist counterparts, supporting measures like the abolition of slavery in Washington. In 1807, with President Jefferson's support, Congress [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|outlawed]] the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]], doing so at the earliest possible date allowed by the Constitution.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 218\u2013221</ref> \n\nAfter the War of 1812, Southerners increasingly came to view slavery as a beneficial institution rather than an unfortunate economic necessity, further polarizing the party over the issue.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 218\u2013221</ref> Anti-slavery Northern Democratic-Republicans held that slavery was incompatible with the equality and individual rights promised by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. They further held that slavery had been permitted under the Constitution only as a local and impermanent exception, and thus, slavery should not be allowed to spread outside of the original thirteen states. The anti-slavery positions developed by Northern Democratic-Republicans would influence later anti-slavery parties, including the [[Free Soil Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 225\u2013227</ref> Some Democratic-Republicans from the border states, including [[Henry Clay]], continued to adhere to the Jeffersonian view of slavery as a necessary evil; many of these leaders joined the [[American Colonization Society]], which proposed the voluntary recolonization of Africa as part of a broader plan for the gradual emancipation of slaves.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 228\u2013229</ref>\n\n== Base of support ==\n[[File:First Party System.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Presidential election results from 1796 to 1824.

The Democratic-Republicans also attracted middle class Northerners, such as artisans, farmers, and lower-level merchants, who were eager to challenge the power of the local elite.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|2009}}, pp. 166\u2013168</ref> Every state had a distinct political geography that shaped party membership; in Pennsylvania, the Republicans were weakest around [[Philadelphia]] and strongest in [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] settlements in the west.<ref>Klein, 44.</ref> The Federalists had broad support in New England, but in other places they relied on wealthy merchants and landowners.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|2009}}, pp. 168\u2013171</ref> After 1800, the Federalists collapsed in the South and West, though the party remained competitive in New England and in some [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states.<ref>Reichley (2000), p. 54</ref>\n\n== Factions ==\n[[File:John Wesley Jarvis - John Randolph - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[John Randolph of Roanoke]] was a prominent member of a group of Southern plantation owners known as the [[Old Republican]]s.]]\n\nHistorian [[Sean Wilentz]] writes that, after assuming power in 1801, the Democratic-Republicans began to factionalize into three main groups: moderates, radicals, and [[Old Republicans]].<ref>Wilentz (2005), p. 100</ref> The Old Republicans, led by [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]], were a loose group of influential Southern plantation owners who strongly favored states' rights and denounced any form of compromise with the Federalists. The radicals consisted of a wide array of individuals from different sections of the country who were characterized by their support for far-reaching political and economic reforms; prominent radicals include [[William Duane (journalist)|William Duane]] and [[Michael Leib]], who jointly led a powerful [[political machine]] in Philadelphia. The moderate faction consisted of many former supporters of the ratification of the Constitution, including James Madison, who were more accepting of Federalist economic programs and sought conciliation with moderate Federalists.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\nAfter 1810, a younger group of nationalist Democratic-Republicans, led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, rose to prominence. These nationalists favored federally-funded internal improvements and high tariffs, positions that would form the basis for Clay's [[American System (economic plan)|American System]].<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 144\u2013148</ref> In addition to its base among the leaders of Clay and Calhoun's generation, nationalist policies also proved attractive to many older Democratic-Republicans, including James Monroe.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 202\u2013203</ref> The Panic of 1819 sparked a backlash against nationalist policies, and many of those opposed to the nationalist policies rallied around William H. Crawford until he had a major stroke in 1823.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 241\u2013242</ref> After the 1824 election, most of Crawford's followers, including Martin Van Buren, gravitated to Andrew Jackson, forming a major part of the coalition that propelled Jackson to victory in the 1828 election.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 294\u2013296</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Organizational Strategy}} Organizational strategy ==\nThe Democratic-Republican Party invented campaign and organizational techniques that were later adopted by the Federalists and became standard American practice. It was especially effective in building a network of [[History of American newspapers|newspapers]] in major cities to broadcast its statements and editorialize its policies.<ref>Jeffrey L. Pasley. ''\"The Tyranny of Printers\": Newspaper Politics in the Early American Republic'' (2003)</ref> [[Fisher Ames]], a leading Federalist, used the term \"[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]\" to link members of Jefferson's party to the radicals of the [[French Revolution]]. He blamed the newspapers for electing Jefferson and wrote they were \"an overmatch for any Government.... The Jacobins owe their triumph to the unceasing use of this engine; not so much to skill in use of it as by repetition\".<ref>Cunningham (1957), 167.</ref>\n\nAs one historian explained: \"It was the good fortune of the Republicans to have within their ranks a number of highly gifted political manipulators and propagandists. Some of them had the ability... to not only see and analyze the problem at hand but to present it in a succinct fashion; in short, to fabricate the apt phrase, to coin the compelling slogan and appeal to the electorate on any given issue in language it could understand\". Outstanding propagandists included editor William Duane (1760\u20131835) and party leaders [[Albert Gallatin]], [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]] and Jefferson himself.<ref>Tinkcom, 271.</ref> Just as important was effective party organization of the sort that [[John J. Beckley]] pioneered. In 1796, he managed the Jefferson campaign in Pennsylvania, blanketing the state with agents who passed out 30,000 hand-written tickets, naming all 15 electors (printed tickets were not allowed). Beckley told one agent: \"In a few days a select republican friend from the City will call upon you with a parcel of tickets to be distributed in your County. Any assistance and advice you can furnish him with, as to suitable districts & characters, will I am sure be rendered\". Beckley was the first American professional campaign manager and his techniques were quickly adopted in other states.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1923388|title = John Beckley: An Early American Party Manager|journal = The William and Mary Quarterly|volume = 13|issue = 1|pages = 40\u201352|last1 = Cunningham|first1 = Noble E.|year = 1956|doi = 10.2307/1923388}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of the new organizational strategies can be seen in the politics of [[Connecticut]] around 1806, which have been well documented by Cunningham. The Federalists dominated Connecticut, so the Republicans had to work harder to win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders \"to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty\". Then the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total the number of taxpayers and the number of eligible voters, find out how many favored the Republicans and how many the Federalists and to count the number of supporters of each party who were not eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager and in turn were compiled and sent to the state manager. Using these lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all eligible people to town meetings and help the young men qualify to vote. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers.<ref>Cunningham (1963), 129.</ref> This highly coordinated \"[[get out the vote|get-out-the-vote]]\" drive would be familiar to modern political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.\n\n== {{anchor|Claims to the Party's Heritage}} Legacy ==\n{{further|Second Party System}}\n{{see also|Thomas Jefferson#Legacy}}\n[[File:Andrew jackson headFXD.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Andrew Jackson]] led a faction of Democratic-Republicans that ultimately coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]]]\n\nThe coalition of Jacksonians, Calhounites, and Crawfordites built by Jackson and Van Buren would become the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which dominated presidential politics in the decades prior to the Civil War. Supporters of Adams and Clay would form the main opposition to Jackson as the [[National Republican Party]]. The National Republicans in turn eventually formed part of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which was the second major party in the United States between the 1830s and the early 1850s.<ref>{{harvnb|Parsons|2009|pages=185\u2013187, 195}}.</ref> The diverse and changing nature of the Democratic-Republican Party allowed both major parties to claim that they stood for Jeffersonian principles.<ref>Brown (1999), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Historian [[Daniel Walker Howe]] writes that Democrats traced their heritage to he \"Old Republicanism of [[Nathaniel Macon|Macon]] and [[William H.

The party became increasingly dominant after the [[1800 United States elections|1800 elections]] as the opposing [[Federalist Party]] collapsed. The Democratic-Republicans later splintered during the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]]. One faction of the Democratic-Republicans eventually coalesced into the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|modern Democratic Party]], while the other faction ultimately formed the core of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party originated as a faction in Congress that opposed the centralizing policies of [[Alexander Hamilton]], who served as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under President [[George Washington]]. The Democratic-Republicans and the opposing Federalist Party each became more cohesive during Washington's second term, partly as a result of the debate over the [[Jay Treaty]]. Though he was defeated by Federalist [[John Adams]] in the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 presidential election]], Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican allies came into power following the [[1800 United States elections|1800 elections]]. As president, Jefferson presided over a reduction in the national debt and government spending, and completed the [[Louisiana Purchase]] with [[France]].\n\nMadison succeeded Jefferson as president in 1809 and led the country during the largely-inconclusive [[War of 1812]] with [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. After the war, Madison and his congressional allies established the [[Second Bank of the United States]] and implemented protective [[tariffs in United States history|tariffs]], marking a move away from the party's earlier emphasis on [[states' rights]] and a strict construction of the [[United States Constitution]]. The Federalists collapsed after 1815, beginning a period known as the [[Era of Good Feelings]]. Lacking an effective opposition, the Democratic-Republicans split into groups after the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]]; one faction supported President [[John Quincy Adams]], while the other faction backed General [[Andrew Jackson]]. Jackson's faction eventually coalesced into the Democratic Party, while supporters of Adams became known as the [[National Republican Party]], which itself later merged into the Whig Party.\n\nDemocratic-Republicans were deeply committed to the principles of republicanism, which they feared were threatened by the supposed monarchical tendencies of the Federalists. During the 1790s, the party strongly opposed Federalist programs, including the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]]. After the War of 1812, Madison and many other party leaders came to accept the need for a national bank and federally-funded infrastructure projects. In foreign affairs, the party advocated western expansion and tended to favor France over Britain, though the party's pro-French stance faded after [[Napoleon]] took power. The Democratic-Republicans were strongest in the [[Southern United States|South]] and the [[American frontier|western frontier]], and weakest in [[New England]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding, 1789\u20131796 ===\n{{Further|Presidency of George Washington|Anti-Administration party}}\n{{multiple image|align=right|total_width=300|image2=Unsuccessful 1796.jpg|image1=James Madison (cropped 3x4 close).jpg|caption2=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|caption1=[[James Madison]]}}\n\nIn the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1788\u201389 presidential election]], the first such election following the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788, [[George Washington]] won the votes of every member of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].<ref name=GWelections>{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/washington/campaigns-and-elections| title=George Washington: Campaigns and Elections| last=Knott| first=Stephen| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=July 14, 2017| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728033729/https://millercenter.org/president/washington/campaigns-and-elections| archivedate=July 28, 2017| date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> His unanimous victory in part reflected the fact that no formal political parties had formed at the national level in the United States prior to 1789, though the country had been broadly polarized between the Federalists, who supported ratification of the Constitution, and the Anti-Federalists, who opposed ratification.<ref>Reichley (2000), pp. 25, 29</ref> Washington selected [[Thomas Jefferson]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]],<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 282\u2013284</ref> and he relied on [[James Madison]] as a key adviser and ally in Congress.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 292\u2013293</ref>\n\nHamilton implemented an expansive economic program, establishing the [[First Bank of the United States]],<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 293\u2013298</ref> and convincing Congress to [[Funding Act of 1790|assume the debts]] of state governments.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 244\u2013252</ref> Hamilton pursued his programs in the belief that they would foster a prosperous and stable country.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 44\u201345</ref> His policies engendered an opposition, chiefly concentrated in the [[Southern United States]], that objected to Hamilton's [[anglophilia]] and accused him of unduly favoring well-connected wealthy Northern merchants and speculators.

Reichley writes that \"the issue that most sharply divided the Jeffersonians from the Federalists was not states rights, nor the national debt, nor the national Bank... but the question of social equality.\"<ref>Reichley (2000), p. 52</ref> In a world in which few believed in democracy or egalitarianism, Jefferson's belief in political equality for white men stood out from many of the other [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], who held that the rich and powerful should lead society. Jefferson advocated a philosophy that historians would later call [[Jeffersonian democracy]], which was marked by his belief in [[agrarianism]] and [[limited government|strict limits on the national government]].<ref>Appleby, 2003, pp. 1\u20135</ref> Influenced by the Jeffersonian belief in equality, by 1824 all but three states had removed property-owning requirements for voting.<ref>Reichley (2000), p. 57</ref>\n\nThough open to some redistributive measures, Jefferson saw a strong centralized government as a threat to freedom.<ref>Reichley (2000), p. 55\u201356</ref> Thus, the Democratic-Republicans opposed Federalist efforts to build a strong, centralized state, and resisted the establishment of a national bank, the build-up of the army and the navy, and passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts.<ref>Reichley (2000), pp. 51\u201352</ref> Jefferson was especially averse to a national debt, which he believed to be inherently dangerous and immoral.<ref>McDonald, 1976, pp. 42\u201343</ref> After the party took power in 1800, Jefferson became increasingly concerned about foreign intervention and more open to programs of economic development conducted by the federal government. In an effort to promote economic growth and the development of a diversified economy, Jefferson's Democratic-Republican successors would oversee the construction of numerous federally-funded infrastructure projects and implement protective tariffs.<ref>Brown (1999), pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\nWhile economic policies were the original catalyst to the partisan split between the Democratic-Republicans and the Federalists, foreign policy was also a major factor that divided the parties. Most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the [[Execution of Louis XVI]] in 1793, but Federalists began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 299\u2013302, 309\u2013311</ref> Jefferson and other Democratic-Republicans defended the French Revolution.<ref>Reichley (2000), pp. 35\u201336</ref> until [[Napoleon]] ascended to power between 1797 and 1803.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 108</ref> Democratic-Republican foreign policy was marked by support for expansionism, as Jefferson championed the concept of an \"[[Empire of Liberty]]\" that centered on the acquisition and settlement of western territories.<ref>Wood (2009), pp. 357\u2013358</ref> Under Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, the United States completed the Louisiana Purchase, acquired [[Spanish Florida]], and reached a treaty with Britain providing for shared sovereignty over [[Oregon Country]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} In 1823, the Monroe administration promulgated the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which reiterated the traditional [[United States non-interventionism|U.S. policy of neutrality]] with regard to European wars and conflicts, but declared that the United States would not accept the recolonization of any country by its former European master.<ref name=JMforeign>{{cite web|title=James Monroe: Foreign Affairs|url=https://millercenter.org/president/monroe/foreign-affairs|publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia|accessdate=February 25, 2017|date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> The Monroe Doctrine would be the cornerstone of American foreign policy for several decades.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Slavery===\n\nFrom the foundation of the party, slavery divided the Democratic-Republicans. Many Southern Democratic-Republicans, especially from the Deep South, defended the institution. Jefferson and many other Democratic-Republicans from Virginia held an ambivalent view on slavery; Jefferson believed it was an immoral institution, but he opposed the immediate emancipation of all slaves on economic grounds.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 136\u2013137</ref>  Meanwhile, Northern Democratic-Republicans often took stronger anti-slavery positions than their Federalist counterparts, supporting measures like the abolition of slavery in Washington. In 1807, with President Jefferson's support, Congress [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|outlawed]] the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]], doing so at the earliest possible date allowed by the Constitution.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 218\u2013221</ref> \n\nAfter the War of 1812, Southerners increasingly came to view slavery as a beneficial institution rather than an unfortunate economic necessity, further polarizing the party over the issue.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 218\u2013221</ref> Anti-slavery Northern Democratic-Republicans held that slavery was incompatible with the equality and individual rights promised by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. They further held that slavery had been permitted under the Constitution only as a local and impermanent exception, and thus, slavery should not be allowed to spread outside of the original thirteen states. The anti-slavery positions developed by Northern Democratic-Republicans would influence later anti-slavery parties, including the [[Free Soil Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 225\u2013227</ref> Some Democratic-Republicans from the border states, including Henry Clay, continued to adhere to the Jeffersonian view of slavery as a necessary evil; many of these leaders joined the [[American Colonization Society]], which proposed the voluntary recolonization of Africa as part of a broader plan for the gradual emancipation of slaves.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 228\u2013229</ref>\n\n== Base of support ==\n[[File:First Party System.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Presidential election results from 1796 to 1824.

The Democratic-Republicans also attracted middle class Northerners, such as artisans, farmers, and lower-level merchants, who were eager to challenge the power of the local elite.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|2009}}, pp. 166\u2013168</ref> Every state had a distinct political geography that shaped party membership; in Pennsylvania, the Republicans were weakest around [[Philadelphia]] and strongest in [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] settlements in the west.<ref>Klein, 44.</ref> The Federalists had broad support in New England, but in other places they relied on wealthy merchants and landowners.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|2009}}, pp. 168\u2013171</ref> After 1800, the Federalists collapsed in the South and West, though the party remained competitive in New England and in some [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states.<ref>Reichley (2000), p. 54</ref>\n\n== Factions ==\n[[File:John Wesley Jarvis - John Randolph - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[John Randolph of Roanoke]] was a prominent member of a group of Southern plantation owners known as the [[Old Republican]]s.]]\n\nHistorian [[Sean Wilentz]] writes that, after assuming power in 1801, the Democratic-Republicans began to factionalize into three main groups: moderates, radicals, and [[Old Republicans]].<ref>Wilentz (2005), p. 100</ref> The Old Republicans, led by [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]], were a loose group of influential Southern plantation owners who strongly favored states' rights and denounced any form of compromise with the Federalists. The radicals consisted of a wide array of individuals from different sections of the country who were characterized by their support for far-reaching political and economic reforms; prominent radicals include [[William Duane (journalist)|William Duane]] and [[Michael Leib]], who jointly led a powerful [[political machine]] in Philadelphia. The moderate faction consisted of many former supporters of the ratification of the Constitution, including James Madison, who were more accepting of Federalist economic programs and sought conciliation with moderate Federalists.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\nAfter 1810, a younger group of nationalist Democratic-Republicans, led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, rose to prominence. These nationalists favored federally-funded internal improvements and high tariffs, positions that would form the basis for Clay's [[American System (economic plan)|American System]].<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 144\u2013148</ref> In addition to its base among the leaders of Clay and Calhoun's generation, nationalist policies also proved attractive to many older Democratic-Republicans, including James Monroe.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 202\u2013203</ref> The Panic of 1819 sparked a backlash against nationalist policies, and many of those opposed to the nationalist policies rallied around William H. Crawford until he had a major stroke in 1823.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 241\u2013242</ref> After the 1824 election, most of Crawford's followers, including Martin Van Buren, gravitated to Andrew Jackson, forming a major part of the coalition that propelled Jackson to victory in the 1828 election.<ref>Wilentz (2005), pp. 294\u2013296</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Organizational Strategy}} Organizational strategy ==\nThe Democratic-Republican Party invented campaign and organizational techniques that were later adopted by the Federalists and became standard American practice. It was especially effective in building a network of [[History of American newspapers|newspapers]] in major cities to broadcast its statements and editorialize its policies.<ref>Jeffrey L. Pasley. ''\"The Tyranny of Printers\": Newspaper Politics in the Early American Republic'' (2003)</ref> [[Fisher Ames]], a leading Federalist, used the term \"[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]\" to link members of Jefferson's party to the radicals of the [[French Revolution]]. He blamed the newspapers for electing Jefferson and wrote they were \"an overmatch for any Government.... The Jacobins owe their triumph to the unceasing use of this engine; not so much to skill in use of it as by repetition\".<ref>Cunningham (1957), 167.</ref>\n\nAs one historian explained: \"It was the good fortune of the Republicans to have within their ranks a number of highly gifted political manipulators and propagandists. Some of them had the ability... to not only see and analyze the problem at hand but to present it in a succinct fashion; in short, to fabricate the apt phrase, to coin the compelling slogan and appeal to the electorate on any given issue in language it could understand\". Outstanding propagandists included editor William Duane (1760\u20131835) and party leaders [[Albert Gallatin]], [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]] and Jefferson himself.<ref>Tinkcom, 271.</ref> Just as important was effective party organization of the sort that [[John J. Beckley]] pioneered. In 1796, he managed the Jefferson campaign in Pennsylvania, blanketing the state with agents who passed out 30,000 hand-written tickets, naming all 15 electors (printed tickets were not allowed). Beckley told one agent: \"In a few days a select republican friend from the City will call upon you with a parcel of tickets to be distributed in your County. Any assistance and advice you can furnish him with, as to suitable districts & characters, will I am sure be rendered\". Beckley was the first American professional campaign manager and his techniques were quickly adopted in other states.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1923388|title = John Beckley: An Early American Party Manager|journal = The William and Mary Quarterly|volume = 13|issue = 1|pages = 40\u201352|last1 = Cunningham|first1 = Noble E.|year = 1956|doi = 10.2307/1923388}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of the new organizational strategies can be seen in the politics of [[Connecticut]] around 1806, which have been well documented by Cunningham. The Federalists dominated Connecticut, so the Republicans had to work harder to win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders \"to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty\". Then the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total the number of taxpayers and the number of eligible voters, find out how many favored the Republicans and how many the Federalists and to count the number of supporters of each party who were not eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager and in turn were compiled and sent to the state manager. Using these lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all eligible people to town meetings and help the young men qualify to vote. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers.<ref>Cunningham (1963), 129.</ref> This highly coordinated \"[[get out the vote|get-out-the-vote]]\" drive would be familiar to modern political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.\n\n== {{anchor|Claims to the Party's Heritage}} Legacy ==\n{{further|Second Party System}}\n{{see also|Thomas Jefferson#Legacy}}\n[[File:Andrew jackson headFXD.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Andrew Jackson]] led a faction of Democratic-Republicans that ultimately coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]]]\n\nThe coalition of Jacksonians, Calhounites, and Crawfordites built by Jackson and Van Buren would become the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which dominated presidential politics in the decades prior to the Civil War. Supporters of Adams and Clay would form the main opposition to Jackson as the [[National Republican Party]]. The National Republicans in turn eventually formed part of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which was the second major party in the United States between the 1830s and the early 1850s.<ref>{{harvnb|Parsons|2009|pages=185\u2013187, 195}}.</ref> The diverse and changing nature of the Democratic-Republican Party allowed both major parties to claim that they stood for Jeffersonian principles.<ref>Brown (1999), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Historian [[Daniel Walker Howe]] writes that Democrats traced their heritage to he \"Old Republicanism of [[Nathaniel Macon|Macon]] and [[William H.
