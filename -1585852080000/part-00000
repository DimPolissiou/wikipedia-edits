Cochrane returned to the [[IFA Premiership|Irish League]] to play for [[Linfield F.C.]], and then [[Coleraine FC]], thinking his dream of playing English football was over. At Coleraine, under the tutelage of former [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] boss, [[Bertie Peacock]], Cochrane developed into a fine winger and was capped by his country for the first time in October 1975 against [[Norway national football team|Norway]].\n\nIn October 1976 Cochrane moved to [[Burnley F.C.]], then playing in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. With Burnley he became a much sought-after player - his scintillating displays aiding Burnley in their survival from relegation. [[Middlesbrough F.C.]] later paid a club record fee of \u00a3233,333 for him in October 1978. This was also a record fee for a Northern Ireland player and his debut came in a 2\u20130 home win over [[Norwich City F.C.]] on 14 October. After five years at [[Ayresome Park]] and a brief spell playing in [[Hong Kong]] with [[Eastern AA]], Cochrane moved to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in October 1983.\n\nNever really established in the international team, indeed 13 of his 26 caps came as a sub, he is remembered for his goal against [[England national football team|England]] during the [[1980 British Home Championship]]. The goal came nine minutes after he had come on as a sub, and just sixty seconds after the English had scored, to earn Northern Ireland a crucial 1\u20131 draw as they went on to win the Championships for the first time in 66 years.\n\nA hamstring injury picked up in a warm-up match against [[France national football team|France]] ruled Cochrane out of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] squad after playing in all but two of the qualifiers. He was capped just twice more after that World Cup series, acting as [[Martin O'Neill]]'s deputy in a British Championship game against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in December 1983, as Northern Ireland won the trophy;<ref>Brown, Alan.

The organisation aims listed in the constitution are:\n* \"We will fight for the legal protections for the environment, workers, migrants and human rights provided by EU membership. We will campaign to retain and extend all of these.\"\n* \"We stand unequivocally for continued and improved freedom of movement, and we will campaign for the rights of migrants and refugees at a time of growing domestic prejudice and international crisis.\"\n* \"We will fight against the racism, hate, border controls and right wing nationalism that have come alongside the Brexit moment, and which are part of a wider moment of far right resurgence. We aim to be a space for those parts of the progressive left who share our perspective to come together, cutting across party lines.\"\n* \"We reject the idea of \u2018Europe\u2019 as an exclusionary identity based on race and religion \u2013 the Europe we want to build is based on ties of humanity and solidarity. We campaign for freedom of movement and other fundamental rights to expand beyond just Europe to all the people of the world.\"\n\n== Activities ==\n== Organisation ==\nAnother Europe is Possible exists as a not-for-profit organization and is a limited company, incorporated on 5 May 2016.<ref>https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10165201/filing-history</ref> According to its filings with [[Companies House]], the organisation presently employs 8 people.<ref>https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-live.ch.gov.uk/docs/0QPQxujYA0VASnIMh-tDMH4E4r5CywWr_6P9FPPnBxA/application-pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAWRGBDBV3OXZG4UEQ%2F20200402%2Feu-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200402T153850Z&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjED8aCWV1LXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIEeo%2FHzczL0HjqOfobpcm7v%2F%2BdnA7K3uLZujhLxNg%2F9DAiBiLPjlB0k5uF8FJIAJBWIwcpcs3JY8bYotQoRXcVKDJyq0AwhIEAIaDDQ0OTIyOTAzMjgyMiIM571jhkd1RLJGZEmbKpEDd0vJOs1VJjzHmmf7iUeuqzyp4DZwzxo7EWfm2mfH7CWP9xVSECvUkf9brBMy%2BWUbHnH6iCHhp1tnZrWYTa9b5eYAbG4u0TZl7rceeFUEgjOzutA1I2D2ZQEgOyByN468XxEsa%2FUrKT1fwtrU3tWq0wuMLuVBs0nMGpv%2FkihaT81S%2Fv%2F1ARWQcRa3BRC1IY4TTrOUx6j4uCLR5n78KMOu32UbrqNQ%2Bp08CdfJcNgIzAg83Q0I4t3Gm6lIngUkZvkzVd0hTuHtYoW8Jp6CRoMeCIIlxU8FQhoRoLZexbAOIzviEyHrCBLOjg9uZ%2FCTJP3b9hyW5XfRgFjWjl2qyW8VmXhE9w%2Bh6zFvVcUj2pGEl1DBMTWGstIoMLWwSerKx62Z9TFNuhN79P2D2fceEagJCzROIjwvCKRRRE38dbkm9Se%2FyNcMRHzHSRCJ9vge2y9AXa2lnrT%2B0QPamn7w2XVWcyiCJLjvTgOcD4Kf19g0Gsc1UrzbiKu9amb1ZMG4w3rlcE0lN7mNwMKAwXwfP3NYRdsw9fiX9AU67AG1P2QPwO5PebPbsKjQIyMPWqW3E0hhqLxt9tzgWks0kRHvhSMsccwAubaip4Kwmoe5wQrVcyiInKYHMLCTyKh6aZpM4TiztjzwqT20Eu1E57EfiLDPY78YjZh2DdxUESmIueQo7M3e0gljKnvxJxdfTB2CzIHqjGQ9YEH8IEn2Gm2a3M7iaejhLJ7zWGLjpFMjP0CjOQiRKoliofyteZqldGu6bJjmkxX0AR4mmEQJTlg7l11D55xP%2FJ5Svb%2BPmqrq8dX%2BMWVQoQcHwqVnj2%2BwBAE%2FgRhIegB%2BCNUaCwro9tVqHXs2QtQLQJCt%2Bg%3D%3D&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=20dc3ff6a364734cc3415287c4d31f3cdd177fde63f41c11efc759d64911c24c</ref> The organisation is additionally supported by volunteers.
