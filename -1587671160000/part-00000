In 1507, Portuguese sailors visited the uninhabited island. The island appears with a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name ''Cirne'' on early Portuguese maps, probably from the name of a ship in the 1507 expedition. Another Portuguese sailor, [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Pedro Mascarenhas]], gave the name ''[[Mascarene Islands|Mascarenes]]'' to the Archipelago.\n\nIn 1598, Dutch squadron under [[Admiral]] Wybrand van Warwyck landed at [[Grand Port]] and named the island ''Mauritius'', in honour of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice van Nassau]], [[stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic]]. Later the island became a French colony and was renamed [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]].

The Dutch inhabited the island in 1638, from which they exploited [[ebony]] trees and introduced [[sugar cane]], [[domestic animals]] and [[deer]]. It was from here that Dutch navigator [[Abel Tasman]] set out to discover the western part of Australia. The first Dutch settlement lasted twenty years. Several attempts were subsequently made, but the settlements never developed enough to produce dividends, causing the Dutch to abandon Mauritius in 1710.<ref name=\"govt\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://culture.govmu.org/English//DOCUMENTS/PAMPHLET%20STRIPPED.PDF|title=History of Mauritius|publisher=Ministry of Art & Culture, Government Portal of Mauritius|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===French Mauritius (1715\u20131810)===\n{{main|Isle de France (Mauritius)}}\nFrance, which already controlled neighbouring \u00cele Bourbon (now [[R\u00e9union]]), took control of Mauritius in 1715 and renamed it [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]].

Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais established [[Port Louis]] as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nUnder his governorship, numerous buildings were erected, a number of which are still standing. These include part of Government House, the Ch\u00e2teau de Mon Plaisir, and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the [[Mauritius Police Force|police force]]. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]], which maintained its presence until 1767.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]] when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government. [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he wrote ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', a love story that made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chauss\u00e9e in Port Louis<ref name=\"Toussaint2\">Port Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. {{ISBN|0 04 969001 9}}</ref> and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne) and [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of [[Pondicherry]] in India).<ref name=\"Toussaint\">''A short History of Mauritius'', P.J. Barnwell & A. Toussaint</ref> [[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]] was a successful general in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and, in some ways, a rival of [[Napol\u00e9on I]]. He ruled as [[Governor of Isle de France (Mauritius)|Governor of Isle de France]] and R\u00e9union from 1803 to 1810. British naval [[cartographer]] and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napol\u00e9on. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Mauritius became a base from which [[French corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a [[Royal Navy]] expedition led by [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the [[Battle of Grand Port]], the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|French could not prevent the British from landing]] at [[Cap Malheureux]] three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810,<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters. Under British rule, the island's name reverted to Mauritius.<ref name=\"govt\"/> The swift conquest of Mauritius was fictionalised in the novel ''[[The Mauritius Command]]'' by [[Patrick O'Brian]], first published in 1977.\n\n===British Mauritius (1810\u20131968)===\n{{main|British Mauritius}}\n[[File:Combat de Grand Port mg 9425.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Grand Port]] between French and British naval forces, 1810]]\nThe British administration, which began with [[Robert Townsend Farquhar|Sir Robert Farquhar]] as [[Governor of British Mauritius|Governor]], led to rapid social and economic changes. However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island's slaves. He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en''), which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was R\u00e9my Ollier, a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless.<ref name=\"Dinan\">''Mauritius in the making across the censuses 1846\u20132000'', Monique Dinan. {{ISBN|99903-904-6-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\n[[File:The web of empire - a diary of the imperial tour of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 (1902) (14763807672).jpg|thumb|Duke and Duchess of [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in Mauritius, 1901]]\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. In fact, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, which included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement, which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections. In the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01 |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938.

Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but workers\u2019 salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane. This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion, and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth.\n\n===Independence (since 1968)===\n{{main|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nAt the Lancaster Conference of 1965, it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius. In 1959, [[Harold Macmillan]] had made his famous ''[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change Speech]]'' where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies. Thus, since the late Fifties, the way was paved for independence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why independence was irresistible (by Anand Moheeputh)|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/243359/|newspaper=L'Express|date=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1965, after the Lancaster Conference, the [[Chagos Archipelago]] was excised from the territory of Mauritius to form the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT). A general election took place on 7 August 1967, and the Labour Party and its two allies obtained the majority of seats.

Industrialisation began to spread to villages as well, and attracted young workers from all ethnic communities. As a result, the sugar industry began to lose its hold on the economy. Large retail chains began opening stores in 1985 and offered credit facilities to low-income earners, thus allowing them to afford basic household appliances.

The dispute was arbitrated by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]].\n\nThe sovereignty of Mauritius was explicitly recognized by two of the arbitrators and denied by none of the other three. Three members of the Tribunal found that they did not have jurisdiction to rule on that question; they expressed no view as to which of the two States has sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. Tribunal Judges [[R\u00fcdiger Wolfrum]] and James Kateka held that the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to decide this question, and concluded that UK does not have sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. They found that:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.mu/sites/lexpress/files/attachments/article/2015/2015-03/2015-03-20/mu-uk_20150318_award.pdf|title=In the Matter of the Chagos }}</ref>\n\n* internal United Kingdom documents suggested an ulterior motive behind the MPA, noting disturbing similarities and a common pattern between the establishment of the so-called \"BIOT\" in 1965 and the proclamation of the MPA in 2010;\n* the excision of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965 shows a complete disregard for the territorial integrity of Mauritius by the UK;\n* UK Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]]'s threat to Premier [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]] in 1965 that he could return home without independence if he did not consent to the excision of the Chagos Archipelago amounted to duress; Mauritian Ministers were coerced into agreeing to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago, which violated the international law of self-determination;\n* the MPA is legally invalid.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision determined that the UK's undertaking to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius gives Mauritius an interest in significant decisions that bear upon possible future uses of the Archipelago.

However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court's jurisdiction. Where the state chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways. The UK's clause deposited at the court excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the court with regard \"to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\". The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court, even if it left.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

Mauritius has a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]].\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's [[unicameral]] legislature, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Electoral Service Commission to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented. The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), which monitors member states' compliance with the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights (ICPCR), has criticised the country's Best Loser System following a complaint by a local youth and trade union movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=59556590&Country=Mauritius&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Election+watch&u=1&pid=1764509560&oid=1764509560&uid=1|title=UN Human Rights Committee criticises Best Loser System|publisher=Country.eiu.com|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref> The president is elected for a five-year term by the Parliament.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is divided into [[Constituencies of Mauritius|20 constituencies]] that return three members each, while Rodrigues is a single constituency that returns two members. After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in the representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government. Its leader becomes the Prime Minister, who selects the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition. The Assembly elects a Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Deputy Chairman of Committees as some of its first tasks.\n\nMauritius is a democracy with a government elected every five years. The most recent National Assembly Election was held on 10 December 2014 in all the 20 mainland constituencies, and in the constituency covering the island of Rodrigues.

Considered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the [[European Union]] and its member states, particularly France. Relations with India is very strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Mauritius established diplomatic relations with China in April 1972 and was forced to defend this decision, along with naval contracts with the USSR in the same year.\n\nMauritius is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[African Union]], the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], [[COMESA]], and formed the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].\n\n==Legal system==\nMauritius has an hybrid legal system derives from [[British common law]] and the [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] established the [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]] and guaranteed the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Mauritius has a single-structured judicial system consisting of two tiers, the [[Supreme Court of Mauritius|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court is composed of various divisions exercising jurisdiction such as the Master's Court, the Family Division, the Commercial Division (Bankruptcy), the Criminal Division, the Mediation Division, the Court of First Instance in civil and criminal proceedings, the Appellate jurisdiction: the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Subordinate courts consist of the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, the District Courts, the Bail and Remand Court and the Court of Rodrigues. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court of appeal of Mauritius. After the independence of Mauritius in 1968, Mauritius maintained the Privy Council as its highest court of appeal. Appeals to the Judicial Committee from decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may be as of right or with the leave of the Court, as set out in section 81 of the Constitution and section 70A of the Courts Act. The Judicial Committee may also grant special leave to appeal from the decision of any court in any civil or criminal matter as per section 81(5) of the Constitution.<ref name=\"Constitution\">{{Cite web |url=http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/constitution/Pages/constitution2016.pdf |title=Constitution of Mauritius |date=2019-10-13 |publisher=[[National Assembly (Mauritius)]] |access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Mauritius population pyramid 2011.svg|thumb|[[Population pyramid]] of Mauritius according to 2011 census]]\n{{main|Demographics of Mauritius|Religion in Mauritius}}\nThe estimated population of the Republic of Mauritius was at 1,265,985, of whom 626,341 were males and 639,644 females as at 1 July 2019.

Styles and forms introduced by Dutch, French, and British settlers from the seventeenth century onward, mixed with influences from India and East Africa, resulted in a unique hybrid architecture of international historic, social, and artistic significance. Mauritian structures present a variety of designs, materials, and decorative elements that are unique to the country and inform the historical context of the Indian Ocean and European colonialism.<ref name=\"wmf.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/traditional-architecture-mauritius|title=Traditional Architecture of Mauritius|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDecades of political, social, and economic change have resulted in the routine destruction of Mauritian architectural heritage. Between 1960 and 1980, the historic homes of the island's high grounds, known locally as campagnes, disappeared at alarming rates. More recent years have witnessed the demolition of plantations, residences, and civic buildings as they have been cleared or drastically renovated for new developments to serve an expanding tourism industry. The capital city of Port Louis remained relatively unchanged until the mid-1990s, yet now reflects the irreversible damage that has been inflicted on its built heritage. Rising land values are pitted against the cultural value of historic structures in Mauritius, while the prohibitive costs of maintenance and the steady decline in traditional building skills make it harder to invest in preservation.<ref name=\"wmf.org\"/>\n\nThe general populace historically lived in what are termed creole houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vintagemauritius.org/vintage-houses/old-colonial-creole-style-houses-mauritius-part-1/|title=Old Colonial and Creole-Style Houses in Mauritius \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Vintage Mauritius|date=6 June 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Mauritian literature}}\nProminent Mauritian writers include [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Humbert]], [[Malcolm de Chazal]], [[Ananda Devi]], [[Shenaz Patel]], [[Khal Torabully]], [[J.

These include part of Government House, the Ch\u00e2teau de Mon Plaisir, and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the [[Mauritius Police Force|police force]]. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]], which maintained its presence until 1767.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]] when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government. [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he wrote ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', a love story that made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chauss\u00e9e in Port Louis<ref name=\"Toussaint2\">Port Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. {{ISBN|0 04 969001 9}}</ref> and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne) and [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of [[Pondicherry]] in India).<ref name=\"Toussaint\">''A short History of Mauritius'', P.J.

He ruled as [[Governor of Isle de France (Mauritius)|Governor of Isle de France]] and R\u00e9union from 1803 to 1810. British naval [[cartographer]] and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napol\u00e9on. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Mauritius became a base from which [[French corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a [[Royal Navy]] expedition led by [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the [[Battle of Grand Port]], the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|French could not prevent the British from landing]] at [[Cap Malheureux]] three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810,<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters.

However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island's slaves. He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en''), which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was R\u00e9my Ollier, a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless.<ref name=\"Dinan\">''Mauritius in the making across the censuses 1846\u20132000'', Monique Dinan. {{ISBN|99903-904-6-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\n[[File:The web of empire - a diary of the imperial tour of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 (1902) (14763807672).jpg|thumb|Duke and Duchess of [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in Mauritius, 1901]]\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. In fact, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, which included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement, which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections. In the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01 |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938.

Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but workers\u2019 salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane. This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion, and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth.\n\n===Independence (since 1968)===\n{{main|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nAt the Lancaster Conference of 1965, it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius. In 1959, [[Harold Macmillan]] had made his famous ''[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change Speech]]'' where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies. Thus, since the late Fifties, the way was paved for independence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why independence was irresistible (by Anand Moheeputh)|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/243359/|newspaper=L'Express|date=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1965, after the Lancaster Conference, the [[Chagos Archipelago]] was excised from the territory of Mauritius to form the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT). A general election took place on 7 August 1967, and the Labour Party and its two allies obtained the majority of seats. In January 1968, six weeks before the declaration of independence the [[1968 Mauritian riots]] occurred in Port Louis leading to the deaths of 25 people.<ref name=\"mg\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiusmag.com/?p=598 |title=An eye witness account of the 1968 riots |website=www.mauritiusmag.com |language=en-US |access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref><ref name=\"eisa\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.eisa.org.za/wep/mauoverview7.htm |title=EISA Mauritius: The road to independence (1945\u20131968) |website=www.eisa.org.za |access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stamp Mauritius 1954 5c.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Elizabeth II]] was [[Queen of Mauritius]] from 1968 to 1992.]]\nMauritius adopted a new constitution and independence was proclaimed on 12 March 1968.

In 1969, the opposition party [[Mauritian Militant Movement]] (MMM) led by [[Paul B\u00e9renger]] was founded. Later in 1971, the MMM, backed by unions, called a series of strikes in the port, which caused a state of emergency in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13882731|publisher=BBC|title=Mauritius profile|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> The coalition government of the Labour Party and the PMSD (Parti Mauricien Social D\u00e9mocrate) reacted by curtailing civil liberties and curbing freedom of the press.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> Two unsuccessful assassination attempts were made against Paul B\u00e9renger.

However, ideological and personality differences emerged within the MMM leadership. The power struggle between B\u00e9renger and Jugnauth peaked in March 1983. Jugnauth travelled to New Delhi to attend a [[Non-Aligned Movement]] summit; on his return, B\u00e9renger proposed constitutional changes that would strip power from the Prime Minister. At Jugnauth's request, PM [[Indira Gandhi]] of India planned an armed intervention involving the [[Indian Navy]] and [[Indian Army]] to prevent a [[coup]] under the code name [[Operation Lal Dora]].<ref>{{cite news|title=When India drew Top Secret 'red line' in Mauritius|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/when-india-drew-top-secret-red-line-in-mauritius/article4493495.ece|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Medcalf|first=Rory|title=When India (Almost) Invaded Mauritius|url=http://thediplomat.com/flashpoints-blog/2013/03/19/when-india-almost-invaded-mauritius/|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=The Diplomat|date=19 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=David Brewster|url= https://www.academia.edu/7992843|title=India's Ocean: the Story of India's Bid for Regional Leadership}}.

Industrialisation began to spread to villages as well, and attracted young workers from all ethnic communities. As a result, the sugar industry began to lose its hold on the economy. Large retail chains began opening stores in 1985 and offered credit facilities to low-income earners, thus allowing them to afford basic household appliances. There was also a boom in the tourism industry, and new hotels sprang up throughout the island.

As early as 1984, there was discontent. Through the ''Newspapers and Periodicals Amendment Act'', the government tried to make every newspaper provide a bank guarantee of half a million rupees. Forty-three journalists protested by participating in a public demonstration in Port Louis, in front of Parliament. They were arrested and freed on bail. This caused a public outcry and the government had to review its policy.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThere was also dissatisfaction in the education sector. There were not enough high-quality secondary colleges to answer the growing demand of primary school leavers who had got through their CPE (Certificate of Primary Education).

However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court's jurisdiction. Where the state chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways. The UK's clause deposited at the court excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the court with regard \"to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\". The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court, even if it left.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

Mauritius has a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]].\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's [[unicameral]] legislature, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Electoral Service Commission to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented. The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), which monitors member states' compliance with the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights (ICPCR), has criticised the country's Best Loser System following a complaint by a local youth and trade union movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=59556590&Country=Mauritius&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Election+watch&u=1&pid=1764509560&oid=1764509560&uid=1|title=UN Human Rights Committee criticises Best Loser System|publisher=Country.eiu.com|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref> The president is elected for a five-year term by the Parliament.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is divided into [[Constituencies of Mauritius|20 constituencies]] that return three members each, while Rodrigues is a single constituency that returns two members. After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in the representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government. Its leader becomes the Prime Minister, who selects the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition.

Considered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the [[European Union]] and its member states, particularly France. Relations with India is very strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Mauritius established diplomatic relations with China in April 1972 and was forced to defend this decision, along with naval contracts with the USSR in the same year.\n\nMauritius is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[African Union]], the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], [[COMESA]], and formed the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].\n\n==Legal system==\nMauritius has an hybrid legal system derives from [[British common law]] and the [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] established the [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]] and guaranteed the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Mauritius has a single-structured judicial system consisting of two tiers, the [[Supreme Court of Mauritius|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court is composed of various divisions exercising jurisdiction such as the Master's Court, the Family Division, the Commercial Division (Bankruptcy), the Criminal Division, the Mediation Division, the Court of First Instance in civil and criminal proceedings, the Appellate jurisdiction: the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Subordinate courts consist of the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, the District Courts, the Bail and Remand Court and the Court of Rodrigues. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court of appeal of Mauritius. After the independence of Mauritius in 1968, Mauritius maintained the Privy Council as its highest court of appeal. Appeals to the Judicial Committee from decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may be as of right or with the leave of the Court, as set out in section 81 of the Constitution and section 70A of the Courts Act. The Judicial Committee may also grant special leave to appeal from the decision of any court in any civil or criminal matter as per section 81(5) of the Constitution.<ref name=\"Constitution\">{{Cite web |url=http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/constitution/Pages/constitution2016.pdf |title=Constitution of Mauritius |date=2019-10-13 |publisher=[[National Assembly (Mauritius)]] |access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Mauritius population pyramid 2011.svg|thumb|[[Population pyramid]] of Mauritius according to 2011 census]]\n{{main|Demographics of Mauritius|Religion in Mauritius}}\nThe estimated population of the Republic of Mauritius was at 1,265,985, of whom 626,341 were males and 639,644 females as at 1 July 2019.

Styles and forms introduced by Dutch, French, and British settlers from the seventeenth century onward, mixed with influences from India and East Africa, resulted in a unique hybrid architecture of international historic, social, and artistic significance. Mauritian structures present a variety of designs, materials, and decorative elements that are unique to the country and inform the historical context of the Indian Ocean and European colonialism.<ref name=\"wmf.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/traditional-architecture-mauritius|title=Traditional Architecture of Mauritius|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDecades of political, social, and economic change have resulted in the routine destruction of Mauritian architectural heritage. Between 1960 and 1980, the historic homes of the island's high grounds, known locally as campagnes, disappeared at alarming rates. More recent years have witnessed the demolition of plantations, residences, and civic buildings as they have been cleared or drastically renovated for new developments to serve an expanding tourism industry. The capital city of Port Louis remained relatively unchanged until the mid-1990s, yet now reflects the irreversible damage that has been inflicted on its built heritage. Rising land values are pitted against the cultural value of historic structures in Mauritius, while the prohibitive costs of maintenance and the steady decline in traditional building skills make it harder to invest in preservation.<ref name=\"wmf.org\"/>\n\nThe general populace historically lived in what are termed creole houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vintagemauritius.org/vintage-houses/old-colonial-creole-style-houses-mauritius-part-1/|title=Old Colonial and Creole-Style Houses in Mauritius \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Vintage Mauritius|date=6 June 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Mauritian literature}}\nProminent Mauritian writers include [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Humbert]], [[Malcolm de Chazal]], [[Ananda Devi]], [[Shenaz Patel]], [[Khal Torabully]], [[J.

He was discovered by [[Andy Griffith]] while working at a [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] nightclub, and he later joined ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' as [[Gomer Pyle]]. The character proved popular, and Nabors was given his own spin-off show ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' He was best known for his portrayal of Gomer Pyle, but he also became a popular guest on variety shows which showcased his rich baritone singing voice in the 1960s and 1970s, including frequent appearances on the ''[[Carol Burnett Show]]'' and two specials of his own in 1969 and 1974. He signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] in 1965 and subsequently recorded numerous albums and singles, most of them containing romantic ballads. He recorded for [[Ranwood Records]] during the late 1970s.\n\nNabors was also known for singing \"[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]\" prior to the start of the [[Indianapolis 500]], held annually over the [[Memorial Day]] weekend. He sang the unofficial Indiana anthem almost every year from 1972 to 2014, except for occasional absences due to illness or scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nabors|first1=Jim|url=http://www.jimnabors.com/NationalSportsNews/|website=Jim Nabors - Official Website|title=Jim Nabors Can't Wait To Get Back Home Again|access-date=May 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126071655/http://www.jimnabors.com/NationalSportsNews/|archive-date=January 26, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Jim|first1=Nabors|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wcgaRkHAWY|title=Jim Nabors' Last 'Back Home Again in Indiana' |year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nNabors was born in [[Sylacauga, Alabama]] on June 12, 1930<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul T.
