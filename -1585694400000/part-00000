He was also, briefly, the provisional president of Georgia in 1777, and [[Gwinnett County]] (now a major suburb of [[metropolitan Atlanta]]) was named for him. Gwinnett was killed in a duel by rival [[Lachlan McIntosh]] following a dispute after a failed invasion of [[East Florida]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Button Gwinnett.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of Button Gwinnett]]\nGwinnett was born in 1735 in the parish of [[Down Hatherley]] in the county of [[Gloucestershire]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], to a Welsh father, the Reverend Samuel Gwinnett, (Gwinnett deriving from the Welsh county of [[Gwynedd]]) and his wife, Anne. He was the third of his parents' seven children, born after his older sister Anna Maria and his older brother Samuel. There are conflicting reports as to his exact birthdate, but he was [[baptized]] in St Catherine's Church in [[Gloucester]] on April 10, 1735. It is believed that he attended the College School, held in Gloucester Cathedral (now called The King's School) as did his older brother, but there is no surviving evidence to substantiate this.  He started his career as a [[merchant]] in [[England]]. He moved to [[Wolverhampton]] in 1754, and in 1757 at age twenty-two he married a local, Ann Bourne, at [[St Peter's Collegiate Church#1660-1848: Decline and demise of the old order|St. Peter's Church]]. In 1762 the couple departed Wolverhampton and [[emigrated]] to America.\n\nGwinnett's business activities took him from Newfoundland to Jamaica. Never very successful, he moved to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in 1765 and opened a store. When that venture failed, he bought (on credit) [[St. Catherines Island|St. Catherine's Island]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Gwinnett House (Saint Catherines Island, Ga.)|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/larc/id:jlc0472|website=John Linley, Box 19|publisher=Georgia Archives|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> off the coast of Georgia, to the south of Savannah, and attempted to become a planter.

Gwinnett abandoned his mercantile pursuits, selling off all his merchandise to buy a tract of land where he started a plantation. Though unsuccessful as a planter, by 1769 he had gained such local prominence that he was elected to the Provincial Assembly.\n\nGwinnett did not become a strong advocate of colonial rights until 1775, when St. John's Parish, which encompassed his lands, threatened to secede from Georgia due to the colony's rather conservative response to the events of the times. During his tenure in the Assembly, Gwinnett's chief rival was [[Lachlan McIntosh]], and [[Lyman Hall]] was his closest ally. Gwinnett's rivalry with McIntosh began when McIntosh was appointed as brigadier general of the Georgia Continentals in 1776.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=David Lee|title=Oglethorpe and colonial Georgia : a history, 1733-1783|date=2006|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=0786422335|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iojIM25o6wkC&lpg=PA83&ots=J4ilEolbvt&dq=Gwinnett%20as%20%E2%80%9Ca%20Scoundrell%20%26%20lying%20Rascal.%E2%80%9D&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=Gwinnett%20as%20%E2%80%9Ca%20Scoundrell%20&%20lying%20Rascal.%E2%80%9D&f=false|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\nGwinnett voted in favor of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], adopted by Congress on July 2, 1776, two days before the \"fair copy,\" dated July 4, 1776, was presented to the Congress.

After signing the Declaration, he was accompanied as far as Virginia by [[Carter Braxton]], another of the signers, carrying a proposed state constitution drawn up by [[John Adams]]. During his service in the Continental Congress, Gwinnett was a candidate for a brigadier general position to lead the 1st Regiment in the [[Continental Army]], but lost out to Lachlan McIntosh.  The loss of the position to his rival embittered Gwinnett greatly.\n\nGwinnett served in the [[Georgia General Assembly|Georgia state legislature]], and in 1777 he wrote the original draft of Georgia's first State Constitution.

He is frequently bullied by the other Founding Fathers. \n\nThe rarity of Button Gwinnett's signature was a plot point in Season 6, Episode 3 the CBS show ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]''. The episode, aired on May 14, 2018, focused on the rarity of Gwinnett's signature as a motive for murder. However, lead character Sherlock Holmes got it wrong when he said Gwinnett \"died shortly after the war.\" Gwinnett actually died during the war.\n\n[[Gwinnett County, Georgia]], now a suburban area of [[Atlanta]], is named after him.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

He is frequently bullied by the other Founding Fathers. \n\nThe rarity of Button Gwinnett's signature was a plot point in Season 6, Episode 3 the CBS show ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]''. The episode, aired on May 14, 2018, focused on the rarity of Gwinnett's signature as a motive for murder. However, lead character Sherlock Holmes got it wrong when he said Gwinnett \"died shortly after the war.\" Gwinnett actually died during the war.\n\n[[Gwinnett County, Georgia]], now a suburban area of [[Atlanta]], is named after him.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

During his tenure as chairman, the Council's overhead expenses dropped from 50% to 15%, the lowest in the State, and the Arts Council budget rose from $1 million to $16 million. His council introduced the idea of artists as \"creative problem solvers.\" By paying artists to \"solve problems for the state\" rather than to make art, they bypassed the objections of many conservative lawmakers. Coyote engineered relationships with 14 departments of the State of California, which began to use artists in a variety of capacities, paying 50 cents on the dollar for it. The policy and the council were an immense success, giving Coyote the confidence (after 12 years in the counterculture) to try his hand at mainstream film-acting.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Film and television acting==\nIn 1978, Coyote began acting again (\"to shake the rust out\") appearing in plays at San Francisco's award-winning [[Magic Theatre]].

He gave supporting performances in ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981) and as the mysterious scientist \"Keys\" in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote's first starring role was in the science fiction adventure ''[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]'' (1982). He also starred in ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985) and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Bitter Moon]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[Kika (1993 film)|Kika]]''), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''), [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (''[[Bon Voyage (2003 film)|Bon Voyage]]''), [[Diane Kurys]] (''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'') and [[Walter Salles]] (''[[A Grande Arte|Exposure]]''). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'', he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] once wrote, \"Coyote's no rubber-stamp leading man\", but he seems comfortable with that. \"I'm a [[Zen]] Buddhist student first, actor second\", Coyote has said. \"If I can't reconcile the two lives, I'll stop acting.

In 2006, he developed a political television show for [[Link TV]] called \"The Active Opposition\" and in 2007 created ''Outside the Box with Peter Coyote'' starting on Link TV's special, Special: ''The End of Oil \u2013 Part 2''.\n\nMany of Coyote's stories from the 1967 to 1975 [[counter-culture]] period are included in his memoir, ''Sleeping Where I Fall,'' published by [[Counterpoint Press]] in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is \"Carla's Story,\" about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband's murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around.

Our journeys down the path along with [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], disordered our senses, senselessly wasted young lives, and often sabotaged what we labored so diligently to construct. ...

He served on the CAC from 1975 to 1983. After his first year, Coyote was elected chairman by his peers three years in a row. During his tenure as chairman, the Council's overhead expenses dropped from 50% to 15%, the lowest in the State, and the Arts Council budget rose from $1 million to $16 million. His council introduced the idea of artists as \"creative problem solvers.\" By paying artists to \"solve problems for the state\" rather than to make art, they bypassed the objections of many conservative lawmakers. Coyote engineered relationships with 14 departments of the State of California, which began to use artists in a variety of capacities, paying 50 cents on the dollar for it. The policy and the council were an immense success, giving Coyote the confidence (after 12 years in the counterculture) to try his hand at mainstream film-acting.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Film and television acting==\nIn 1978, Coyote began acting again (\"to shake the rust out\") appearing in plays at San Francisco's award-winning [[Magic Theatre]]. While playing the lead in the world premiere of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', a Hollywood agent approached him, and his film career began with ''[[Die Laughing (film)|Die Laughing]]'' (1980). He gave supporting performances in ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981) and as the mysterious scientist \"Keys\" in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote's first starring role was in the science fiction adventure ''[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]'' (1982). He also starred in ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985) and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Bitter Moon]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[Kika (1993 film)|Kika]]''), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''), [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (''[[Bon Voyage (2003 film)|Bon Voyage]]''), [[Diane Kurys]] (''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'') and [[Walter Salles]] (''[[A Grande Arte|Exposure]]''). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'', he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] once wrote, \"Coyote's no rubber-stamp leading man\", but he seems comfortable with that. \"I'm a [[Zen]] Buddhist student first, actor second\", Coyote has said. \"If I can't reconcile the two lives, I'll stop acting. I spend more time off-screen than on.\" In addition to his movie work in more recent films such as ''[[Sphere (1998 film)|Sphere]]'', ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'', and ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', Coyote has also appeared in many made-for-TV movies and miniseries, and he does commercial voice-overs. Coyote was cast in lead roles on several television series: ''[[The 4400]]'' in 2004 and ''[[The Inside (TV series)|The Inside]]'' in 2005. After ''The Inside'' was canceled, Coyote returned to ''The 4400'' as a special guest star for their two-part season finale, then joined the cast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' as the [[Vice President of the United States]], and the next year did a four episode turn as [[Sally Field]]'s disreputable boyfriend in ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.\n\n==Narration==\nIn 2005, Coyote served as the narrator for several prominent projects including the documentary film ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' and the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''-produced [[PBS]] documentary based on [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. He also narrated an episode of the series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in April 2006. In 2008, he narrated ''[[Torturing Democracy]]'', a documentary produced by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] which details the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]'s use of \"[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]\" in the [[War on Terror]]. He also narrated the 12-hour [[Ken Burns]] series on the [[The National Parks: America's Best Idea|National Parks]], and 15 episodes for the ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]'' series. In 2010 he narrated the documentary ''Solitary Confinement'' on the effect of long-term isolation, with footage taken from [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] where all prisoners are held this way. In 2014, he appeared in the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] television series ''[[Perception (American TV series)|Perception]]'', as the father of the main character, Dr. Daniel Pierce, and narrated Burns' [[The Roosevelts (miniseries)|''The Roosevelts: An Intimate History'']]; the latter saw him win his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. In 2019, he narrated Burns' PBS documentary ''[[Country Music (miniseries)]]''.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nCoyote's [[left-wing politics]] are evident in his articles for ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, some of which he wrote as a delegate to the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]]; in his disagreements with [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]; and in his autobiography ''Sleeping Where I Fall''. In 2006, he developed a political television show for [[Link TV]] called \"The Active Opposition\" and in 2007 created ''Outside the Box with Peter Coyote'' starting on Link TV's special, Special: ''The End of Oil \u2013 Part 2''.\n\nMany of Coyote's stories from the 1967 to 1975 [[counter-culture]] period are included in his memoir, ''Sleeping Where I Fall,'' published by [[Counterpoint Press]] in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is \"Carla's Story,\" about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband's murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around. This story was published in ''[[Zyzzyva (magazine)|Zyzzyva]]'', and awarded the 1993\u20131994 [[Pushcart Prize]]. He also states he was a close friend of singer [[Janis Joplin]].

The bank was originally known as the [[Bank of Alberta]], the result of an amalgamation of Western & Pacific Bank of Canada (chartered in 1982). It was co-founded by Dr. Charles Alexander Allard and Eugene I. Pechet, when the pair grew impatient with the big banks\u2019 lending routine at the time. Long banking cycles and a lack of knowledge about the unique challenges and opportunities in Western Canada stymied entrepreneurs, opening the door for Allard\u2019s and Pechet\u2019s made-at-home financial institution.\n\n== Today ==\nToday, CWB has expanded to become CWB Financial Group, which is comprised of 10 specialized banking, lending, wealth and trust companies<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwb.com/our-companies|title=CWB.com - Our Companies|last=|first=|date=March 31, 2020|website=www.cwb.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> that focus on serving small- and medium-sized business owners as well as personal clients. They have a growing national presence found in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. Its loan book is almost equally represented across BC, Alberta and Ontario<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwb.com/-/media/cwbgroup/documents/IR/Annual-Reports/2019/CWBFG-Annual-Report-2019-Full-FIN_REVISED_01-27-20.ashx|title=CWB Annual Report - 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Diversification of CWB\u2019s business lines has been a strategic priority. The bank will open its first branch in Mississauga, Ontario, a sign that CWB is poised to challenge for market share in Canada\u2019s most populous province.\n\nCWB is more conservatively capitalized than Canada\u2019s biggest banks, while having similar loan exposures.

The bank was originally known as the [[Bank of Alberta]], the result of an amalgamation of Western & Pacific Bank of Canada (chartered in 1982). It was co-founded by Dr. Charles Alexander Allard and Eugene I. Pechet, when the pair grew impatient with the big banks\u2019 lending routine at the time. Long banking cycles and a lack of knowledge about the unique challenges and opportunities in Western Canada stymied entrepreneurs, opening the door for Allard\u2019s and Pechet\u2019s made-at-home financial institution.\n\n== Today ==\nToday, CWB has expanded to become CWB Financial Group, which is comprised of 10 specialized banking, lending, wealth and trust companies<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwb.com/our-companies|title=CWB.com - Our Companies|last=|first=|date=March 31, 2020|website=www.cwb.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> that focus on serving small- and medium-sized business owners as well as personal clients.

Diversification of CWB\u2019s business lines has been a strategic priority. The bank will open its first branch in Mississauga, Ontario, a sign that CWB is poised to challenge for market share in Canada\u2019s most populous province.\n\nCWB is more conservatively capitalized than Canada\u2019s biggest banks, while having similar loan exposures.

The [[Old High German]] form of the name is recorded as ''Hessun'' (dative plural of ''Hessi''), in [[Middle Latin]] as ''Hassia'', ''Hessia'', ''Hassonia''. The name of the Hessians ultimately continues the tribal name of the ''[[Chatti]]''.<ref>[[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]], ''Our forefathers : The Gothonic nations : A manual of the ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian peoples'', vol. 2 (1933), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=0R9aAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 p. 191].</ref>\nThe ancient name ''Chatti'' by the 7th century is recorded as ''Chassi'', and from the 8th century as ''Hassi'' or ''Hessi''.<ref>\nChristian Presche, ''Kassel im Mittelalter: Zur Stadtentwicklung bis 1367'' vol. 1 (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5ZfbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p. 41].</ref>\n\nAn inhabitant of Hessen is called a \"Hessian\" (German: ''[[:wikt:Hesse#German|Hesse]]'' (masculine) or ''Hessin'' (feminine), plural ''Hessen''). \nThe [[American English]] term [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] for 18th-century British auxiliary troops originates with Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse|Frederick II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hessen-Cassel]] hiring out regular army units to the government of Great Britain to fight in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe English form ''Hesse'' was in common use by the 18th century, first in the hyphenated names ''Hesse-Cassel'' and ''Hesse-Darmstadt'', but the latinate form ''Hessia'' remained in common English usage well into the 19th century.<ref>\"The Hessians, called, in the early history of Germany, Catti, lived in the present Hessia\".

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe climate zones in Hesse are quite similar to some annual temperature differences. Especially in the Southern part, there can be even found some [[seasonal tropical forest]] climates. \n\nExamples:\n{{Climate chart\n| [[Kreis Offenbach]]\n|20.0|22.0|48.9\n|19.0|21.0|50.1\n|18.0|20.0|52.5\n|18.0|20.0|56.4\n|20.0|22.0|66.1\n|24.0|26.0|71.4\n|27.0|29.0|72.7\n|30.0|32.0|64.5\n|26.0|28.0|62.7\n|24.0|26.0|61.9\n|22.0|24.0|61.0\n|21.0|23.0|49.9\n|maxprecip = 72.7\n|float     = right\n|clear     = right\n|units     = SI\n}}\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

The [[Old High German]] form of the name is recorded as ''Hessun'' (dative plural of ''Hessi''), in [[Middle Latin]] as ''Hassia'', ''Hessia'', ''Hassonia''. The name of the Hessians ultimately continues the tribal name of the ''[[Chatti]]''.<ref>[[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]], ''Our forefathers : The Gothonic nations : A manual of the ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian peoples'', vol. 2 (1933), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=0R9aAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 p. 191].</ref>\nThe ancient name ''Chatti'' by the 7th century is recorded as ''Chassi'', and from the 8th century as ''Hassi'' or ''Hessi''.<ref>\nChristian Presche, ''Kassel im Mittelalter: Zur Stadtentwicklung bis 1367'' vol. 1 (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5ZfbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p. 41].</ref>\n\nAn inhabitant of Hessen is called a \"Hessian\" (German: ''[[:wikt:Hesse#German|Hesse]]'' (masculine) or ''Hessin'' (feminine), plural ''Hessen''). \nThe [[American English]] term [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] for 18th-century British auxiliary troops originates with Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse|Frederick II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hessen-Cassel]] hiring out regular army units to the government of Great Britain to fight in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe English form ''Hesse'' was in common use by the 18th century, first in the hyphenated names ''Hesse-Cassel'' and ''Hesse-Darmstadt'', but the latinate form ''Hessia'' remained in common English usage well into the 19th century.<ref>\"The Hessians, called, in the early history of Germany, Catti, lived in the present Hessia\".

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\n==== CLimate ====\nThe climate zones in Hesse are quite similar to some annual temperature differences. Especially in the Southern part, there can be even found some [[seasonal tropical forest]] climates. \n\nExamples:\n{{Climate chart\n| [[Kreis Offenbach]]\n|20.0|22.0|48.9\n|19.0|21.0|50.1\n|18.0|20.0|52.5\n|18.0|20.0|56.4\n|20.0|22.0|66.1\n|24.0|26.0|71.4\n|27.0|29.0|72.7\n|30.0|32.0|64.5\n|26.0|28.0|62.7\n|24.0|26.0|61.9\n|22.0|24.0|61.0\n|21.0|23.0|49.9\n|float=right\n|clear=right\n}}\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area. The administrative regions have no legislature of their own, but are executive agencies of the state government.\n\n[[File:Map of Hesse with districts (with numbers).svg|frameless|upright=1.45]]\n[[File:0472-0490R-Hessische Staatskanzlei.jpg|thumb|The state chancellery building in the capital city of [[Wiesbaden]]]]\n[[File:FrankfurtSkyline2014.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Schlosspark Wilhelmsh\u00f6he 001.jpg|thumb|[[Kassel]]]]\n[[File:Luisenplatz.jpg|thumb|[[Darmstadt]]]]\n[[File:Offenbach am main from drone.jpg|thumb|[[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach am Main]]]]\nHesse is divided into 21 districts (Kreise) and five independent cities, each with their own local governments.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

HR provides a statewide TV channel as well as a range of regional radio stations (HR&nbsp;1, HR&nbsp;2, HR&nbsp;3, HR&nbsp;4, you&nbsp;fm and HR&nbsp;info). Besides the state run HR, privately run TV stations exist and are an important line of commerce. Among the commercial radio stations that are active in Hesse, Hit Radio FFH, Planet Radio, Harmony FM, Radio BOB and Antenne Frankfurt are the most popular.\n\n== Economy ==\nWith Hesse's largest city [[Frankfurt am Main]] being home of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Bundesbank|German Bundesbank]] and the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], Hesse is home to the financial capital of mainland Europe. Furthermore, Hesse has always been one of the largest and healthiest economies in Germany. Its [[GDP]] in 2013 exceeded \u20ac236&nbsp;billion (about US$316&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|title=Bruttoinlandsprodukt|publisher=Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt|year=2012|work=Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnungen|accessdate=27 March 2013|language=de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120914010546/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|archivedate=14 September 2012}}</ref> This makes Hesse itself one of the largest economies in Europe and the 38th largest in the world.<ref>See the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)]].</ref> According to GDP-per-capita figures, Hesse is the wealthiest state (after the [[city-state]]s [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]) in Germany with approx. US$52,500.\n\nThe [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]] has the second largest industrial density in Germany after the [[Ruhr area]]. The main economic fields of importance are the [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries with [[Sanofi]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], [[Heraeus]], [[Messer Griesheim]] and [[Degussa]]. In the mechanical and automotive engineering field [[Opel]] in R\u00fcsselsheim is worth mentioning. Frankfurt is crucial as a [[financial center]], with both the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]'s headquarters located there. Numerous smaller banks and [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[KfW|KfW Bank]], [[Commerzbank]] are also headquartered in Frankfurt, with the offices of several international banks also being housed there. Frankfurt is also the location of the most important German stock exchange, the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. [[Insurance]] companies have settled mostly in [[Wiesbaden]]. The city's largest private employer is the [[R+V Versicherung]], with about 3,900 employees, other major employers are [[Winterthur Group|DBV-Winterthur]], the [[SV SparkassenVersicherung]] and the [[Delta Lloyd Group]]. The leather industry is predominantly settled in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]].

[[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Road transport ===\nHesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]], adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s.\n\n=== Railway transport ===\nHesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[K\u00f6ln\u2013Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne\u2013Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg high-speed railway|Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]]. Other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

Upon Louis' death in 840, it passed to his son [[Lothair I|Lothair]], who had been his co-ruler. By this point the territory of Charlemagne had been divided into several territories, and over the course of the later ninth century the title of Emperor was disputed by the Carolingian rulers of [[Western Francia]] and [[Eastern Francia]], with first the western king ([[Charles the Bald]]) and then the eastern ([[Charles the Fat]]), who briefly reunited the Empire, attaining the prize; however, after the death of Charles the Fat in 888 the Carolingian Empire broke apart, and was never restored.

The Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen dynasty ===\n[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Hohenstaufen-ruled Holy Roman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2Zsef |date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAlbert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.\n\nInstead, Henry VII, of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n{{Further|Late Middle Ages|Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages}}\n\n==== Rise of the territories after the Hohenstaufens ====\nThe difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of [[prince-elector]]s (''Kurf\u00fcrsten''), whose composition and procedures were set forth in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], which remained valid until 1806. This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite journal|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Deutschland im XVI.

This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\").\nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495.\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nThe Holy Roman Empire never had a single permanent/fixed [[capital city]].

The larger principalities in the HRE, beginning around 1648, also did the same. The HRE did not have its own dedicated ministry of foreign affairs and therefore the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] had no control over these diplomats; occasionally the Diet criticised them.<ref name=Wilsonp70>Wilson, Peter H.

Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follows:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;\n* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;\n* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.</ref>\n\nA credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follows:<ref>Whaley, vol.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a \"normal year\". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion. For the first time, the permanent nature of the division between the Christian Churches of the empire was more or less assumed.<ref>Whaley (2012), vol. I, p. 624\u2013625.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a [[History of the Jews in Germany#In the Holy Roman Empire|Jewish minority]] existed in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Holy Roman Empire}}\n* [[List of German monarchs]]\n* [[Carolingian Empire]]\n* [[Family tree of the German monarchs]]\n* [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*[[Eamon Duffy|Duffy, Eamon]]. 1997.

Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2Zsef |date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAlbert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.\n\nInstead, Henry VII, of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n{{Further|Late Middle Ages|Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages}}\n\n==== Rise of the territories after the Hohenstaufens ====\nThe difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of [[prince-elector]]s (''Kurf\u00fcrsten''), whose composition and procedures were set forth in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], which remained valid until 1806. This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite journal|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Deutschland im XVI.

This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\").\nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495.\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nThe Holy Roman Empire never had a single permanent/fixed [[capital city]]. Usually, the Holy Roman Emperor ruled from a place of his own choice.<ref name=Thelocalgermancapitals/> This was called an imperial seat.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Seats of the Holy Roman Emperor included: [[Aachen]] (from 794), [[Palermo]] (1220\u20131254), [[Munich]] (1328\u20131347 and 1744\u20131745), [[Prague]] (1355\u20131437 and 1576\u20131611), [[Brussels]] (1516\u20131556), [[Vienna]] (1438\u20131576, 1611\u20131740 and 1745\u20131806) and [[Frankfurt am Main]] (1742\u20131744) among other cities.\n\nThe [[Aulic Council]] (''Reichshofrat'') resided in [[Vienna]].\n\nThe ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' resided in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Speyer]] and [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]] before it was moved permanently to [[Wetzlar]].\n\nThe [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (''Reichstag'') resided variously in [[Paderborn]], [[Bad Lippspringe]], [[Ingelheim am Rhein]], [[Diedenhofen]] (now [[Thionville]]), [[Aachen]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Forchheim]], [[Trebur]], [[Fritzlar]], [[Ravenna]], [[Quedlinburg]], [[Dortmund]], [[Verona]], [[Minden]], [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Merseburg]], [[Goslar]], [[W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Bamberg]], [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], [[Speyer]], [[Gelnhausen]], [[Erfurt]], [[Cheb|Eger]] (now [[Cheb]]), [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], [[Lindau]], [[Freiburg]], [[Cologne]], [[Konstanz]] and [[Trier]] before it was moved permanently to [[Regensburg]].<ref>Anton Schindling (1986), \"The Development of the Eternal Diet in Regensburg\", ''The Journal of Modern History'', 58:64. {{doi|10.1086/243149}}</ref>\n\n[[Imperial election]]s were mostly held in Frankfurt am Main, but also took place in [[Augsburg]], [[Rhens]], [[Cologne]] and [[Regensburg]]. Going as far as into the 16th century, the elected Holy Roman Emperor was then [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] and appointed by the Pope in [[Rome]], but individual coronations also happened in [[Ravenna]], [[Bologna]] and [[Reims]].\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\nThe [[Habsburg]] royal family had its own diplomats to represent its interests. The larger principalities in the HRE, beginning around 1648, also did the same. The HRE did not have its own dedicated ministry of foreign affairs and therefore the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] had no control over these diplomats; occasionally the Diet criticised them.<ref name=Wilsonp70>Wilson, Peter H.

Regensburg was the place where envoys met as it was where representatives of the Diet could be reached.<ref name=Harterp122etal/><!--Note that page 122 discusses which countries sent envoys, and page 132 discusses why Regensburg was chosen-->\n\n== Demographics ==\n===Population===\nOverall population figures for the Holy Roman Empire are extremely vague and vary widely. Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follows:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;\n* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;\n* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.</ref>\n\nA credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follows:<ref>Whaley, vol. II, p. 351.</ref>\n\n* 9 million Austrian subjects (including Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia);\n* 4 million Prussian subjects;\n* 14\u201315 million inhabitants for the rest of the Empire.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\nLargest cities or towns of the Empire by year:\n* '''1050''': [[Regensburg]] 40,000 people.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a \"normal year\". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion. For the first time, the permanent nature of the division between the Christian Churches of the empire was more or less assumed.<ref>Whaley (2012), vol. I, p. 624\u2013625.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a [[History of the Jews in Germany#In the Holy Roman Empire|Jewish minority]] existed in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Holy Roman Empire}}\n* [[List of German monarchs]]\n* [[Carolingian Empire]]\n* [[Family tree of the German monarchs]]\n* [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*[[Eamon Duffy|Duffy, Eamon]]. 1997.
