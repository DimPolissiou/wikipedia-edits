Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales.

This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.\n\n====Scottish Division====\nThe six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].\n*Armoured Infantry ([[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)|4 SCOTS]]) - 1\n*Light Role ([[Royal Scots Borderers|1 SCOTS]], [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2 SCOTS]], [[Black Watch|3 SCOTS]]) - 3\n*Air Assault/Light Role ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|5 SCOTS]]) - 1\n\n====King's Division====\nThe six battalions of the King's Division have amalgamated into two regiments;\n*[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)]] - this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]], [[King's Regiment]] and [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]].\n**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) - 1\n**Light Role (2 LANCS) - 1\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment]] - this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]], [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]].\n**Armoured Infantry ([[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|3 YORKS]]) - 1\n**Light Role ([[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire|1 YORKS]], [[Green Howards|2 YORKS]])- 2\n\n====Prince of Wales's Division====\nThe original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales's Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] to the Light Division.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force.

Two notable ones depicting the modern British Army have been ''[[Spearhead (TV series)|Spearhead]]'' from the period of the late 1970s, and ''[[Soldier Soldier]]'' from the early to mid-1990s. Both are seen as reasonably accurate depictions of life in the army at those times, and both are centred on a fictional infantry regiment.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.\n\n====Scottish Division====\nThe six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].\n*Armoured Infantry ([[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)|4 SCOTS]]) - 1\n*Light Role ([[Royal Scots Borderers|1 SCOTS]], [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2 SCOTS]], [[Black Watch|3 SCOTS]]) - 3\n*Air Assault/Light Role ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|5 SCOTS]]) - 1\n\n====King's Division====\nThe six battalions of the King's Division have amalgamated into two regiments;\n*[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)]] - this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]], [[King's Regiment]] and [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]].\n**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) - 1\n**Light Role (2 LANCS) - 1\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment]] - this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]], [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]].\n**Armoured Infantry ([[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|3 YORKS]]) - 1\n**Light Role ([[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire|1 YORKS]], [[Green Howards|2 YORKS]])- 2\n\n====Prince of Wales's Division====\nThe original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales's Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] to the Light Division.

These two were amalgamated into a single battalion and then amalgamated with [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]] and the [[Royal Green Jackets]] to form a new five battalion regiment, called [[The Rifles]]. On its formation, the Light Division was abolished.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm The Rifles - March 2006 situation report 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515082627/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm |date=15 May 2006 }}</ref>\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role (2 RIFLES, 3 RIFLES) - 2\n*Mechanised Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Commando (1 RIFLES) - 1\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n\n* The single regular battalion of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] is unamalgamated to \"retain an infantry footprint in Northern Ireland\".\n**Air Assault/Light Role (1 R IRISH) - 1\n* The [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] is unaffected by the restructuring.

The Guards Division has The London Regiment as an affiliated TA battalion.\n\n===Strategic Defence and Security Review (2010)/Army 2020===\n{{main|Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Army 2020}}\nFollowing the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]], the new government instituted a new defence review. The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment.

They were produced by a group of amateur animators known as Daicon Film, who would later go on to form the animation studio [[Gainax]]. The films are known for their unusually high production values for amateur works and for including numerous references to [[otaku]] culture, as well as its unauthorized appropriations of both the [[Playboy Bunny]] costume and the 1981 song \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\" by the English [[rock music|rock]] band [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]].\n\n''Daicon III'' was made by [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Hiroyuki Yamaga]] and [[Takami Akai]] and ''Daicon IV'' credits twelve people, including Yamaga as the director and Anno and Akai as animation supervisors. Despite the questionable legal status of the works, the production of ''Daicon III'' resulted in debts that were repaid by selling video tapes and 8mm reels of the production, the profits of which went to the production of ''Daicon IV''. In 2001, the anime magazine ''[[Animage]]'' ranked the ''Daicon'' animations as the 35th of the \"Top 100\" anime of all time.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===''Daicon III Opening Animation''===\nThe Jet VTOL ship from ''[[Ultraman]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Science Patrol descends out of the sky toward Earth, as a school girl, carrying her ''[[randoseru]]'', observes from behind a tree. The Science Patrol offer the girl a cup of water and ask her to deliver it to \"DAICON\". The girl salutes and races away, but she quickly experiences trouble as ''Punk Dragon'' blocks her path. He summons a [[mecha]] from ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and it and the girl begin battling. The girl tosses the mecha aside and [[Gomora (Ultra monster)|Gomora]] rises from the earth. Using a booster concealed in her backpack, the girl flies up into the sky and evades Gomora's blast, with the mecha flying after her. They continue their battle in mid-air. A blow from the mecha sends the girl falling, imperiling her cup of water. At the last moment, she has a vision of the Science Patrol and regains consciousness. She snatches the cup before it crashes to the ground. Resuming her battle with the mecha, she catches one of its missiles and hurls it back at the mecha, causing a huge explosion. The destroyed mecha launches a rocket, summoning [[Godzilla]] with the [[Space Runaway Ideon|Ideon]] symbol. With [[King Ghidorah]] and [[Gamera]] chasing her, the girl flies through the air with her jet-propelled backpack. A [[Star Destroyer]], a [[TIE fighter]], and [[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|Martian fighting machines]] from the film ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953) cross the background. Reaching into her backpack, the girl pulls out a bamboo ruler, which magically becomes a [[lightsaber]]. After slicing an [[Alien Baltan]] in half, the girl launches a number of miniature missiles from her backpack. Hit by one of the missiles, a Maser Tank from [[Godzilla (franchise)|the ''Godzilla'' series]] catches fire. The ''[[Atragon]]'' breaks in two as the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'', the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS Enterprise]]'', an [[X-wing fighter]] and [[Daimajin]] explode in complete chaos. The girl pours her cup of water on a shriveled [[daikon]] buried in the ground. As the daikon absorbs the water, it turns into the spaceship ''Daicon''. Bathed in light, and now wearing a naval uniform, the girl boards the ship, where the film's producers, [[Toshio Okada]] and [[Yasuhiro Takeda]], sit at the controls. As the landing gear retracts, ''Daicon'' departs for the far reaches of the universe.\n\n===''Daicon IV Opening Animation''===\nThe ''Daicon IV Opening Animation'' begins with an abridged, 90-second retelling of the ''Daicon III Opening Animation'' set to \"Noah's Ark\" by [[Kitar\u014d]] from the album, ''Silver Cloud''.{{Not in citation|date=April 2018}} After this, \"Prologue\" by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] is heard, while the lyrics appear against a starfield and an outline of the spaceship ''Daicon'' passes in the background. The film proper begins as \"Prologue\" segues into \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\", the song which follows it on the album ''[[Time (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Time]]''.<ref name=LittleB/>\n\nThe girl from the previous animation is now an adult, wearing a [[Playboy bunny|bunny costume]]. She fights off a multitude of sci-fi monsters{{ref label|fight|a|}} and [[Gundam|mobile suits]] then jumps into a throng of Metron Seijin and tosses them aside.{{ref label|aside|b|}} She is then in a lightsaber duel with [[Darth Vader]], with [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]] sitting in the background and the [[Death Star]] enshrined in one corner. From atop a cliff, a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] with artificial legs, wielding the [[Discovery One]], knocks the girl down with an energy burst and the [[Dynaman]] robot (Dyna Robo) attempts to crush her. The girl lifts Dyna Robo off her with superhuman strength and smashes it against a cliff. The [[Stormbringer]] suddenly appears in the sky, and the girl jumps on it, riding it like a surfboard. A few scenes unconnected to the main plot are shown, such as [[Yoda]] as ''Y\u016b Ida'' given a Japanese comedy routine with various characters in the audience.{{ref label|audience|c|}} The girl is still riding the Stormbringer when she runs into a formation of Ultrahawk 1's. Then the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'', the ''[[Arcadia of My Youth|Arcadia]]'' attached to the transformed [[SDF-1 Macross]] appear, along with an exploding [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] [[variable fighter]] from ''[[Macross]]'' armed with a [[Mobile Suit Gundam|''Gundam'']]-style beam saber. An air battle unfolds in an ''otaku'' coffee shop. The girl is then seen in a world filled with American comic superheroes.{{ref label|superheroes|d|}} A host of machines and characters (from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]]'', ''[[Dragonriders of Pern|Pern]]'', and others) fly past her into space, including a [[Klingon]] battle cruiser, the moon ship from [[H.

They were produced by a group of amateur animators known as Daicon Film, who would later go on to form the animation studio [[Gainax]]. The films are known for their unusually high production values for amateur works and for including numerous references to [[otaku]] culture, as well as its unauthorized appropriations of both the [[Playboy Bunny]] costume and the 1981 song \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\" by the English [[rock music|rock]] band [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]].\n\n''Daicon III'' was made by [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Hiroyuki Yamaga]] and [[Takami Akai]] and ''Daicon IV'' credits twelve people, including Yamaga as the director and Anno and Akai as animation supervisors. Despite the questionable legal status of the works, the production of ''Daicon III'' resulted in debts that were repaid by selling video tapes and 8mm reels of the production, the profits of which went to the production of ''Daicon IV''. In 2001, the anime magazine ''[[Animage]]'' ranked the ''Daicon'' animations as the 35th of the \"Top 100\" anime of all time.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===''Daicon III Opening Animation''===\nThe Jet VTOL ship from ''[[Ultraman]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Science Patrol descends out of the sky toward Earth, as a school girl, carrying her ''[[randoseru]]'', observes from behind a tree. The Science Patrol offer the girl a cup of water and ask her to deliver it to \"DAICON\". The girl salutes and races away, but she quickly experiences trouble as ''Punk Dragon'' blocks her path. He summons a [[mecha]] from ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and it and the girl begin battling. The girl tosses the mecha aside and [[Gomora (Ultra monster)|Gomora]] rises from the earth. Using a booster concealed in her backpack, the girl flies up into the sky and evades Gomora's blast, with the mecha flying after her. They continue their battle in mid-air. A blow from the mecha sends the girl falling, imperiling her cup of water. At the last moment, she has a vision of the Science Patrol and regains consciousness. She snatches the cup before it crashes to the ground. Resuming her battle with the mecha, she catches one of its missiles and hurls it back at the mecha, causing a huge explosion. The destroyed mecha launches a rocket, summoning [[Godzilla]] with the [[Space Runaway Ideon|Ideon]] symbol. With [[King Ghidorah]] and [[Gamera]] chasing her, the girl flies through the air with her jet-propelled backpack. A [[Star Destroyer]], a [[TIE fighter]], and [[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|Martian fighting machines]] from the film ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953) cross the background. Reaching into her backpack, the girl pulls out a bamboo ruler, which magically becomes a [[lightsaber]]. After slicing an [[Alien Baltan]] in half, the girl launches a number of miniature missiles from her backpack. Hit by one of the missiles, a Maser Tank from [[Godzilla (franchise)|the ''Godzilla'' series]] catches fire. The ''[[Atragon]]'' breaks in two as the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'', the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS Enterprise]]'', an [[X-wing fighter]] and [[Daimajin]] explode in complete chaos. The girl pours her cup of water on a shriveled [[daikon]] buried in the ground. As the daikon absorbs the water, it turns into the spaceship ''Daicon''. Bathed in light, and now wearing a naval uniform, the girl boards the ship, where the film's producers, [[Toshio Okada]] and [[Yasuhiro Takeda]], sit at the controls. As the landing gear retracts, ''Daicon'' departs for the far reaches of the universe.\n\n===''Daicon IV Opening Animation''===\nThe ''Daicon IV Opening Animation'' begins with an abridged, 90-second retelling of the ''Daicon III Opening Animation'' set to \"Noah's Ark\" by [[Kitar\u014d]] from the album, ''Silver Cloud''.{{Not in citation|date=April 2018}} After this, \"Prologue\" by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] is heard, while the lyrics appear against a starfield and an outline of the spaceship ''Daicon'' passes in the background. The film proper begins as \"Prologue\" segues into \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\", the song which follows it on the album ''[[Time (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Time]]''.<ref name=LittleB/>\n\nThe girl from the previous animation is now an adult, wearing a [[Playboy bunny|bunny costume]]. She fights off a multitude of sci-fi monsters{{ref label|fight|a|}} and [[Gundam|mobile suits]] then jumps into a throng of Metron Seijin and tosses them aside.{{ref label|aside|b|}} She is then in a lightsaber duel with [[Darth Vader]], with [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]] sitting in the background and the [[Death Star]] enshrined in one corner. From atop a cliff, a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] with artificial legs, wielding the [[Discovery One]], knocks the girl down with an energy burst and the [[Dynaman]] robot (Dyna Robo) attempts to crush her. The girl lifts Dyna Robo off her with superhuman strength and smashes it against a cliff. The [[Stormbringer]] suddenly appears in the sky, and the girl jumps on it, riding it like a surfboard. A few scenes unconnected to the main plot are shown, such as [[Yoda]] as ''Y\u016b Ida'' given a Japanese comedy routine with various characters in the audience.{{ref label|audience|c|}} The girl is still riding the Stormbringer when she runs into a formation of Ultrahawk 1's. Then the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'', the ''[[Arcadia of My Youth|Arcadia]]'' attached to the transformed [[SDF-1 Macross]] appear, along with an exploding [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] [[variable fighter]] from ''[[Macross]]'' armed with a [[Mobile Suit Gundam|''Gundam'']]-style beam saber. An air battle unfolds in an ''otaku'' coffee shop. The girl is then seen in a world filled with American comic superheroes.{{ref label|superheroes|d|}} A host of machines and characters (from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]]'', ''[[Dragonriders of Pern|Pern]]'', and others) fly past her into space, including a [[Klingon]] battle cruiser, the moon ship from [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[First Men in the Moon]]'', the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', ''[[The White Dragon (novel)|Lord Jaxom]]'' and the [[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]].{{ref label|space|e|}} Once back on land, the girl jumps off the Stormbringer and it splits into seven parts, which fly though the sky spewing smoke in seven colors. A sequence of famous spaceships crashing into each other is shown.<!----At the foot of [[Mt.
