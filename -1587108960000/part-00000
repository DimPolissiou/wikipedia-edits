His [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) playing career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the [[Oakland Athletics]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], winning one [[World Series]] championship each with Oakland as a player in [[1989 World Series|1989]] and with St. Louis as a coach in [[2011 World Series|2011]].  One of the most prolific [[home run]] hitters in baseball history, McGwire holds the major league career record for [[at bats per home run]] ratio (10.6), and is the former record holder for both [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|home runs in a single season]] (70 in 1998) and home runs hit by rookie (49 in 1987).  \n\nHe ranks 11th all time in [[home run]]s with 583, and led the major leagues in home runs in five different seasons, while establishing the major league record for home runs hit in a four-season period from 1996 to 1999 with 245.  Further, he demonstrated exemplary patience as a batter, producing a career .394 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and twice leading the major leagues in [[bases on balls]].  Injuries cut short the manifestation of even greater potential as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons.

He hit just four in the month of April, but followed in May with 15, and another nine in June. Before the All-Star break arrived, he totaled 33 HR and earned a spot on the [[American League]] (AL) [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]]. On August 11, he broke [[Al Rosen]]'s AL rookie record of 37 home runs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708140841/http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|date=August 10, 2008}}</ref>  Three days later, McGwire broke the major league record of 38, which [[Frank Robinson]] and [[Wally Berger]] jointly held. In September, McGwire hit nine more home runs while posting monthly personal bests of a .351 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], .419 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and 11 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (2B). With 49 HR and two games remaining in the regular season, he chose to sit them out with an opportunity for 50 home runs to be present for the birth of his first child. McGwire also totaled 118 [[runs batted in]] (RBI), .289 batting average, 97 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored, 28 doubles, a .618 [[slugging percentage]] and a .370 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP). McGwire's 49 home runs as a rookie stood as a major league record until [[Aaron Judge]] hit 52 for the [[New York Yankees]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/yankees-aaron-judge-sets-rookie-hr-record-mark-mcgwire/xyqbr125vm8k13f1ips4sg1nl|title=Yankees' Aaron Judge breaks Mark McGwire's rookie HR record|date=2017-09-26|work=Sporting News|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>\n\nNot only did he lead the AL in home runs in 1987, but he also tied for the major league lead with [[1987 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] right fielder [[Andre Dawson]]. McGwire also led the major leagues in SLG, finished second in the AL in adjusted [[on-base plus slugging]] percentage (OPS+, 164) total bases (344), third in RBI and on-base plus slugging (OPS, .987). He was thus a unanimous choice for the AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] and finished sixth overall in the AL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] voting.\n\n====More All-Star appearances (1988\u201391)====\n\n[[File:Mark McGwire 1989.jpg|thumb|left|McGwire with the A's, 1989]]\n\nFrom [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|1988]] to [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|1990]], McGwire followed with 32, 33, and 39 home runs, respectively, becoming the first Major Leaguer to hit 30+ home runs in each of his first four full seasons.<ref name=\"BaseballRefMain\">{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mcgwima01.shtml |title=Mark McGwire Statistics |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  On July 3 and 4, 1988, he hit game-winning home runs in the 16th inning of both games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TOR/TOR198807030.shtml |title=July 3, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Toronto Blue Jays play by play and box score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=July 3, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE198807040.shtml |title=July 4, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Cleveland Indians Jays play by play and box score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=July 4, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Through May 2009, McGwire was tied for third all-time with [[Joe DiMaggio]] in home runs over his first two calendar years in the major leagues (71), behind [[Chuck Klein]] (83) and [[Ryan Braun]] (79).<ref>[https://nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=1633915 Sandler, Jeremy, \"NL Weekly: The Notebook\", National Post, May 27, 2009, accessed 5/28/09]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nMcGwire's most famous home run with the A's was likely his game-winning solo shot in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3 of the [[1988 World Series]] against the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and former A's [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Jay Howell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198810180.shtml |title=October 18, 1988 World Series Game 3 at Network Associates Coliseum Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=October 18, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire's game-winner brought the A's their only victory in the 1988 World Series, which they lost in five games; however, McGwire and his fellow [[Bash Brother]], [[Jos\u00e9 Canseco]], played a large part in the 1989 championship club that defeated the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the famous \"[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1989_WS.shtml |title=1989 World Series \u2013 OAK vs. SFG |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWorking diligently on his defense at first base, McGwire bristled at the notion that he was a one-dimensional player. He was generally regarded as a good fielder in his early years, even winning a [[Gold Glove Award]] in [[1990 Major League Baseball season|1990]] \u2013 the only one that [[New York Yankees]] legend [[Don Mattingly]] would not win between [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985]] and [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994]]. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense; however, McGwire's batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to .260, .231, and .235 from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, he bottomed out with a .201 average and 22 homers. [[List of Oakland Athletics managers|Manager]] [[Tony La Russa]] sat him out the final game of the [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|season]] to avoid allowing his batting average to dip below .200. Despite the declining averages during this time of his career, his high [[bases on balls]] totals allowed him to maintain acceptable OBPs. In fact, when he hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, or just over league average.\n\nMcGwire stated in an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that 1991 was the \"worst year\" of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, and that he \"didn't lift a weight\" that entire season. With all that behind him, McGwire re-dedicated himself to working out harder than ever and received visual therapy from a sports vision specialist.<ref>[http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf] https://web.archive.org/web/20150701040841/http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |work=CNN |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |title=Oakland's Mark McGwire is smiling again, now that he's hitting homers at a record pace |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104193550/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====Career resurgence (1992\u201397)====\n\nThe \"new look\" McGwire hit 42 homers and batted .268 in 1992, with an outstanding OPS+ of 175 (the highest of his career to that point), and put on a home run hitting show at the [[Home Run Derby]] during the [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992 All-Star break]]. His performance propelled the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to the American League West Division title in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The A's lost in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|playoffs]] to the eventual [[1992 World Series|World Series]] champion, the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]].\n\nFoot injuries limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in [[1993 Oakland Athletics season|1993]] and [[1994 Oakland Athletics season|1994]], and just 9 home runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in [[1995 Oakland Athletics season|1995]], but his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. In [[1996 Oakland Athletics season|1996]], McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging percentage and on-base percentage.\n\nMcGwire's total of 363 home runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine [[American League]] All-Star Teams while playing for the A's, including six consecutive appearances from [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]] through [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992]].

In 51 games with the Cardinals to finish the 1997 season, McGwire compiled a .253 batting average, 24 home runs, and 42 RBI. Overall in 1997, McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs. He also finished third in the major leagues in slugging percentage (.646), fourth in OPS (1.039), fifth in OPS+ (170), tenth in RBI (123), and ninth in walks (101). He placed 16th in the NL MVP voting.\n\nIt was the last year of his contract, so there was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lived; however, McGwire signed a contract to stay in St. Louis. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged [[Jim Edmonds]], another Southern California resident who was traded to St. Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000.\n\n====Single-season home run record chase (1998)====\n\nAs the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998 season]] progressed, it became clear that McGwire, [[1998 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] outfielder [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[1998 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Sammy Sosa]] were all on track to break [[Roger Maris]]'s single-season home run record. [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|The race to break the record]] first attracted media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire; however, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn September 8, 1998, McGwire hit a pitch by the Cubs' [[Steve Trachsel]] over the left field wall for his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting off massive celebrations at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The fact that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Maris's family were also present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMcGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs (including five in his last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a record that was broken three seasons later in 2001 by [[Barry Bonds]] with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified/>\n\nMcGwire was honored with the inaugural [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading Major League Baseball in home runs.<ref name=harber>{{cite news|last=Harber|first=Paul|title=A statue fit for a home run king|date=July 22, 2001|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602104753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2011|quote=The first award was given to Mark McGwire after his 70-home-run season in 1998.}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa (who had fewer HR but more RBI and stolen bases) won the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the [[1998 National League Division Series|playoffs]] (the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in 1998 finished third in the NL Central).

For the fourth consecutive season, he led MLB in home runs with 65. It was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 50 home runs, extending his own major league record. Sosa, who hit 63 home runs in 1999, again trailed McGwire. Thus, they became the first, and still only, players in major league history to hit 60 or more home runs in consecutive seasons. McGwire also set a record from 1998 to 1999 for home runs in a two-season period with 135. Further, he owned the highest four-season HR total, with 245 from 1996 to 1999. In 1999, he drove in an NL-leading 147 runs while only having 145 hits, the highest RBI-per-hit tally for a season in baseball history.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nStatistically in 2000 and 2001, McGwire's numbers declined relative to previous years as he struggled to avoid injury (32 HR in 89 games, and 29 HR in 97 games, respectively).

Further, in each of those four seasons, he exceeded 50 home runs, becoming the first player to do so. He was also the first player to hit 49 or more home runs five times, including his rookie-season record of 49 in 1987.

baseball]] [[first baseman]]. His [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) playing career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the [[Oakland Athletics]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], winning one [[World Series]] championship each with Oakland as a player in [[1989 World Series|1989]] and with St. Louis as a coach in [[2011 World Series|2011]].  One of the most prolific [[home run]] hitters in baseball history, McGwire holds the major league career record for [[at bats per home run]] ratio (10.6), and is the former record holder for both [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|home runs in a single season]] (70 in 1998) and home runs hit by rookie (49 in 1987).  \n\nHe ranks 11th all time in [[home run]]s with 583, and led the major leagues in home runs in five different seasons, while establishing the major league record for home runs hit in a four-season period from 1996 to 1999 with 245.  Further, he demonstrated exemplary patience as a batter, producing a career .394 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and twice leading the major leagues in [[bases on balls]].  Injuries cut short the manifestation of even greater potential as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons.  A right-handed batter and thrower, McGwire stood {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|245|lb}} during his playing career.\n\nA part of the [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase]] of [[Roger Maris]]' 61 with the Cardinals, McGwire set the [[Major League Baseball single-season home run record|major league single-season home run record]] with 70,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_progress.shtml |title=Progressive Leaders & Records for Home Runs |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> which [[Barry Bonds]] broke three years later with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594 |title=\"Bonds testified that substances didn't work\", ESPN.com, December 4, 2004, accessed 02/03/11 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 4, 2004 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire also led the league in [[runs batted in]], twice in [[bases on balls]] and [[on-base percentage]], and four times in [[slugging percentage]]. Injuries significantly cut into his playing time in 2000 and 2001 before factoring into his retirement. He finished with 583 home runs, which was [[500 home run club|fifth all-time]] when he retired.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcgwima01.shtml|title=Mark McGwire Stats {{!}} Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nMcGwire was a central figure in baseball's [[doping in baseball|steroids scandal]].

His father was a [[dentist]]. He attended [[Damien High School]] in [[La Verne, California]], where he played baseball, golf, and basketball. He was drafted by the [[Montreal Expos]] in the 1981 amateur draft but did not sign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcgwima01.shtml|title=Mark McGwire Stats - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> He played college baseball at the [[University of Southern California]] (where he was a teammate of [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Jack Del Rio]]) under coach [[Rod Dedeaux]].\n\nMcGwire was selected by the Athletics with the 10th overall selection in the [[1984 Major League Baseball draft|1984 MLB draft]]. \n\nHe was a member of the [[silver medal]]-winning entry of the [[United States national baseball team|United States national team]]<nowiki/> that [[Baseball  at the 1984 Summer Olympics|same year]]<nowiki/>at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], with Japan finishing ahead for gold medal.\n\n==Playing career (1984\u20132001)==\n\n===Oakland Athletics (1984\u20131997)===\n\nAfter three years at Southern California and a stint on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, the [[Oakland Athletics]] drafted McGwire tenth overall in the [[1984 Major League Baseball draft]].\n\nMcGwire debuted in the major leagues in August [[1986 Oakland Athletics season|1986]], hitting three [[home run]]s and nine [[runs batted in]] in 18 games.\n\n====Rookie home run record and major league leader (1987)====\n\nRetaining his rookie status in [[1987 Major League Baseball season|1987]], McGwire took center stage in baseball with his home runs. He hit just four in the month of April, but followed in May with 15, and another nine in June. Before the All-Star break arrived, he totaled 33 HR and earned a spot on the [[American League]] (AL) [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]]. On August 11, he broke [[Al Rosen]]'s AL rookie record of 37 home runs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708140841/http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|date=August 10, 2008}}</ref>  Three days later, McGwire broke the major league record of 38, which [[Frank Robinson]] and [[Wally Berger]] jointly held. In September, McGwire hit nine more home runs while posting monthly personal bests of a .351 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], .419 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and 11 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (2B). With 49 HR and two games remaining in the regular season, he chose to sit them out with an opportunity for 50 home runs to be present for the birth of his first child. McGwire also totaled 118 [[runs batted in]] (RBI), .289 batting average, 97 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored, 28 doubles, a .618 [[slugging percentage]] and a .370 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP). McGwire's 49 home runs as a rookie stood as a major league record until [[Aaron Judge]] hit 52 for the [[New York Yankees]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/yankees-aaron-judge-sets-rookie-hr-record-mark-mcgwire/xyqbr125vm8k13f1ips4sg1nl|title=Yankees' Aaron Judge breaks Mark McGwire's rookie HR record|date=2017-09-26|work=Sporting News|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>\n\nNot only did he lead the AL in home runs in 1987, but he also tied for the major league lead with [[1987 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] right fielder [[Andre Dawson]]. McGwire also led the major leagues in SLG, finished second in the AL in adjusted [[on-base plus slugging]] percentage (OPS+, 164) total bases (344), third in RBI and on-base plus slugging (OPS, .987). He was thus a unanimous choice for the AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] and finished sixth overall in the AL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] voting.\n\n====More All-Star appearances (1988\u201391)====\n\n[[File:Mark McGwire 1989.jpg|thumb|left|McGwire with the A's, 1989]]\n\nFrom [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|1988]] to [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|1990]], McGwire followed with 32, 33, and 39 home runs, respectively, becoming the first Major Leaguer to hit 30+ home runs in each of his first four full seasons.<ref name=\"BaseballRefMain\">{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mcgwima01.shtml |title=Mark McGwire Statistics |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  On July 3 and 4, 1988, he hit game-winning home runs in the 16th inning of both games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TOR/TOR198807030.shtml |title=July 3, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Toronto Blue Jays play by play and box score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=July 3, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE198807040.shtml |title=July 4, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Cleveland Indians Jays play by play and box score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=July 4, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Through May 2009, McGwire was tied for third all-time with [[Joe DiMaggio]] in home runs over his first two calendar years in the major leagues (71), behind [[Chuck Klein]] (83) and [[Ryan Braun]] (79).<ref>[https://nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=1633915 Sandler, Jeremy, \"NL Weekly: The Notebook\", National Post, May 27, 2009, accessed 5/28/09]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nMcGwire's most famous home run with the A's was likely his game-winning solo shot in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3 of the [[1988 World Series]] against the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and former A's [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Jay Howell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198810180.shtml |title=October 18, 1988 World Series Game 3 at Network Associates Coliseum Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=October 18, 1988 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire's game-winner brought the A's their only victory in the 1988 World Series, which they lost in five games; however, McGwire and his fellow [[Bash Brother]], [[Jos\u00e9 Canseco]], played a large part in the 1989 championship club that defeated the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the famous \"[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1989_WS.shtml |title=1989 World Series \u2013 OAK vs. SFG |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWorking diligently on his defense at first base, McGwire bristled at the notion that he was a one-dimensional player. He was generally regarded as a good fielder in his early years, even winning a [[Gold Glove Award]] in [[1990 Major League Baseball season|1990]] \u2013 the only one that [[New York Yankees]] legend [[Don Mattingly]] would not win between [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985]] and [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994]]. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense; however, McGwire's batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to .260, .231, and .235 from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, he bottomed out with a .201 average and 22 homers. [[List of Oakland Athletics managers|Manager]] [[Tony La Russa]] sat him out the final game of the [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|season]] to avoid allowing his batting average to dip below .200. Despite the declining averages during this time of his career, his high [[bases on balls]] totals allowed him to maintain acceptable OBPs. In fact, when he hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, or just over league average.\n\nMcGwire stated in an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that 1991 was the \"worst year\" of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, and that he \"didn't lift a weight\" that entire season. With all that behind him, McGwire re-dedicated himself to working out harder than ever and received visual therapy from a sports vision specialist.<ref>[http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf] https://web.archive.org/web/20150701040841/http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |work=CNN |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |title=Oakland's Mark McGwire is smiling again, now that he's hitting homers at a record pace |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104193550/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====Career resurgence (1992\u201397)====\n\nThe \"new look\" McGwire hit 42 homers and batted .268 in 1992, with an outstanding OPS+ of 175 (the highest of his career to that point), and put on a home run hitting show at the [[Home Run Derby]] during the [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992 All-Star break]]. His performance propelled the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to the American League West Division title in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The A's lost in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|playoffs]] to the eventual [[1992 World Series|World Series]] champion, the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]].\n\nFoot injuries limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in [[1993 Oakland Athletics season|1993]] and [[1994 Oakland Athletics season|1994]], and just 9 home runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in [[1995 Oakland Athletics season|1995]], but his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. In [[1996 Oakland Athletics season|1996]], McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging percentage and on-base percentage.\n\nMcGwire's total of 363 home runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine [[American League]] All-Star Teams while playing for the A's, including six consecutive appearances from [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]] through [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992]].

In 51 games with the Cardinals to finish the 1997 season, McGwire compiled a .253 batting average, 24 home runs, and 42 RBI. Overall in 1997, McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs. He also finished third in the major leagues in slugging percentage (.646), fourth in OPS (1.039), fifth in OPS+ (170), tenth in RBI (123), and ninth in walks (101). He placed 16th in the NL MVP voting.\n\nIt was the last year of his contract, so there was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lived; however, McGwire signed a contract to stay in St. Louis. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged [[Jim Edmonds]], another Southern California resident who was traded to St. Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000.\n\n====Single-season home run record chase (1998)====\n\nAs the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998 season]] progressed, it became clear that McGwire, [[1998 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] outfielder [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[1998 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Sammy Sosa]] were all on track to break [[Roger Maris]]'s single-season home run record. [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|The race to break the record]] first attracted media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire; however, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn September 8, 1998, McGwire hit a pitch by the Cubs' [[Steve Trachsel]] over the left field wall for his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting off massive celebrations at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The fact that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Maris's family were also present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMcGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs (including five in his last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a record that was broken three seasons later in 2001 by [[Barry Bonds]] with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified/>\n\nMcGwire was honored with the inaugural [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading Major League Baseball in home runs.<ref name=harber>{{cite news|last=Harber|first=Paul|title=A statue fit for a home run king|date=July 22, 2001|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602104753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2011|quote=The first award was given to Mark McGwire after his 70-home-run season in 1998.}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa (who had fewer HR but more RBI and stolen bases) won the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the [[1998 National League Division Series|playoffs]] (the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in 1998 finished third in the NL Central). Many credited the Sosa-McGwire home run chase in 1998 with \"saving baseball\", by both bringing in new, younger fans and bringing back old fans soured by the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/sports/myth-of-men-who-saved-baseball.html|title=Myth of men who saved baseball|date=March 30, 2005|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====Later playing career (1999\u20132001)====\nMcGwire kept his high level of offensive production from 1998 going in [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|1999]] while setting or extending several significant records. For the fourth consecutive season, he led MLB in home runs with 65. It was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 50 home runs, extending his own major league record. Sosa, who hit 63 home runs in 1999, again trailed McGwire. Thus, they became the first, and still only, players in major league history to hit 60 or more home runs in consecutive seasons. McGwire also set a record from 1998 to 1999 for home runs in a two-season period with 135. Further, he owned the highest four-season HR total, with 245 from 1996 to 1999.

This suggests people's beliefs influence their actions. The principle behind this phenomenon is people create consequences regarding people or events, based on their previous knowledge toward that specific subject. Additionally, a self-fulfilling prophecy is applicable to negative and positive outcomes.\n\nAmerican sociologist [[William Isaac Thomas]] was the first to discover this phenomenon. In 1928 he developed the [[Thomas theorem]] (also known as the Thomas dictum), stating,\n{{cquote|If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.<ref>''The child in America: Behavior problems and programs.'' W.I. Thomas and D.S. Thomas. New York: Knopf, 1928: 571\u2013572</ref>}}\nIn other words, the consequence will come to fruition based on how one interprets the situation. Using Thomas' idea, another American sociologist, [[Robert K. Merton]], coined the term ''self-fulfilling prophecy'', popularizing the idea \u201c...a belief or expectation, correct or incorrect, could bring about a desired or expected outcome.\u201d<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nMerton applied this concept to a fictional situation. In  his book ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'', he uses the example of a [[bank run]] to show how self-fulfilling thoughts can make unwanted situations happen. He mentions how a number of people falsely believe the bank was going to file for bankruptcy. Because of this false fear, many people decide to go to the bank and ask for all of their cash at once. These actions cause the bank to indeed go bankrupt because banks rarely have the amount of cash on hand to satisfy a large number of customers asking for all of their deposited cash at once. \n\nMerton concludes this example with the analysis, \u201cThe prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfillment.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=On social structure and science|last=Merton, Robert King, 1910-2003.|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226520706|oclc=34116334}}</ref>\n\nWhile Merton\u2019s example focused on self-fulfilling prophecies within a business, his theory is also applicable to interpersonal communication since it is found to have a \u201cpotential for triggering self-fulfilling prophecy effects\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|chapter=Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|doi=10.1007/springerreference_180548|title=Springer ''Reference''|year=2011}}</ref> . This is due to the fact \u201cthat an individual decides whether or not to conform to the expectations of others.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> This makes people rely upon or fall into self-fulfilling thoughts since they are trying to satisfy other\u2019s perceptions of them.\n\nSelf-fulfilling theory can be divided into two subsections, one would be the [[Pygmalion effect]] which is when \u201cone person has expectations of another, changes her behavior in accordance with these expectations, and the object of the expectations then also changes her behavior as a result.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAdditionally, Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] called the self-fulfilling prophecy the ''Oedipus effect'':\n\n{{quote|One of the ideas I had discussed in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' was the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted. I had called this the \"Oedipus effect\", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. \u2026 For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences.

However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0\u201311 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage. The selected players are exposed to higher levels of coaching, play more games, and have better teammates.

They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.\n\n===Classical===\nMany myths, legends, and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.<ref>See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. \"Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change\". (Wilkins 1976:177).</ref> In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.<!--own what?--> The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.\n\n====Greek====\n[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]\nThe best-known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.\n\nAlthough the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Dana\u00eb]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition\u2014an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Dana\u00eb to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Dana\u00eb because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Dana\u00eb's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.\n\nGreek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked\u2014but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.<ref>Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88</ref> In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.\n\nWhen it was predicted that [[Cronus|Cronos]] would be overthrown by his son, and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, Cronus ate his children, each shortly after they were born. When Zeus was born, Cronos was thwarted by Rhea, who gave him a stone to eat instead, sending Zeus to be raised by [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]]. Cronos' attempt to avoid the prophecy made Zeus his enemy,  ultimately leading to its fulfilment.\n\n====Roman====\n[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]\nThe story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him as he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n====Arabic====\nA variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is \"[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the \"[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193\u2013194}}</ref>\n\nAnother variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in \"[[The Tale of Attaf]]\", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, \"falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''\" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, \"disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.\" After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}</ref> In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}</ref>\n\n====Hinduism====\n[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n====Rusan====\n[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad \"The Song of the Wise Oleg\". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].\n\n====European fairy tales====\nMany fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).<ref>Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977</ref> This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system|Aarne\u2013Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.\n\nAnother fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.\n\nIn some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.\n\n====Shakespeare====\n[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.\n\nThe later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should \"Beware Macduff\" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.\n\n===Modern===\nSimilar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it. In [[George R. R. Martin]]\u2019s book series [[a Song of Ice and Fire]], [[Cersei Lannister]] kills a friend of hers after hearing a prophecy, from Maggy the Frog, that said friend will soon die.\n\nThe song \"Iron Man\" by British heavy metal band [[Black Sabbath]] follows the story of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n====New Thought====\nThe [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that \"like attracts like\" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.<ref name=gazette>Whittaker, S.

This suggests people's beliefs influence their actions. The principle behind this phenomenon is people create consequences regarding people or events, based on their previous knowledge toward that specific subject. Additionally, self-fulfilling prophecy is applicable to negative and positive outcomes.\n\nAmerican sociologist [[William Isaac Thomas]] was the first to discover this phenomenon. In 1928 he developed the [[Thomas theorem]] (also known as the Thomas dictum), stating,\n{{cquote|If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.<ref>''The child in America: Behavior problems and programs.'' W.I. Thomas and D.S. Thomas. New York: Knopf, 1928: 571\u2013572</ref>}}\nIn other words, the consequence will come to fruition based on how one interprets the situation. Using Thomas' idea, another American sociologist, [[Robert K. Merton]], coined the term ''self-fulfilling prophecy'', popularizing the idea \u201c...a belief or expectation, correct or incorrect, could bring about a desired or expected outcome.\u201d<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nMerton applied this concept to a fictional situation. In  his book ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'', he uses the example of a [[bank run]] to show how self-fulfilling thoughts can make unwanted situations happen. He mentions how a number of people falsely believe the bank was going to file for bankruptcy. Because of this false fear, many people decide to go to the bank and ask for all of their cash at once. These actions cause the bank to indeed go bankrupt because banks rarely have the amount of cash on hand to satisfy a large number of customers asking for all of their deposited cash at once. \n\nMerton concludes this example with the analysis, \u201cThe prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfillment.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=On social structure and science|last=Merton, Robert King, 1910-2003.|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226520706|oclc=34116334}}</ref>\n\nWhile Merton\u2019s example focused on self-fulfilling prophecies within a business, his theory is also applicable to interpersonal communication since it is found to have a \u201cpotential for triggering self-fulfilling prophecy effects\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|chapter=Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|doi=10.1007/springerreference_180548|title=Springer ''Reference''|year=2011}}</ref> . This is due to the fact \u201cthat an individual decides whether or not to conform to the expectations of others.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> This makes people rely upon or fall into self-fulfilling thoughts since they are trying to satisfy other\u2019s perceptions of them.\n\nSelf-fulfilling theory can be divided into two subsections, one would be the Pygmalion effect which is when \u201cone person has expectations of another, changes her behavior in accordance with these expectations, and the object of the expectations then also changes her behavior as a result.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAdditionally, Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] called the self-fulfilling prophecy the ''Oedipus effect'':\n\n{{quote|One of the ideas I had discussed in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' was the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted. I had called this the \"Oedipus effect\", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. \u2026 For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences.

However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0\u201311 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage. The selected players are exposed to higher levels of coaching, play more games, and have better teammates. These factors make them actually become the best players, fulfilling the prophecy, while the real selection criterion was age.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=Outliers|year=2008|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=978-0-316-01792-3|pages=20\u201325|chapter=1 \u2013 The Matthew Effect|lay-url=http://www.rugbyiq.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1199:is-it-because-of-talent-that-athletes-succeed&catid=102:mental-toughness&Itemid=458|title-link=Outliers (book)}}</ref>\nThe same [[relative age effect]] has been noticed in Belgian soccer after 1997, when the start of the selection year was changed from August 1 to January 1.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Helsen|first=WF |author2=Starkes, JL |author3=Van Winckel, J|title=Effect of a change in selection year on success in male soccer players|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2000-11-01|volume=12|issue=6|pages=729\u2013735|pmid=11534065|doi=10.1002/1520-6300(200011/12)12:6<729::AID-AJHB2>3.0.CO;2-7}}</ref>\n\n==Stereotype==\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies are one of the main contributions to racial prejudice and vice versa.

Instead, the teacher and the counselor recommended classes that were dominated by females.\n\n==Literature, media, and the arts==\nIn literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as [[plot device]]s. They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the [[science fiction]] genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.\n\n===Classical===\nMany myths, legends, and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.<ref>See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. \"Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change\". (Wilkins 1976:177).</ref> In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.<!--own what?--> The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.\n\n====Greek====\n[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]\nThe best-known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.\n\nAlthough the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Dana\u00eb]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition\u2014an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Dana\u00eb to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Dana\u00eb because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Dana\u00eb's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.\n\nGreek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked\u2014but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.<ref>Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88</ref> In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.\n\nWhen it was predicted that [[Cronus|Cronos]] would be overthrown by his son, and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, Cronus ate his children, each shortly after they were born. When Zeus was born, Cronos was thwarted by Rhea, who gave him a stone to eat instead, sending Zeus to be raised by [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]]. Cronos' attempt to avoid the prophecy made Zeus his enemy,  ultimately leading to its fulfilment.\n\n====Roman====\n[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]\nThe story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him as he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n====Arabic====\nA variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is \"[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the \"[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193\u2013194}}</ref>\n\nAnother variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in \"[[The Tale of Attaf]]\", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, \"falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''\" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, \"disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.\" After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}</ref> In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}</ref>\n\n====Hinduism====\n[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n====Rusan====\n[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad \"The Song of the Wise Oleg\". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].\n\n====European fairy tales====\nMany fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).<ref>Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977</ref> This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system|Aarne\u2013Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.\n\nAnother fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.\n\nIn some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.\n\n====Shakespeare====\n[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.\n\nThe later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should \"Beware Macduff\" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.\n\n===Modern===\nSimilar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it. In [[George R. R. Martin]]\u2019s book series [[a Song of Ice and Fire]], [[Cersei Lannister]] kills a friend of hers after hearing a prophecy, from Maggy the Frog, that said friend will soon die.\n\nThe song \"Iron Man\" by British heavy metal band [[Black Sabbath]] follows the story of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n====New Thought====\nThe [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that \"like attracts like\" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.<ref name=gazette>Whittaker, S.

Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nOn Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students at the fictional Shermer High School report at 7:00 am for all-day detention. Each comes from a different [[clique]]: stuck-up Claire Standish, geek Brian Johnson, wrestler Andrew Clark, rebellious John Bender, and outcast Allison Reynolds. They gather in the school library, where assistant principal Richard Vernon instructs them not to talk, move from their seats, or sleep until they are released at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. He assigns them a thousand-word essay, in which each must describe \"who you think you are\". He leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them.\n\nJohn, who has an antagonistic relationship with Vernon, ignores the rules and riles up the other students, teasing and harassing Brian, Andrew, and Claire. Vernon gives John eight weekends' worth of additional detention and eventually locks him in a storage closet, but he escapes and returns to the library.\n\nThe students pass the hours by talking, arguing, and, at one point, smoking [[marijuana]], (except Allison who doesn't smoke with the others). Gradually, they open up and reveal their secrets: Claire has lots of experiences of [[peer pressure]], John comes from an abusive household, Allison is a compulsive liar, Andrew can't think for himself, and Brian contemplated suicide over a bad grade. They discover they all have poor relationships with their parents: Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during arguments, John's parents physically and verbally abuse him, Allison's parents ignore her, Andrew's father pushes him to the limit, especially in [[wrestling]], and Brian's parents pressure him to earn high grades. The students realize that, despite their differences, they face similar problems.\n\nClaire gives Allison a makeover, which sparks romantic interest from Andrew. Claire decides to break her \"pristine\" innocent appearance by kissing John and giving him a [[hickey]]. Although they suspect their new relationships will end along with their detention, they believe their mutual experiences will change the way they look at their peers.\n\nAs the detention nears its end, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone, and John returns to the storage closet to fool Vernon into thinking he never left. Brian leaves the essay in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. As the students part ways, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John. Allison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his jacket to keep, and Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings, which he puts on. Vernon reads the essay, in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are using stereotypes, and that they think that he (Vernon) is crazy if he thinks that they are going to tell him who they are; so Brian correspondingly states in the letter that \"each one of us is a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question?\" He signs off the letter with \"Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Judd Nelson]] as John Bender, the criminal\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Claire Standish, the princess\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Andrew Clark, the athlete\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Brian Johnson, the brain\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Allison Reynolds, the basket case\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Assistant Principal Vernon\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Carl Reed\n* [[Ron Dean]] as Mr. Clark\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Molly Ringwald]] and [[Anthony Michael Hall]] both starred in Hughes's 1984 film ''[[Sixteen Candles]]''. Towards the end of filming, Hughes asked them both to be in ''The Breakfast Club''. Hall became the first to be cast, agreeing to the role of Brian Johnson; his real life\nmother and sister playing the same roles in the film. Ringwald was originally approached to play the character of Allison Reynolds, but she was \"really upset\" because she wanted to play Claire Standish (then named \"Cathy\" in the first draft of the script), which saw the auditions of [[Robin Wright]], [[Jodie Foster]], and [[Laura Dern]]. She eventually convinced Hughes and the studio to give her the part.<ref name=\"Itzkoff\"/> The role of Allison ultimately went to [[Ally Sheedy]].\n\n[[Emilio Estevez]] originally auditioned for the role of John Bender. However, when Hughes was unable to find someone to play Andrew Clark, Estevez was recast. [[Nicolas Cage]] was considered for the role of John Bender, which was the last role to be cast, though the role was narrowed down to [[John Cusack]] and [[Judd Nelson]]. Hughes originally cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look threatening enough for the role. At one point, Hughes was disappointed in Nelson because he stayed in character and harassed Ringwald off-camera, with the other actors having to convince Hughes not to fire him.<ref name=\"Itzkoff\">{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |title=She Won't Forget About Him: Molly Ringwald Remembers John Hughes |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/she-wont-forget-about-him-molly-ringwald-remembers-john-hughes/ |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"wsj\"/>\n\n[[Rick Moranis]] was originally cast as the janitor but left due to creative differences and was replaced by [[John Kapelos]].<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010).

Hughes originally thought that ''The Breakfast Club'' would be his directorial debut. Hughes opted for an insular, largely one-room set and wrote about high school students, who would be played by younger actors.<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''.

Filming took place at [[Maine North High School]] in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]], which had closed in 1981. The same setting was used for interior scenes of Hughes's 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', which featured exterior shots from nearby [[Glenbrook North High School]]. The library at Maine North High School, considered too small for the film, prompted the crew to build the set in the school's gymnasium.<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010).

A brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel and a recluse\".\n\n==Themes==\nThe main theme of the film is the constant struggle of the American teenager to be understood, by adults and by themselves. It explores the pressure put on teenagers to fit into their own realms of high school social constructs, as well as the lofty expectations of their parents, teachers, and other authority figures. On the surface, the students have little in common with each other. However, as the day rolls on, they eventually bond over a common disdain for the aforementioned issues of peer pressure and parental expectations.<ref name=\"Loukides\">{{cite book |last=Loukides |first=Paul |year=1996 |title=Beyond the Stars 5: Themes and Ideologies in American Popular Film |publisher=Popular Press |isbn=9780879727017 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondstars00louk/page/30 30\u201332] |url=https://archive.org/details/beyondstars00louk/page/30 }}</ref><ref>Barsanti, Chris (2010).

It stars [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Judd Nelson]], [[Molly Ringwald]] and [[Ally Sheedy]] as teenagers from different high school cliques who spend a Saturday in [[Detention (Academia)|detention]] with their authoritarian assistant principal ([[Paul Gleason]]).\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on February 7, 1985. [[Universal Pictures]] released it in cinemas in the United States on February 15, 1985. It received critical acclaim and earned $51.5 million on a $1 million budget. Critics consider it to be one of Hughes's most memorable and recognizable works. The media referred to the film's five main actors as members of a group called the \"[[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]]\".\n\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/breakfast-club-rushmore-added-to-national-film-registry-w456002 |title='Breakfast Club,' 'Rushmore' Among Films Added to National Film Registry |author=Daniel Kreps |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=December 14, 2016 |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/national-film-registry-honors-breakfast-club-rushmore-and-other-teen-angst-movies/2016/12/13/824a7fbe-be58-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html|title=National Film Registry honors \u2018Breakfast Club,\u2019 \u2018Rushmore\u2019 and other teen angst movies |author=Michael O'Sullivan |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=December 21, 2017}}</ref> The film was digitally remastered and was re-screened in 430 theaters in celebration of its 30th anniversary in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.BreakfastClub30.com |publisher=BreakfastClub30.com |title=Breakfast Club 30}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- The plot summary should be 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nOn Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students at the fictional Shermer High School report at 7:00 am for all-day detention. Each comes from a different [[clique]]: stuck-up Claire Standish, geek Brian Johnson, wrestler Andrew Clark, rebellious John Bender, and outcast Allison Reynolds. They gather in the school library, where assistant principal Richard Vernon instructs them not to talk, move from their seats, or sleep until they are released at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. He assigns them a thousand-word essay, in which each must describe \"who you think you are\". He leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them.\n\nJohn, who has an antagonistic relationship with Vernon, ignores the rules and riles up the other students, teasing and harassing Brian, Andrew, and Claire. Vernon gives John eight weekends' worth of additional detention and eventually locks him in a storage closet, but he escapes and returns to the library.\n\nThe students pass the hours by talking, arguing, and, at one point, smoking [[marijuana]], (except Allison who doesn't smoke with the others). Gradually, they open up and reveal their secrets: Claire has lots of experiences of [[peer pressure]], John comes from an abusive household, Allison is a compulsive liar, Andrew can't think for himself, and Brian contemplated suicide over a bad grade. They discover they all have poor relationships with their parents: Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during arguments, John's parents physically and verbally abuse him, Allison's parents ignore her, Andrew's father pushes him to the limit, especially in [[wrestling]], and Brian's parents pressure him to earn high grades. The students realize that, despite their differences, they face similar problems.\n\nClaire gives Allison a makeover, which sparks romantic interest from Andrew. Claire decides to break her \"pristine\" innocent appearance by kissing John and giving him a [[hickey]]. Although they suspect their new relationships will end along with their detention, they believe their mutual experiences will change the way they look at their peers.\n\nAs the detention nears its end, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone, and John returns to the storage closet to fool Vernon into thinking he never left. Brian leaves the essay in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. As the students part ways, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John. Allison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his jacket to keep, and Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings, which he puts on. Vernon reads the essay, in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are using stereotypes, and that they think that he (Vernon) is crazy if he thinks that they are going to tell him who they are; so Brian correspondingly states in the letter that \"each one of us is a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question?\" He signs off the letter with \"Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Judd Nelson]] as John Bender, the criminal\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Claire Standish, the princess\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Andrew Clark, the athlete\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Brian Johnson, the brain\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Allison Reynolds, the basket case\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Assistant Principal Vernon\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Carl Reed\n* [[Ron Dean]] as Mr. Clark\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Molly Ringwald]] and [[Anthony Michael Hall]] both starred in Hughes's 1984 film ''[[Sixteen Candles]]''. Towards the end of filming, Hughes asked them both to be in ''The Breakfast Club''. Hall became the first to be cast, agreeing to the role of Brian Johnson; his real life\nmother and sister playing the same roles in the film. Ringwald was originally approached to play the character of Allison Reynolds, but she was \"really upset\" because she wanted to play Claire Standish (then named \"Cathy\" in the first draft of the script), which saw the auditions of [[Robin Wright]], [[Jodie Foster]], and [[Laura Dern]]. She eventually convinced Hughes and the studio to give her the part.<ref name=\"Itzkoff\"/> The role of Allison ultimately went to [[Ally Sheedy]].\n\n[[Emilio Estevez]] originally auditioned for the role of John Bender. However, when Hughes was unable to find someone to play Andrew Clark, Estevez was recast. [[Nicolas Cage]] was considered for the role of John Bender, which was the last role to be cast, though the role was narrowed down to [[John Cusack]] and [[Judd Nelson]]. Hughes originally cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look threatening enough for the role. At one point, Hughes was disappointed in Nelson because he stayed in character and harassed Ringwald off-camera, with the other actors having to convince Hughes not to fire him.<ref name=\"Itzkoff\">{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |title=She Won't Forget About Him: Molly Ringwald Remembers John Hughes |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/she-wont-forget-about-him-molly-ringwald-remembers-john-hughes/ |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"wsj\"/>\n\n[[Rick Moranis]] was originally cast as the janitor but left due to creative differences and was replaced by [[John Kapelos]].<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010).

Hughes originally thought that ''The Breakfast Club'' would be his directorial debut. Hughes opted for an insular, largely one-room set and wrote about high school students, who would be played by younger actors.<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. p. 47.</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 28, 1984, and ended in May. Filming took place at [[Maine North High School]] in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]], which had closed in 1981. The same setting was used for interior scenes of Hughes's 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', which featured exterior shots from nearby [[Glenbrook North High School]]. The library at Maine North High School, considered too small for the film, prompted the crew to build the set in the school's gymnasium.<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010).

The shot of five actors gazing at the camera influenced the way teen films were marketed from that point on.<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. pp. 79-80, 325-326.</ref> The poster refers to the five \"types\" of the story using slightly different terms than those used in the film, and in a different sequence, stating \"They were five total strangers with nothing in common, meeting for the first time. A brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel and a recluse\".\n\n==Themes==\nThe main theme of the film is the constant struggle of the American teenager to be understood, by adults and by themselves. It explores the pressure put on teenagers to fit into their own realms of high school social constructs, as well as the lofty expectations of their parents, teachers, and other authority figures. On the surface, the students have little in common with each other. However, as the day rolls on, they eventually bond over a common disdain for the aforementioned issues of peer pressure and parental expectations.<ref name=\"Loukides\">{{cite book |last=Loukides |first=Paul |year=1996 |title=Beyond the Stars 5: Themes and Ideologies in American Popular Film |publisher=Popular Press |isbn=9780879727017 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondstars00louk/page/30 30\u201332] |url=https://archive.org/details/beyondstars00louk/page/30 }}</ref><ref>Barsanti, Chris (2010).

According to the method is possible to construct a function called \"Melnikov function\", and hence to predict either regular or chaotic behavior of a studied dynamical system. Thus, the Melnikov function will be used to determine a measure of distance between stable and unstable [[Stable manifold|manifolds]] in the Poincar\u00e9 map.

Such tangle is a very complicated structure with the stable and unstable manifolds intersecting an infinite number of times.\n\nConsider a small element of phase volume, departing from the neighborhood of a point near the transversal intersection, along the unstable manifold of a fixed point. Clearly, when this volume element approaches the hyperbolic fixed point it will be distorted considerably, due to the repetitive infinite intersections and stretching (and folding) associated with the relevant invariant sets. Therefore, it is reasonably expect that the volume element will undergo an infinite sequence of stretch and fold transformations as the [[horseshoe map]]. Then, this intuitive expectation is rigorously confirmed by a theorem stated as follows\n\n'''Theorem 2''': Suppose that a diffeomorphism <math> P : M \\rightarrow M,</math>where <math>M</math>is an n-dimensional manifold,\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0hyperbolic\u00a0fixed\u00a0point <math>\\bar{x}</math>with a\u00a0stable <math>W^{s}(\\bar{x})</math>and\u00a0<math>W^{u}(\\bar{x})</math>unstable manifold that intersect transversely at some point <math>x_0 \\neq \\bar{x}</math>, <math>W^{s}(\\bar{x}) \\perp W^{u}(\\bar{x}),</math>where <math>dimW^{s} + dimW^{u}=n.</math> Then, <math>M</math>contains a hyperbolic set <math>\\Lambda,</math> invariant under <math>P,</math>on which <math>P</math>is topologically conjugate to a [[Shift space|shift]] on finitely many symbols.\n\nThus, according to the '''theorem 2''', it implies that the dynamics when you have a transverse homoclinic point is topologically similar to the horseshoe map and\u00a0 it has the property of sensitivity to initial conditions and hence when the Melnikov distance (10) has a simple zero, it implies that the system is chaotic.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Melnikov Distance}}\n[[Category:Dynamical systems]]\n", "text_old": "In mathematics, the Melnikov method is a tool to identify the existence of [[Chaos theory|chaos]] in a class of [[dynamical system]]s under periodic perturbation.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nThe Melnikov method is used in many cases to predict the occurrence of chaotic orbits in non-autonomous smooth nonlinear systems under periodic perturbation. According to the method is possible to construct a function called \"Melnikov function\", and hence to predict either regular or chaotic behavior of a studied dynamical system. Thus, the Melnikov function will be used to determine a measure of distance between stable and unstable [[Stable manifold|manifolds]] in the Poincar\u00e9 map.

Such tangle is a very complicated structure with the stable and unstable manifolds intersecting an infinite number of times.\n\nConsider a small element of phase volume, departing from the neighborhood of a point near the transversal intersection, along the unstable manifold of a fixed point. Clearly, when this volume element approaches the hyperbolic fixed point it will be distorted considerably, due to the repetitive infinite intersections and stretching (and folding) associated with the relevant invariant sets. Therefore, it is reasonably expect that the volume element will undergo an infinite sequence of stretch and fold transformations as the [[horseshoe map]]. Then, this intuitive expectation is rigorously confirmed by a theorem stated as follows\n\n'''Theorem 2''': Suppose that a diffeomorphism <math> P : M \\rightarrow M,</math>where <math>M</math>is an n-dimensional manifold,\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0hyperbolic\u00a0fixed\u00a0point <math>\\bar{x}</math>with a\u00a0stable <math>W^{s}(\\bar{x})</math>and\u00a0<math>W^{u}(\\bar{x})</math>unstable manifold that intersect transversely at some point <math>x_0 \\neq \\bar{x}</math>, <math>W^{s}(\\bar{x}) \\perp W^{u}(\\bar{x}),</math>where <math>dimW^{s} + dimW^{u}=n.</math> Then, <math>M</math>contains a hyperbolic set <math>\\Lambda,</math> invariant under <math>P,</math>on which <math>P</math>is topologically conjugate to a [[Shift space|shift]] on finitely many symbols.\n\nThus, according to the '''theorem 2''', it implies that the dynamics when you have a transverse homoclinic point is topologically similar to the horseshoe map and\u00a0 it has the property of sensitivity to initial conditions and hence when the Melnikov distance (10) has a simple zero, it implies that the system is chaotic.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Melnikov Distance}}\n[[Category:Dynamical systems]]\n", "name_user": "Kyler Natividad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDeduction of the Melnikov function", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melnikov_distance"}

Within 15 minutes, the SSG teams had stormed the school and entered the premises from two sides in their heavy armoured vehicles and trucks. Immediately, the SSG personnel engaged the terrorists, preventing them from going after and killing other remaining teaching staff and students. The gunmen moved to the administration block of the school and took hostages there. One of them was shot by the military personnel near the auditorium, while the other five managed to make it to the administration block. The emergency trauma teams, and units of the [[Pakistan Army Medical Corps|Army Medical Corps]] in military armoured vehicles were rushed to the school, [[Pakistan Army Corps of Military Police|Army Corps of Military Police]] and the provincial civilian [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police]] (KP Police) worked toward closing off any potential escape routes for the terrorists.\n\nMeanwhile, the SSG commandos had reached the area and surrounded the administration block. Most of the operation took place in the attempt to clear this block and rescue the hostages taken by the gunmen. Special teams of snipers and their spotters pinpointed the terrorists; one of the six attackers was killed by the snipers from the windows and air vents, while the other three were killed when the commandos stormed the building and rescued the remaining hostages in the process.\nSeven commandos, including two officers, were injured in the battle. A search and clearance operation was started immediately to defuse any IEDs planted by the gunmen within the school premises or in the suicide vests that the terrorists were wearing.\nThe terrorists were in contact with their handlers during the attack, but soon after the SSG had moved in, the security forces intercepted the terrorists' communications. \"We know who they are and who they were in contact with but details cannot be shared due to operation reasons. They were aware of locations and they must have carried out the recon of the area. And it is highly possible that someone from inside might have tipped them off\", said Bajwa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Casualties ===\nAn estimated total of 1,099 pupils and teaching staff were present on the school premises.

The gunmen moved to the administration block of the school and took hostages there. One of them was shot by the military personnel near the auditorium, while the other five managed to make it to the administration block. The emergency trauma teams, and units of the [[Pakistan Army Medical Corps|Army Medical Corps]] in military armoured vehicles were rushed to the school, [[Pakistan Army Corps of Military Police|Army Corps of Military Police]] and the provincial civilian [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police]] (KP Police) worked toward closing off any potential escape routes for the terrorists.\n\nMeanwhile, the SSG commandos had reached the area and surrounded the administration block. Most of the operation took place in the attempt to clear this block and rescue the hostages taken by the gunmen. Special teams of snipers and their spotters pinpointed the terrorists; one of the six attackers was killed by the snipers from the windows and air vents, while the other three were killed when the commandos stormed the building and rescued the remaining hostages in the process.\nSeven commandos, including two officers, were injured in the battle. A search and clearance operation was started immediately to defuse any IEDs planted by the gunmen within the school premises or in the suicide vests that the terrorists were wearing.\nThe terrorists were in contact with their handlers during the attack, but soon after the SSG had moved in, the security forces intercepted the terrorists' communications. \"We know who they are and who they were in contact with but details cannot be shared due to operation reasons.
