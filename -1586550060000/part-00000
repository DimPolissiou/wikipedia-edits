The [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] style station is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]]. Its architecture, particularly the signature twin domes, is often echoed in the design of modern buildings in [[Downtown San Diego]]. A wing now houses the downtown branch of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]].\n\nThe Santa Fe Depot (as it was originally designated) officially opened on March 8, 1915, to accommodate visitors to the [[Panama-California Exposition (1915)|Panama-California Exposition]].<ref name=\"Great American Stations\">[http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/SAN/Station_view Great American Stations]. Accessed 2013-02-19.</ref> The depot was completed during a particularly optimistic period in the City's development, and represents the battle waged by the City of San Diego to become the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] terminus of the Santa Fe Railway system's [[transcontinental railroad]], a fight that was ultimately lost to the City of [[Los Angeles]]. It is now [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/CA/San+Diego/state3.html listed] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIn its heyday, the facility not only handled Santa Fe traffic but also that of the [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] (SD&A) and [[San Diego Electric Railway]] (SDERy). The designation was officially changed to \"San Diego Union Station\" in response to the SD&A's completion of its own transcontinental line in December 1919. The Santa Fe resumed solo operation of the station in January, 1951 when the [[San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway]] (successor to the SD&A) discontinued passenger service, the SDERy having ceased operation some two years prior.\n\nThe historic depot is located in the [[Core, San Diego|Core]] of [[Downtown San Diego]] and is still an active transportation center, providing services to [[Amtrak]], the [[COASTER|San Diego Coaster]], the [[San Diego Trolley]], and the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System]] bus system.  Of the 74 [[Amtrak California|California stations served by Amtrak]] in Fiscal Year 2013, the Santa Fe Depot was the third busiest in California (behind only [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles Union Station]] and [[Sacramento Valley Station]]) and the 13th busiest in the Amtrak system, boarding or detraining an average of approximately 1,880 passengers daily.<ref name=\"Amtrak-CA-factsheet-2013\" />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Union Station, San Diego.jpg|thumbnail|left|Union Station from Broadway, San Diego, California]]\nThe magnificent complex was designed by [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] architects [[Bakewell and Brown]] as a \"monumental reminder\" of [[California|California's]] [[Spain|Spanish]] heritage. The [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] styling reflects the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial Spanish]] history of the state, and was intended to harmonize with the [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival Style]] buildings of the Panama-California Exposition.<ref>Weitze, p. 85</ref> The size and grandeur far surpassed anything the Santa Fe had ever built in the West. The new edifice featured a covered concourse some {{convert|650|ft|m|adj=on}} long by {{convert|106|ft|m|adj=on}} wide, with a main waiting room measuring {{convert|170|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}}. A {{convert|27|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|650|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] connected the passenger terminal with the [[baggage]] and express rooms.<ref name=\"Duke, p. 245\">{{Harvnb|Duke|1995|p=245}}</ref> The cost of the station was approximately $300,000.<ref name=\"Great American Stations\"/> An enlarged bus depot was installed in the southeast portico in 1942.<ref>Jordan (2Q 1996), p. 24</ref>\n\nThe massive arch of the front entrance is flanked by twin ''[[campanile]]s'', each topped by a colorful tile-covered dome and displaying Santa Fe's blue \"cross\" emblem on all four sides. The structure draws much more heavily from the architecturally distinctive Spanish, [[Islamic architecture|Moorish]], and [[Mexico|Mexican]] lines exhibited by the [[Mission San Lu\u00eds Rey de Francia]] (located in the town of [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] in north [[San Diego County]]) than it does from the nearby [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1]], some nine miles (14&nbsp;km) away. The grand interior space of the depot features natural [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] beam ceilings, highlighted by walls covered with a brightly colored ceramic [[tile]] wainscot. The glazed faience tile used in the wainscot was manufactured by the California China Products Company of nearby National City. Elaborate Hispano-Moorish designs are executed in green, yellow, blue, white, and black and the bottom and top edges are finished with a frieze of stylized ziggurats.<ref name=\"Great American Stations\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:San_Diego-Union_Depot_post_card_ca_1920.jpg|thumb|left|This postcard was issued in 1920 to commemorate the completion of the SD&A's connection to downtown. A portion of the SDERy's [[streetcar]] loop is depicted at left.]]\n===Background===\nOn June 20, 1879, the Santa Fe Railway received a land grant from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] government that allowed them to extend their reach through the valley of [[Sonora]] through to the coastal town of [[Guaymas]] on the [[Gulf of California]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Duke|1995|p=14}}</ref> The [[Sonora Railway]] (an [[operating subsidiary]]) allowed the Santa Fe to effectively compete with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] for business on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. Traffic on the line, however, was light, and Santa Fe pushed further westward in search of a suitable Pacific terminus. Since 1845, the citizens of San Diego (then essentially a sleepy fishing village) had attempted to establish a direct rail link to the east without success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duke|1995|p=239}}</ref> The [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] Company (known as the T&P) was created by federal charter in 1871 with the purpose of building a southern [[transcontinental railroad]] between [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], [[Texas]], and San Diego. The T&P had a significant foothold in Texas by the mid-1880s but construction difficulties delayed westward progress until American financier [[Jay Gould]] acquired an interest in the railroad in 1879. The T&P never reached San Diego but instead met the Southern Pacific at [[Sierra Blanca, Texas|Sierra Blanca]], [[Texas]], in 1881.\n\n[[Image:Santa Fe Route Map 1891.jpg|thumb|left|A map of \"The Santa F\u00e9 Route\" and subsidiary lines as published in an 1891 issue of the ''Grain Dealers and Shippers Gazetteer'']]\n\nIn the wake of this setback, the Santa Fe was approached by the '''Citizens Railroad Committee of San Diego''', who had formed a syndicate for the purpose of building a rail line to connect with the A&P in eastern [[California]]. Santa Fe provided financial assistance to the group, which also founded the California Southern Railroad Company (CSRR) on October 23, 1880.<ref>Serpico, p. 18</ref> A [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], workshops, and [[classification yard]]s were built in [[National City, California|National City]], a suburb of San Diego. A [[wharf]] was also constructed to accommodate ship traffic. Initial plans were made to construct 18 miles (29&nbsp;km) of main line track extending north from the new complex. As of January 12, 1882, the California Southern commenced regular passenger and freight service between its National City terminus and Fallbrook Junction, just north of [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]].<ref>California Southern Railway History</ref>\n\nTracklaying continued and proceeded steadily northward until August 14, 1882, when a connection was made with the Southern Pacific's line in [[Colton, California|Colton]]. The California Southern's attempts to cross over the SP tracks a year later led to a [[frog war]] that ended on August 11, 1883, with a court order in the CSRR's favor. A track extension to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] was completed and the first regular passenger train arrived on September 13.<ref>Serpico, p. 20</ref> The line became part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad's transcontinental rail line in 1885 via an extension of the California Southern from Colton north over the [[Cajon Pass]] to [[Barstow, California|Barstow]]. Santa Fe completed the \"Surf Line\" run between Los Angeles and San Diego under the auspices of its subsidiary, the Southern California Railway (a different subsidiary from the California Southern), on August 12, 1888.<ref>Duke and Kistler, p. 43</ref> The route was initially referred to as the Los Angeles\u2014San Diego \"Short Line\" as it replaced the circuitous inland route through [[Temecula, California|Temecula Canyon]].\n\n[[Image:Santa Fe passenger terminal in San Diego prior to 1915.jpg|thumb|right|California Southern's San Diego passenger terminal as it appeared toward the end of the 19th century. An early predecessor of the ''San Diegan'' is waiting to depart.]]\n\nA real estate boom in the spring of 1887 brought thousands of people to Southern California, many of them traveling on \"The Santa F\u00e9 Route\" to San Diego. The California Southern constructed a new [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style depot to handle the throngs of people coming to the Southland.<ref>Gustafson and Serpico, p. 208</ref> The structure sported dark red paint with dark green trim.<ref>Hendrickson, p. 46</ref> Recurring washouts in the [[Temecula, California|Temecula Canyon]], however, often disrupted service; in response, the Santa Fe began construction of its {{convert|126|mi|km|adj=on}}-long \"[[Surf Line]]\" between Los Angeles' [[La Grande Station]] and the National City depot. From 1886 to 1888, the [[Riverside, Santa Ana and Los Angeles Railway]] built a branch line from [[Highgrove, California|Highgrove]] southwest via [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], to [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] and from [[Orange, California|Orange]] northwest to Los Angeles. Also in 1888, the [[San Bernardino and San Diego Railway]] completed its line from [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] north to Santa Ana, completing what was originally called the \"Los Angeles-San Diego Short Line.\" The inland route was finally abandoned in 1891, leaving the newer, coastal route as the only line to San Diego from the north.\n\nIt was generally felt that with the completion of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914, San Diego would logically become the principal [[Ship transport|port of call]] for the Atlantic-Pacific sea trade. To that end, the City decided to stage an international exposition in celebration of the opening of the Canal, and to tout San Diego as the first [[United States|U.S.]] port for ships traveling north after passing through the facility. But San Diego, even with its natural landlocked harbor, was {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} farther south than Los Angeles, which translated into an additional day of travel for both freight and passenger trains; in order for Santa Fe to compete with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], the company needed a port closer to its rival's transcontinental terminus. Santa Fe transferred most of its engine terminal yard to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] in 1887, then established an interim port facility in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] the following year. But when the railroad relocated its port operations to [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro's]] newly dredged, manmade harbor in 1911, it effectively ended San Diego's hopes to become the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast's]] southernmost commercial port.<ref>Serpico, p. 45</ref>\n\n===Santa Fe Depot===\n[[File:Sdadepot.jpg|thumb|left|The first SD&A through passenger train \"arrives\" in San Diego on December 1, 1919 to officially open the line.]]\nThough the elegant California Southern depot had served San Diego for nearly three decades, the station was not adequate to handle the expected flood of visitors through the \"Silver Gate\" in 1915. In fact, the Santa Fe had considered replacing the aging \"D\" Street station with a larger, more modern edifice.<ref>Gustafson and Serpico, p. 19</ref> Plans were drawn up for a new station complex in the Mission Revival Style, befitting the upcoming Exposition. The large, graceful [[palm tree]]s that graced the old depot were boxed and stored for re-planting alongside the new building. Construction began on a site just east of the existing structure on January 15, 1914, and was completed on December 31, at a total cost of [[United States dollar|$]]300,000. A [[Fred Harvey Company]] lunch counter and dining room were incorporated into the floor plan. The old wooden structure was razed during the few days before the opening; the [[clock tower]] was ceremonially toppled on March 7, 1915.\n\nThe facility opened for business on March 8.<ref name=\"Duke, p. 245\" /> Oliver J. Stough, the last surviving veteran of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], was given the honor of purchasing the first ticket.<ref>Hendrickson, p. 47</ref> At the outset, the Santa Fe had three daily local trains and one express train running between Los Angeles and San Diego. During the exposition nine scheduled trains ran on during the week (eight only made stops at [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], while the ninth was a local that stopped at all of the \"Surf Line\" stations). Twelve trains operated on weekends, many running in multiple sections. Four helper locomotives were assigned to the Sorrento Grade to help trains over the hill for the duration of the Exposition.\n\n[[File:Outside SD Union Station 1941.jpg|thumb|The station platform at San Diego in the early days of World War II.

Spreckels]]' [[San Diego Electric Railway]] (SDERy) made regular stops at the station since its opening, and continued to do so until April 24, 1949, when San Diego adopted an all-[[bus]] transit system.<ref>Dodge, p. 113</ref> Spreckels' other rail-related concern, the [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] (built in part to provide San Diego with a direct transcontinental rail link to the east by connecting with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] lines in [[El Centro, California|El Centro]]) was invited to make use of the facility. The first SD&A passenger train arrived in downtown on December 1, 1919.<ref>Hanft, p. 80</ref> In 1936 the Santa Fe ordered a six-car trainset from the [[Budd Company]] specifically for the initiation of a new, streamlined named train between the [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|LAUPT]] and San Diego. On March 27, 1938, the company inaugurated the ''[[San Diegan (train)|San Diegan]]'' route, operating on a two-hour-and-30-minute schedule. A second ''San Diegan'' consist entered service on June 8, 1941, doubling the schedule to four daily round trips.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duke|1995|p=247}}</ref> Freight service consisted of one scheduled overnight train per day, though extras were run as required (sometimes numbering as many as 10\u201312 per day). The United States' entry into [[World War II]] saw a significant increase in rail traffic to and from San Diego, both in the form of troop movements and transport of military vehicles and supplies.<ref>Jordan (2004), p. 69</ref>\n\n[[File:AT&SF64atSanDiegoCA10-26-63.jpg|thumb|right|The ''San Diegan'', pulled by a pair of back-to-back [[ALCO PA]] units, reaches the end of the line at San Diego's Union Station on October 26, 1963.]]\nWhile freight shipments dropped precipitously after the War, passenger demand remained high, and traffic on the \"Surf Line\" ran second only to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s [[New York City|New York]]\u2013[[Philadelphia]] corridor.<ref>Jordan (4Q 1996), p. 12</ref> Passenger service on the [[San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway]] (a successor to the SD&A) ended on January 11, 1951, due to years of continued declining patronage.<ref>Hanft, p. 125</ref> The front [[portico]] was removed in September 1954 to allow for the construction of a parking lot.<ref>Gustafson and Serpico, p. 209</ref>\n\n[[File:UnionStationSanDiegoByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the station, with an [[Amtrak]] [[Pacific Surfliner]] train parked in the Station, along with a northbound [[BNSF]] freight train passing through the station.]]\nOn May 1, 1971, [[Amtrak]] took over operation of the ''San Diegan'' line, which operated its route between Santa Fe Depot and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] in Los Angeles. Santa Fe trainsets usually ran with no cabcar in the days before Amtrak took over the operation of the ''San Diegan''. To make this work, Santa Fe trains backed up, and turned the trains around at the Washington Street [[Wye (rail)|Wye]], just about 3 miles north of the station near the San Diego International Airport. The wye is not longer in service today, and has been torn up and removed from the site.  After more than sixty years of service, the ''San Diegan'' was rebranded as the ''[[Pacific Surfliner]]'', reflecting extensions of the route over the past two decades to the Central Coast. Since the nearest wye is now 16 miles away in [[Miramar, San Diego|Miramar]], Amtrak Pacific Surfliner trains operate in [[push-pull train|push-pull]] mode, with an engine at one end and a cabcar at the other end.\n\nIn 1972 Santa Fe proposed to demolish the station and replace it with two 12-story buildings. After protests from the Save Our Heritage Organization, the city's Historical Review Board, and Mayor [[Pete Wilson]], Amtrak agreed to preserve the station if the city would redevelop the surrounding neighborhood.<ref name=\"Showley\" />\n\n==Current services==\nToday, a variety of bus, light rail, and commuter rail services call the station \"home.\" The structure has retained most of its original features, including the large blue-and-white \"Santa Fe\" sign (which was added in the mid-1950s as a nod to its heritage) and the original, hundred-year-old oak benches.<ref name=\"Showley\">{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/mar/03/depot-santa-fe-centennial/|title=Once nearly razed, Santa Fe Depot turns 100|last=Showley|first=Roger|date=March 3, 2015|newspaper=[[U-T San Diego]]|accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===San Diego Trolley===\nThe [[San Diego Trolley]], a modern [[light rail]] version of the San Diego Electric Railway Association (SDERy) [[tram|streetcar]] service, commenced operations on July 26, 1981, with its northern terminus at the station.

Because of their close proximity, the Metropolitan Transit System refers to the Santa Fe Depot, America Plaza stations and nearby bus stops as the \"Santa Fe Transit Center.\"\n\n===Commuter, intercity and freight rail===\n[[File:SDSanta.JPG|thumb|alt=central station, union station, San Diego Downtown, Spanish mission design|Inner architecture of Santa Fe]]\nCommuter rail at the station is provided by the [[Coaster (commuter rail)|Coaster commuter rail line]], which began weekday service on February 27, 1995. The Santa Fe Depot serves as the Coaster's southern terminus.\n\nThe station is the southern terminus of Amtrak's ''[[Pacific Surfliner]]'', successor to the ''San Diegan.'' It runs from San Diego through Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo, though the great majority of trains run along the \"[[Surf Line]]\" from San Diego to Los Angeles, the second busiest rail corridor in the United States after the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\nAmtrak's passenger figures have shown a decline in boardings and alightings at Santa Fe Depot over the last two years.

However, subsequent revisions to the proposal have settled on a new southern terminus, a proposed [[San Diego International Airport|Lindbergh Field]] intermodal transit center (ITC) to be built at Washington Street and Pacific Highway by 2035, as extending the high-speed rail line into downtown San Diego was likely to prove problematic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/programs/statewide_rail/proj_sections/LA_San_Diego/Los_Angeles_to_San_Diego_Community_Open_House_Meeting_Maps_5_16_11.pdf |title=Los Angeles to San Diego via the Inland Empire Section High-Speed Train Project Open House Meetings 2011 |publisher=California High-Speed Rail Authority |format=pdf |year=2011 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Station layout==\n[[File:Station_outside.JPG|thumb|The railway platform with the [[Pacific Surfliner]] and [[COASTER]].]]\nThe depot has six tracks.

The [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] style station is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]]. Its architecture, particularly the signature twin domes, is often echoed in the design of modern buildings in [[Downtown San Diego]]. A wing now houses the downtown branch of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]].\n\nThe Santa Fe Depot (as it was originally designated) officially opened on March 8, 1915, to accommodate visitors to the [[Panama-California Exposition (1915)|Panama-California Exposition]].<ref name=\"Great American Stations\">[http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/SAN/Station_view Great American Stations]. Accessed 2013-02-19.</ref> The depot was completed during a particularly optimistic period in the City's development, and represents the battle waged by the City of San Diego to become the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] terminus of the Santa Fe Railway system's [[transcontinental railroad]], a fight that was ultimately lost to the City of [[Los Angeles]]. It is now [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/CA/San+Diego/state3.html listed] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIn its heyday, the facility not only handled Santa Fe traffic but also that of the [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] (SD&A) and [[San Diego Electric Railway]] (SDERy). The designation was officially changed to \"San Diego Union Station\" in response to the SD&A's completion of its own transcontinental line in December 1919. The Santa Fe resumed solo operation of the station in January, 1951 when the [[San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway]] (successor to the SD&A) discontinued passenger service, the SDERy having ceased operation some two years prior.\n\nThe historic depot is located in the [[Core, San Diego|Core]] of [[Downtown San Diego]] and is still an active transportation center, providing services to [[Amtrak]], the [[COASTER|San Diego Coaster]], the [[San Diego Trolley]], and the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System]] bus system.  Of the 74 [[Amtrak California|California stations served by Amtrak]] in Fiscal Year 2013, the Santa Fe Depot was the third busiest in California (behind only [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles Union Station]] and [[Sacramento Valley Station]]) and the 13th busiest in the Amtrak system, boarding or detraining an average of approximately 1,880 passengers daily.<ref name=\"Amtrak-CA-factsheet-2013\" />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Union Station, San Diego.jpg|thumbnail|left|Union Station from Broadway, San Diego, California]]\nThe magnificent complex was designed by [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] architects [[Bakewell and Brown]] as a \"monumental reminder\" of [[California|California's]] [[Spain|Spanish]] heritage. The [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] styling reflects the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial Spanish]] history of the state, and was intended to harmonize with the [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival Style]] buildings of the Panama-California Exposition.<ref>Weitze, p. 85</ref> The size and grandeur far surpassed anything the Santa Fe had ever built in the West. The new edifice featured a covered concourse some {{convert|650|ft|m|adj=on}} long by {{convert|106|ft|m|adj=on}} wide, with a main waiting room measuring {{convert|170|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}}. A {{convert|27|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|650|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] connected the passenger terminal with the [[baggage]] and express rooms.<ref name=\"Duke, p. 245\">{{Harvnb|Duke|1995|p=245}}</ref> The cost of the station was approximately $300,000.<ref name=\"Great American Stations\"/> An enlarged bus depot was installed in the southeast portico in 1942.<ref>Jordan (2Q 1996), p. 24</ref>\n\nThe massive arch of the front entrance is flanked by twin ''[[campanile]]s'', each topped by a colorful tile-covered dome and displaying Santa Fe's blue \"cross\" emblem on all four sides. The structure draws much more heavily from the architecturally distinctive Spanish, [[Islamic architecture|Moorish]], and [[Mexico|Mexican]] lines exhibited by the [[Mission San Lu\u00eds Rey de Francia]] (located in the town of [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] in north [[San Diego County]]) than it does from the nearby [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1]], some nine miles (14&nbsp;km) away. The grand interior space of the depot features natural [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] beam ceilings, highlighted by walls covered with a brightly colored ceramic [[tile]] wainscot. The glazed faience tile used in the wainscot was manufactured by the California China Products Company of nearby National City. Elaborate Hispano-Moorish designs are executed in green, yellow, blue, white, and black and the bottom and top edges are finished with a frieze of stylized ziggurats.<ref name=\"Great American Stations\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:San_Diego-Union_Depot_post_card_ca_1920.jpg|thumb|left|This postcard was issued in 1920 to commemorate the completion of the SD&A's connection to downtown. A portion of the SDERy's [[streetcar]] loop is depicted at left.]]\n===Background===\nOn June 20, 1879, the Santa Fe Railway received a land grant from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] government that allowed them to extend their reach through the valley of [[Sonora]] through to the coastal town of [[Guaymas]] on the [[Gulf of California]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Duke|1995|p=14}}</ref> The [[Sonora Railway]] (an [[operating subsidiary]]) allowed the Santa Fe to effectively compete with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] for business on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. Traffic on the line, however, was light, and Santa Fe pushed further westward in search of a suitable Pacific terminus. Since 1845, the citizens of San Diego (then essentially a sleepy fishing village) had attempted to establish a direct rail link to the east without success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duke|1995|p=239}}</ref> The [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] Company (known as the T&P) was created by federal charter in 1871 with the purpose of building a southern [[transcontinental railroad]] between [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], [[Texas]], and San Diego. The T&P had a significant foothold in Texas by the mid-1880s but construction difficulties delayed westward progress until American financier [[Jay Gould]] acquired an interest in the railroad in 1879. The T&P never reached San Diego but instead met the Southern Pacific at [[Sierra Blanca, Texas|Sierra Blanca]], [[Texas]], in 1881.\n\n[[Image:Santa Fe Route Map 1891.jpg|thumb|left|A map of \"The Santa F\u00e9 Route\" and subsidiary lines as published in an 1891 issue of the ''Grain Dealers and Shippers Gazetteer'']]\n\nIn the wake of this setback, the Santa Fe was approached by the '''Citizens Railroad Committee of San Diego''', who had formed a syndicate for the purpose of building a rail line to connect with the A&P in eastern [[California]]. Santa Fe provided financial assistance to the group, which also founded the California Southern Railroad Company (CSRR) on October 23, 1880.<ref>Serpico, p. 18</ref> A [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], workshops, and [[classification yard]]s were built in [[National City, California|National City]], a suburb of San Diego. A [[wharf]] was also constructed to accommodate ship traffic. Initial plans were made to construct 18 miles (29&nbsp;km) of main line track extending north from the new complex. As of January 12, 1882, the California Southern commenced regular passenger and freight service between its National City terminus and Fallbrook Junction, just north of [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]].<ref>California Southern Railway History</ref>\n\nTracklaying continued and proceeded steadily northward until August 14, 1882, when a connection was made with the Southern Pacific's line in [[Colton, California|Colton]]. The California Southern's attempts to cross over the SP tracks a year later led to a [[frog war]] that ended on August 11, 1883, with a court order in the CSRR's favor. A track extension to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] was completed and the first regular passenger train arrived on September 13.<ref>Serpico, p. 20</ref> The line became part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad's transcontinental rail line in 1885 via an extension of the California Southern from Colton north over the [[Cajon Pass]] to [[Barstow, California|Barstow]]. Santa Fe completed the \"Surf Line\" run between Los Angeles and San Diego under the auspices of its subsidiary, the Southern California Railway (a different subsidiary from the California Southern), on August 12, 1888.<ref>Duke and Kistler, p. 43</ref> The route was initially referred to as the Los Angeles\u2014San Diego \"Short Line\" as it replaced the circuitous inland route through [[Temecula, California|Temecula Canyon]].\n\n[[Image:Santa Fe passenger terminal in San Diego prior to 1915.jpg|thumb|right|California Southern's San Diego passenger terminal as it appeared toward the end of the 19th century. An early predecessor of the ''San Diegan'' is waiting to depart.]]\n\nA real estate boom in the spring of 1887 brought thousands of people to Southern California, many of them traveling on \"The Santa F\u00e9 Route\" to San Diego. The California Southern constructed a new [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style depot to handle the throngs of people coming to the Southland.<ref>Gustafson and Serpico, p. 208</ref> The structure sported dark red paint with dark green trim.<ref>Hendrickson, p. 46</ref> Recurring washouts in the [[Temecula, California|Temecula Canyon]], however, often disrupted service; in response, the Santa Fe began construction of its {{convert|126|mi|km|adj=on}}-long \"[[Surf Line]]\" between Los Angeles' [[La Grande Station]] and the National City depot. From 1886 to 1888, the [[Riverside, Santa Ana and Los Angeles Railway]] built a branch line from [[Highgrove, California|Highgrove]] southwest via [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], to [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] and from [[Orange, California|Orange]] northwest to Los Angeles. Also in 1888, the [[San Bernardino and San Diego Railway]] completed its line from [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] north to Santa Ana, completing what was originally called the \"Los Angeles-San Diego Short Line.\" The inland route was finally abandoned in 1891, leaving the newer, coastal route as the only line to San Diego from the north.\n\nIt was generally felt that with the completion of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914, San Diego would logically become the principal [[Ship transport|port of call]] for the Atlantic-Pacific sea trade. To that end, the City decided to stage an international exposition in celebration of the opening of the Canal, and to tout San Diego as the first [[United States|U.S.]] port for ships traveling north after passing through the facility. But San Diego, even with its natural landlocked harbor, was {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} farther south than Los Angeles, which translated into an additional day of travel for both freight and passenger trains; in order for Santa Fe to compete with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], the company needed a port closer to its rival's transcontinental terminus. Santa Fe transferred most of its engine terminal yard to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] in 1887, then established an interim port facility in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] the following year. But when the railroad relocated its port operations to [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro's]] newly dredged, manmade harbor in 1911, it effectively ended San Diego's hopes to become the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast's]] southernmost commercial port.<ref>Serpico, p. 45</ref>\n\n===Santa Fe Depot===\n[[File:Sdadepot.jpg|thumb|left|The first SD&A through passenger train \"arrives\" in San Diego on December 1, 1919 to officially open the line.]]\nThough the elegant California Southern depot had served San Diego for nearly three decades, the station was not adequate to handle the expected flood of visitors through the \"Silver Gate\" in 1915. In fact, the Santa Fe had considered replacing the aging \"D\" Street station with a larger, more modern edifice.<ref>Gustafson and Serpico, p. 19</ref> Plans were drawn up for a new station complex in the Mission Revival Style, befitting the upcoming Exposition. The large, graceful [[palm tree]]s that graced the old depot were boxed and stored for re-planting alongside the new building. Construction began on a site just east of the existing structure on January 15, 1914, and was completed on December 31, at a total cost of [[United States dollar|$]]300,000. A [[Fred Harvey Company]] lunch counter and dining room were incorporated into the floor plan. The old wooden structure was razed during the few days before the opening; the [[clock tower]] was ceremonially toppled on March 7, 1915.\n\nThe facility opened for business on March 8.<ref name=\"Duke, p. 245\" /> Oliver J. Stough, the last surviving veteran of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], was given the honor of purchasing the first ticket.<ref>Hendrickson, p. 47</ref> At the outset, the Santa Fe had three daily local trains and one express train running between Los Angeles and San Diego. During the exposition nine scheduled trains ran on during the week (eight only made stops at [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], while the ninth was a local that stopped at all of the \"Surf Line\" stations). Twelve trains operated on weekends, many running in multiple sections. Four helper locomotives were assigned to the Sorrento Grade to help trains over the hill for the duration of the Exposition.\n\n[[File:Outside SD Union Station 1941.jpg|thumb|The station platform at San Diego in the early days of World War II.

Spreckels]]' [[San Diego Electric Railway]] (SDERy) made regular stops at the station since its opening, and continued to do so until April 24, 1949, when San Diego adopted an all-[[bus]] transit system.<ref>Dodge, p. 113</ref> Spreckels' other rail-related concern, the [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] (built in part to provide San Diego with a direct transcontinental rail link to the east by connecting with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] lines in [[El Centro, California|El Centro]]) was invited to make use of the facility. The first SD&A passenger train arrived in downtown on December 1, 1919.<ref>Hanft, p. 80</ref> In 1936 the Santa Fe ordered a six-car trainset from the [[Budd Company]] specifically for the initiation of a new, streamlined named train between the [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|LAUPT]] and San Diego. On March 27, 1938, the company inaugurated the ''[[San Diegan (train)|San Diegan]]'' route, operating on a two-hour-and-30-minute schedule. A second ''San Diegan'' consist entered service on June 8, 1941, doubling the schedule to four daily round trips.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duke|1995|p=247}}</ref> Freight service consisted of one scheduled overnight train per day, though extras were run as required (sometimes numbering as many as 10\u201312 per day). The United States' entry into [[World War II]] saw a significant increase in rail traffic to and from San Diego, both in the form of troop movements and transport of military vehicles and supplies.<ref>Jordan (2004), p. 69</ref>\n\n[[File:AT&SF64atSanDiegoCA10-26-63.jpg|thumb|right|The ''San Diegan'', pulled by a pair of back-to-back [[ALCO PA]] units, reaches the end of the line at San Diego's Union Station on October 26, 1963.]]\nWhile freight shipments dropped precipitously after the War, passenger demand remained high, and traffic on the \"Surf Line\" ran second only to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s [[New York City|New York]]\u2013[[Philadelphia]] corridor.<ref>Jordan (4Q 1996), p. 12</ref> Passenger service on the [[San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway]] (a successor to the SD&A) ended on January 11, 1951, due to years of continued declining patronage.<ref>Hanft, p. 125</ref> The front [[portico]] was removed in September 1954 to allow for the construction of a parking lot.<ref>Gustafson and Serpico, p. 209</ref>\n\n[[File:UnionStationSanDiegoByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the station, with an [[Amtrak]] [[Pacific Surfliner]] train parked in the Station, along with a northbound [[BNSF]] freight train passing through the station.]]\nOn May 1, 1971, [[Amtrak]] took over operation of the ''San Diegan'' line, which operated its route between Santa Fe Depot and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] in Los Angeles. Santa Fe trainsets usually ran with no cabcar in the days before Amtrak took over the operation of the ''San Diegan''. To make this work, Santa Fe trains backed up, and turned the trains around at the Washington Street [[Wye (rail)|Wye]], just about 3 miles north of the station near the San Diego International Airport. The wye is not longer in service today, and has been torn up and removed from the site.  After more than sixty years of service, the ''San Diegan'' was rebranded as the ''[[Pacific Surfliner]]'', reflecting extensions of the route over the past two decades to the Central Coast. Since the nearest wye is now 16 miles away in [[Miramar, San Diego|Miramar]], Amtrak Pacific Surfliner trains operate in [[push-pull train|push-pull]] mode, with an engine at one end and a cabcar at the other end.\n\nIn 1972 Santa Fe proposed to demolish the station and replace it with two 12-story buildings. After protests from the Save Our Heritage Organization, the city's Historical Review Board, and Mayor [[Pete Wilson]], Amtrak agreed to preserve the station if the city would redevelop the surrounding neighborhood.<ref name=\"Showley\" />\n\n==Current services==\nToday, a variety of bus, light rail, and commuter rail services call the station \"home.\" The structure has retained most of its original features, including the large blue-and-white \"Santa Fe\" sign (which was added in the mid-1950s as a nod to its heritage) and the original, hundred-year-old oak benches.<ref name=\"Showley\">{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/mar/03/depot-santa-fe-centennial/|title=Once nearly razed, Santa Fe Depot turns 100|last=Showley|first=Roger|date=March 3, 2015|newspaper=[[U-T San Diego]]|accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===San Diego Trolley===\nThe [[San Diego Trolley]], a modern [[light rail]] version of the San Diego Electric Railway Association (SDERy) [[tram|streetcar]] service, commenced operations on July 26, 1981, with its northern terminus at the station. Relocation of the [[Surf Line|Santa Fe mainline]] between the depot and Old Town San Diego in 1991 allowed for an extension of the Trolley to [[Mission Valley, California|Mission Valley]].

Because of their close proximity, the Metropolitan Transit System refers to the Santa Fe Depot, America Plaza stations and nearby bus stops as the \"Santa Fe Transit Center.\"\n\n===Commuter, intercity and freight rail===\n[[File:SDSanta.JPG|thumb|alt=central station, union station, San Diego Downtown, Spanish mission design|Inner architecture of Santa Fe]]\nCommuter rail at the station is provided by the [[Coaster (commuter rail)|Coaster commuter rail line]], which began weekday service on February 27, 1995. The Santa Fe Depot serves as the Coaster's southern terminus.\n\nThe station is the southern terminus of Amtrak's ''[[Pacific Surfliner]]'', successor to the ''San Diegan.'' It runs from San Diego through Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo, though the great majority of trains run along the \"[[Surf Line]]\" from San Diego to Los Angeles, the second busiest rail corridor in the United States after the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\nAmtrak's passenger figures have shown a decline in boardings and alightings at Santa Fe Depot over the last two years. In Fiscal Year 2011, there were 753,739 boardings and alightings at Santa Fe Depot;<ref name=\"Amtrak-CA-factsheet-2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/CALIFORNIA11.pdf |title=Amtrak Fact Sheet, Fiscal Year 2011 - State of California |publisher=Amtrak |format=pdf |date=December 2011 |accessdate= 2013-08-13}}</ref> in Fiscal Year 2012, boardings and alightings at the station declined to 708,934 (a 5.94% decrease over FY2011).<ref name=\"Amtrak-CA-factsheet-2012\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/CALIFORNIA12.pdf |title=Amtrak Fact Sheet, Fiscal Year 2012 - State of California |publisher=Amtrak |format=pdf |date=November 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> As of Fiscal Year 2013, the Amtrak ridership figure further declined, to 686,953 boardings and alightings, a 3.10% decline over FY2012.<ref name=\"Amtrak-CA-factsheet-2013\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/CALIFORNIA13.pdf |title=Amtrak Fact Sheet, Fiscal Year 2013 - State of California |publisher=Amtrak |format=pdf |date=November 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> (There has been a corresponding increase in Amtrak boardings at the [[Old Town Transit Center (MTS Transit Center)|Old Town Transit Center]] in San Diego over this same period, possibly indicating that some Amtrak boardings have been relocating from Santa Fe Depot to Old Town over the past two years.)<ref name=\"Amtrak-CA-factsheet-2013\" />\n\nDaily freight trains, operated by [[BNSF]], run through the station often at night (usually 4 trains or more during the late hours) due to less commuter traffic at that time. The yard for the freight trains is approximately a few miles more south, near [[Petco Park]] and adjacent to the [[12th & Imperial Transit Center]].\n\n==Future service==\n[[File:Union_front.JPG|thumb|In front of Santa Fe Depot.]]\nThe station was earlier studied as the possible southern terminus for the planned [[California High-Speed Rail]] system.  Upon completion, passengers would have been able to get to [[Los Angeles Union Station]] in 1 hour and 18 minutes. However, subsequent revisions to the proposal have settled on a new southern terminus, a proposed [[San Diego International Airport|Lindbergh Field]] intermodal transit center (ITC) to be built at Washington Street and Pacific Highway by 2035, as extending the high-speed rail line into downtown San Diego was likely to prove problematic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/programs/statewide_rail/proj_sections/LA_San_Diego/Los_Angeles_to_San_Diego_Community_Open_House_Meeting_Maps_5_16_11.pdf |title=Los Angeles to San Diego via the Inland Empire Section High-Speed Train Project Open House Meetings 2011 |publisher=California High-Speed Rail Authority |format=pdf |year=2011 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Station layout==\n[[File:Station_outside.JPG|thumb|The railway platform with the [[Pacific Surfliner]] and [[COASTER]].]]\nThe depot has six tracks.

Signs of mold-related respiratory problems in an infant include a persistent cough or [[wheeze]]. Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during the first year of life.

Exposure to mold may cause throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough and wheezing and skin irritation in some cases. Exposure to mold may heighten sensitivity, depending on the time and nature of exposure. People with chronic lung diseases are at higher risk for mold allergies, and will experience more severe reactions when exposed to mold.

They reproduce by [[spore]]s, which are carried by [[air current]]s. When spores land on a moist surface suitable for life, they begin to grow. Mold is normally found indoors at levels which do not affect most healthy individuals.\n\nBecause common [[building material]]s are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). [[Flood]]ing, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor-[[plumbing]] problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Warm Air is a Moisture Conduit|url=http://fourseasonsroofingandsiding.com/moisture.htm#moistair|work=by Robert Wewer|publisher=FSI Restorations|accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref> This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without [[vapor barrier]]s or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The \"[[doormat test]]\" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Doormat Test|url=http://fourseasonsroofingandsiding.com/Phantom.Siding.Leaks.htm#doormat|work=by Robert Wewer|publisher=FSI Restorations|accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref> Some materials, such as [[polished concrete]], do not support mold growth.\n\nSignificant mold growth requires moisture and food sources and a substrate capable of sustaining growth. Common cellulose-based building materials, such as [[plywood]], [[drywall]], [[furring]] strips, finish carpentry, cabinetry, wood framing, composite wood flooring, carpets, and carpet padding provide food for mold. In carpet, organic load such as invisible dust and [[cellulose]] are food sources. After water damage to a building, mold grows in walls and then becomes [[Dormancy|dormant]] until subsequent high humidity; suitable conditions reactivate mold. Mycotoxin levels are higher in buildings which have had a water incident.<ref name=CMHC>[[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]]</ref>\n\n[[Image:DublinMold.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Bedroom with mold on wall and ceiling|Although this home experienced minor exterior damage from [[Hurricane Katrina]], small leaks and inadequate airflow permitted mold infestation.]]\n\n=== Hidden mold ===\nMold is detectable by smell and signs of water damage on walls or ceiling and can grow in places invisible to the human eye. It may be found behind wallpaper or paneling, on the inside of ceiling tiles, the back of drywall, or the underside of carpets or carpet padding. Piping in walls may also be a source of mold, since they may leak (causing moisture and condensation).<ref name=\"EPA mold guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldguide.html|title=A Brief Guide to Mold, Moisture, and Your Home. EPA 402-K-02-003|date=September 2010|publisher=U. S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSpores need three things to grow into mold: nutrients - cellulose (the cell wall of green plants) is a common food for indoor spores; moisture - to begin the decaying process caused by mold; and time - mold growth begins from 24 hours to 10 days after the provision of growing conditions.\n\nMold colonies can grow inside buildings, and the chief hazard is the inhalation of mycotoxins. After a flood or major leak, mycotoxin levels are higher - even after a building has dried out.<ref name=CMHC/>\n\nFood sources for mold in buildings include cellulose-based materials such as wood, [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] and the paper facing on drywall and [[organic matter]] such as soap, fabrics, and dust containing skin cells. If a house has mold, the moisture may originate in the basement or crawl space, a leaking roof or a leak in plumbing pipes. Insufficient ventilation may accelerate moisture buildup. Visible mold colonies may form where ventilation is poorest and on perimeter walls (because they are nearest the [[dew point]]).\n\nIf there are mold problems in a house only during certain times of the year, the house is probably too [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] or too drafty. Mold problems occur in airtight homes more frequently in the warmer months (when humidity is high inside the house, and moisture is trapped), and occur in drafty homes more frequently in the colder months (when warm air escapes from the living area and condenses). If a house is [[Humidifier|artificially humidified]] during the winter, this can create conditions favorable to mold. Moving air may prevent mold from growing, since it has the same [[Desiccation|desiccating]] effect as low humidity. Mold grow best in warm temperatures, {{convert|77|to|86|F|C}}, although growth may occur between {{convert|32|and|95|F|C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dryhero.com/blog/controlling-mold-growth-in-the-home|title=Controlling Mold Growth in the Home|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nRemoving one of the three requirements for mold reduces (or eliminates) new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for example, dust or [[dander]]); and warmth since mold generally does not grow in cold environments.\n\n[[HVAC]] systems can produce all three requirements for mold growth. The [[air conditioning]] system creates a difference in temperature, encouraging condensation. The high rate of dusty air movement through an HVAC system may furnish ample food for mold. Since the air-conditioning system is not always running, warm conditions are the final component for mold growth.\n\n== Assessment ==\nAn observation of the indoor environment should be conducted before any sampling is performed. The area should be surveyed for odors indicating mold or bacterial growth, moisture sources, such as stagnant water or leaking pipes, and water-damaged building materials.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=Clinical environmental health and toxic exposures|date=2001|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|others=Sullivan, John B.

Efforts typically focus on areas where there are signs of liquid moisture or water vapor (humidity), or where moisture problems are suspected. Often, quick decisions about the immediate safety and health of the environment can be made by these observations before sampling is even needed.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) does not generally recommend sampling unless an occupant of the space has symptoms.

It should be done only to make a particular determination, such as airborne spore concentration or identifying a particular species.\n\n=== Sampling ===\nBefore sampling, a subsequent course of action should be determined.\n\nIn the U.S., sampling and analysis should follow the recommendations of the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), the EPA and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).

With swab, a cotton swab is rubbed across the area being sampled, often a measured area, and subsequently sent to the mold testing laboratory. The swab can rubbed on an agar plate to grow the mold on a culture medium. Final results indicate mold levels and species located in the suspect area. Surface sampling can by used to identify the source of mold exposure. Molecular analyses, such as [[Quantitative polymerase chain reaction|qPCR]], may also be used for species identification and quantification. Swab and surface sampling can give detailed information about the mold, but cannot measure the actual mold exposure because it is not aerosolized.<ref name=\":03\"/>\n\n==== Bulk and Dust Sampling ====\nBulk removal of material from the contaminated area is used to identify and quantify the mold in the sample. This method is often used to verify contamination and identify the source of contamination.<ref name=\":03\" /> Dust samples can be collected using a vacuum with a collection filter attached. Dust from surfaces such as floors, beds, or furniture is often collected to assess health effects from exposure in epidemiology studies.<ref name=\":03\" /> Researchers of indoor mold also use a long-term settled dust collection method where a dust cloth or petri dish is left out in the environment for a set period of time, sometimes weeks.<ref name=\":03\" /> Dust samples can be analyzed using culture-based or culture-independent methods. [[Quantitative PCR]] is a DNA-based molecular method that can identify and quantify fungal species. The Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) is a numerical that can be used in epidemiological studies to assess mold burdens of houses in the United States. The ERMI consists of a list of 36 fungal species commonly associated with damp houses that can be measured using qPCR.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vesper|first=Stephen|last2=McKinstry|first2=Craig|last3=Haugland|first3=Richard|last4=Wymer|first4=Larry|last5=Bradham|first5=Karen|last6=Ashley|first6=Peter|last7=Cox|first7=David|last8=Dewalt|first8=Gary|last9=Friedman|first9=Warren|date=August 2007|title=Development of an Environmental Relative Moldiness Index for US Homes|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=49|issue=8|pages=829\u2013833|doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181255e98|pmid=17693779|issn=1076-2752}}</ref><ref name=\":03\"/> Like swab and surface sampling, bulk and dust sampling can give detailed information about the mold source, but cannot accurately determine the level of exposure to the source.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n== Remediation ==\n[[File:Mold Remediation.png|thumbnail|alt=Worker in protective clothing removing mold from a wall|Mold remediation]]\nThe first step in solving an indoor mold problem is to remove the moisture source;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldresources.html|accessdate=July 12, 2015|title=Mold Resources|website=United States Environmental Agency|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218000155/http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldresources.html|archivedate=February 18, 2004}}</ref> new mold will begin to grow on moist, porous surfaces within 24 to 48 hours.

Exposure to mold may cause throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough and wheezing and skin irritation in some cases. Exposure to mold may heighten sensitivity, depending on the time and nature of exposure. People with chronic lung diseases are at higher risk for mold allergies, and will experience more severe reactions when exposed to mold.

They reproduce by [[spore]]s, which are carried by [[air current]]s. When spores land on a moist surface suitable for life, they begin to grow. Mold is normally found indoors at levels which do not affect most healthy individuals.\n\nBecause common [[building material]]s are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). [[Flood]]ing, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor-[[plumbing]] problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Warm Air is a Moisture Conduit|url=http://fourseasonsroofingandsiding.com/moisture.htm#moistair|work=by Robert Wewer|publisher=FSI Restorations|accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref> This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without [[vapor barrier]]s or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The \"[[doormat test]]\" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Doormat Test|url=http://fourseasonsroofingandsiding.com/Phantom.Siding.Leaks.htm#doormat|work=by Robert Wewer|publisher=FSI Restorations|accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref> Some materials, such as [[polished concrete]], do not support mold growth.\n\nSignificant mold growth requires moisture and food sources and a substrate capable of sustaining growth. Common cellulose-based building materials, such as [[plywood]], [[drywall]], [[furring]] strips, finish carpentry, cabinetry, wood framing, composite wood flooring, carpets, and carpet padding provide food for mold. In carpet, organic load such as invisible dust and [[cellulose]] are food sources. After water damage to a building, mold grows in walls and then becomes [[Dormancy|dormant]] until subsequent high humidity; suitable conditions reactivate mold. Mycotoxin levels are higher in buildings which have had a water incident.<ref name=CMHC>[[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]]</ref>\n\n[[Image:DublinMold.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Bedroom with mold on wall and ceiling|Although this home experienced minor exterior damage from [[Hurricane Katrina]], small leaks and inadequate airflow permitted mold infestation.]]\n\n=== Hidden mold ===\nMold is detectable by smell and signs of water damage on walls or ceiling and can grow in places invisible to the human eye. It may be found behind wallpaper or paneling, on the inside of ceiling tiles, the back of drywall, or the underside of carpets or carpet padding. Piping in walls may also be a source of mold, since they may leak (causing moisture and condensation).<ref name=\"EPA mold guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldguide.html|title=A Brief Guide to Mold, Moisture, and Your Home. EPA 402-K-02-003|date=September 2010|publisher=U. S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSpores need three things to grow into mold: nutrients - cellulose (the cell wall of green plants) is a common food for indoor spores; moisture - to begin the decaying process caused by mold; and time - mold growth begins from 24 hours to 10 days after the provision of growing conditions.\n\nMold colonies can grow inside buildings, and the chief hazard is the inhalation of mycotoxins. After a flood or major leak, mycotoxin levels are higher - even after a building has dried out.<ref name=CMHC/>\n\nFood sources for mold in buildings include cellulose-based materials such as wood, [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] and the paper facing on drywall and [[organic matter]] such as soap, fabrics, and dust containing skin cells. If a house has mold, the moisture may originate in the basement or crawl space, a leaking roof or a leak in plumbing pipes. Insufficient ventilation may accelerate moisture buildup. Visible mold colonies may form where ventilation is poorest and on perimeter walls (because they are nearest the [[dew point]]).\n\nIf there are mold problems in a house only during certain times of the year, the house is probably too [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] or too drafty. Mold problems occur in airtight homes more frequently in the warmer months (when humidity is high inside the house, and moisture is trapped), and occur in drafty homes more frequently in the colder months (when warm air escapes from the living area and condenses). If a house is [[Humidifier|artificially humidified]] during the winter, this can create conditions favorable to mold. Moving air may prevent mold from growing, since it has the same [[Desiccation|desiccating]] effect as low humidity. Mold grow best in warm temperatures, {{convert|77|to|86|F|C}}, although growth may occur between {{convert|32|and|95|F|C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstore.ksre.k-state.edu/pubs/mf2141.pdf|title=Controlling Mold Growth in the Home|publisher=Kansas State University}}</ref>\n\nRemoving one of the three requirements for mold reduces (or eliminates) new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for example, dust or [[dander]]); and warmth since mold generally does not grow in cold environments.\n\n[[HVAC]] systems can produce all three requirements for mold growth. The [[air conditioning]] system creates a difference in temperature, encouraging condensation. The high rate of dusty air movement through an HVAC system may furnish ample food for mold. Since the air-conditioning system is not always running, warm conditions are the final component for mold growth.\n\n== Assessment ==\nAn observation of the indoor environment should be conducted before any sampling is performed. The area should be surveyed for odors indicating mold or bacterial growth, moisture sources, such as stagnant water or leaking pipes, and water-damaged building materials.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=Clinical environmental health and toxic exposures|date=2001|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|others=Sullivan, John B.

With swab, a cotton swab is rubbed across the area being sampled, often a measured area, and subsequently sent to the mold testing laboratory. The swab can rubbed on an agar plate to grow the mold on a culture medium. Final results indicate mold levels and species located in the suspect area. Surface sampling can by used to identify the source of mold exposure. Molecular analyses, such as [[Quantitative polymerase chain reaction|qPCR]], may also be used for species identification and quantification. Swab and surface sampling can give detailed information about the mold, but cannot measure the actual mold exposure because it is not aerosolized.<ref name=\":03\"/>\n\n==== Bulk and Dust Sampling ====\nBulk removal of material from the contaminated area is used to identify and quantify the mold in the sample. This method is often used to verify contamination and identify the source of contamination.<ref name=\":03\" /> Dust samples can be collected using a vacuum with a collection filter attached.

The Elymian tribes have been speculated to be a [[Mediterranean race|pre-Indo-European people]] who migrated to Sicily from either [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolia]], the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean-Anatolian Coastal-Basin]], [[Liguria]] ([[Cinque Terre|Cinque Terre Coast]]), or one of the [[Aegean Islands]], or perhaps were a collection of native migratory maritime-based tribes from all previously mentioned regions. When the Elymians migrated to Sicily is unknown, however [[Hellenic historiography|scholars of antiquity]] considered them to be the second oldest inhabitants, while the Sicanians, thought to be the oldest inhabitants of Sicily by scholars of antiquity, were speculated to also be a [[Mediterranean race|pre-Indo-European tribe]], who migrated via boat from the [[J\u00facar|X\u00faquer river]] basin in [[Province of Castell\u00f3n|Castell\u00f3n]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]], [[Province of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Province of Alicante|Alicante]].   \n\nAll three tribes lived both a [[sedentary]] [[pastoral farming]] and [[Orchard|orchard farming]] lifestyle, and a [[semi-nomadic]] [[fishing]] and [[mixed farming]] lifestyle. The river [[Salso|Salsu]] was the territorial boundary between the Sicels and Sicanians. They wore basic [[Clothing in the ancient world|clothing]] made of wool, [[Fiber crop|plant fibre]], [[papyrus]], [[esparto grass]], animal skins, [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]], leather and fur, and created tools and weapons using [[Forging|metal forging]] and [[pottery]]. They typically lived in a [[nuclear family]] unit, with some [[Extended family|extended]] family members as well, usually within a [[Trullo|drystone hut]], a [[neolithic long house]] or a simple [[hut]] made of mud, stones, wood, palm leaves or grass. Their main methods of transportation were horseback, donkeys and [[chariots]]. Evidence of pet [[wildcats]], [[Cirneco dell'Etna|cirneco dogs]] and [[List of wooden toys|children toys]] have been discovered in archaeological digs, especially in [[Necropolis of Pantalica|cemetery tombs]]. Their diet was a typical [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean diet]], including unique food varieties such as [[Gaglioppo]], [[Acitana]] and [[Diamante citron]], while in modern times the [['Nduja|Calabrian Salami]], which is also produced in Sicily, and sometimes used to make [['Nduja|spicy 'Nduja spreadable paste/sauce]], is a popular type of salami sold in [[Brazil]] and the [[Anglosphere]]. The Sicelian polytheistic worship of the ancient and native [[chthonic]], [[animism|animistic]]-cult deities associated with [[geysers]] known as the [[Palici]], and of the volcano-fire god by the name of [[Adranus|Adranos]], were also worshipped throughout Sicily by the Elymians and Sicanians. The Elymians inhabited the western parts of Sicily, while the Sicanians inhabitated the central parts, and the Sicels inhabitated the [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] parts.  [[File:Sicilia arcaica.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left|Map of early settlements of Sicily]]\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{See also|Magna Graecia|Ancient Carthage|Phoenicia}}\nFrom the 11th century BC, [[Phoenicians]] began to settle in western Sicily, having already started colonies on the nearby parts of [[maghreb|North Africa]] and [[Malta]]. Sicily was later colonized and heavily settled by [[Greeks]], beginning in the 8th century BC. Initially, this was restricted to the [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] and southern parts of the island. As the [[Greek colonisation|Greek]] and [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenician]] communities grew more populous and more powerful, the Sicels and Sicanians were pushed further into the centre of the island. The independent [[Tyre, Lebanon|Phoenician]] colonial settlements were eventually absorbed by Carthage during the 6th Century BC. By the 3rd century BC, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was the most populous [[City-state|Greek city state]] in the world. [[Political_history_of_the_world#Ancient_history|Sicilian politics]] was intertwined with politics in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] itself, leading [[Classical Athens|Athens]], for example, to mount the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] in 415-413 BC during the [[Peloponnesian War]], which ended up severely affecting a defeated Athens, both politically and economically, in the following years to come. The constant warfare between [[Ancient Carthage]] and the [[Magna Graecia|Greek city-states]] eventually opened the door to an emerging [[Roman Republic|third power]]. In the 3rd century BC the [[Messina|Messanan Crisis]], caused by [[Mamertines|Mamertine]] [[mercenaries]] from [[Campania]], when the city-states of [[Messina]] ([[Punics|Carthaginian-owned]]) and [[Syracuse,Sicily|Syracuse]] ([[Dorians|Dorian-owned]]) were being constantly raided and pillaged by [[Mamertines]], during the period (282-240 BC) when Central (including Western) and Northeast Sicily were put under Carthaginian rule, motivated the intervention of the [[Roman Republic]] into Sicilian affairs, and led to the [[First Punic War]] between [[Rome]] and [[Carthage]]. By the end of the [[First Punic War|war]] in 242 BC, and with the death of [[Hiero II]], all of Sicily except Syracuse was in Roman hands, becoming Rome's first province outside of the Italian peninsula. For the next 600 years, Sicily would be [[Sicilia (Roman province)|a province]] of the Roman Republic and later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Prior to Roman rule, there were three native [[Elymian]] towns by the names of [[Segesta]], [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]] and [[Entella]], as well as several [[Sicels|Siculian]] towns called [[Agira|Agyrion]], [[Enna]] and [[Necropolis of Pantalica|Pantalica]]. \n\nSometime after Carthage conquered most of Sicily except for the Southeast which was still controlled by Syracuse, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus#Ruler of Sicily|Pyrrhus of Epirus]], the [[Molossians|Molossian]] king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], was installed as King/Tyrant of Sicily from 278-275 BC, even capturing the native [[Elymians|Elymian]] mountain-city of [[Eryx]], which was previously under Carthaginian fortification & protection before he captured it. Pyrrhus even attempted to capture [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]] ([[Siege of Lilybaeum]]) from the [[Punics]], which didn't succeed. A couple years later (275 BC), Envoys from [[South Italy|Southern Italy]] had notified him that of all the [[Magna Graecia|Greek cities]] in Italy, only Tarentum hadn't fallen to the Romans. Upon hearing this, coinciding with the fact that the Sicilian city-states had started becoming hostile towards him, due to him trying to force Sicily into becoming a [[Martial law|martial state]], Pyrrhus made his decision to depart from the island and dethrone himself, leaving Syracuse and Carthage in charge of the island again. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\" While his army was being transported by ship to mainland Italy, Pyrrhus' navy was destroyed by the Carthaginians at the [[Battle of the Strait of Messina]], with 98 warships sunk or disabled out of 110. After Pyrrhus of Epirus landed on Mainland Italy, his Roman opponents had mastered up a large army under [[Roman consul]] [[Manius Curius Dentatus]], while he was still Tyrant of Sicily. After Pyrrhus was defeated at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)]] by the Romans, he decided to end his campaigns against Southern Italy, and return to [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], resulting in the loss of all his territorial gains in Italy. The city of Tarentum however still remained under Epirote control. \n\nThe ancient historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] who wrote and recorded the monumental works of manuscripts about [[universal history|universal world/human history]] called [[Bibliotheca historica]], and the ancient [[Doric Greek|Doric-Greek]] revolutionary scientist, inventor and mathematician [[Archimedes]] who anticipated modern [[calculus]], and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] by applying methods of [[infinitesimal|infinitesimals]] and [[Method of exhaustion|exhaustion]] to rigorously derive and prove the range of [[geometry|geometric]] [[theorems]], and invented the innovative [[Archimedes' screw|Archimedean screw]], [[Block and tackle|compound pulleys]], and defensive war machines to protect his native town of Syracuse from invasions, were both born, grew up in, lived and died in Sicily.\n\n===Middle ages===\nAs the Roman Empire was falling apart, a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe known as the [[Vandals]], and an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribe known as the [[Alans]] took over Sicily in 468 AD (after [[Battle of Carthage (439)|taking]] Carthage in 439 they tried several times but failed to take the  island) under the rule of their king [[Geiseric]] ([[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal-Alanian Kingdom]]). The Vandals & Alans gained a monopoly on the Mediterranean grain trade during their monarchical reign, with all grain taxes being monitored by them. Due to the [[Western Roman Empire]] being too preoccupied with war in [[Gaul]], when the Vandals & Alans started [[Invasion|invading]] Sicily in 440, the Romans could not respond. Eastern Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II]] sent a failed expeditionary force to deal with them in 441, which ended in a Vandal-Alan counter-victory. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions, except for one toehold in [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]], to [[Odoacer]] (an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]] [[Barbarian]] statesman & general of possible [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] & [[Huns|Hunnic]] descent, and [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client king]] under [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] whose [[King of Italy|reign over Italy]] marked the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]) in 476 and completely to the [[Ostrogothic]] conquest of Sicily by [[Theodoric the Great]] which began in 488; although the [[Goths]] were [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], Theodoric sought to revive [[Roman people|Roman]] culture and government and allowed freedom of religion. In contrast to the prior Carthaginian, Syracusan (Dorian) and Roman Empires which ruled Sicily in the past, Sicily did not serve as a distinct province or administrative region under Germanic control, although it did retain a certain amount of autonomy. The [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] took place between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (with its capital-city based at [[Constantinople]], modern [[Istanbul]]), and during the reign of [[Justinian I]], Sicily was brought back under [[Greco-Roman_world|Greco-Roman rule]] under the military expeditions of Byzantine generals [[Belisarius|Flavius Belisarius]] and [[Narses]], resulting in [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine-Greek language]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|religion]] being embraced by the majority of the population. It was Syracuse where the Byzantine Emperor [[Constans II]] desired to move his capital in 663 AD, a decision which eventually led to his assassination. Sicily remained under [[Autonomous province|autonomous]] stable [[Constantinople|Byzantine rule]] as the [[Sicily (theme)|Theme/Province of Sicily]] ([[Theme (Byzantine district)]] for several peaceful centuries, until an invasion by [[Arab]] [[Muslims]] ([[Aghlabids]] from the [[Banu Tamim|Banu Tamim Clan]]) in the 9th century. \n\nBesides Sicily, the Theme or Province of Sicily also included the adjacent region of [[Calabria]] in Mainland Italy. The capital city of Byzantine Sicily was Syracuse. The province was looked after by the imperial governor known as a [[Praetor]], and was militarily protected under a general by the title of [[Dux]]. Sicily itself was divided into many districts known as a [[Turma]]. The Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Exarch of Ravennan Italy]] named [[Theophylact (exarch)|Theophylact]], between 702-709, originally came from Sicily. The garrison of [[Ravenna]] tried to kill him in 701, for reasons unknown. He also marched to Rome in 701 shortly after his promotion in the Exarchate for unknown reasons, which angered the Romans and local soldiers living there, however he was able to speak to the [[Pope John VI|Pope]], who calmed the Romans down. While Theophylact was still Exarch, Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian II]] seized all the leading citizens and officials of Ravenna at a local banquet, and dragged them abroad a ship to Constantinople. He sentenced many of them to death, while sparing some. This was due to a recent rebellion which [[Ravenna]] took part in, in 695. Justinian II later sacked Ravenna, weakening the Exarchate in charge of it. Theophylact was not a victim of the catastrophe, but was the first Exarch to experience a weakened Ravenna. Theophylact possibly moved back to Sicily after he retired from the Exarchate in 709. Theophylact might have also been the [[Strategos]] of Sicily from 700-710. The Strategos of Sicily was also able to exercise some control over the autonomous duchies of [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], depending on the local political situation or faction at the time.\n\nThe [[Aghlabid]] invasions were in part caused by the Byzantine-Sicilian military commander [[Euphemius (Sicily)|Euphemius]], who invited the Aghlabids to aid him in his rebellion against the imperial governor of Sicily in 826 AD. A similar situation happened a century prior, when the imperial governor of Sicily (Sergios), had declared a Byzantine official from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] by the name of [[Basil Onomagoulos]] ([[regnal name]] [[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]) as rival emperor, when false news reached Sicily that Constantinople had fallen to the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. When [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo the Syrian]] sent an [[Chartoularios|administrative official]] named [[Paul (exarch)|Paul]] to Sicily, the people and army of Syracuse surrendered Basil and his rebels up to him, leading to the beheading of Basil, while the former governor Sergios was able to escape to [[Kingdom of the Lombards|the parts of Mainland Italy controlled by the Lombards]]. Another rebellion took place between the years 781-793, when the aristocratic governor of Sicily, [[Elpidius (rebel)|Elpidius]], was accused of conspiring against [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]] in favour of [[Nikephoros (Caesar)|Nikephoros]]. After Elpidius's forces were militarily defeated by Empress Irene's large fleet dispatched in Sicily, he, along with his lieutenant, the [[dux]] of [[Calabria]] named Nikephoros, defected to the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], where he was humorously acknowledged as rival emperor. After losing another military expedition, this time against [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] with the help of the Abbasids, he advised the [[Banu Abbas|Abbasid]] [[Emir]] of [[Upper Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Abd al-Malik ibn Salih]], to \"throw away his silk and put on his armour\", warning him against the aggressive new reign of [[Nikephoros I]]. [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|The Muslim conquest]] was a see-saw affair; the local population resisted fiercely and the [[Aghlabids|Arabs]] suffered considerable dissension and infighting among themselves during this process. Not until 965 was the island's conquest successfully completed by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], with Syracuse in particular resisting almost to the end ([[Siege of Syracuse (877-878)]]). Before 965, there still remained some fortified towns under Roman-Byzantine protection. During the [[Emirate of Sicily]]'s reign, substantial settlements were established in various regions of Sicily by [[Arab-Berbers]]. Their capital was based at [[Palermo|Bal'harm]]. \n\nThe first phase of [[Muslim]] rule began with the conquests of the third Aghlabid [[Emir]] [[Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya]], and consolidated with the reign of the ninth Emir [[Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya]] after the conquest of [[Taormina]]. The first attempt to [[Siege of Syracuse (827-828)|capture Syracuse]] was under general [[Asad ibn al-Furat]], although it ended in a Byzantine victory. A strong combination of [[Ifriqiya|Ifriqiyan]] and [[Andalusia|Andalusian]] troops helped to capture the Island between 830-831. After a revolt was suppressed, the Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Mansur Billah]] appointed a member of the [[Kalbids|Kalbid]] dynasty, [[Al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi]], as First Emir of Sicily. The Kalbids ruled Sicily from 948 to 1053. [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis]], fourth ruler of the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] [[Sanhaja]] dynasty in North Africa, attempted to annex the island for the Zirids, but his attempts failed. The new Arab-Berber rulers initiated revolutionary [[Arab Agricultural Revolution|land reforms]], which in turn increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings, a dent to the dominance of the landed estates. The Arabs further improved irrigation systems through [[Qanats]], introducing oranges, lemons, pistachio and sugarcane to Sicily. [[Ibn Hawqal]], a [[Baghdad|Baghdadi]] [[merchant]] who visited Sicily in 950, commented that a walled suburb called the Kasr (the palace) was the center of Palermo, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman Catholic cathedral. The suburb of Al-Khalisa (Kalsa) contained the Sultan's palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. Ibn Hawqual reckoned there were 7,000 individual butchers trading in 150 shops. By 1050, Palermo had a population of 350,000, making it one of the largest cities in Europe, behind Islamic-Spain's capital C\u00f3rdoba and the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, which had populations over 450-500,000. Palermo's population dropped to 150,000 under Norman rule. By 1330 Palermo's population had declined to 51,000, possibly due to the inhabitants of the region being deported to other regions of [[County of Sicily|Norman Sicily]] or to the Norman [[County of Apulia and Calabria]]. The Arab traveler [[Ibn Jubayr]] from [[Al-Andalus]] stated that the buildings built during this period were made of [[limestone]]. The latinized Catholic Sicilians in Western Sicily still continued to revolt until Norman rule, and the [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]-speaking Byzantine [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]-[[Catholicism|Catholic]] Sicilians in the East almost secured their independence several times during their revolts. Christians and Jews were tolerated in Muslim Sicily as [[dhimmi|dhimmis]], and had to pay the [[Jizya]] poll tax, and [[Kharaj]] land tax, but were exempt from the [[Zakat]] alms-giving tax Muslims had to pay. Many Jews immigrated to Sicily during Muslim rule, but left after the Normans arrived. \n\n[[File:Sicilian types and costumes.jpg|thumb|200px|Sicilians in traditional dress]] \nIn the 11th century, the mainland southern Italian powers were hiring [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman mercenaries]], who were Christian descendants of the [[Vikings]]; it was the [[Normans]] under [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] (of the [[Hauteville dynasty]]) who conquered Sicily from the Muslims [[Battle of Cerami|over a period of thirty years]] until finally controlling the entire island by 1091 as the [[County of Sicily]]. In 1130, [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]] founded the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] as an independent state with its own [[Sicilian Parliament|Parliament]], language, [[schooling]], army and currency, while the Sicilian culture evolved distinct traditions, clothing, linguistic changes, [[Sicilian cuisine|cuisine]] and customs not found in mainland [[Italy]].<ref>James Minahan, ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World A-Z'', 2002 p.1714.</ref> A great number of mainland [[County of Apulia and Calabria|Southern Italian]] and [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] families began settling in Sicily during this time.\n\nThe Siculo-Norman rule of the [[Hauteville dynasty]] continued until 1198, when [[Frederick I of Sicily]], the son of a [[Siculo-Norman]] queen and a [[Hohenstaufen dynasty|Swabian-German]] emperor ascended the throne. In fact it was during the reign of this Hohenstaufen ([[Swabians|Swabian-German]]) king [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], that the poetic form known as a [[sonnet]] was invented by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], the head Poet, Teacher and [[Notary]] of the [[Sicilian School|Sicilian School for Poetry]]. His (Frederick I) descendants governed Sicily until the [[Papal States|Papacy]] invited a [[Capetian dynasty|French]] prince to take the throne, which led to a decade-and-a-half of French rule under [[Charles I of Sicily]]; he was later deposed in the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] against French rule, which put the daughter of [[Manfred of Sicily]] - [[Constance of Sicily, Queen of Aragon|Constance II]] and her husband [[Peter III of Aragon]], a member of the [[House of Barcelona]], on the throne. Their [[House of Barcelona|descendants]] ruled the Kingdom of Sicily until 1401. Following the [[Compromise of Caspe]] in 1412 the Sicilian throne passed to the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] monarchs from [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castille]].\n\n===Modern and Contemporary history===\nAfter the [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans]], [[History of the Caucasus|Caucasus]], [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]] and [[Ottoman wars in Africa|North Africa]], waves of [[Greeks|Greek]] (including [[Arvanites]] and [[Pontic Greeks]]), [[Peoples of the Caucasus|North and South Caucasian]], [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]], [[Kabyle people|Kayble]] and [[Tunisian people|Tunisian]] [[Berbers|Berber]], [[Syrians|Syrian]], [[Bosnians|Bosnian]], Romanian [[Vlachs|Vlach]], Lebanese [[Maronites|Maronite]] and [[Lebanese Druze|Druze]], [[Serbs|Serbian]], [[Tarabin Bedouin|Tarabin Bedouins]] from the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and Albanian [[Tosks|Tosk]] [[Immigration|migrants]], and [[migrant workers]] fled to [[Sicily]] in sizable numbers between the 15th and 19th centuries to escape persecution and [[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Taxation]]. In 1735, the Spanish era ended when [[Charles V of Sicily|Charles V]] from the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|House of Bourbon]] was crowned king. For the better part of the next century-and-a-half, Sicily was in [[personal union]] with the other Southern Italian [[Kingdom of Naples]], with the official residence located in [[Naples]], under the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Bourbon dynasty]]. In 1861, however, Sicily became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] as a result of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. After the unification of Italy and the [[Fascism|Fascist era]], a wave of [[Sicilian nationalism]] led to the adoption of the [[Statute of Sicily]], under which the island has become an [[autonomous region]]. Since 1946, the island enjoys the most advanced special status of all the [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]]s, which allows the Sicilian residents to keep 100% of the revenue from all the taxes, without giving back any to the central government in [[Rome]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type=\n|align=right\n|widths=50px \n|heights=50px\n|footnote=Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2017\n|1861|2409000\n|1871|2590000\n|1881|2933000\n|1901|3568000\n|1911|3812000\n|1921|4223000\n|1931|3906000\n|1936|4000000\n|1951|4487000\n|1961|4721000\n|1971|4681000\n|1981|4907000\n|1991|4966000\n|2001|4969000\n|2011|5002904\n|2017|5029615\n}}\n\n[[File:Palermo panorama.JPG|thumb|The city of [[Palermo]] in 2005]]\nSicily has experienced the presence of a number of different cultures and ethnicities in its vast history, including the original [[Italic peoples]] ([[Sicani]], [[Siculi]] and [[Elymians]], although the language families which each of these three peoples spoke has still not been deciphered by academia or linguistic historians/scholars), [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenicians]] ([[Phoenicia]]) and [[Punics|Carthaginians]] ([[Ancient Carthage]]), [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]] ([[Magna Graecia]]), [[Bruttians]], [[Lucanians]], [[Mamertines]], [[Iberians]], [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], [[Colchis|Colchians]] (Proto-[[Georgians]]), [[Anatolian peoples|Anatolians]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Assyria|Assyrians]], [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[Nabataeans]], [[Numidians]], [[Tribe of Judah|Judeans]] & [[Tribe of Dan|Danites]], [[Eurasian nomads]] ([[Scythia]]), [[Illyrians]], [[Ligures]], [[Gauls]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the [[ancient history|ancient]] and [[classical antiquity|classical periods]]. \n\nFrom the medieval and modern eras, Sicily experienced [[Human migration|migratory]] waves of [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] (During [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal-Alan]] rule), while under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Emirate of Sicily|Saracen]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] rules, there were considerable numbers of [[Arabs]], [[Berbers]], [[Hebrews]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Tarabin Bedouin|Tarabin Bedouins]], [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]], [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Nubians]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Tatars]], [[Vikings]], [[Mongols]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Normans]], [[Swabians]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austrians and Hungarians]], [[Lombards]] and [[Italians]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]], [[Spaniards]], [[Sardinians]], [[Basques]], [[Romanians]], [[French people|French]], [[British people|British]] and [[Albanians|Albanian]] people settling in Sicily for various reasons, such as to escape [[persecution]], to establish merchant communities or to find better land for cultivation.\n\nAbout five million people live in Sicily, making it the [[List of regions of Italy#List of regions|fourth most populated region in Italy]]. However, in the first century after the [[Italian unification]], Sicily had one of the most negative [[net migration rate]]s among the regions of Italy because of millions of people moving to the Italian mainland and countries like [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], The [[Soviet Union]], [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], The [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Albania]], [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], The [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Japan]], [[South Asia|India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[South Korea]], [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

Despite being genetically similar to the aforementioned regions, Sicilians still constitute a distinct and separate ethnic group, with the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] and [[Calabria|Calabrese]] being the two populations most closely related, genetically and culturally speaking, to Sicilians. <ref name=\"Peristera\">{{cite journal|title=Maritime route of colonization of Europe|first=Peristera|last=Paschou |doi=10.1073/pnas.1320811111|pmid=24927591|volume=111|issue=25|pages=9211\u20139216|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=4078858|year=2014|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.9211P}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Genetic history of the population of Crete|first1=Petros|last1=Drineas|first2=Fotis|last2=Tsetsos|first3=Anna|last3=Plantinga|first4=Iosif|last4=Lazaridis|first5=Evangelia|last5=Yannaki|first6=Anna|last6=Razou|first7=Katerina|last7=Kanaki|first8=Manolis|last8=Michalodimitrakis|first9=Francisco|last9=Perez\u2010Jimenez|first10=Giustina De|last10=Silvestro|first11=Maria C.|last11=Renda|first12=John A.|last12=Stamatoyannopoulos|first13=Kenneth K.|last13=Kidd|first14=Brian L.|last14=Browning|first15=Peristera|last15=Paschou|first16=George|last16=Stamatoyannopoulos|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|volume=0|issue=6|pages=373\u2013388|doi=10.1111/ahg.12328|pmid = 31192450|pmc=6851683|year = 2019}} </ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stamatoyannopoulos |first1=George |title=Genetics of the peloponnesean populations and the theory of extinction of the medieval peloponnesean Greeks |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |date=8 March 2017 |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=637\u2013645 |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2017.18|pmid=28272534 |pmc=5437898 }}</ref> https://cyprus-mail.com/2017/06/21/study-finds-greek-turkish-cypriots-close-genetically/\n\n====MtDna and Y DNA studies====\nAccording to one study, [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-Dna haplogroups]] were found at the following frequencies in Sicily:\n[[Haplogroup R1 (Y-DNA)|R1]] (36.76%), [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] (29.65%), [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] (18.21%), [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|I]] (7.62%), [[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|G]] (5.93%), [[Haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|T]] (5.51%), [[Haplogroup Q-M242 (Y-DNA)|Q]] (2.54%).<ref name=\"nature.com\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2008.120|pmid = 18685561|pmc = 2985948|title = Differential Greek and northern African migrations to Sicily are supported by genetic evidence from the Y chromosome|journal = European Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 91\u201399|year = 2009|last1 = Di Gaetano|first1 = Cornelia|last2 = Cerutti|first2 = Nicoletta|last3 = Crobu|first3 = Francesca|last4 = Robino|first4 = Carlo|last5 = Inturri|first5 = Serena|last6 = Gino|first6 = Sarah|last7 = Guarrera|first7 = Simonetta|last8 = Underhill|first8 = Peter A.|last9 = King|first9 = Roy J.|last10 = Romano|first10 = Valentino|last11 = Cali|first11 = Francesco|last12 = Gasparini|first12 = Mauro|last13 = Matullo|first13 = Giuseppe|last14 = Salerno|first14 = Alfredo|last15 = Torre|first15 = Carlo|last16 = Piazza|first16 = Alberto}}</ref> R1 and I haplogroups are typical in [[Western Europe|West European]] populations while J, T and E1b1b consist of lineages with differential distribution across [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Europe]], although haplogroup T is most prominent in populations from the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]] in [[East India]]. Haplogroup G reaches its highest percentage among [[Georgians]], its presence in Sicily is probably a result of [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasian]] immigration into Sicily after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]], while the presence of haplogroup Q at almost 3 percent is most likely the result of previous [[Tatar]], and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] migration into Sicily during the medieval and early modern periods, as this haplogroup is mostly found in the [[Americas]] and [[Siberia]].

However the use of [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] is limited to informal contexts (mostly in family).\n\nSicilian was an early influence in the development of standard Italian, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and his court of notaries or ''Magna Curia'' which, headed by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], also gave birth to the [[Sicilian School]], widely inspired by troubadour literature. It is in this language that appeared the first [[sonnet]], whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself. Sicilian was also the official language of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1300 to 1543. Prior to the 20th century, large numbers of Sicilian people spoke only Sicilian as their mother tongue, with little or no fluent knowledge of [[Italian language|Italian]]. Today, while Sicilian is an unrecognized language being used as part of many people's daily life, Italian is the only official language and predominates in the public arena.\n\nThe [[Siculo-Arabic]] dialect as a vernacular [[Varieties of Arabic|variety of]] [[Arabic]] once spoken in [[Sicily]] and neighbouring [[Malta]] between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century. The language became extinct in Sicily, but in Malta it eventually evolved into what is now the [[Maltese language]]. It influenced the dialect of [[Pantelleria]].\n\nThe [[Siculish]] dialect is the [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] \"Sicilianization\" of [[English language]] words and phrases by immigrants from [[Sicily]] to the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Forms of Siculish are also to be found in other Sicilian immigrant communities of [[Anglosphere|English-speaking countries]], namely Canada and Australia.  A surprising similarity can often be found between these forms, through either coincidence, trans-national movements of Sicilian immigrants, or more likely, through the logical adaptation of [[English language|English]] using linguistic norms from the Sicilian language.\n\n====Ethno-linguistic minorities====\nThere are two main historical [[Ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic]] minorities in Sicily, the [[Lombards of Sicily]] and the [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb]].\n* The [[Lombards of Sicily]] are a linguistic minority living in Sicily who speak an isolated variety of Gallo-Italic dialects, the so-called [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily]].

The Lombards of Sicily, who originally hailed from Northern Italy, settled the central and [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] part of Sicily about 900 years ago, during the [[Norman conquest of Sicily]]. Because of linguistic differences among the Gallo-Italic dialects of Sicily, it is supposed that there were different immigration routes. From [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia]], and [[Lombardy]] they began to spread south between the 11th and 14th centuries. The most important areas where the Gallo-Italic of Sicily is spoken are [[Acquedolci]], [[Montalbano Elicona]], [[Novara di Sicilia]], [[Fondachelli-Fantina]] [[San Fratello]] and [[San Piero Patti]] ([[Province of Messina]]), [[Aidone]], [[Nicosia, Sicily|Nicosia]], [[Piazza Armerina]] and [[Sperlinga]] ([[Province of Enna]]).\n[[File:Tabelle italiano-albanese.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Bilingual road signs, in Italian and Arb\u00ebresh in [[Piana degli Albanesi]].]]\n* The [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people]] settled in Southern Italy in the 15th to 18th centuries in several waves of migrations. They are the descendants of mostly [[Tosk Albanian]] refugees of Christian faith who fled to Italy after the Albanian conquest and subsequent Islamisation by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the [[Balkans]]. They speak their own variant of the [[Arb\u00ebresh]] language. There are three identified Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb communities in the [[province of Palermo]], which have maintained unchanged, with different aspects together, the ethnic, linguistic and religious origins. The areas are: [[Contessa Entellina]], [[Piana degli Albanesi]] and [[Santa Cristina Gela]]; while the varieties of Piana and Santa Cristina Gela are similar enough to be entirely mutually intelligible, the variety of Contessa Entellina is not entirely intelligible. The largest centre is [[Piana degli Albanesi]] which, besides being the hub of [[Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi|religious]] and socio-cultural communities, has guarded and defended their peculiarities intact over time. There are two other communities with a strong historical and linguistic heritage.\n\n* The community of the [[Griko people|Greeks of Messina]] (or Siculo-Greeks) speaks [[modern Greek]] with some elements of the [[Ancient Greek|ancient Greek language]] spoken in the island, and [[Calabrian Greek]]. The Greek community was reconstituted in 2003 with the name of ''\"Comunit\u00e0 Hellenica dello Stretto\"'' (Hellenic Community of the Strait).\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Icon - Main altar of Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015.JPG|180px|right|thumb|[[Hodegetria|Virgin Hodegetria]], [[Monreale Cathedral]].]]\nThe vast majority of Sicilians are [[baptism|baptized]] as [[Roman Catholic]]. The Catholic religion represents one of the most important elements of the Sicilian identity. The [[Hodegetria|Virgin Hodegetria]] is the patroness of Sicily. The Sicilian people are also known for their deep devotion to some Sicilian female saints: the martyrs [[Agatha of Sicily|Agatha]] and [[Saint Lucy|Lucy]], respectively patroness of Catania and Syracuse, and the hermitess [[Saint Rosalia|Rosalia]], patroness of Palermo. The Sicilian people have significantly contributed to the history of [[Christianity]].

The Elymian tribes have been speculated to be a [[Mediterranean race|pre-Indo-European people]] who migrated to Sicily from either [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolia]], the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean-Anatolian Coastal-Basin]], [[Liguria]] ([[Cinque Terre|Cinque Terre Coast]]), or one of the [[Aegean Islands]], or perhaps were a collection of native migratory maritime-based tribes from all previously mentioned regions. When the Elymians migrated to Sicily is unknown, however [[Hellenic historiography|scholars of antiquity]] considered them to be the second oldest inhabitants, while the Sicanians, thought to be the oldest inhabitants of Sicily by scholars of antiquity, were speculated to also be a [[Mediterranean race|pre-Indo-European tribe]], who migrated via boat from the [[J\u00facar|X\u00faquer river]] basin in [[Province of Castell\u00f3n|Castell\u00f3n]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]], [[Province of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Province of Alicante|Alicante]].   \n\nAll three tribes lived both a [[sedentary]] [[pastoral farming]] and [[Orchard|orchard farming]] lifestyle, and a [[semi-nomadic]] [[fishing]] and [[mixed farming]] lifestyle. The river [[Salso|Salsu]] was the territorial boundary between the Sicels and Sicanians. They wore basic [[Clothing in the ancient world|clothing]] made of wool, [[Fiber crop|plant fibre]], [[papyrus]], [[esparto grass]], animal skins, [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]], leather and fur, and created tools and weapons using [[Forging|metal forging]] and [[pottery]]. They typically lived in a [[nuclear family]] unit, with some [[Extended family|extended]] family members as well, usually within a [[Trullo|drystone hut]], a [[neolithic long house]] or a simple [[hut]] made of mud, stones, wood, palm leaves or grass. Their main methods of transportation were horseback, donkeys and [[chariots]]. Evidence of pet [[wildcats]], [[Cirneco dell'Etna|cirneco dogs]] and [[List of wooden toys|children toys]] have been discovered in archaeological digs, especially in [[Necropolis of Pantalica|cemetery tombs]]. Their diet was a typical [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean diet]], including unique food varieties such as [[Gaglioppo]], [[Acitana]] and [[Diamante citron]], while in modern times the [['Nduja|Calabrian Salami]], which is also produced in Sicily, and sometimes used to make [['Nduja|spicy 'Nduja spreadable paste/sauce]], is a popular type of salami sold in [[Brazil]] and the [[Anglosphere]]. The Sicelian polytheistic worship of the ancient and native [[chthonic]], [[animism|animistic]]-cult deities associated with [[geysers]] known as the [[Palici]], and of the volcano-fire god by the name of [[Adranus|Adranos]], were also worshipped throughout Sicily by the Elymians and Sicanians. The Elymians inhabited the western parts of Sicily, while the Sicanians inhabitated the central parts, and the Sicels inhabitated the [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] parts.  [[File:Sicilia arcaica.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left|Map of early settlements of Sicily]]\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{See also|Magna Graecia|Ancient Carthage|Phoenicia}}\nFrom the 11th century BC, [[Phoenicians]] began to settle in western Sicily, having already started colonies on the nearby parts of [[maghreb|North Africa]] and [[Malta]]. Sicily was later colonized and heavily settled by [[Greeks]], beginning in the 8th century BC. Initially, this was restricted to the [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] and southern parts of the island. As the [[Greek colonisation|Greek]] and [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenician]] communities grew more populous and more powerful, the Sicels and Sicanians were pushed further into the centre of the island. The independent [[Tyre, Lebanon|Phoenician]] colonial settlements were eventually absorbed by Carthage during the 6th Century BC. By the 3rd century BC, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was the most populous [[City-state|Greek city state]] in the world. [[Political_history_of_the_world#Ancient_history|Sicilian politics]] was intertwined with politics in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] itself, leading [[Classical Athens|Athens]], for example, to mount the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] in 415-413 BC during the [[Peloponnesian War]], which ended up severely affecting a defeated Athens, both politically and economically, in the following years to come. The constant warfare between [[Ancient Carthage]] and the [[Magna Graecia|Greek city-states]] eventually opened the door to an emerging [[Roman Republic|third power]]. In the 3rd century BC the [[Messina|Messanan Crisis]], caused by [[Mamertines|Mamertine]] [[mercenaries]] from [[Campania]], when the city-states of [[Messina]] ([[Punics|Carthaginian-owned]]) and [[Syracuse,Sicily|Syracuse]] ([[Dorians|Dorian-owned]]) were being constantly raided and pillaged by [[Mamertines]], during the period (282-240 BC) when Central (including Western) and Northeast Sicily were put under Carthaginian rule, motivated the intervention of the [[Roman Republic]] into Sicilian affairs, and led to the [[First Punic War]] between [[Rome]] and [[Carthage]]. By the end of the [[First Punic War|war]] in 242 BC, and with the death of [[Hiero II]], all of Sicily except Syracuse was in Roman hands, becoming Rome's first province outside of the Italian peninsula. For the next 600 years, Sicily would be [[Sicilia (Roman province)|a province]] of the Roman Republic and later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Prior to Roman rule, there were three native [[Elymian]] towns by the names of [[Segesta]], [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]] and [[Entella]], as well as several [[Sicels|Siculian]] towns called [[Agira|Agyrion]], [[Enna]] and [[Necropolis of Pantalica|Pantalica]]. \n\nSometime after Carthage conquered most of Sicily except for the Southeast which was still controlled by Syracuse, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus#Ruler of Sicily|Pyrrhus of Epirus]], the [[Molossians|Molossian]] king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], was installed as King/Tyrant of Sicily from 278-275 BC, even capturing the native [[Elymians|Elymian]] mountain-city of [[Eryx]], which was previously under Carthaginian fortification & protection before he captured it. Pyrrhus even attempted to capture [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]] ([[Siege of Lilybaeum]]) from the [[Punics]], which didn't succeed. A couple years later (275 BC), Envoys from [[South Italy|Southern Italy]] had notified him that of all the [[Magna Graecia|Greek cities]] in Italy, only Tarentum hadn't fallen to the Romans. Upon hearing this, coinciding with the fact that the Sicilian city-states had started becoming hostile towards him, due to him trying to force Sicily into becoming a [[Martial law|martial state]], Pyrrhus made his decision to depart from the island and dethrone himself, leaving Syracuse and Carthage in charge of the island again. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\" While his army was being transported by ship to mainland Italy, Pyrrhus' navy was destroyed by the Carthaginians at the [[Battle of the Strait of Messina]], with 98 warships sunk or disabled out of 110. After Pyrrhus of Epirus landed on Mainland Italy, his Roman opponents had mastered up a large army under [[Roman consul]] [[Manius Curius Dentatus]], while he was still Tyrant of Sicily. After Pyrrhus was defeated at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)]] by the Romans, he decided to end his campaigns against Southern Italy, and return to [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], resulting in the loss of all his territorial gains in Italy. The city of Tarentum however still remained under Epirote control. \n\nThe ancient historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] who wrote and recorded the monumental works of manuscripts about [[universal history|universal world/human history]] called [[Bibliotheca historica]], and the ancient [[Doric Greek|Doric-Greek]] revolutionary scientist, inventor and mathematician [[Archimedes]] who anticipated modern [[calculus]], and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] by applying methods of [[infinitesimal|infinitesimals]] and [[Method of exhaustion|exhaustion]] to rigorously derive and prove the range of [[geometry|geometric]] [[theorems]], and invented the innovative [[Archimedes' screw|Archimedean screw]], [[Block and tackle|compound pulleys]], and defensive war machines to protect his native town of Syracuse from invasions, were both born, grew up in, lived and died in Sicily.\n\n===Middle ages===\nAs the Roman Empire was falling apart, a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe known as the [[Vandals]], and an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribe known as the [[Alans]] took over Sicily in 468 AD (after [[Battle of Carthage (439)|taking]] Carthage in 439 they tried several times but failed to take the  island) under the rule of their king [[Geiseric]] ([[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal-Alanian Kingdom]]). The Vandals & Alans gained a monopoly on the Mediterranean grain trade during their monarchical reign, with all grain taxes being monitored by them. Due to the [[Western Roman Empire]] being too preoccupied with war in [[Gaul]], when the Vandals & Alans started [[Invasion|invading]] Sicily in 440, the Romans could not respond. Eastern Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II]] sent a failed expeditionary force to deal with them in 441, which ended in a Vandal-Alan counter-victory. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions, except for one toehold in [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]], to [[Odoacer]] (an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]] [[Barbarian]] statesman & general of possible [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] & [[Huns|Hunnic]] descent, and [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client king]] under [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] whose [[King of Italy|reign over Italy]] marked the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]) in 476 and completely to the [[Ostrogothic]] conquest of Sicily by [[Theodoric the Great]] which began in 488; although the [[Goths]] were [[Germanic]], Theodoric sought to revive [[Roman people|Roman]] culture and government and allowed freedom of religion. In contrast to the prior Carthaginian, Syracusan (Dorian) and Roman Empires which ruled Sicily in the past, Sicily did not serve as a distinct province or administrative region under Germanic control, although it did retain a certain amount of autonomy. The [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] took place between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (with its capital-city based at [[Constantinople]], modern [[Istanbul]]), and during the reign of [[Justinian I]], Sicily was brought back under [[Greco-Roman_world|Greco-Roman rule]] under the military expeditions of Byzantine generals [[Belisarius|Flavius Belisarius]] and [[Narses]], resulting in [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine-Greek language]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|religion]] being embraced by the majority of the population. It was Syracuse where the Byzantine Emperor [[Constans II]] desired to move his capital in 663 AD, a decision which eventually led to his assassination. Sicily remained under [[Autonomous province|autonomous]] stable [[Constantinople|Byzantine rule]] as the [[Sicily (theme)|Theme/Province of Sicily]] ([[Theme (Byzantine district)]] for several peaceful centuries, until an invasion by [[Arab]] [[Muslims]] ([[Aghlabids]] from the [[Banu Tamim|Banu Tamim Clan]]) in the 9th century. \n\nBesides Sicily, the Theme or Province of Sicily also included the adjacent region of [[Calabria]] in Mainland Italy. The capital city of Byzantine Sicily was Syracuse. The province was looked after by the imperial governor known as a [[Praetor]], and was militarily protected under a general by the title of [[Dux]]. Sicily itself was divided into many districts known as a [[Turma]]. The Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Exarch of Ravennan Italy]] named [[Theophylact (exarch)|Theophylact]], between 702-709, originally came from Sicily. The garrison of [[Ravenna]] tried to kill him in 701, for reasons unknown. He also marched to Rome in 701 shortly after his promotion in the Exarchate for unknown reasons, which angered the Romans and local soldiers living there, however he was able to speak to the [[Pope John VI|Pope]], who calmed the Romans down. While Theophylact was still Exarch, Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian II]] seized all the leading citizens and officials of Ravenna at a local banquet, and dragged them abroad a ship to Constantinople. He sentenced many of them to death, while sparing some. This was due to a recent rebellion which [[Ravenna]] took part in, in 695. Justinian II later sacked Ravenna, weakening the Exarchate in charge of it. Theophylact was not a victim of the catastrophe, but was the first Exarch to experience a weakened Ravenna. Theophylact possibly moved back to Sicily after he retired from the Exarchate in 709. Theophylact might have also been the [[Strategos]] of Sicily from 700-710. The Strategos of Sicily was also able to exercise some control over the autonomous duchies of [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], depending on the local political situation or faction at the time.\n\nThe [[Aghlabid]] invasions were in part caused by the Byzantine-Sicilian military commander [[Euphemius (Sicily)|Euphemius]], who invited the Aghlabids to aid him in his rebellion against the imperial governor of Sicily in 826 AD. A similar situation happened a century prior, when the imperial governor of Sicily (Sergios), had declared a Byzantine official from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] by the name of [[Basil Onomagoulos]] ([[regnal name]] [[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]) as rival emperor, when false news reached Sicily that Constantinople had fallen to the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. When [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo the Syrian]] sent an [[Chartoularios|administrative official]] named [[Paul (exarch)|Paul]] to Sicily, the people and army of Syracuse surrendered Basil and his rebels up to him, leading to the beheading of Basil, while the former governor Sergios was able to escape to [[Kingdom of the Lombards|the parts of Mainland Italy controlled by the Lombards]]. Another rebellion took place between the years 781-793, when the aristocratic governor of Sicily, [[Elpidius (rebel)|Elpidius]], was accused of conspiring against [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]] in favour of [[Nikephoros (Caesar)|Nikephoros]]. After Elpidius's forces were militarily defeated by Empress Irene's large fleet dispatched in Sicily, he, along with his lieutenant, the [[dux]] of [[Calabria]] named Nikephoros, defected to the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], where he was humorously acknowledged as rival emperor. After losing another military expedition, this time against [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] with the help of the Abbasids, he advised the [[Banu Abbas|Abbasid]] [[Emir]] of [[Upper Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Abd al-Malik ibn Salih]], to \"throw away his silk and put on his armour\", warning him against the aggressive new reign of [[Nikephoros I]]. [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|The Muslim conquest]] was a see-saw affair; the local population resisted fiercely and the [[Aghlabids|Arabs]] suffered considerable dissension and infighting among themselves during this process. Not until 965 was the island's conquest successfully completed by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], with Syracuse in particular resisting almost to the end ([[Siege of Syracuse (877-878)]]). Before 965, there still remained some fortified towns under Roman-Byzantine protection. During the [[Emirate of Sicily]]'s reign, substantial settlements were established in various regions of Sicily by [[Arab-Berbers]]. Their capital was based at [[Palermo|Bal'harm]]. \n\nThe first phase of [[Muslim]] rule began with the conquests of the third Aghlabid [[Emir]] [[Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya]], and consolidated with the reign of the ninth Emir [[Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya]] after the conquest of [[Taormina]]. The first attempt to [[Siege of Syracuse (827-828)|capture Syracuse]] was under general [[Asad ibn al-Furat]], although it ended in a Byzantine victory. A strong combination of [[Ifriqiya|Ifriqiyan]] and [[Andalusia|Andalusian]] troops helped to capture the Island between 830-831. After a revolt was suppressed, the Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Mansur Billah]] appointed a member of the [[Kalbids|Kalbid]] dynasty, [[Al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi]], as First Emir of Sicily. The Kalbids ruled Sicily from 948 to 1053. [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis]], fourth ruler of the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] [[Sanhaja]] dynasty in North Africa, attempted to annex the island for the Zirids, but his attempts failed. The new Arab-Berber rulers initiated revolutionary [[Arab Agricultural Revolution|land reforms]], which in turn increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings, a dent to the dominance of the landed estates. The Arabs further improved irrigation systems through [[Qanats]], introducing oranges, lemons, pistachio and sugarcane to Sicily. [[Ibn Hawqal]], a [[Baghdad|Baghdadi]] [[merchant]] who visited Sicily in 950, commented that a walled suburb called the Kasr (the palace) was the center of Palermo, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman Catholic cathedral. The suburb of Al-Khalisa (Kalsa) contained the Sultan's palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. Ibn Hawqual reckoned there were 7,000 individual butchers trading in 150 shops. By 1050, Palermo had a population of 350,000, making it one of the largest cities in Europe, behind Islamic-Spain's capital C\u00f3rdoba and the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, which had populations over 450-500,000. Palermo's population dropped to 150,000 under Norman rule. By 1330 Palermo's population had declined to 51,000, possibly due to the inhabitants of the region being deported to other regions of [[County of Sicily|Norman Sicily]] or to the Norman [[County of Apulia and Calabria]]. The Arab traveler [[Ibn Jubayr]] from [[Al-Andalus]] stated that the buildings built during this period were made of [[limestone]]. The latinized Catholic Sicilians in Western Sicily still continued to revolt until Norman rule, and the [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]-speaking Byzantine [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]-[[Catholicism|Catholic]] Sicilians in the East almost secured their independence several times during their revolts. Christians and Jews were tolerated in Muslim Sicily as [[dhimmi|dhimmis]], and had to pay the [[Jizya]] poll tax, and [[Kharaj]] land tax, but were exempt from the [[Zakat]] alms-giving tax Muslims had to pay. Many Jews immigrated to Sicily during Muslim rule, but left after the Normans arrived. \n\n[[File:Sicilian types and costumes.jpg|thumb|200px|Sicilians in traditional dress]] \nIn the 11th century, the mainland southern Italian powers were hiring [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman mercenaries]], who were Christian descendants of the [[Vikings]]; it was the [[Normans]] under [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] (of the [[Hauteville dynasty]]) who conquered Sicily from the Muslims [[Battle of Cerami|over a period of thirty years]] until finally controlling the entire island by 1091 as the [[County of Sicily]]. In 1130, [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]] founded the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] as an independent state with its own [[Sicilian Parliament|Parliament]], language, [[schooling]], army and currency, while the Sicilian culture evolved distinct traditions, clothing, linguistic changes, [[Sicilian cuisine|cuisine]] and customs not found in mainland [[Italy]].<ref>James Minahan, ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World A-Z'', 2002 p.1714.</ref> A great number of mainland [[County of Apulia and Calabria|Southern Italian]] and [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] families began settling in Sicily during this time.\n\nThe Siculo-Norman rule of the [[Hauteville dynasty]] continued until 1198, when [[Frederick I of Sicily]], the son of a [[Siculo-Norman]] queen and a [[Hohenstaufen dynasty|Swabian-German]] emperor ascended the throne. In fact it was during the reign of this Hohenstaufen ([[Swabians|Swabian-German]]) king [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], that the poetic form known as a [[sonnet]] was invented by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], the head Poet, Teacher and [[Notary]] of the [[Sicilian School|Sicilian School for Poetry]]. His (Frederick I) descendants governed Sicily until the [[Papal States|Papacy]] invited a [[Capetian dynasty|French]] prince to take the throne, which led to a decade-and-a-half of French rule under [[Charles I of Sicily]]; he was later deposed in the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] against French rule, which put the daughter of [[Manfred of Sicily]] - [[Constance of Sicily, Queen of Aragon|Constance II]] and her husband [[Peter III of Aragon]], a member of the [[House of Barcelona]], on the throne. Their [[House of Barcelona|descendants]] ruled the Kingdom of Sicily until 1401. Following the [[Compromise of Caspe]] in 1412 the Sicilian throne passed to the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] monarchs from [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castille]].\n\n===Modern and Contemporary history===\nAfter the [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans]], [[History of the Caucasus|Caucasus]], [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]] and [[Ottoman wars in Africa|North Africa]], waves of [[Greeks|Greek]] (including [[Arvanites]] and [[Pontic Greeks]]), [[Peoples of the Caucasus|North and South Caucasian]], [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]], [[Kabyle people|Kayble]] and [[Tunisian people|Tunisian]] [[Berbers|Berber]], [[Syrians|Syrian]], [[Bosnians|Bosnian]], Romanian [[Vlachs|Vlach]], Lebanese [[Maronites|Maronite]] and [[Lebanese Druze|Druze]], [[Serbs|Serbian]], [[Tarabin Bedouin|Tarabin Bedouins]] from the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and Albanian [[Tosks|Tosk]] [[Immigration|migrants]], and [[migrant workers]] fled to [[Sicily]] in sizable numbers between the 15th and 19th centuries to escape persecution and [[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Taxation]]. In 1735, the Spanish era ended when [[Charles V of Sicily|Charles V]] from the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|House of Bourbon]] was crowned king. For the better part of the next century-and-a-half, Sicily was in [[personal union]] with the other Southern Italian [[Kingdom of Naples]], with the official residence located in [[Naples]], under the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Bourbon dynasty]]. In 1861, however, Sicily became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] as a result of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. After the unification of Italy and the [[Fascism|Fascist era]], a wave of [[Sicilian nationalism]] led to the adoption of the [[Statute of Sicily]], under which the island has become an [[autonomous region]]. Since 1946, the island enjoys the most advanced special status of all the [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]]s, which allows the Sicilian residents to keep 100% of the revenue from all the taxes, without giving back any to the central government in [[Rome]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type=\n|align=right\n|widths=50px \n|heights=50px\n|footnote=Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2017\n|1861|2409000\n|1871|2590000\n|1881|2933000\n|1901|3568000\n|1911|3812000\n|1921|4223000\n|1931|3906000\n|1936|4000000\n|1951|4487000\n|1961|4721000\n|1971|4681000\n|1981|4907000\n|1991|4966000\n|2001|4969000\n|2011|5002904\n|2017|5029615\n}}\n\n[[File:Palermo panorama.JPG|thumb|The city of [[Palermo]] in 2005]]\nSicily has experienced the presence of a number of different cultures and ethnicities in its vast history, including the original [[Italic peoples]] ([[Sicani]], [[Siculi]] and [[Elymians]], although the language families which each of these three peoples spoke has still not been deciphered by academia or linguistic historians/scholars), [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenicians]] ([[Phoenicia]]) and [[Punics|Carthaginians]] ([[Ancient Carthage]]), [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]] ([[Magna Graecia]]), [[Bruttians]], [[Lucanians]], [[Mamertines]], [[Iberians]], [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], [[Colchis|Colchians]] (Proto-[[Georgians]]), [[Anatolian peoples|Anatolians]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Assyria|Assyrians]], [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[Nabataeans]], [[Numidians]], [[Tribe of Judah|Judeans]] & [[Tribe of Dan|Danites]], [[Eurasian nomads]] ([[Scythia]]), [[Illyrians]], [[Ligures]], [[Gauls]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the [[ancient history|ancient]] and [[classical antiquity|classical periods]]. \n\nFrom the medieval and modern eras, Sicily experienced [[Human migration|migratory]] waves of [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] (During [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal-Alan]] rule), while under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Emirate of Sicily|Saracen]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] rules, there were considerable numbers of [[Arabs]], [[Berbers]], [[Hebrews]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Tarabin Bedouin|Tarabin Bedouins]], [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]], [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Nubians]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Tatars]], [[Vikings]], [[Mongols]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Normans]], [[Swabians]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austrians and Hungarians]], [[Lombards]] and [[Italians]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]], [[Spaniards]], [[Sardinians]], [[Basques]], [[Romanians]], [[French people|French]], [[British people|British]] and [[Albanians|Albanian]] people settling in Sicily for various reasons, such as to escape [[persecution]], to establish merchant communities or to find better land for cultivation.\n\nAbout five million people live in Sicily, making it the [[List of regions of Italy#List of regions|fourth most populated region in Italy]].

Despite being genetically similar to the aforementioned regions, Sicilians still constitute a distinct and separate ethnic group, with the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] and [[Calabria|Calabrese]] being the two populations most closely related, genetically and culturally speaking, to Sicilians. <ref name=\"Peristera\">{{cite journal|title=Maritime route of colonization of Europe|first=Peristera|last=Paschou |doi=10.1073/pnas.1320811111|pmid=24927591|volume=111|issue=25|pages=9211\u20139216|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=4078858|year=2014|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.9211P}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Genetic history of the population of Crete|first1=Petros|last1=Drineas|first2=Fotis|last2=Tsetsos|first3=Anna|last3=Plantinga|first4=Iosif|last4=Lazaridis|first5=Evangelia|last5=Yannaki|first6=Anna|last6=Razou|first7=Katerina|last7=Kanaki|first8=Manolis|last8=Michalodimitrakis|first9=Francisco|last9=Perez\u2010Jimenez|first10=Giustina De|last10=Silvestro|first11=Maria C.|last11=Renda|first12=John A.|last12=Stamatoyannopoulos|first13=Kenneth K.|last13=Kidd|first14=Brian L.|last14=Browning|first15=Peristera|last15=Paschou|first16=George|last16=Stamatoyannopoulos|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|volume=0|issue=6|pages=373\u2013388|doi=10.1111/ahg.12328|pmid = 31192450|pmc=6851683|year = 2019}} </ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stamatoyannopoulos |first1=George |title=Genetics of the peloponnesean populations and the theory of extinction of the medieval peloponnesean Greeks |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |date=8 March 2017 |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=637\u2013645 |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2017.18|pmid=28272534 |pmc=5437898 }}</ref> https://cyprus-mail.com/2017/06/21/study-finds-greek-turkish-cypriots-close-genetically/\n\n====MtDna and Y DNA studies====\nAccording to one study, [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-Dna haplogroups]] were found at the following frequencies in Sicily:\n[[Haplogroup R1 (Y-DNA)|R1]] (36.76%), [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] (29.65%), [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] (18.21%), [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|I]] (7.62%), [[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|G]] (5.93%), [[Haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|T]] (5.51%), [[Haplogroup Q-M242 (Y-DNA)|Q]] (2.54%).<ref name=\"nature.com\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2008.120|pmid = 18685561|pmc = 2985948|title = Differential Greek and northern African migrations to Sicily are supported by genetic evidence from the Y chromosome|journal = European Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 91\u201399|year = 2009|last1 = Di Gaetano|first1 = Cornelia|last2 = Cerutti|first2 = Nicoletta|last3 = Crobu|first3 = Francesca|last4 = Robino|first4 = Carlo|last5 = Inturri|first5 = Serena|last6 = Gino|first6 = Sarah|last7 = Guarrera|first7 = Simonetta|last8 = Underhill|first8 = Peter A.|last9 = King|first9 = Roy J.|last10 = Romano|first10 = Valentino|last11 = Cali|first11 = Francesco|last12 = Gasparini|first12 = Mauro|last13 = Matullo|first13 = Giuseppe|last14 = Salerno|first14 = Alfredo|last15 = Torre|first15 = Carlo|last16 = Piazza|first16 = Alberto}}</ref> R1 and I haplogroups are typical in [[Western Europe|West European]] populations while J, T and E1b1b consist of lineages with differential distribution across [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Europe]], although haplogroup T is most prominent in populations from the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]] in [[East India]]. Haplogroup G reaches its highest percentage among [[Georgians]], its presence in Sicily is probably a result of [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasian]] immigration into Sicily after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]], while the presence of haplogroup Q at almost 3 percent is most likely the result of previous [[Tatar]], and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] migration into Sicily during the medieval and early modern periods, as this haplogroup is mostly found in the [[Americas]] and [[Siberia]].

However the use of [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] is limited to informal contexts (mostly in family).\n\nSicilian was an early influence in the development of standard Italian, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and his court of notaries or ''Magna Curia'' which, headed by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], also gave birth to the [[Sicilian School]], widely inspired by troubadour literature. It is in this language that appeared the first [[sonnet]], whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself. Sicilian was also the official language of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1300 to 1543. Prior to the 20th century, large numbers of Sicilian people spoke only Sicilian as their mother tongue, with little or no fluent knowledge of [[Italian language|Italian]]. Today, while Sicilian is an unrecognized language being used as part of many people's daily life, Italian is the only official language and predominates in the public arena.\n\nThe [[Siculo-Arabic]] dialect as a vernacular [[Varieties of Arabic|variety of]] [[Arabic]] once spoken in [[Sicily]] and neighbouring [[Malta]] between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century. The language became extinct in Sicily, but in Malta it eventually evolved into what is now the [[Maltese language]]. It influenced the dialect of [[Pantelleria]].\n\nThe [[Siculish]] dialect is the [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] \"Sicilianization\" of [[English language]] words and phrases by immigrants from [[Sicily]] to the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Forms of Siculish are also to be found in other Sicilian immigrant communities of [[Anglosphere|English-speaking countries]], namely Canada and Australia.  A surprising similarity can often be found between these forms, through either coincidence, trans-national movements of Sicilian immigrants, or more likely, through the logical adaptation of [[English language|English]] using linguistic norms from the Sicilian language.\n\n====Ethno-linguistic minorities====\nThere are two main historical [[Ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic]] minorities in Sicily, the [[Lombards of Sicily]] and the [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb]].\n* The [[Lombards of Sicily]] are a linguistic minority living in Sicily who speak an isolated variety of Gallo-Italic dialects, the so-called [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily]].

The Lombards of Sicily, who originally hailed from Northern Italy, settled the central and [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] part of Sicily about 900 years ago, during the [[Norman conquest of Sicily]]. Because of linguistic differences among the Gallo-Italic dialects of Sicily, it is supposed that there were different immigration routes. From [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia]], and [[Lombardy]] they began to spread south between the 11th and 14th centuries. The most important areas where the Gallo-Italic of Sicily is spoken are [[Acquedolci]], [[Montalbano Elicona]], [[Novara di Sicilia]], [[Fondachelli-Fantina]] [[San Fratello]] and [[San Piero Patti]] ([[Province of Messina]]), [[Aidone]], [[Nicosia, Sicily|Nicosia]], [[Piazza Armerina]] and [[Sperlinga]] ([[Province of Enna]]).\n[[File:Tabelle italiano-albanese.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Bilingual road signs, in Italian and Arb\u00ebresh in [[Piana degli Albanesi]].]]\n* The [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people]] settled in Southern Italy in the 15th to 18th centuries in several waves of migrations. They are the descendants of mostly [[Tosk Albanian]] refugees of Christian faith who fled to Italy after the Albanian conquest and subsequent Islamisation by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the [[Balkans]]. They speak their own variant of the [[Arb\u00ebresh]] language. There are three identified Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb communities in the [[province of Palermo]], which have maintained unchanged, with different aspects together, the ethnic, linguistic and religious origins. The areas are: [[Contessa Entellina]], [[Piana degli Albanesi]] and [[Santa Cristina Gela]]; while the varieties of Piana and Santa Cristina Gela are similar enough to be entirely mutually intelligible, the variety of Contessa Entellina is not entirely intelligible. The largest centre is [[Piana degli Albanesi]] which, besides being the hub of [[Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi|religious]] and socio-cultural communities, has guarded and defended their peculiarities intact over time. There are two other communities with a strong historical and linguistic heritage.\n\n* The community of the [[Griko people|Greeks of Messina]] (or Siculo-Greeks) speaks [[modern Greek]] with some elements of the [[Ancient Greek|ancient Greek language]] spoken in the island, and [[Calabrian Greek]]. The Greek community was reconstituted in 2003 with the name of ''\"Comunit\u00e0 Hellenica dello Stretto\"'' (Hellenic Community of the Strait).\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Icon - Main altar of Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015.JPG|180px|right|thumb|[[Hodegetria|Virgin Hodegetria]], [[Monreale Cathedral]].]]\nThe vast majority of Sicilians are [[baptism|baptized]] as [[Roman Catholic]]. The Catholic religion represents one of the most important elements of the Sicilian identity. The [[Hodegetria|Virgin Hodegetria]] is the patroness of Sicily. The Sicilian people are also known for their deep devotion to some Sicilian female saints: the martyrs [[Agatha of Sicily|Agatha]] and [[Saint Lucy|Lucy]], respectively patroness of Catania and Syracuse, and the hermitess [[Saint Rosalia|Rosalia]], patroness of Palermo. The Sicilian people have significantly contributed to the history of [[Christianity]]. There were four Sicilian [[Pope|Popes]] ([[Pope Agatho|Agatho]], [[Pope Leo II|Leo II]], [[Pope Sergius I|Sergius I]], [[Pope Stephen III|Stephen III]]) and a Sicilian [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] ([[Methodios I of Constantinople|Methodios I]]).\n\n===Art and architecture===\n{{Main article|Norman-Sicilian culture|Sicilian Baroque}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main article|Sicilian cuisine}}\n\n{{Main article|List of people from Sicily|List of Sicilian Americans}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery caption=\"Sicilian folk costumes and traditions\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Sicilian artigiana 6.jpg|Sicilian artigiana at a presepe vivente at Santa Maria La Stella, Sicily\nFile:Women in Albanian dress.jpg|Women in Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb dress\nFile:Sicilian costume 3 1880.jpg|Boy in Sicilian costume of the 1880s\nFile:Sicilian costume 1880s.jpg|Girl wearing a costume of the 1880s period in Sicily\nFile:Reprofotografi av bild fr\u00e5n resealbum, i samband med utst\u00e4llningen Samtida venetianskt konstglas - Hallwylska museet - 87765.tif|Sicilian family, 1880s.\nFile:Ramacca 033.jpg|Sicilian band in medieval costumes\nFile:Piana-degli-Albanesi-bjs2007-03.jpg|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb in Piana degli Albanesi\nFile:Handkolorerat fotografi p\u00e5 siciliansk vagn - Hallwylska museet - 104084.tif|\nFile:Artigiano siciliano.JPG|A Sicilian artisan in Sutera\nFile:Bruno, Giuseppe (1836-1904) - n. 020 (Timbrato sul retro).jpg|Two peasants wearing a Sicilian costume, 1880s\nFile:Gloeden, Wilhelm von (1856-1931) - n. 0024 - Pescatore catanese.jpg|Fisherman from Catania, 1890s.\nFile:Gloeden, Wilhelm von (1856-1931) - n. 0036 - da - Sicilia mitica Arcadia - p. 61.jpg|A girl holding an amphora, Limina, 1880/1890\nFile:Catacombe dei Cappuccini Palermo.jpg|Catacombe dei Cappuccini, Palermo\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|People of Sicily}}\n*[[List of people from Sicily]]\n*[[Sicilian Americans]]\n*[[Kingdom of Sicily]]\n*[[History of Sicily]]\n*[[Sicilian language]]\n*[[Magna Graecia]]\n*[[Crown of Aragon]]\n*[[Maltese people]]\n*[[Italians]]\n*[[Griko people]]\n*[[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Sicily}}\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Italy]]\n[[Category:People from Sicily| ]]\n[[Category:Romance peoples]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toGermanic(link changed toGermanic peoples) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilians"}

It was presumably composed by the balladeer [[Marx Augustin]] in 1679, though written documents only date back to about 1800.\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nIn 1679, Vienna was struck by the [[Great Plague of Vienna|Great Plague]] and Augustin was a [[ballad]] singer and [[bagpipes|bagpiper]], who toured the city's inns entertaining people. The Viennese loved Augustin because of his charming humour in bitter times, and they called him {{Lang|de|Lieber Augustin}} (Dear Augustin).\n\nAccording to legend,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} once he was drunk and on his way home he fell in the gutter and went to sleep. He was mistaken for a dead man by the gravediggers patrolling the city for dead bodies. They picked him up and threw him, along with his bagpipes which they presumed were infected, into a pit filled with bodies of plague victims outside the city walls. Next day when Augustin woke up, he was unable to get out of the deep mass grave. He was shocked and after a while he started to play his bagpipes, because he wanted to die the same way he lived. Finally people heard him and he was rescued from this dreadful place. Luckily he remained healthy despite having slept with the infected dead bodies and Augustin became a symbol of hope for Viennese people.\n\nThe story, already rendered by the preacher [[Abraham a Sancta Clara]] (1644\u20131709), lives on in the song, which is still popular in Austria. The tune is nearly identical to that of \"[[Did You Ever See a Lassie?]]\", although \"{{Lang|de|O du lieber Augustin|italic=no}}\" is longer and more melancholy than that song.\n\n==Text==\n{{Listen|type=music\n| filename    = O_du_lieber_Augustin.ogg\n| title       = O, du lieber Augustin\n| description = Harmonised version for brass instruments\n}}\n{|\n|<poem>O, du lieber Augustin, Augustin, Augustin,\nO, du lieber Augustin, alles ist hin.\n\nGeld ist weg, M\u00e4d'l ist weg,\nAlles hin, Augustin.\nO, du lieber Augustin,\nAlles ist hin.\n\nRock ist weg, Stock ist weg,\nAugustin liegt im Dreck,\nO, du lieber Augustin,\nAlles ist hin.\n\nUnd selbst das reiche Wien,\nHin ist's wie Augustin;\nWeint mit mir im gleichen Sinn,\nAlles ist hin!\n\nJeder Tag war ein Fest,\nUnd was jetzt?

It was presumably composed by the balladeer [[Marx Augustin]] in 1679, though written documents only date back to about 1800.\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nIn 1679, Vienna was struck by the [[Great Plague of Vienna|Great Plague]] and Augustin was a [[ballad]] singer and [[bagpipes|bagpiper]], who toured the city's inns entertaining people. The Viennese loved Augustin because of his charming humour in bitter times, and they called him {{Lang|de|Lieber Augustin}} (Dear Augustin).\n\nAccording to legend,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} once he was drunk and on his way home he fell in the gutter and went to sleep. He was mistaken for a dead man by the gravediggers patrolling the city for dead bodies. They picked him up and threw him, along with his bagpipes which they presumed were infected, into a pit filled with bodies of plague victims outside the city walls. Next day when Augustin woke up, he was unable to get out of the deep mass grave. He was shocked and after a while he started to play his bagpipes, because he wanted to die the same way he lived. Finally people heard him and he was rescued from this dreadful place. Luckily he remained healthy despite having slept with the infected dead bodies and Augustin became a symbol of hope for Viennese people.\n\nThe story, already rendered by the preacher [[Abraham a Sancta Clara]] (1644\u20131709), lives on in the song, which is still popular in Austria. The tune is nearly identical to that of \"[[Did You Ever See a Lassie?]]\", although \"{{Lang|de|O du lieber Augustin|italic=no}}\" is longer and more melancholy than that song.\n\n==Text==\n{{Listen|type=music\n| filename    = O_du_lieber_Augustin.ogg\n| title       = O, du lieber Augustin\n| description = Harmonised version for brass instruments\n}}\n{|\n|<poem>O, du lieber Augustin, Augustin, Augustin,\nO, du lieber Augustin, alles ist hin.\n\nGeld ist weg, M\u00e4d'l ist weg,\nAlles hin, Augustin.\nO, du lieber Augustin,\nAlles ist hin.\n\nRock ist weg, Stock ist weg,\nAugustin liegt im Dreck,\nO, du lieber Augustin,\nAlles ist hin.\n\nUnd selbst das reiche Wien,\nHin ist's wie Augustin;\nWeint mit mir im gleichen Sinn,\nAlles ist hin!\n\nJeder Tag war ein Fest,\nUnd was jetzt?

The road passed through Ashton-under-Lyne as well as [[Audenshaw]], [[Mottram-in-Longdendale]], and [[Stalybridge]]. A Turnpike Trust was responsible for collecting tolls from traffic; the proceeds were used for road maintenance. The Trust for Manchester to Salters Brook was one of over 400&nbsp;established between 1706 and 1750, a period in which turnpikes became popular.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;118\u2013120.</ref> It was the first [[Turnpike trusts in Greater Manchester|turnpike to be opened in Tameside]], and driven by economic growth, more turnpikes were opened in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Acts of Parliaments were passed in 1765, 1793, and 1799 permitting the construction of turnpikes from Ashton-under-Lyne to Doctor Lane Head in Saddleworth, Standedge in Saddleworth, and Oldham respectively. Towards the end of the 19th century, many Turnpike Trusts were wound up as they were superseded by local government; the last in Tameside to close was the Ashton-under-Lyne to Salters Brook road in 1884.<ref>Nevell (1993), p.&nbsp;121.</ref> Ashton is now served by the [[M60 motorway]], which cuts through the west end of Ashton (Junction 23).\n\n===Canals===\n[[File:Portland Basin.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A brick-built warehouse with a canal in the foreground.

The 1790s has been characterised as a period of mania for canal building in England. The first of the three to be built was the [[Ashton Canal]], which was constructed between 1792 and 1797. Connecting Manchester to Ashton-under-Lyne, with a branch to Oldham, it cost about \u00a3170,000 (\u00a3{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|170000|1796|r=-6}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;121\u2013122.</ref> The [[Peak Forest Canal]] was constructed from 1794 to 1805, and was originally planned as a branch of the Ashton Canal.

The new railways were quicker and more economical than the canals, and the waterways declined. The Huddersfield Canal was bought by the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway in 1844. Along with the Ashton and Peak Forest canals, the Huddersfield Canal was later bought by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;123\u2013124.</ref> The canals remained in use throughout the 19th century on a smaller scale than in their heyday, but by the mid-20th century all commercial traffic had ceased. Following an extended period of closure and dereliction, during which parts of the Huddersfield Canal were filled in or built over, a complete restoration was undertaken and the entire canal reopened in 2001. The three canals are now used for leisure craft and are still maintained and in good condition.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;124\u2013125.</ref>\n[[File:Ashton_station.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The entrance to a train station with a sign saying \"Ashton\" above the entrance|[[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station]]]]\n\n===Railways===\n[[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station|The present station]] at Ashton was opened by the [[Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway]] (AS&LJR) on 13 April 1846.<ref name=Butt>{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=978-1-85260-508-7 |id=R508 |page=20 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=John |authorlink=John Marshall (railway historian) |title=The Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, volume 1 |year=1969 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=978-0-7153-4352-4 |pages=61, 63 |ref=harv }}</ref> Known originally as ''Ashton'', it was renamed ''Ashton (Charlestown)'' in 1874.<ref name=Butt /> and then ''Ashton-under-Lyne'' on 6 May 1968.<ref name=Butt /> It has regular services on the [[Huddersfield Line]] between Manchester ([[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria]]) and [[Huddersfield]]. \n\nThe town historically had three stations, only one of which remains: Ashton (Charlestown), [[Ashton Park Parade railway station|Park Parade]] (closed 1956) and [[Oldham Road railway station (Ashton-under-Lyne)|Oldham Road]] (closed 1959).

The road passed through Ashton-under-Lyne as well as [[Audenshaw]], [[Mottram-in-Longdendale]], and [[Stalybridge]]. A Turnpike Trust was responsible for collecting tolls from traffic; the proceeds were used for road maintenance. The Trust for Manchester to Salters Brook was one of over 400&nbsp;established between 1706 and 1750, a period in which turnpikes became popular.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;118\u2013120.</ref> It was the first [[Turnpike trusts in Greater Manchester|turnpike to be opened in Tameside]], and driven by economic growth, more turnpikes were opened in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Acts of Parliaments were passed in 1765, 1793, and 1799 permitting the construction of turnpikes from Ashton-under-Lyne to Doctor Lane Head in Saddleworth, Standedge in Saddleworth, and Oldham respectively. Towards the end of the 19th century, many Turnpike Trusts were wound up as they were superseded by local government; the last in Tameside to close was the Ashton-under-Lyne to Salters Brook road in 1884.<ref>Nevell (1993), p.&nbsp;121.</ref> Ashton is now served by the [[M60 motorway]], which cuts through the west end of Ashton (Junction 23).\n\n===Canals===\n[[File:Portland Basin.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A brick-built warehouse with a canal in the foreground. There are barges on the canal and people sitting outside the warehouse.|The [[Portland Basin]] warehouse is now a museum.]]\nThe town of Ashton-under-Lyne became the focus of three canals which were constructed in Tameside in the 1790s because it was an important centre of coal mining in the Lancashire coalfield. The 1790s has been characterised as a period of mania for canal building in England. The first of the three to be built was the [[Ashton Canal]], which was constructed between 1792 and 1797. Connecting Manchester to Ashton-under-Lyne, with a branch to Oldham, it cost about \u00a3170,000 (\u00a3{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|170000|1796|r=-6}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;121\u2013122.</ref> The [[Peak Forest Canal]] was constructed from 1794 to 1805, and was originally planned as a branch of the Ashton Canal. It connected the [[Portland Basin]] with the [[Peak District]] and cost \u00a3177,000 (\u00a3{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|177000|1805|r=-6}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref name=\"Nevell 1993 122\">Nevell (1993), p.&nbsp;122.</ref> The [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] was built between 1794 and 1811, to enable cross-Pennine trade between Manchester and [[Kingston upon Hull]]; the cost of construction was \u00a3400,000.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref name=\"Nevell 1993 122\"/>\n\nThe advent of the railways in the 19th century signalled the decline of the canal system. The new railways were quicker and more economical than the canals, and the waterways declined. The Huddersfield Canal was bought by the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway in 1844. Along with the Ashton and Peak Forest canals, the Huddersfield Canal was later bought by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;123\u2013124.</ref> The canals remained in use throughout the 19th century on a smaller scale than in their heyday, but by the mid-20th century all commercial traffic had ceased. Following an extended period of closure and dereliction, during which parts of the Huddersfield Canal were filled in or built over, a complete restoration was undertaken and the entire canal reopened in 2001. The three canals are now used for leisure craft and are still maintained and in good condition.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;124\u2013125.</ref>\n[[File:Ashton_station.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The entrance to a train station with a sign saying \"Ashton\" above the entrance|[[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station]]]]\n\n===Railways===\n[[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station|The present station]] at Ashton was opened by the [[Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway]] (AS&LJR) on 13 April 1846.<ref name=Butt>{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=978-1-85260-508-7 |id=R508 |page=20 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=John |authorlink=John Marshall (railway historian) |title=The Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, volume 1 |year=1969 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=978-0-7153-4352-4 |pages=61, 63 |ref=harv }}</ref> Known originally as ''Ashton'', it was renamed ''Ashton (Charlestown)'' in 1874.<ref name=Butt /> and then ''Ashton-under-Lyne'' on 6 May 1968.<ref name=Butt /> It has regular services on the [[Huddersfield Line]] between Manchester ([[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria]]) and [[Huddersfield]]. \n\nThe town historically had three stations, only one of which remains: Ashton (Charlestown), [[Ashton Park Parade railway station|Park Parade]] (closed 1956) and [[Oldham Road railway station (Ashton-under-Lyne)|Oldham Road]] (closed 1959). Park Parade station was on the [[Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway]], which was founded in 1836 with the purpose of building a line linking Manchester and Sheffield. The line was opened in stages and by 1845 was complete. It included a branch to the nearby town of Stalybridge, the former Ashton Park Parade station was included on this branch.<ref name=\"Nevell 1993 127\"/>.

The first tramway of its kind in Tameside, it was later extended to Manchester. The Oldham, Ashton and Hyde Electric Tramway Company, founded in 1899, operated {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} of tram lines with electric tramcars. It was the first line around Manchester to use electricity.

Reed]] and [[Gustave Solomon]] in 1960.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}}</ref>\nThey have many applications, the most prominent of which include consumer technologies such as [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray]] discs, [[QR code]]s, [[data transmission]] technologies such as [[DSL]] and [[WiMAX]], [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] systems such as satellite communications, [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], and storage systems such as [[RAID 6]].\n\nReed\u2013Solomon codes operate on a block of data treated as a set of [[finite field]] elements called symbols. Reed\u2013Solomon codes are able to detect and correct multiple symbol errors. By adding {{mvar|t}} check symbols to the data, a Reed\u2013Solomon code can detect (but not correct) any combination of up to and including {{mvar|t}} erroneous symbols, '''OR''' locate and correct up to and including {{math|\u230a''t''/2\u230b}} erroneous symbols at unknown locations. As an [[erasure code]], it can correct up to and including {{mvar|t}} erasures at locations that are known and provided to the algorithm, or it can detect and correct combinations of errors and erasures. Reed\u2013Solomon codes are also suitable as multiple-[[burst error|burst]] bit-error correcting codes, since a sequence of {{math|''b''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}} consecutive bit errors can affect at most two symbols of size {{mvar|b}}. The choice of {{mvar|t}} is up to the designer of the code, and may be selected within wide limits.\n\nThere are two basic types of Reed\u2013Solomon codes, original view and [[BCH code|BCH]] view, with BCH view being the most common as BCH view decoders are faster and require less working storage than original view decoders.\n\n==History==\nReed\u2013Solomon codes were developed in 1960 by [[Irving S. Reed]] and [[Gustave Solomon]], who were then staff members of [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]]. Their seminal article was titled \"Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields\". {{Harvard citation|Reed|Solomon|1960}}. The original encoding scheme described in the Reed & Solomon article used a variable polynomial based on the message to be encoded where only a fixed set of values (evaluation points) to be encoded are known to encoder and decoder. The original theoretical decoder generated potential polynomials based on subsets of ''k'' (unencoded message length) out of ''n'' (encoded message length) values of a received message, choosing the most popular polynomial as the correct one, which was impractical for all but the simplest of cases. This was initially resolved by changing the original scheme to a [[BCH code]] like scheme based on a fixed polynomial known to both encoder and decoder, but later, practical decoders based on the original scheme were developed, although slower than the BCH schemes. The result of this is that there are two main types of Reed Solomon codes, ones that use the original encoding scheme, and ones that use the BCH encoding scheme.\n\nAlso in 1960, a practical fixed polynomial decoder for [[BCH codes]] developed by [[Daniel Gorenstein]] and Neal Zierler was described in an MIT Lincoln Laboratory report by Zierler in January 1960 and later in a paper in June 1961.<ref>D. Gorenstein and N. Zierler, \"A class of cyclic linear error-correcting codes in p^m symbols\", J. SIAM, vol. 9, pp. 207-214, June 1961</ref>   The Gorenstein\u2013Zierler decoder and the related work on BCH codes are described in a book Error Correcting Codes by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] (1961).<ref>Error Correcting Codes by W_Wesley_Peterson, 1961</ref> By 1963 (or possibly earlier), J. J. Stone (and others) recognized that Reed Solomon codes could use the BCH scheme of using a fixed generator polynomial, making such codes a special class of BCH codes,<ref>Error Correcting Codes by W_Wesley_Peterson, second edition, 1972</ref> but Reed Solomon codes based on the original encoding scheme, are not a class of BCH codes, and depending on the set of evaluation points, they are not even [[cyclic code]]s.\n\nIn 1969, an improved BCH scheme decoder was developed by [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[James Massey]], and has since been known as the [[Berlekamp\u2013Massey algorithm|Berlekamp\u2013Massey decoding algorithm]].\n\nIn 1975, another improved BCH scheme decoder was developed by Yasuo Sugiyama, based on the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].<ref>Yasuo Sugiyama, Masao Kasahara, Shigeichi Hirasawa, and Toshihiko Namekawa. A method for solving key equation for decoding Goppa codes. Information and Control, 27:87\u201399, 1975.</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Reed\u2013Solomon codes were implemented in the [[Voyager program]] in the form of [[concatenated error correction code]]s. The first commercial application in mass-produced consumer products appeared in 1982 with the [[compact disc]], where two [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaved]] Reed\u2013Solomon codes are used. Today, Reed\u2013Solomon codes are widely implemented in [[Data storage device|digital storage]] devices and [[Data transmission|digital communication]] standards, though they are being slowly replaced by more modern [[Low-density parity-check code|low-density parity-check (LDPC) code]]s or [[turbo code]]s.  For example, Reed\u2013Solomon codes are used in the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) standard [[DVB-S]], but LDPC codes are used in its successor, [[DVB-S2]].\n\nIn 1986, an original scheme decoder known as the [[Berlekamp\u2013Welch algorithm]] was developed.\n\nIn 1996, variations of original scheme decoders called list decoders or soft decoders were developed by Madhu Sudan and others, and work continues on these types of decoders \u2013 see ''[[Guruswami\u2013Sudan list decoding algorithm]]''.\n\nIn 2002, another original scheme decoder was developed by Shuhong Gao, based on the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] [http://www.math.clemson.edu/~sgao/papers/RS.pdf Gao_RS.pdf] .\n\n== Applications ==\n\n===Data storage===\nReed\u2013Solomon coding is very widely used in mass storage systems to correct\nthe burst errors associated with media defects.\n\nReed\u2013Solomon coding is a key component of the [[compact disc]]. It was the first use of strong error correction coding in a mass-produced consumer product, and [[digital audio tape|DAT]] and [[DVD]] use similar schemes. In the CD, two layers of Reed\u2013Solomon coding separated by a 28-way [[convolution]]al [[interleaver]] yields a scheme called Cross-Interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon Coding ([[Cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding|CIRC]]). The first element of a CIRC decoder is a relatively weak inner (32,28) Reed\u2013Solomon code, shortened from a (255,251) code with 8-bit symbols. This code can correct up to 2 byte errors per 32-byte block. More importantly, it flags as erasures any uncorrectable blocks, i.e., blocks with more than 2 byte errors. The decoded 28-byte blocks, with erasure indications, are then spread by the deinterleaver to different blocks of the (28,24) outer code. Thanks to the deinterleaving, an erased 28-byte block from the inner code becomes a single erased byte in each of 28 outer code blocks. The outer code easily corrects this, since it can handle up to 4 such erasures per block.\n\nThe result is a CIRC that can completely correct error bursts up to 4000 bits, or about 2.5&nbsp;mm on the disc surface. This code is so strong that most CD playback errors are almost certainly caused by tracking errors that cause the laser to jump track, not by uncorrectable error bursts.<ref>{{Citation |first=K. A.

The Distributed online storage service [[Wuala]] (discontinued in 2015) also used to make use of Reed\u2013Solomon when breaking up files.\n\n===Bar code===\nAlmost all two-dimensional bar codes such as [[PDF-417]], [[MaxiCode]], [[Datamatrix]], [[QR Code]], and [[Aztec Code]] use Reed\u2013Solomon error correction to allow correct reading even if a portion of the bar code is damaged.  When the bar code scanner cannot recognize a bar code symbol, it will treat it as an erasure.\n\nReed\u2013Solomon coding is less common in one-dimensional bar codes, but is used by the [[PostBar]] symbology.\n\n===Data transmission===\nSpecialized forms of Reed\u2013Solomon codes, specifically [[Cauchy matrix|Cauchy]]-RS and [[Vandermonde matrix|Vandermonde]]-RS, can be used to overcome the unreliable nature of data transmission over [[Binary erasure channel|erasure channels]]. The encoding process assumes a code of RS(''N'',&nbsp;''K'') which results in ''N'' codewords of length ''N'' symbols each storing ''K'' symbols of data, being generated, that are then sent over an erasure channel.\n\nAny combination of ''K'' codewords received at the other end is enough to reconstruct all of the ''N'' codewords. The code rate is generally set to 1/2 unless the channel's erasure likelihood can be adequately modelled and is seen to be less. In conclusion, ''N'' is usually 2''K'', meaning that at least half of all the codewords sent must be received in order to reconstruct all of the codewords sent.\n\nReed\u2013Solomon codes are also used in [[xDSL]] systems and [[CCSDS]]'s [[Space Communications Protocol Specifications]] as a form of [[forward error correction]].\n\n===Space transmission===\n\n[[File:DeepSpaceFEC.png|350px|right|thumb| Deep-space concatenated coding system.<ref>J. Hagenauer, E. Offer, and L. Papke, Reed Solomon Codes and Their Applications. New York IEEE Press, 1994 - p. 433</ref>]]\n\nOne significant application of Reed\u2013Solomon coding was to encode the digital pictures sent back by the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space probe.\n\nVoyager introduced Reed\u2013Solomon coding [[concatenated code|concatenated]] with [[convolutional code]]s, a practice that has since become very widespread in deep space and satellite (e.g., direct digital broadcasting) communications.\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:NASA ECC Codes-imperfection.png|thumb|600px|none|NASA's Deep Space Missions ECC Codes (code imperfectness) {{Deletable image-caption|date=March 2012}}]] -->\n\n[[Viterbi decoder]]s tend to produce errors in short bursts. Correcting these burst errors is a job best done by short or simplified Reed\u2013Solomon codes.\n\nModern versions of concatenated Reed\u2013Solomon/Viterbi-decoded convolutional coding were and are used on the [[Mars Pathfinder]], [[Galileo probe|Galileo]], [[Mars Exploration Rover]] and [[Cassini probe|Cassini]] missions, where they perform within about 1\u20131.5 [[decibel|dB]] of the ultimate limit, being the [[Shannon capacity]].\n\nThese concatenated codes are now being replaced by more powerful [[turbo code]]s.\n\n== Constructions ==\n\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon code is actually a family of codes, where every code is characterised by three parameters: an [[Block code#The alphabet .CE.A3|alphabet]] size ''q'', a [[Block code#The block length n|block length]] ''n'', and a [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] ''k,'' with ''k < n \u2264 q.'' The set of alphabet symbols is interpreted as the [[finite field]] of order ''q'', and thus, ''q'' has to be a [[prime power]]. In the most useful parameterizations of the Reed\u2013Solomon code, the block length is usually some constant multiple of the message length, that is, the [[Block code#The rate R|rate]] {{nowrap|1=''R'' = ''k''/''n''}} is some constant, and furthermore, the block length is equal to or one less than the alphabet size, that is, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''q''}} or {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''q'' \u2212 1}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Reed & Solomon's original view: The codeword as a sequence of values ===\n\nThere are different encoding procedures for the Reed\u2013Solomon code, and thus, there are different ways to describe the set of all codewords.\nIn the original view of {{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}}, every codeword of the Reed\u2013Solomon code is a sequence of function values of a polynomial of degree less than ''k''. In order to obtain a codeword of the Reed\u2013Solomon code, the message is interpreted as the description of a polynomial ''p'' of degree less than ''k'' over the finite field ''F'' with ''q'' elements.\nIn turn, the polynomial ''p'' is evaluated at ''n'' \u2264 ''q'' distinct points <math>a_1,\\dots,a_n</math> of the field ''F'', and the sequence of values is the corresponding codeword. Common choices for a set of evaluation points include {0, 1, 2, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}, {0, 1, ''\u03b1'', ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''\u03b1''<sup>''n''\u22122</sup>}, or for ''n'' < ''q'', {1, ''\u03b1'', ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''\u03b1''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}, ... , where ''\u03b1'' is a [[primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]] of ''F''.\n\nFormally, the set <math>\\mathbf{C}</math> of codewords of the Reed\u2013Solomon code is defined as follows:\n: <math>\n\\mathbf{C}\n = \\Big\\{\\;\n     \\big( p(a_1), p(a_2), \\dots, p(a_n) \\big)\n     \\;\\Big|\\;\n     p \\text{ is a polynomial over } F \\text{ of degree } <k\n   \\;\\Big\\}\\,.\n</math>\nSince any two ''distinct'' polynomials of degree less than <math>k</math> agree in at most <math>k-1</math> points, this means that any two codewords of the Reed\u2013Solomon code disagree in at least <math>n - (k-1) = n-k+1</math> positions.\nFurthermore, there are two polynomials that do agree in <math>k-1</math> points but are not equal, and thus, the [[Block code#The distance d|distance]] of the Reed\u2013Solomon code is exactly <math>d=n-k+1</math>.\nThen the relative distance is <math>\\delta = d/n = 1-k/n + 1/n = 1-R+1/n\\sim 1-R</math>, where <math>R=k/n</math> is the rate.\nThis trade-off between the relative distance and the rate is asymptotically optimal since, by the [[Singleton bound]], ''every'' code satisfies <math>\\delta+R\\leq 1+1/n</math>.\nBeing a code that achieves this optimal trade-off, the Reed\u2013Solomon code belongs to the class of [[maximum distance separable code]]s.\n\nWhile the number of different polynomials of degree less than ''k'' and the number of different messages are both equal to <math>q^k</math>, and thus every message can be uniquely mapped to such a polynomial, there are different ways of doing this encoding.\nThe original construction of {{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}} interprets the message ''x'' as the ''coefficients'' of the polynomial ''p'', whereas subsequent constructions interpret the message as the ''values'' of the polynomial at the first ''k'' points <math>a_1,\\dots,a_k</math> and obtain the polynomial ''p'' by interpolating these values with a polynomial of degree less than ''k''.\nThe latter encoding procedure, while being slightly less efficient, has the advantage that it gives rise to a [[systematic code]], that is, the original message is always contained as a subsequence of the codeword.\n\n==== Simple encoding procedure: The message as a sequence of coefficients ====\nIn the original construction of {{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}}, the message <math>x=(x_1,\\dots,x_k)\\in F^k</math> is mapped to the polynomial <math>p_x</math> with\n:<math>p_x(a) = \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i a^{i-1} \\,.</math>\nThe codeword of <math>x</math> is obtained by evaluating <math>p_x</math> at <math>n</math> different points <math>a_1,\\dots,a_n</math> of the field <math>F</math>.\nThus the classical encoding function <math>C:F^k \\to F^n</math> for the Reed\u2013Solomon code is defined as follows: \n:<math>C(x) = \\big(p_x(a_1),\\dots,p_x(a_n)\\big)\\,.</math>\nThis function <math>C</math> is a [[linear mapping]], that is, it satisfies <math>C(x) = x \\cdot A</math> for the following <math>(k\\times n)</math>-matrix <math>A</math> with elements from <math>F</math>:\n:<math>A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1         & \\dots  & 1         & \\dots  & 1     \\\\\na_1       & \\dots  & a_k       & \\dots  & a_n   \\\\\na_1^2     & \\dots  & a_k^2     & \\dots  & a_n^2 \\\\\n\\vdots    &        & \\vdots    &        & \\vdots \\\\\na_1^{k-1} & \\dots  & a_k^{k-1} & \\dots  & a_n^{k-1}\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nThis matrix is the transpose of a [[Vandermonde matrix]] over <math>F</math>. In other words, the Reed\u2013Solomon code is a [[linear code]], and in the classical encoding procedure, its [[Linear code#Properties|generator matrix]] is <math>A</math>.\n\n==== Systematic encoding procedure: The message as an initial sequence of values ====\n\nThere is an alternative encoding procedure that also produces the Reed\u2013Solomon code, but that does so in a [[systematic code|systematic]] way. Here, the mapping from the message <math>x</math> to the polynomial <math>p_x</math> works differently: the polynomial <math>p_x</math> is now defined as the unique polynomial of degree less than <math>k</math> such that\n:<math>p_x(a_i) = x_i</math> holds for all <math>i\\in\\{1,\\dots,k\\}</math>.\nTo compute this polynomial <math>p_x</math> from <math>x</math>, one can use [[Lagrange interpolation]].\nOnce it has been found, it is evaluated at the other points <math>a_{k+1},\\dots,a_n</math> of the field.\nThe alternative encoding function <math>C:F^k \\to F^n</math> for the Reed\u2013Solomon code is then again just the sequence of values: \n:<math>C(x) = \\big(p_x(a_1),\\dots,p_x(a_n)\\big)\\,.</math>\nSince the first <math>k</math> entries of each codeword <math> C(x) </math> coincide with <math>x</math>, this encoding procedure is indeed [[systematic code|systematic]].\nSince Lagrange interpolation is a linear transformation, <math> C </math> is a linear mapping. In fact, we have <math> C(x) = x \\cdot G </math>, where\n:<math>G=\n(A\\text{'s left square submatrix})^{-1}\\cdot A\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1         & 0      & 0         & \\dots  & 0      & g_{1,k+1} & \\dots  & g_{1,n} \\\\\n0         & 1      & 0         & \\dots  & 0      & g_{2,k+1} & \\dots  & g_{2,n} \\\\\n0         & 0      & 1         & \\dots  & 0      & g_{3,k+1} & \\dots  & g_{3,n} \\\\\n\\vdots    & \\vdots & \\vdots    &        & \\vdots & \\vdots    &        & \\vdots  \\\\\n0         & \\dots  & 0         & \\dots  & 1      & g_{k,k+1} & \\dots  & g_{k,n} \n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\n==== Discrete Fourier transform and its inverse ====\n\nA [[discrete Fourier transform (general)|discrete Fourier transform]] is essentially the same as the encoding procedure; it uses the generator polynomial ''p''(x) to map a set of evaluation points into the message values as shown above:\n\n:<math>C(x) = \\big(p_x(a_1),\\dots,p_x(a_n)\\big)\\,.</math>\n\nThe inverse Fourier transform could be used to convert an error free set of ''n'' < ''q'' message values back into the encoding polynomial of ''k'' coefficients, with the constraint that in order for this to work, the set of evaluation points used to encode the message must be a set of increasing powers of ''\u03b1'':\n\n:<math>a_i = \\alpha^{i-1}</math>\n:<math>a_1, \\dots, a_n = \\{ 1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\dots, \\alpha^{n-1} \\}</math>\n\nHowever, Lagrange interpolation performs the same conversion without the constraint on the set of evaluation points or the requirement of an error free set of message values and is used for systematic encoding, and in one of the steps of the [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction#Gao decoder|Gao decoder]].\n\n=== The BCH view: The codeword as a sequence of coefficients ===\nIn this view, the sender again maps the message <math>x</math> to a polynomial <math>p_x</math>, and for this, any of the two mappings just described can be used (where the message is either interpreted as the coefficients of <math>p_x</math> or as the initial sequence of values of <math>p_x</math>). Once the sender has constructed the polynomial <math>p_x</math> in some way, however, instead of sending the ''values'' of <math>p_x</math> at all points, the sender computes some related polynomial <math>s</math> of degree at most <math>n-1</math> for <math>n=q-1</math> and sends the <math>n</math> ''coefficients'' of that polynomial. The polynomial <math>s(a)</math> is constructed by multiplying the message polynomial <math>p_x(a)</math>, which has degree at most <math>k-1</math>, with a [[generator polynomial]] <math>g(a)</math> of degree <math>n-k</math> that is known to both the sender and the receiver. {{^|comment - as mentioned in remarks below, methods like puncturing may omit transmission of some of the coefficients}} The generator polynomial <math>g(x)</math> is defined as the polynomial whose roots are exactly <math>\\alpha,\\alpha^2,\\dots,\\alpha^{n-k}</math>, i.e.,\n\n: <math>g(x) = (x-\\alpha)(x-\\alpha^2)\\cdots(x-\\alpha^{n-k}) = g_0 + g_1x + \\cdots + g_{n-k-1}x^{n-k-1} + x^{n-k}\\,.</math>\n\nThe transmitter sends the <math>n=q-1</math> coefficients of <math>s(a)=p_x(a) \\cdot g(a)</math>. Thus, in the BCH view of Reed\u2013Solomon codes, the set <math>\\mathbf{C}</math> of codewords is defined for <math>n=q-1</math> as follows:<ref>{{cite book |first1=Rudolf |last1=Lidl |first2=G\u00fcnter |last2=Pilz |title=Applied Abstract Algebra |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley |year=1999 |page=226}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{C} =\n\\left\\{\n  \\left ( s_1, s_2,\\dots, s_{n} \\right)\n  \\;\\Big|\\;\n  s(a)=\\sum_{i=1}^n s_i a^{i-1}\n  \\text{ is a polynomial that has at least the roots } \\alpha^1,\\alpha^2, \\dots, \\alpha^{n-k}\n\\right\\}\\,.</math>\n\n==== Systematic encoding procedure ====\nThe encoding procedure for the BCH view of Reed\u2013Solomon codes can be modified to yield a [[systematic code|systematic encoding procedure]], in which each codeword contains the message as a prefix, and simply appends error correcting symbols as a suffix. Here, instead of sending <math>s(x) = p(x) g(x)</math>, the encoder constructs the transmitted polynomial <math>s(x)</math> such that the coefficients of the <math>k</math> largest monomials are equal to the corresponding coefficients of <math>p(x)</math>, and the lower-order coefficients of <math>s(x)</math> are chosen exactly in such a way that <math>s(x)</math> becomes divisible by <math>g(x)</math>. Then the coefficients of <math>p(x)</math> are a subsequence (specifically, a prefix) of the coefficients of <math>s(x)</math>. To get a code that is overall systematic, we construct the message polynomial <math>p(x)</math> by interpreting the message as the sequence of its coefficients.\n\nFormally, the construction is done by multiplying <math>p(x)</math> by <math>x^t</math> to make room for the <math>t=n-k</math> check symbols, dividing that product by <math>g(x)</math> to find the remainder, and then compensating for that remainder by subtracting it. The <math>t</math> check symbols are created by computing the remainder <math>s_r(x)</math>:\n\n:<math>s_r(x) = p(x)\\cdot x^t \\ \\bmod \\  g(x).</math>\n\nThe remainder has degree at most <math>t-1</math>, whereas the coefficients of <math>x^{t-1},x^{t-2},\\dots,x^1,x^0</math> in the polynomial <math>p(x)\\cdot x^t</math> are zero. Therefore, the following definition of the codeword <math>s(x)</math> has the property that the first <math>k</math> coefficients are identical to the coefficients of <math>p(x)</math>:\n\n:<math>s(x) = p(x)\\cdot x^t - s_r(x)\\,.</math>\n\nAs a result, the codewords <math>s(x)</math> are indeed elements of <math>\\mathbf{C}</math>, that is, they are divisible by the generator polynomial <math>g(x)</math>:<ref>See {{harvtxt|Lin|Costello|1983|p=171}}, for example.</ref>\n:<math>s(x) \\equiv p(x)\\cdot x^t - s_r(x) \\equiv s_r(x) - s_r(x) \\equiv 0 \\mod g(x)\\,.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon code is a [''n'', ''k'', ''n'' &minus; ''k'' + 1] code; in other words, it is a [[linear code|linear block code]] of length ''n'' (over ''F'') with [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]] ''k'' and minimum [[Hamming distance]] <math display=\"inline\">d_{\\min}=n-k+1.</math> The Reed\u2013Solomon code is optimal in the sense that the minimum distance has the maximum value possible for a linear code of size (''n'',&nbsp;''k''); this is known as the [[Singleton bound]]. Such a code is also called a [[MDS code|maximum distance separable (MDS) code]].\n\nThe error-correcting ability of a Reed\u2013Solomon code is determined by its minimum distance, or equivalently, by <math>n - k</math>, the measure of redundancy in the block. If the locations of the error symbols are not known in advance, then a Reed\u2013Solomon code can correct up to <math>(n-k)/2</math> erroneous symbols, i.e., it can correct half as many errors as there are redundant symbols added to the block. Sometimes error locations are known in advance (e.g., \"side information\" in [[demodulator]] [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s)\u2014these are called [[Erasure channel|erasures]]. A Reed\u2013Solomon code (like any [[Maximum distance separable code|MDS code]]) is able to correct twice as many erasures as errors, and any combination of errors and erasures can be corrected as long as the relation 2''E''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' is satisfied, where <math>E</math> is the number of errors and <math>S</math> is the number of erasures in the block.\n\n[[File:RS BER.png|400px|right|thumb| Theoretical BER performance of the Reed-Solomon code (N=255, K=233, QPSK, AWGN). Step-like characteristic.]]\n\nThe theoretical error bound can be described via the following formula for the [[Additive white Gaussian noise|AWGN]] channel for [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]]:<ref>[https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/bit-error-rate-ber.html#brck0zf Analytical Expressions Used in bercoding and BERTool]</ref>\n\n: <math>P_b \\approx \\frac{2^{m-1}}{2^m-1}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{\\ell=t+1}^n \\ell {n\\choose \\ell}P_s^\\ell(1-P_s)^{n-\\ell}</math>\n\nand for other modulation schemes:\n\n: <math>P_b \\approx \\frac{1}{m}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{\\ell=t+1}^n \\ell {n\\choose \\ell} P_s^\\ell(1-P_s)^{n-\\ell}</math>\n\nwhere <math>t = \\frac{1}{2}(d_{\\min}-1)</math>, <math>P_s = 1-(1-s)^h</math>, <math>h = \\frac{m}{\\log_2M}</math>, <math>s</math> is the symbol error rate in uncoded AWGN case and <math>M</math> is the modulation order.\n\nFor practical uses of Reed\u2013Solomon codes, it is common to use a finite field <math>F</math> with <math>2^m</math> elements. In this case, each symbol can be represented as an <math>m</math>-bit value. \nThe sender sends the data points as encoded blocks, and the number of symbols in the encoded block is <math>n = 2^m - 1</math>. Thus a Reed\u2013Solomon code operating on 8-bit symbols has <math>n = 2^8 - 1 = 255</math> symbols per block. (This is a very popular value because of the prevalence of [[byte-oriented]] computer systems.) The number <math>k</math>, with <math>k < n</math>, of ''data'' symbols in the block is a design parameter. A commonly used code encodes <math>k = 223</math> eight-bit data symbols plus 32 eight-bit parity symbols in an <math>n = 255</math>-symbol block; this is denoted as a <math>(n, k) = (255,223)</math> code, and is capable of correcting up to 16 symbol errors per block.\n\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon code properties discussed above make them especially well-suited to applications where errors occur in [[burst error|burst]]s.  This is because it does not matter to the code how many bits in a symbol are in error \u2014 if multiple bits in a symbol are corrupted it only counts as a single error.  Conversely, if a data stream is not characterized by error bursts or drop-outs but by random single bit errors, a Reed\u2013Solomon code is usually a poor choice compared to a binary code.\n\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon code, like the [[convolutional code]], is a transparent code. This means that if the channel symbols have been [[bitwise NOT|inverted]] somewhere along the line, the decoders will still operate. The result will be the inversion of the original data. However, the Reed\u2013Solomon code loses its transparency when the code is shortened. The \"missing\" bits in a shortened code need to be filled by either zeros or ones, depending on whether the data is complemented or not. (To put it another way, if the symbols are inverted, then the zero-fill needs to be inverted to a one-fill.) For this reason it is mandatory that the sense of the data (i.e., true or complemented) be resolved before Reed\u2013Solomon decoding.\n\nWhether the Reed\u2013Solomon code is [[cyclic code|cyclic]] or not depends on subtle details of the construction. In the original view of Reed and Solomon, where the codewords are the values of a polynomial, one can choose the sequence of evaluation points in such a way as to make the code cyclic. In particular, if <math>\\alpha</math> is a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] of the field <math>F</math>, then by definition all non-zero elements of <math>F</math> take the form <math>\\alpha^i</math> for  <math>i\\in\\{1,\\dots,q-1\\}</math>, where <math>q=|F|</math>.  Each polynomial <math>p</math> over <math>F</math> gives rise to a codeword <math>(p(\\alpha^1),\\dots,p(\\alpha^{q-1}))</math>. Since the function <math>a\\mapsto p(\\alpha a)</math> is also a polynomial of the same degree, this function gives rise to a codeword <math>(p(\\alpha^2),\\dots,p(\\alpha^{q}))</math>; since <math>\\alpha^{q}=\\alpha^1</math> holds, this codeword is the [[circular shift|cyclic left-shift]] of the original codeword derived from <math>p</math>. So choosing a sequence of primitive root powers as the evaluation points makes the original view Reed\u2013Solomon code [[cyclic code|cyclic]]. Reed\u2013Solomon codes in the BCH view are always cyclic because [[BCH code#Properties|BCH codes are cyclic]].\n\n===Remarks===\n\nDesigners are not required to use the \"natural\" sizes of Reed\u2013Solomon code blocks. A technique known as \"shortening\" can produce a smaller code of any desired size from a larger code. For example, the widely used (255,223) code can be converted to a (160,128) code by padding the unused portion of the source block with 95 binary zeroes and not transmitting them. At the decoder, the same portion of the block is loaded locally with binary zeroes. The Delsarte\u2013Goethals\u2013Seidel<ref>{{Citation |first=Florian |last=Pfender |first2=G\u00fcnter M. |last2=Ziegler |title=Kissing Numbers, Sphere Packings, and Some Unexpected Proofs |journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=873&ndash;883 |date=September 2004 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200408/fea-pfender.pdf |doi= }}. Explains the Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel theorem as used in the context of the error correcting code for [[compact disc]].</ref> theorem illustrates an example of an application of shortened Reed\u2013Solomon codes. In parallel to shortening, a technique known as [[puncturing]] allows omitting some of the encoded parity symbols.\n\n== Reed Solomon original view decoders ==\n\nThe decoders described in this section use the Reed Solomon original view of a codeword as a sequence of polynomial values where the polynomial is based on the message to be encoded. The same set of fixed values are used by the encoder and decoder, and the decoder recovers the encoding polynomial (and optionally an error locating polynomial) from the received message.\n\n==== Theoretical decoder ====\n\n{{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}} described a theoretical decoder that corrected errors by finding the most popular message polynomial. The decoder only knows the set of values <math>a_1</math> to <math>a_n</math> and which encoding method was used to generate the codeword's sequence of values. The original message, the polynomial, and any errors are unknown. A decoding procedure could use a method like Lagrange interpolation on various subsets of n codeword values taken k at a time to repeatedly produce potential polynomials, until a sufficient number of matching polynomials are produced to reasonably eliminate any errors in the received codeword. Once a polynomial is determined, then any errors in the codeword can be corrected, by recalculating the corresponding codeword values. Unfortunately, in all but the simplest of cases, there are too many subsets, so the algorithm is impractical.  The number of subsets is the [[binomial coefficient]], <math>\\textstyle \\binom{n}{k} = {n! \\over (n-k)! k!}</math>, and the number of subsets is infeasible for even modest codes. For a <math>(255,249)</math> code that can correct 3 errors, the naive theoretical decoder would examine 359 billion subsets. <!-- = 255 * 254 * 253 * 252 * 251 * 250 / 720 rounded down; could say 360B -->\n\n==== Berlekamp Welch decoder ====\n\nIn 1986, a decoder known as the [[Berlekamp\u2013Welch algorithm]] was developed as a decoder that is able to recover the original message polynomial as well as an error \"locator\" polynomial that produces zeroes for the input values that correspond to errors, with time complexity O(n^3), where n is the number of values in a message.

Gorenstein and N. Zierler, \"A class of cyclic linear error-correcting codes in p^m symbols,\" J. SIAM, vol. 9, pp. 207\u2013214, June 1961</ref> The Gorenstein\u2013Zierler decoder and the related work on BCH codes are described in a book ''Error Correcting Codes'' by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] (1961).<ref>''Error Correcting Codes'' by W Wesley Peterson, 1961</ref>\n\n====Formulation====\n\nThe transmitted message, <math>(c_0, \\ldots, c_i, \\ldots,c_{n-1})</math>, is viewed as the coefficients of a polynomial ''s''(''x'') that is divisible by a generator polynomial ''g''(''x'').\n:<math>s(x) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}  c_i x^i</math>\n:<math>g(x) = \\prod_{j=1}^{n-k} (x - \\alpha^j), </math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b1'' is a primitive root.\n\nSince ''s''(''x'') is a multiple of the generator ''g''(''x''), it follows that it \"inherits\" all its roots:\n:<math>s(\\alpha^j) = 0, \\ j=1,2,\\ldots,n-k</math>\n\nThe transmitted polynomial is corrupted in transit by an error polynomial ''e''(''x'') to produce the received polynomial ''r''(''x'').\n:<math>r(x) = s(x) + e(x)</math>\n:<math>e(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} e_i   x^i </math>\n\nwhere ''e<sub>i</sub>'' is the coefficient for the ''i''-th power of ''x''.  Coefficient ''e<sub>i</sub>'' will be zero if there is no error at that power of ''x'' and nonzero if there is an error.  If there are ''\u03bd'' errors at distinct powers ''i<sub>k</sub>'' of ''x'', then\n\n:<math>e(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\nu e_{i_k} x^{i_k}</math>\n\nThe goal of the decoder is to find the number of errors (''\u03bd''), the positions of the errors (''i<sub>k</sub>''), and the error values at those positions (''e<sub>i<sub>k</sub></sub>''). From those, ''e''(''x'') can be calculated and subtracted from ''r''(''x'') to get the originally sent message ''s''(''x'').\n\n====Syndrome decoding====\n\nThe decoder starts by evaluating the polynomial as received at certain points. We call the results of that evaluation the \"syndromes\", ''S''<sub>''j''</sub>. They are defined as:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nS_j &= r(\\alpha^j) = s(\\alpha^j) + e(\\alpha^j) = 0 + e(\\alpha^j) = e(\\alpha^j), \\ j=1,2,\\ldots,n-k \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{k=1}^\\nu e_{i_k} \\left( \\alpha^j \\right)^{i_k}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe advantage of looking at the syndromes is that the message polynomial drops out. In other words, the syndromes only relate to the error, and are unaffected by the actual contents of the message being transmitted. If the syndromes are all zero, the algorithm stops here and reports that the message was not corrupted in transit.\n\n====Error locators and error values====\n<!-- There's confusion between index k and the k in (n,k). Literature also has confusion? Or does it use kappa? -->\n\nFor convenience, define the '''error locators''' ''X<sub>k</sub>'' and '''error values''' ''Y<sub>k</sub>'' as:\n:<math> X_k = \\alpha^{i_k}, \\  Y_k = e_{i_k} </math>\n\nThen the syndromes can be written in terms of the error locators and error values as\n:<math>  S_j =  \\sum_{k=1}^{\\nu} Y_k X_k^{j} </math>\n\nThis definition of the syndrome values is equivalent to the previous since <math>(\\alpha^j)^{i_k} = \\alpha ^ {j*i_k} = (\\alpha^{i_k})^j = X_k^j</math>.\n\nThe syndromes give a system of ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' \u2265 2''\u03bd'' equations in 2''\u03bd'' unknowns, but that system of equations is nonlinear in the ''X<sub>k</sub>'' and does not have an obvious solution.  However, if the ''X<sub>k</sub>'' were known (see below), then the syndrome equations provide a linear system of equations that can easily be solved for the ''Y<sub>k</sub>'' error values.\n<!--\nVandermonde comment. Matrix equation -->\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nX_1^1 & X_2^1 & \\cdots & X_\\nu^1 \\\\\nX_1^2 & X_2^2 & \\cdots & X_\\nu^2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots && \\vdots \\\\\nX_1^{n-k} & X_2^{n-k} & \\cdots & X_\\nu^{n-k} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nY_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_\\nu\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nS_1 \\\\ S_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ S_{n-k}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nConsequently, the problem is finding the ''X<sub>k</sub>'', because then the leftmost matrix would be known, and both sides of the equation could be multiplied by its inverse, yielding Y''<sub>k</sub>''\n\nIn the variant of this algorithm where the locations of the errors are already known (when it is being used as an [[erasure code]]), this is the end. The error locations (''X<sub>k</sub>'') are already known by some other method (for example, in a FM transmission, the sections where the bitstream was unclear or overcome with interference are probabilistically determinable from frequency analysis). In this scenario, up to <math>n-k</math> errors can be corrected.\n\nThe rest of the algorithm serves to locate the errors, and will require syndrome values up to <math>2v</math>, instead of just the <math>v</math> used thus far. This is why 2x as many error correcting symbols need to be added as can be corrected without knowing their locations.\n\n====Error locator polynomial====\n\nThere is a linear recurrence relation that gives rise to a system of linear equations. Solving those equations identifies those error locations ''X<sub>k</sub>''.\n<!--This is credited to Daniel Gorenstein and Neal Zierler in the book Error Correcting Codes by Peterson - 1961 -->\n<!--Petersons decoder is a simplified implementation for bit oriented BCH codes where the error values only have magnitude one. -->\n\nDefine the '''error locator polynomial''' \u039b(''x'') as\n\n:<math>\\Lambda(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^\\nu (1 - x X_k ) = 1 + \\Lambda_1 x^1 + \\Lambda_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\Lambda_\\nu x^\\nu</math>\n\nThe zeros of \u039b(''x'') are the reciprocals <math>X_k^{-1}</math>. This follows from the above product notation construction since if <math>x=X_k^{-1}</math> then one of the multiplied terms will be zero <math>(1 - X_k^{-1} \\cdot X_k) = 1 - 1 = 0</math>, making the whole polynomial evaluate to zero.\n:<math> \\Lambda(X_k^{-1}) = 0 </math>\n\nLet <math>j</math> be any integer such that <math>1 \\leq j \\leq v</math>. Multiply both sides by <math>Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu}</math> and it will still be zero. \n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} \\Lambda(X_k^{-1}) = 0. \\\\\n& Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} (1 + \\Lambda_1 X_k^{-1} + \\Lambda_2 X_k^{-2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_\\nu X_k^{-\\nu}) = 0. \\\\ \n& Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} + \\Lambda_1 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} X_k^{-1} + \\Lambda_2 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} X_k^{-2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_\\nu Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} X_k^{-\\nu} = 0. \\\\\n& Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} + \\Lambda_1 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu-1} + \\Lambda_2 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu -2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_{\\nu} Y_k X_k^j = 0. \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSum for ''k'' = 1 to ''\u03bd''\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\sum_{k=1}^\\nu ( Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} + \\Lambda_1 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu-1} + \\Lambda_2 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu -2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_{\\nu} Y_k X_k^{j} ) = 0  \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nCollect each term into its own sum, and extract the constant values of <math>\\Lambda</math> that are unaffected by the summation\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\nu  Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} \\right) + \\Lambda_1 \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\nu Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu-1}\\right) + \\Lambda_2 \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\nu Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu -2}\\right) + \\cdots + \\Lambda_\\nu \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\nu Y_k X_k^j \\right) = 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese summations are now equivalent to the syndrome values, which we know and can substitute in! This therefore reduces to\n\n:<math> S_{j + \\nu} + \\Lambda_1 S_{j+\\nu-1} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_{\\nu-1} S_{j+1} + \\Lambda_{\\nu} S_j   = 0 \\, </math>\n\nSubtracting <math>S_{j+\\nu}</math> from both sides yields\n\n:<math> S_j \\Lambda_{\\nu} + S_{j+1}\\Lambda_{\\nu-1} + \\cdots + S_{j+\\nu-1} \\Lambda_1 = - S_{j + \\nu} \\ </math>\n\nRecall that ''j'' was chosen to be any integer between 1 and ''v'' inclusive, and this equivalence is true for any and all such values. Therefore, we have ''v'' linear equations, not just one. This system of linear equations can therefore be solved for the coefficients \u039b<sub>''i''</sub> of the error location polynomial:\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nS_1 & S_2 & \\cdots & S_{\\nu} \\\\\nS_2 & S_3 & \\cdots & S_{\\nu+1} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots && \\vdots \\\\\nS_{\\nu} & S_{\\nu+1} & \\cdots & S_{2\\nu-1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\Lambda_{\\nu} \\\\ \\Lambda_{\\nu-1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\Lambda_1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n- S_{\\nu+1} \\\\ - S_{\\nu+2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ - S_{\\nu+\\nu}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nThe above assumes the decoder knows the number of errors ''\u03bd'', but that number has not been determined yet. The PGZ decoder does not determine ''\u03bd'' directly but rather searches for it by trying successive values. The decoder first assumes the largest value for a trial ''\u03bd'' and sets up the linear system for that value. If the equations can be solved (i.e., the matrix determinant is nonzero), then that trial value is the number of errors. If the linear system cannot be solved, then the trial ''\u03bd'' is reduced by one and the next smaller system is examined. {{Harv|Gill|n.d.|p=35}}\n\n====Obtain the error locators from the error locator polynomial====\n\nUse the coefficients \u039b<sub>''i''</sub> found in the last step to build the error location polynomial. The roots of the error location polynomial can be found by exhaustive search. The error locators ''X<sub>k</sub>'' are the reciprocals of those roots. The order of coefficients of the error location polynomial can be reversed, in which case the roots of that reversed polynomial are the error locators <math>X_k</math> (not their reciprocals <math>X_k^{-1}</math>). [[Chien search]] is an efficient implementation of this step.\n\n====Calculate the error values====\n\nOnce the error locators ''X<sub>k</sub>'' are known, the error values can be determined. This can be done by direct solution for ''Y<sub>k</sub>'' in the [[#Error locators and error values|error equations]] matrix given above, or using the [[Forney algorithm]].\n\n====Calculate the error locations====\n\nCalculate ''i<sub>k</sub>'' by taking the log base <math>\\alpha</math> of ''X<sub>k</sub>''. This is generally done using a precomputed lookup table.\n\n====Fix the errors====\n\nFinally, e(x) is generated from ''i<sub>k</sub>'' and ''e<sub>i<sub>k</sub></sub>'' and then is subtracted from r(x) to get the originally sent message s(x), with errors corrected.\n\n==== Example ====\n\nConsider the Reed&ndash;Solomon code defined in {{math|''GF''(929)}} with {{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} 3}} and {{math|''t'' {{=}} 4}} (this is used in [[PDF417]] barcodes) for a RS(7,3) code.

Costello Jr, \"Error Control Coding\" second edition, pp. 255\u2013262, 1982, 2004</ref>  To avoid conflict with syndrome names, let ''c''(''x'') = ''s''(''x'') the encoded codeword. ''r''(''x'') and ''e''(''x'') are the same as above. Define ''C''(''x''), ''E''(''x''), and ''R''(''x'') as the discrete Fourier transforms of ''c''(''x''), ''e''(''x''), and ''r''(''x''). Since ''r''(''x'') = ''c''(''x'') + ''e''(''x''), and since a discrete Fourier transform is a linear operator, ''R''(''x'') = ''C''(''x'') + ''E''(''x'').\n\nTransform ''r''(''x'') to ''R''(''x'') using discrete Fourier transform. Since the calculation for a discrete Fourier transform is the same as the calculation for syndromes, ''t'' coefficients of ''R''(''x'') and ''E''(''x'') are the same as the syndromes:\n\n:<math>R_j = E_j = S_j = r(\\alpha^j)</math>\n:<math>\\text{for } 1 \\le j \\le t</math>\n\nUse <math>R_1</math> through <math>R_t</math> as syndromes (they're the same) and generate the error locator polynomial using the methods from any of the above decoders.\n\nLet v = number of errors. Generate E(x) using the known coefficients <math>E_1</math> to <math>E_t</math>, the error locator polynomial, and these formulas\n\n:<math>E_0 = - \\frac{1}{\\Lambda_v}(E_{v} + \\Lambda_1 E_{v-1} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_{v-1} E_{1})</math>\n:<math>E_j = -(\\Lambda_1 E_{j-1} + \\Lambda_2 E_{j-2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_v E_{j-v})</math>\n:<math>\\text{for } t < j < n</math>\n\nThen calculate ''C''(''x'') = ''R''(''x'') \u2212 ''E''(''x'') and take the inverse transform (polynomial interpolation) of ''C''(''x'') to produce ''c''(''x'').\n\n===Decoding beyond the error-correction bound===\n\nThe [[Singleton bound]] states that the minimum distance ''d'' of a linear block code of size (''n'',''k'') is upper-bounded by ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. The distance ''d'' was usually understood to limit the error-correction capability to \u230a''d''/2\u230b. The Reed\u2013Solomon code achieves this bound with equality, and can thus correct up to \u230a(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2\u230b errors. However, this error-correction bound is not exact.\n\nIn 1999, [[Madhu Sudan]] and [[Venkatesan Guruswami]] at MIT published \"Improved Decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon and Algebraic-Geometry Codes\" introducing an algorithm that allowed for the correction of errors beyond half the minimum distance of the code.<ref>{{Citation |first=V. |last=Guruswami |first2=M. |last2=Sudan |title=Improved decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon codes and algebraic geometry codes |journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1757&ndash;1767 |date=September 1999 |doi=10.1109/18.782097 |citeseerx=10.1.1.115.292 }}</ref> It applies to Reed\u2013Solomon codes and more generally to [[algebraic geometric code]]s. This algorithm produces a list of codewords (it is a [[list-decoding]] algorithm) and is based on interpolation and factorization of polynomials over <math>GF(2^m)</math> and its extensions.\n\n===Soft-decoding===\n\nThe algebraic decoding methods described above are hard-decision methods, which means that for every symbol a hard decision is made about its value.  For example, a decoder could associate with each symbol an additional value corresponding to the channel [[demodulator]]'s confidence in the correctness of the symbol. The advent of [[low-density parity-check code|LDPC]] and [[turbo code]]s, which employ iterated [[soft-decision decoding|soft-decision]] belief propagation decoding methods to achieve error-correction performance close to the [[Shannon limit|theoretical limit]], has spurred interest in applying soft-decision decoding to conventional algebraic codes. In 2003, Ralf Koetter and [[Alexander Vardy]] presented a polynomial-time soft-decision algebraic list-decoding algorithm for Reed\u2013Solomon codes, which was based upon the work by Sudan and Guruswami.<ref>{{cite journal | first1=Ralf | last1=Koetter | first2=Alexander | last2=Vardy | title=Algebraic soft-decision decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon codes | journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] | volume=49 | issue=11 | year=2003 | pages=2809\u20132825 | doi=10.1109/TIT.2003.819332| citeseerx=10.1.1.13.2021 }}</ref>\nIn 2016,  Steven J.

Reed]] and [[Gustave Solomon]] in 1960.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}}</ref>\nThey have many applications, the most prominent of which include consumer technologies such as [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray]] discs, [[QR code]]s, [[data transmission]] technologies such as [[DSL]] and [[WiMAX]], [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] systems such as satellite communications, [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], and storage systems such as [[RAID 6]].\n\nReed\u2013Solomon codes operate on a block of data treated as a set of [[finite field]] elements called symbols. Reed\u2013Solomon codes are able to detect and correct multiple symbol errors. By adding {{mvar|t}} check symbols to the data, a Reed\u2013Solomon code can detect (but not correct) any combination of up to and including {{mvar|t}} erroneous symbols, '''OR''' locate and correct up to and including {{math|\u230a''t''/2\u230b}} erroneous symbols at unknown locations. As an [[erasure code]], it can correct up to and including {{mvar|t}} erasures at locations that are known and provided to the algorithm, or it can detect and correct combinations of errors and erasures. Reed\u2013Solomon codes are also suitable as multiple-[[burst error|burst]] bit-error correcting codes, since a sequence of {{math|''b''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}} consecutive bit errors can affect at most two symbols of size {{mvar|b}}. The choice of {{mvar|t}} is up to the designer of the code, and may be selected within wide limits.\n\nThere are two basic types of Reed\u2013Solomon codes, original view and [[BCH code|BCH]] view, with BCH view being the most common as BCH view decoders are faster and require less working storage than original view decoders.\n\n==History==\nReed\u2013Solomon codes were developed in 1960 by [[Irving S. Reed]] and [[Gustave Solomon]], who were then staff members of [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]]. Their seminal article was titled \"Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields\". {{Harvard citation|Reed|Solomon|1960}}. The original encoding scheme described in the Reed & Solomon article used a variable polynomial based on the message to be encoded where only a fixed set of values (evaluation points) to be encoded are known to encoder and decoder. The original theoretical decoder generated potential polynomials based on subsets of ''k'' (unencoded message length) out of ''n'' (encoded message length) values of a received message, choosing the most popular polynomial as the correct one, which was impractical for all but the simplest of cases. This was initially resolved by changing the original scheme to a [[BCH code]] like scheme based on a fixed polynomial known to both encoder and decoder, but later, practical decoders based on the original scheme were developed, although slower than the BCH schemes. The result of this is that there are two main types of Reed Solomon codes, ones that use the original encoding scheme, and ones that use the BCH encoding scheme.\n\nAlso in 1960, a practical fixed polynomial decoder for [[BCH codes]] developed by [[Daniel Gorenstein]] and Neal Zierler was described in an MIT Lincoln Laboratory report by Zierler in January 1960 and later in a paper in June 1961.<ref>D. Gorenstein and N. Zierler, \"A class of cyclic linear error-correcting codes in p^m symbols\", J. SIAM, vol. 9, pp. 207-214, June 1961</ref>   The Gorenstein\u2013Zierler decoder and the related work on BCH codes are described in a book Error Correcting Codes by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] (1961).<ref>Error Correcting Codes by W_Wesley_Peterson, 1961</ref> By 1963 (or possibly earlier), J. J. Stone (and others) recognized that Reed Solomon codes could use the BCH scheme of using a fixed generator polynomial, making such codes a special class of BCH codes,<ref>Error Correcting Codes by W_Wesley_Peterson, second edition, 1972</ref> but Reed Solomon codes based on the original encoding scheme, are not a class of BCH codes, and depending on the set of evaluation points, they are not even [[cyclic code]]s.\n\nIn 1969, an improved BCH scheme decoder was developed by [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[James Massey]], and has since been known as the [[Berlekamp\u2013Massey algorithm|Berlekamp\u2013Massey decoding algorithm]].\n\nIn 1975, another improved BCH scheme decoder was developed by Yasuo Sugiyama, based on the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].<ref>Yasuo Sugiyama, Masao Kasahara, Shigeichi Hirasawa, and Toshihiko Namekawa. A method for solving key equation for decoding Goppa codes. Information and Control, 27:87\u201399, 1975.</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Reed\u2013Solomon codes were implemented in the [[Voyager program]] in the form of [[concatenated error correction code]]s. The first commercial application in mass-produced consumer products appeared in 1982 with the [[compact disc]], where two [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaved]] Reed\u2013Solomon codes are used. Today, Reed\u2013Solomon codes are widely implemented in [[Data storage device|digital storage]] devices and [[Data transmission|digital communication]] standards, though they are being slowly replaced by more modern [[Low-density parity-check code|low-density parity-check (LDPC) code]]s or [[turbo code]]s.  For example, Reed\u2013Solomon codes are used in the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) standard [[DVB-S]], but LDPC codes are used in its successor, [[DVB-S2]].\n\nIn 1986, an original scheme decoder known as the [[Berlekamp\u2013Welch algorithm]] was developed.\n\nIn 1996, variations of original scheme decoders called list decoders or soft decoders were developed by Madhu Sudan and others, and work continues on these types of decoders \u2013 see ''[[Guruswami\u2013Sudan list decoding algorithm]]''.\n\nIn 2002, another original scheme decoder was developed by Shuhong Gao, based on the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] [http://www.math.clemson.edu/~sgao/papers/RS.pdf Gao_RS.pdf] .\n\n== Applications ==\n\n===Data storage===\nReed\u2013Solomon coding is very widely used in mass storage systems to correct\nthe burst errors associated with media defects.\n\nReed\u2013Solomon coding is a key component of the [[compact disc]]. It was the first use of strong error correction coding in a mass-produced consumer product, and [[digital audio tape|DAT]] and [[DVD]] use similar schemes. In the CD, two layers of Reed\u2013Solomon coding separated by a 28-way [[convolution]]al [[interleaver]] yields a scheme called Cross-Interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon Coding ([[Cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding|CIRC]]). The first element of a CIRC decoder is a relatively weak inner (32,28) Reed\u2013Solomon code, shortened from a (255,251) code with 8-bit symbols. This code can correct up to 2 byte errors per 32-byte block. More importantly, it flags as erasures any uncorrectable blocks, i.e., blocks with more than 2 byte errors. The decoded 28-byte blocks, with erasure indications, are then spread by the deinterleaver to different blocks of the (28,24) outer code. Thanks to the deinterleaving, an erased 28-byte block from the inner code becomes a single erased byte in each of 28 outer code blocks. The outer code easily corrects this, since it can handle up to 4 such erasures per block.\n\nThe result is a CIRC that can completely correct error bursts up to 4000 bits, or about 2.5&nbsp;mm on the disc surface. This code is so strong that most CD playback errors are almost certainly caused by tracking errors that cause the laser to jump track, not by uncorrectable error bursts.<ref>{{Citation |first=K. A.

The Distributed online storage service [[Wuala]] (discontinued in 2015) also used to make use of Reed\u2013Solomon when breaking up files.\n\n===Bar code===\nAlmost all two-dimensional bar codes such as [[PDF-417]], [[MaxiCode]], [[Datamatrix]], [[QR Code]], and [[Aztec Code]] use Reed\u2013Solomon error correction to allow correct reading even if a portion of the bar code is damaged.  When the bar code scanner cannot recognize a bar code symbol, it will treat it as an erasure.\n\nReed\u2013Solomon coding is less common in one-dimensional bar codes, but is used by the [[PostBar]] symbology.\n\n===Data transmission===\nSpecialized forms of Reed\u2013Solomon codes, specifically [[Cauchy matrix|Cauchy]]-RS and [[Vandermonde matrix|Vandermonde]]-RS, can be used to overcome the unreliable nature of data transmission over [[Binary erasure channel|erasure channels]]. The encoding process assumes a code of RS(''N'',&nbsp;''K'') which results in ''N'' codewords of length ''N'' symbols each storing ''K'' symbols of data, being generated, that are then sent over an erasure channel.\n\nAny combination of ''K'' codewords received at the other end is enough to reconstruct all of the ''N'' codewords. The code rate is generally set to 1/2 unless the channel's erasure likelihood can be adequately modelled and is seen to be less. In conclusion, ''N'' is usually 2''K'', meaning that at least half of all the codewords sent must be received in order to reconstruct all of the codewords sent.\n\nReed\u2013Solomon codes are also used in [[xDSL]] systems and [[CCSDS]]'s [[Space Communications Protocol Specifications]] as a form of [[forward error correction]].\n\n===Space transmission===\n\n[[File:DeepSpaceFEC.png|350px|right|thumb| Deep-space concatenated coding system.<ref>J. Hagenauer, E. Offer, and L. Papke, Reed Solomon Codes and Their Applications. New York IEEE Press, 1994 - p. 433</ref>]]\n\nOne significant application of Reed\u2013Solomon coding was to encode the digital pictures sent back by the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space probe.\n\nVoyager introduced Reed\u2013Solomon coding [[concatenated code|concatenated]] with [[convolutional code]]s, a practice that has since become very widespread in deep space and satellite (e.g., direct digital broadcasting) communications.\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:NASA ECC Codes-imperfection.png|thumb|600px|none|NASA's Deep Space Missions ECC Codes (code imperfectness) {{Deletable image-caption|date=March 2012}}]] -->\n\n[[Viterbi decoder]]s tend to produce errors in short bursts. Correcting these burst errors is a job best done by short or simplified Reed\u2013Solomon codes.\n\nModern versions of concatenated Reed\u2013Solomon/Viterbi-decoded convolutional coding were and are used on the [[Mars Pathfinder]], [[Galileo probe|Galileo]], [[Mars Exploration Rover]] and [[Cassini probe|Cassini]] missions, where they perform within about 1\u20131.5 [[decibel|dB]] of the ultimate limit, being the [[Shannon capacity]].\n\nThese concatenated codes are now being replaced by more powerful [[turbo code]]s.\n\n== Constructions ==\n\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon code is actually a family of codes, where every code is characterised by three parameters: an [[Block code#The alphabet .CE.A3|alphabet]] size ''q'', a [[Block code#The block length n|block length]] ''n'', and a [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] ''k,'' with ''k < n \u2264 q.'' The set of alphabet symbols is interpreted as the [[finite field]] of order ''q'', and thus, ''q'' has to be a [[prime power]]. In the most useful parameterizations of the Reed\u2013Solomon code, the block length is usually some constant multiple of the message length, that is, the [[Block code#The rate R|rate]] {{nowrap|1=''R'' = ''k''/''n''}} is some constant, and furthermore, the block length is equal to or one less than the alphabet size, that is, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''q''}} or {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''q'' \u2212 1}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Reed & Solomon's original view: The codeword as a sequence of values ===\n\nThere are different encoding procedures for the Reed\u2013Solomon code, and thus, there are different ways to describe the set of all codewords.\nIn the original view of {{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}}, every codeword of the Reed\u2013Solomon code is a sequence of function values of a polynomial of degree less than ''k''. In order to obtain a codeword of the Reed\u2013Solomon code, the message is interpreted as the description of a polynomial ''p'' of degree less than ''k'' over the finite field ''F'' with ''q'' elements.\nIn turn, the polynomial ''p'' is evaluated at ''n'' \u2264 ''q'' distinct points <math>a_1,\\dots,a_n</math> of the field ''F'', and the sequence of values is the corresponding codeword. Common choices for a set of evaluation points include {0, 1, 2, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}, {0, 1, ''\u03b1'', ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''\u03b1''<sup>''n''\u22122</sup>}, or for ''n'' < ''q'', {1, ''\u03b1'', ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''\u03b1''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}, ... , where ''\u03b1'' is a [[primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]] of ''F''.\n\nFormally, the set <math>\\mathbf{C}</math> of codewords of the Reed\u2013Solomon code is defined as follows:\n: <math>\n\\mathbf{C}\n = \\Big\\{\\;\n     \\big( p(a_1), p(a_2), \\dots, p(a_n) \\big)\n     \\;\\Big|\\;\n     p \\text{ is a polynomial over } F \\text{ of degree } <k\n   \\;\\Big\\}\\,.\n</math>\nSince any two ''distinct'' polynomials of degree less than <math>k</math> agree in at most <math>k-1</math> points, this means that any two codewords of the Reed\u2013Solomon code disagree in at least <math>n - (k-1) = n-k+1</math> positions.\nFurthermore, there are two polynomials that do agree in <math>k-1</math> points but are not equal, and thus, the [[Block code#The distance d|distance]] of the Reed\u2013Solomon code is exactly <math>d=n-k+1</math>.\nThen the relative distance is <math>\\delta = d/n = 1-k/n + 1/n = 1-R+1/n\\sim 1-R</math>, where <math>R=k/n</math> is the rate.\nThis trade-off between the relative distance and the rate is asymptotically optimal since, by the [[Singleton bound]], ''every'' code satisfies <math>\\delta+R\\leq 1+1/n</math>.\nBeing a code that achieves this optimal trade-off, the Reed\u2013Solomon code belongs to the class of [[maximum distance separable code]]s.\n\nWhile the number of different polynomials of degree less than ''k'' and the number of different messages are both equal to <math>q^k</math>, and thus every message can be uniquely mapped to such a polynomial, there are different ways of doing this encoding.\nThe original construction of {{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}} interprets the message ''x'' as the ''coefficients'' of the polynomial ''p'', whereas subsequent constructions interpret the message as the ''values'' of the polynomial at the first ''k'' points <math>a_1,\\dots,a_k</math> and obtain the polynomial ''p'' by interpolating these values with a polynomial of degree less than ''k''.\nThe latter encoding procedure, while being slightly less efficient, has the advantage that it gives rise to a [[systematic code]], that is, the original message is always contained as a subsequence of the codeword.\n\n==== Simple encoding procedure: The message as a sequence of coefficients ====\nIn the original construction of {{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}}, the message <math>x=(x_1,\\dots,x_k)\\in F^k</math> is mapped to the polynomial <math>p_x</math> with\n:<math>p_x(a) = \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i a^{i-1} \\,.</math>\nThe codeword of <math>x</math> is obtained by evaluating <math>p_x</math> at <math>n</math> different points <math>a_1,\\dots,a_n</math> of the field <math>F</math>.\nThus the classical encoding function <math>C:F^k \\to F^n</math> for the Reed\u2013Solomon code is defined as follows: \n:<math>C(x) = \\big(p_x(a_1),\\dots,p_x(a_n)\\big)\\,.</math>\nThis function <math>C</math> is a [[linear mapping]], that is, it satisfies <math>C(x) = x \\cdot A</math> for the following <math>(k\\times n)</math>-matrix <math>A</math> with elements from <math>F</math>:\n:<math>A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1         & \\dots  & 1         & \\dots  & 1     \\\\\na_1       & \\dots  & a_k       & \\dots  & a_n   \\\\\na_1^2     & \\dots  & a_k^2     & \\dots  & a_n^2 \\\\\n\\vdots    &        & \\vdots    &        & \\vdots \\\\\na_1^{k-1} & \\dots  & a_k^{k-1} & \\dots  & a_n^{k-1}\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nThis matrix is the transpose of a [[Vandermonde matrix]] over <math>F</math>. In other words, the Reed\u2013Solomon code is a [[linear code]], and in the classical encoding procedure, its [[Linear code#Properties|generator matrix]] is <math>A</math>.\n\n==== Systematic encoding procedure: The message as an initial sequence of values ====\n\nThere is an alternative encoding procedure that also produces the Reed\u2013Solomon code, but that does so in a [[systematic code|systematic]] way. Here, the mapping from the message <math>x</math> to the polynomial <math>p_x</math> works differently: the polynomial <math>p_x</math> is now defined as the unique polynomial of degree less than <math>k</math> such that\n:<math>p_x(a_i) = x_i</math> holds for all <math>i\\in\\{1,\\dots,k\\}</math>.\nTo compute this polynomial <math>p_x</math> from <math>x</math>, one can use [[Lagrange interpolation]].\nOnce it has been found, it is evaluated at the other points <math>a_{k+1},\\dots,a_n</math> of the field.\nThe alternative encoding function <math>C:F^k \\to F^n</math> for the Reed\u2013Solomon code is then again just the sequence of values: \n:<math>C(x) = \\big(p_x(a_1),\\dots,p_x(a_n)\\big)\\,.</math>\nSince the first <math>k</math> entries of each codeword <math> C(x) </math> coincide with <math>x</math>, this encoding procedure is indeed [[systematic code|systematic]].\nSince Lagrange interpolation is a linear transformation, <math> C </math> is a linear mapping. In fact, we have <math> C(x) = x \\cdot G </math>, where\n:<math>G=\n(A\\text{'s left square submatrix})^{-1}\\cdot A\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1         & 0      & 0         & \\dots  & 0      & g_{1,k+1} & \\dots  & g_{1,n} \\\\\n0         & 1      & 0         & \\dots  & 0      & g_{2,k+1} & \\dots  & g_{2,n} \\\\\n0         & 0      & 1         & \\dots  & 0      & g_{3,k+1} & \\dots  & g_{3,n} \\\\\n\\vdots    & \\vdots & \\vdots    &        & \\vdots & \\vdots    &        & \\vdots  \\\\\n0         & \\dots  & 0         & \\dots  & 1      & g_{k,k+1} & \\dots  & g_{k,n} \n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\n==== Discrete Fourier transform and its inverse ====\n\nA [[discrete Fourier transform (general)|discrete Fourier transform]] is essentially the same as the encoding procedure; it uses the generator polynomial ''p''(x) to map a set of evaluation points into the message values as shown above:\n\n:<math>C(x) = \\big(p_x(a_1),\\dots,p_x(a_n)\\big)\\,.</math>\n\nThe inverse Fourier transform could be used to convert an error free set of ''n'' < ''q'' message values back into the encoding polynomial of ''k'' coefficients, with the constraint that in order for this to work, the set of evaluation points used to encode the message must be a set of increasing powers of ''\u03b1'':\n\n:<math>a_i = \\alpha^{i-1}</math>\n:<math>a_1, \\dots, a_n = \\{ 1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\dots, \\alpha^{n-1} \\}</math>\n\nHowever, Lagrange interpolation performs the same conversion without the constraint on the set of evaluation points or the requirement of an error free set of message values and is used for systematic encoding, and in one of the steps of the [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction#Gao decoder|Gao decoder]].\n\n=== The BCH view: The codeword as a sequence of coefficients ===\nIn this view, the sender again maps the message <math>x</math> to a polynomial <math>p_x</math>, and for this, any of the two mappings just described can be used (where the message is either interpreted as the coefficients of <math>p_x</math> or as the initial sequence of values of <math>p_x</math>). Once the sender has constructed the polynomial <math>p_x</math> in some way, however, instead of sending the ''values'' of <math>p_x</math> at all points, the sender computes some related polynomial <math>s</math> of degree at most <math>n-1</math> for <math>n=q-1</math> and sends the <math>n</math> ''coefficients'' of that polynomial. The polynomial <math>s(a)</math> is constructed by multiplying the message polynomial <math>p_x(a)</math>, which has degree at most <math>k-1</math>, with a [[generator polynomial]] <math>g(a)</math> of degree <math>n-k</math> that is known to both the sender and the receiver. {{^|comment - as mentioned in remarks below, methods like puncturing may omit transmission of some of the coefficients}} The generator polynomial <math>g(x)</math> is defined as the polynomial whose roots are exactly <math>\\alpha,\\alpha^2,\\dots,\\alpha^{n-k}</math>, i.e.,\n\n: <math>g(x) = (x-\\alpha)(x-\\alpha^2)\\cdots(x-\\alpha^{n-k}) = g_0 + g_1x + \\cdots + g_{n-k-1}x^{n-k-1} + x^{n-k}\\,.</math>\n\nThe transmitter sends the <math>n=q-1</math> coefficients of <math>s(a)=p_x(a) \\cdot g(a)</math>. Thus, in the BCH view of Reed\u2013Solomon codes, the set <math>\\mathbf{C}</math> of codewords is defined for <math>n=q-1</math> as follows:<ref>{{cite book |first1=Rudolf |last1=Lidl |first2=G\u00fcnter |last2=Pilz |title=Applied Abstract Algebra |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley |year=1999 |page=226}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{C} =\n\\left\\{\n  \\left ( s_1, s_2,\\dots, s_{n} \\right)\n  \\;\\Big|\\;\n  s(a)=\\sum_{i=1}^n s_i a^{i-1}\n  \\text{ is a polynomial that has at least the roots } \\alpha^1,\\alpha^2, \\dots, \\alpha^{n-k}\n\\right\\}\\,.</math>\n\n==== Systematic encoding procedure ====\nThe encoding procedure for the BCH view of Reed\u2013Solomon codes can be modified to yield a [[systematic code|systematic encoding procedure]], in which each codeword contains the message as a prefix, and simply appends error correcting symbols as a suffix. Here, instead of sending <math>s(x) = p(x) g(x)</math>, the encoder constructs the transmitted polynomial <math>s(x)</math> such that the coefficients of the <math>k</math> largest monomials are equal to the corresponding coefficients of <math>p(x)</math>, and the lower-order coefficients of <math>s(x)</math> are chosen exactly in such a way that <math>s(x)</math> becomes divisible by <math>g(x)</math>. Then the coefficients of <math>p(x)</math> are a subsequence (specifically, a prefix) of the coefficients of <math>s(x)</math>. To get a code that is overall systematic, we construct the message polynomial <math>p(x)</math> by interpreting the message as the sequence of its coefficients.\n\nFormally, the construction is done by multiplying <math>p(x)</math> by <math>x^t</math> to make room for the <math>t=n-k</math> check symbols, dividing that product by <math>g(x)</math> to find the remainder, and then compensating for that remainder by subtracting it. The <math>t</math> check symbols are created by computing the remainder <math>s_r(x)</math>:\n\n:<math>s_r(x) = p(x)\\cdot x^t \\ \\bmod \\  g(x).</math>\n\nThe remainder has degree at most <math>t-1</math>, whereas the coefficients of <math>x^{t-1},x^{t-2},\\dots,x^1,x^0</math> in the polynomial <math>p(x)\\cdot x^t</math> are zero. Therefore, the following definition of the codeword <math>s(x)</math> has the property that the first <math>k</math> coefficients are identical to the coefficients of <math>p(x)</math>:\n\n:<math>s(x) = p(x)\\cdot x^t - s_r(x)\\,.</math>\n\nAs a result, the codewords <math>s(x)</math> are indeed elements of <math>\\mathbf{C}</math>, that is, they are divisible by the generator polynomial <math>g(x)</math>:<ref>See {{harvtxt|Lin|Costello|1983|p=171}}, for example.</ref>\n:<math>s(x) \\equiv p(x)\\cdot x^t - s_r(x) \\equiv s_r(x) - s_r(x) \\equiv 0 \\mod g(x)\\,.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon code is a [''n'', ''k'', ''n'' &minus; ''k'' + 1] code; in other words, it is a [[linear code|linear block code]] of length ''n'' (over ''F'') with [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]] ''k'' and minimum [[Hamming distance]] <math display=\"inline\">d_{\\min}=n-k+1.</math> The Reed\u2013Solomon code is optimal in the sense that the minimum distance has the maximum value possible for a linear code of size (''n'',&nbsp;''k''); this is known as the [[Singleton bound]]. Such a code is also called a [[MDS code|maximum distance separable (MDS) code]].\n\nThe error-correcting ability of a Reed\u2013Solomon code is determined by its minimum distance, or equivalently, by <math>n - k</math>, the measure of redundancy in the block. If the locations of the error symbols are not known in advance, then a Reed\u2013Solomon code can correct up to <math>(n-k)/2</math> erroneous symbols, i.e., it can correct half as many errors as there are redundant symbols added to the block. Sometimes error locations are known in advance (e.g., \"side information\" in [[demodulator]] [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s)\u2014these are called [[Erasure channel|erasures]]. A Reed\u2013Solomon code (like any [[Maximum distance separable code|MDS code]]) is able to correct twice as many erasures as errors, and any combination of errors and erasures can be corrected as long as the relation 2''E''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' is satisfied, where <math>E</math> is the number of errors and <math>S</math> is the number of erasures in the block.\n\n[[File:RS BER.png|400px|right|thumb| Theoretical BER performance of the Reed-Solomon code (N=255, K=233, QPSK, AWGN). Step-like characteristic.]]\n\nThe theoretical error bound can be described via the following formula for the [[Additive white Gaussian noise|AWGN]] channel for [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]]:<ref>[https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/bit-error-rate-ber.html#brck0zf Analytical Expressions Used in bercoding and BERTool]</ref>\n\n: <math>P_b \\approx \\frac{2^{m-1}}{2^m-1}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{\\ell=t+1}^n \\ell {n\\choose \\ell}P_s^\\ell(1-P_s)^{n-\\ell}</math>\n\nand for other modulation schemes:\n\n: <math>P_b \\approx \\frac{1}{m}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{\\ell=t+1}^n \\ell {n\\choose \\ell} P_s^\\ell(1-P_s)^{n-\\ell}</math>\n\nwhere <math>t = \\frac{1}{2}(d_{\\min}-1)</math>, <math>P_s = 1-(1-s)^h</math>, <math>h = \\frac{m}{\\log_2M}</math>, <math>s</math> is the symbol error rate in uncoded AWGN case and <math>M</math> is the modulation order.\n\nFor practical uses of Reed\u2013Solomon codes, it is common to use a finite field <math>F</math> with <math>2^m</math> elements. In this case, each symbol can be represented as an <math>m</math>-bit value. \nThe sender sends the data points as encoded blocks, and the number of symbols in the encoded block is <math>n = 2^m - 1</math>. Thus a Reed\u2013Solomon code operating on 8-bit symbols has <math>n = 2^8 - 1 = 255</math> symbols per block. (This is a very popular value because of the prevalence of [[byte-oriented]] computer systems.) The number <math>k</math>, with <math>k < n</math>, of ''data'' symbols in the block is a design parameter. A commonly used code encodes <math>k = 223</math> eight-bit data symbols plus 32 eight-bit parity symbols in an <math>n = 255</math>-symbol block; this is denoted as a <math>(n, k) = (255,223)</math> code, and is capable of correcting up to 16 symbol errors per block.\n\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon code properties discussed above make them especially well-suited to applications where errors occur in [[burst error|burst]]s.  This is because it does not matter to the code how many bits in a symbol are in error \u2014 if multiple bits in a symbol are corrupted it only counts as a single error.  Conversely, if a data stream is not characterized by error bursts or drop-outs but by random single bit errors, a Reed\u2013Solomon code is usually a poor choice compared to a binary code.\n\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon code, like the [[convolutional code]], is a transparent code. This means that if the channel symbols have been [[bitwise NOT|inverted]] somewhere along the line, the decoders will still operate. The result will be the inversion of the original data. However, the Reed\u2013Solomon code loses its transparency when the code is shortened. The \"missing\" bits in a shortened code need to be filled by either zeros or ones, depending on whether the data is complemented or not. (To put it another way, if the symbols are inverted, then the zero-fill needs to be inverted to a one-fill.) For this reason it is mandatory that the sense of the data (i.e., true or complemented) be resolved before Reed\u2013Solomon decoding.\n\nWhether the Reed\u2013Solomon code is [[cyclic code|cyclic]] or not depends on subtle details of the construction. In the original view of Reed and Solomon, where the codewords are the values of a polynomial, one can choose the sequence of evaluation points in such a way as to make the code cyclic. In particular, if <math>\\alpha</math> is a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] of the field <math>F</math>, then by definition all non-zero elements of <math>F</math> take the form <math>\\alpha^i</math> for  <math>i\\in\\{1,\\dots,q-1\\}</math>, where <math>q=|F|</math>.  Each polynomial <math>p</math> over <math>F</math> gives rise to a codeword <math>(p(\\alpha^1),\\dots,p(\\alpha^{q-1}))</math>. Since the function <math>a\\mapsto p(\\alpha a)</math> is also a polynomial of the same degree, this function gives rise to a codeword <math>(p(\\alpha^2),\\dots,p(\\alpha^{q}))</math>; since <math>\\alpha^{q}=\\alpha^1</math> holds, this codeword is the [[circular shift|cyclic left-shift]] of the original codeword derived from <math>p</math>. So choosing a sequence of primitive root powers as the evaluation points makes the original view Reed\u2013Solomon code [[cyclic code|cyclic]]. Reed\u2013Solomon codes in the BCH view are always cyclic because [[BCH code#Properties|BCH codes are cyclic]].\n\n===Remarks===\n\nDesigners are not required to use the \"natural\" sizes of Reed\u2013Solomon code blocks. A technique known as \"shortening\" can produce a smaller code of any desired size from a larger code. For example, the widely used (255,223) code can be converted to a (160,128) code by padding the unused portion of the source block with 95 binary zeroes and not transmitting them. At the decoder, the same portion of the block is loaded locally with binary zeroes. The Delsarte\u2013Goethals\u2013Seidel<ref>{{Citation |first=Florian |last=Pfender |first2=G\u00fcnter M. |last2=Ziegler |title=Kissing Numbers, Sphere Packings, and Some Unexpected Proofs |journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=873&ndash;883 |date=September 2004 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200408/fea-pfender.pdf |doi= }}. Explains the Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel theorem as used in the context of the error correcting code for [[compact disc]].</ref> theorem illustrates an example of an application of shortened Reed\u2013Solomon codes. In parallel to shortening, a technique known as [[puncturing]] allows omitting some of the encoded parity symbols.\n\n== Reed Solomon original view decoders ==\n\nThe decoders described in this section use the Reed Solomon original view of a codeword as a sequence of polynomial values where the polynomial is based on the message to be encoded. The same set of fixed values are used by the encoder and decoder, and the decoder recovers the encoding polynomial (and optionally an error locating polynomial) from the received message.\n\n==== Theoretical decoder ====\n\n{{Harvtxt|Reed|Solomon|1960}} described a theoretical decoder that corrected errors by finding the most popular message polynomial. The decoder only knows the set of values <math>a_1</math> to <math>a_n</math> and which encoding method was used to generate the codeword's sequence of values. The original message, the polynomial, and any errors are unknown. A decoding procedure could use a method like Lagrange interpolation on various subsets of n codeword values taken k at a time to repeatedly produce potential polynomials, until a sufficient number of matching polynomials are produced to reasonably eliminate any errors in the received codeword. Once a polynomial is determined, then any errors in the codeword can be corrected, by recalculating the corresponding codeword values. Unfortunately, in all but the simplest of cases, there are too many subsets, so the algorithm is impractical.  The number of subsets is the [[binomial coefficient]], <math>\\textstyle \\binom{n}{k} = {n! \\over (n-k)! k!}</math>, and the number of subsets is infeasible for even modest codes. For a <math>(255,249)</math> code that can correct 3 errors, the naive theoretical decoder would examine 359 billion subsets. <!-- = 255 * 254 * 253 * 252 * 251 * 250 / 720 rounded down; could say 360B -->\n\n==== Berlekamp Welch decoder ====\n\nIn 1986, a decoder known as the [[Berlekamp\u2013Welch algorithm]] was developed as a decoder that is able to recover the original message polynomial as well as an error \"locator\" polynomial that produces zeroes for the input values that correspond to errors, with time complexity O(n^3), where n is the number of values in a message. The recovered polynomial is then used to recover (recalculate as needed) the original message.\n\n===== Example =====\n\nUsing RS(7,3), GF(929), and the set of evaluation points ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''i'' \u2212 1\n\n:{{math| ''a'' {{=}} {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} }}\n\nIf the message polynomial is\n:{{math| ''p''(''x'') {{=}} 003 ''x''<sup>2</sup> + 002 ''x'' + 001}}\n\nThe codeword is\n:{{math| ''c'' {{=}} {001, 006, 017, 034, 057, 086, 121} }}\n\nErrors in transmission might cause this to be received instead.\n:{{math| ''b'' {{=}} ''c'' + ''e'' {{=}} {001, 006, 123, 456, 057, 086, 121} }}\n\nThe key equations are:\n\n:<math>b_i E(a_i) - Q(a_i) = 0 </math>\n\nAssume maximum number of errors: ''e'' = 2.

Gorenstein and N. Zierler, \"A class of cyclic linear error-correcting codes in p^m symbols,\" J. SIAM, vol. 9, pp. 207\u2013214, June 1961</ref> The Gorenstein\u2013Zierler decoder and the related work on BCH codes are described in a book ''Error Correcting Codes'' by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] (1961).<ref>''Error Correcting Codes'' by W Wesley Peterson, 1961</ref>\n\n====Formulation====\n\nThe transmitted message, <math>(c_0, \\ldots, c_i, \\ldots,c_{n-1})</math>, is viewed as the coefficients of a polynomial ''s''(''x'') that is divisible by a generator polynomial ''g''(''x'').\n:<math>s(x) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}  c_i x^i</math>\n:<math>g(x) = \\prod_{j=1}^{n-k} (x - \\alpha^j), </math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b1'' is a primitive root.\n\nSince ''s''(''x'') is a multiple of the generator ''g''(''x''), it follows that it \"inherits\" all its roots:\n:<math>s(\\alpha^j) = 0, \\ j=1,2,\\ldots,n-k</math>\n\nThe transmitted polynomial is corrupted in transit by an error polynomial ''e''(''x'') to produce the received polynomial ''r''(''x'').\n:<math>r(x) = s(x) + e(x)</math>\n:<math>e(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} e_i   x^i </math>\n\nwhere ''e<sub>i</sub>'' is the coefficient for the ''i''-th power of ''x''.  Coefficient ''e<sub>i</sub>'' will be zero if there is no error at that power of ''x'' and nonzero if there is an error.  If there are ''\u03bd'' errors at distinct powers ''i<sub>k</sub>'' of ''x'', then\n\n:<math>e(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\nu e_{i_k} x^{i_k}</math>\n\nThe goal of the decoder is to find the number of errors (''\u03bd''), the positions of the errors (''i<sub>k</sub>''), and the error values at those positions (''e<sub>i<sub>k</sub></sub>''). From those, ''e''(''x'') can be calculated and subtracted from ''r''(''x'') to get the originally sent message ''s''(''x'').\n\n====Syndrome decoding====\n\nThe decoder starts by evaluating the polynomial as received at certain points. We call the results of that evaluation the \"syndromes\", ''S''<sub>''j''</sub>. They are defined as:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nS_j &= r(\\alpha^j) = s(\\alpha^j) + e(\\alpha^j) = 0 + e(\\alpha^j) = e(\\alpha^j), \\ j=1,2,\\ldots,n-k \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{k=1}^\\nu e_{i_k} \\left( \\alpha^j \\right)^{i_k}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe advantage of looking at the syndromes is that the message polynomial drops out. In other words, the syndromes only relate to the error, and are unaffected by the actual contents of the message being transmitted. If the syndromes are all zero, the algorithm stops here and reports that the message was not corrupted in transit.\n\n====Error locators and error values====\n<!-- There's confusion between index k and the k in (n,k). Literature also has confusion? Or does it use kappa? -->\n\nFor convenience, define the '''error locators''' ''X<sub>k</sub>'' and '''error values''' ''Y<sub>k</sub>'' as:\n:<math> X_k = \\alpha^{i_k}, \\  Y_k = e_{i_k} </math>\n\nThen the syndromes can be written in terms of the error locators and error values as\n:<math>  S_j =  \\sum_{k=1}^{\\nu} Y_k X_k^{j} </math>\n\nThis definition of the syndrome values is equivalent to the previous since <math>(\\alpha^j)^{i_k} = \\alpha ^ {j*i_k} = (\\alpha^{i_k})^j = X_k^j</math>.\n\nThe syndromes give a system of ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' \u2265 2''\u03bd'' equations in 2''\u03bd'' unknowns, but that system of equations is nonlinear in the ''X<sub>k</sub>'' and does not have an obvious solution.  However, if the ''X<sub>k</sub>'' were known (see below), then the syndrome equations provide a linear system of equations that can easily be solved for the ''Y<sub>k</sub>'' error values.\n<!--\nVandermonde comment. Matrix equation -->\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nX_1^1 & X_2^1 & \\cdots & X_\\nu^1 \\\\\nX_1^2 & X_2^2 & \\cdots & X_\\nu^2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots && \\vdots \\\\\nX_1^{n-k} & X_2^{n-k} & \\cdots & X_\\nu^{n-k} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nY_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_\\nu\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nS_1 \\\\ S_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ S_{n-k}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nConsequently, the problem is finding the ''X<sub>k</sub>'', because then the leftmost matrix would be known, and both sides of the equation could be multiplied by its inverse, yielding Y''<sub>k</sub>''\n\nIn the variant of this algorithm where the locations of the errors are already known (when it is being used as an [[erasure code]]), this is the end. The error locations (''X<sub>k</sub>'') are already known by some other method (for example, in a FM transmission, the sections where the bitstream was unclear or overcome with interference are probabilistically determinable from frequency analysis). In this scenario, up to <math>n-k</math> errors can be corrected.\n\nThe rest of the algorithm serves to locate the errors, and will require syndrome values up to <math>2v</math>, instead of just the <math>v</math> used thus far. This is why 2x as many error correcting symbols need to be added as can be corrected without knowing their locations.\n\n====Error locator polynomial====\n\nThere is a linear recurrence relation that gives rise to a system of linear equations. Solving those equations identifies those error locations ''X<sub>k</sub>''.\n<!--This is credited to Daniel Gorenstein and Neal Zierler in the book Error Correcting Codes by Peterson - 1961 -->\n<!--Petersons decoder is a simplified implementation for bit oriented BCH codes where the error values only have magnitude one. -->\n\nDefine the '''error locator polynomial''' \u039b(''x'') as\n\n:<math>\\Lambda(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^\\nu (1 - x X_k ) = 1 + \\Lambda_1 x^1 + \\Lambda_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\Lambda_\\nu x^\\nu</math>\n\nThe zeros of \u039b(''x'') are the reciprocals <math>X_k^{-1}</math>. This follows from the above product notation construction since if <math>x=X_k^{-1}</math> then one of the multiplied terms will be zero <math>(1 - X_k^{-1} \\cdot X_k) = 1 - 1 = 0</math>, making the whole polynomial evaluate to zero.\n:<math> \\Lambda(X_k^{-1}) = 0 </math>\n\nLet <math>j</math> be any number such that <math>1 \\leq j \\leq v</math>. Multiply both sides by <math>Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu}</math> and it will still be zero. \n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} \\Lambda(X_k^{-1}) = 0. \\\\\n& Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} (1 + \\Lambda_1 X_k^{-1} + \\Lambda_2 X_k^{-2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_\\nu X_k^{-\\nu}) = 0. \\\\ \n& Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} + \\Lambda_1 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} X_k^{-1} + \\Lambda_2 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} X_k^{-2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_\\nu Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} X_k^{-\\nu} = 0. \\\\\n& Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} + \\Lambda_1 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu-1} + \\Lambda_2 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu -2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_{\\nu} Y_k X_k^j = 0. \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSum for ''k'' = 1 to ''\u03bd''\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\sum_{k=1}^\\nu ( Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} + \\Lambda_1 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu-1} + \\Lambda_2 Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu -2} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_{\\nu} Y_k X_k^{j} ) = 0  \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nCollect each term into its own sum, and extract the constant values of <math>\\Lambda</math> that are unaffected by the summation\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\nu  Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu} \\right) + \\Lambda_1 \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\nu Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu-1}\\right) + \\Lambda_2 \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\nu Y_k X_k^{j+\\nu -2}\\right) + \\cdots + \\Lambda_\\nu \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^\\nu Y_k X_k^j \\right) = 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese summations are now equivalent to the syndrome values, which we know and can substitute in! This therefore reduces to\n\n:<math> S_{j + \\nu} + \\Lambda_1 S_{j+\\nu-1} + \\cdots + \\Lambda_{\\nu-1} S_{j+1} + \\Lambda_{\\nu} S_j   = 0 \\, </math>\n\nSubtracting <math>S_{j+\\nu}</math> from both sides yields\n\n:<math> S_j \\Lambda_{\\nu} + S_{j+1}\\Lambda_{\\nu-1} + \\cdots + S_{j+\\nu-1} \\Lambda_1 = - S_{j + \\nu} \\ </math>\n\nRecall that ''j'' was chosen to be any integer between 1 and ''v'' inclusive, and this equivalence is true for any and all such values. Therefore, we have ''v'' linear equations, not just one. This system of linear equations can therefore be solved for the coefficients \u039b<sub>''i''</sub> of the error location polynomial:\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nS_1 & S_2 & \\cdots & S_{\\nu} \\\\\nS_2 & S_3 & \\cdots & S_{\\nu+1} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots && \\vdots \\\\\nS_{\\nu} & S_{\\nu+1} & \\cdots & S_{2\\nu-1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\Lambda_{\\nu} \\\\ \\Lambda_{\\nu-1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\Lambda_1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n- S_{\\nu+1} \\\\ - S_{\\nu+2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ - S_{\\nu+\\nu}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nThe above assumes the decoder knows the number of errors ''\u03bd'', but that number has not been determined yet. The PGZ decoder does not determine ''\u03bd'' directly but rather searches for it by trying successive values. The decoder first assumes the largest value for a trial ''\u03bd'' and sets up the linear system for that value. If the equations can be solved (i.e., the matrix determinant is nonzero), then that trial value is the number of errors. If the linear system cannot be solved, then the trial ''\u03bd'' is reduced by one and the next smaller system is examined. {{Harv|Gill|n.d.|p=35}}\n\n====Obtain the error locators from the error locator polynomial====\n\nUse the coefficients \u039b<sub>''i''</sub> found in the last step to build the error location polynomial. The roots of the error location polynomial can be found by exhaustive search. The error locators ''X<sub>k</sub>'' are the reciprocals of those roots. The order of coefficients of the error location polynomial can be reversed, in which case the roots of that reversed polynomial are the error locators <math>X_k</math> (not their reciprocals <math>X_k^{-1}</math>). [[Chien search]] is an efficient implementation of this step.\n\n====Calculate the error values====\n\nOnce the error locators ''X<sub>k</sub>'' are known, the error values can be determined.

Costello Jr, \"Error Control Coding\" second edition, pp. 255\u2013262, 1982, 2004</ref>  To avoid conflict with syndrome names, let ''c''(''x'') = ''s''(''x'') the encoded codeword. ''r''(''x'') and ''e''(''x'') are the same as above. Define ''C''(''x''), ''E''(''x''), and ''R''(''x'') as the discrete Fourier transforms of ''c''(''x''), ''e''(''x''), and ''r''(''x''). Since ''r''(''x'') = ''c''(''x'') + ''e''(''x''), and since a discrete Fourier transform is a linear operator, ''R''(''x'') = ''C''(''x'') + ''E''(''x'').\n\nTransform ''r''(''x'') to ''R''(''x'') using discrete Fourier transform. Since the calculation for a discrete Fourier transform is the same as the calculation for syndromes, ''t'' coefficients of ''R''(''x'') and ''E''(''x'') are the same as the syndromes:\n\n:<math>R_j = E_j = S_j = r(\\alpha^j)</math>\n:<math>\\text{for } 1 \\le j \\le t</math>\n\nUse <math>R_1</math> through <math>R_t</math> as syndromes (they're the same) and generate the error locator polynomial using the methods from any of the above decoders.\n\nLet v = number of errors.

The distance ''d'' was usually understood to limit the error-correction capability to \u230a''d''/2\u230b. The Reed\u2013Solomon code achieves this bound with equality, and can thus correct up to \u230a(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2\u230b errors. However, this error-correction bound is not exact.\n\nIn 1999, [[Madhu Sudan]] and [[Venkatesan Guruswami]] at MIT published \"Improved Decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon and Algebraic-Geometry Codes\" introducing an algorithm that allowed for the correction of errors beyond half the minimum distance of the code.<ref>{{Citation |first=V. |last=Guruswami |first2=M. |last2=Sudan |title=Improved decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon codes and algebraic geometry codes |journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1757&ndash;1767 |date=September 1999 |doi=10.1109/18.782097 |citeseerx=10.1.1.115.292 }}</ref> It applies to Reed\u2013Solomon codes and more generally to [[algebraic geometric code]]s.

For example, a decoder could associate with each symbol an additional value corresponding to the channel [[demodulator]]'s confidence in the correctness of the symbol. The advent of [[low-density parity-check code|LDPC]] and [[turbo code]]s, which employ iterated [[soft-decision decoding|soft-decision]] belief propagation decoding methods to achieve error-correction performance close to the [[Shannon limit|theoretical limit]], has spurred interest in applying soft-decision decoding to conventional algebraic codes.

He competed on the [[ATP Tour]] from 1996 to 2017. After breaking into the world top 100 in 1997, and reaching a career-high singles ranking of world No. 2 in May 2002, his career was interrupted by injuries: Haas twice dropped out of the world rankings due to being unable to play for twelve months.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/729898-tommy-haas-renaissance-man Tommy Haas: Renaissance Man] Bleacher Report. 9 June 2011. Accessed 18 October 2011.</ref> His first period of injury saw him miss the whole of the [[2003 ATP Tour|2003 season]], and he did not return to the world's top 10 until 2007. He also missed over a year's tennis between February 2010 and June 2011, but afterwards returned to play on the tour. He returned to world No. 11 in 2013, after reaching the quarterfinals at the [[2013 French Open \u2013 Men's Singles|French Open]] for the first time in his career.\n\nHaas reached the semifinals of the [[Australian Open]] three times, and in [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] once. He reached the quarterfinal stage of each of the Grand Slam events. He won 15 career titles in singles, including one [[ATP Masters|Masters tournament]] (Stuttgart) in 2001, and has a silver medal from the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles|2000 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Hamburg]], Germany to Brigitte and Peter Haas,<ref name=\"atpworldtour.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Tommy-Haas.aspx|title=Tommy Haas \u2013 Overview \u2013 ATP World Tour \u2013 Tennis|work=ATP World Tour}}</ref> Tommy started playing his own version of tennis when he was four years old,<ref>http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=10009389</ref> using a wooden plank to hit balls against the wall or into his father's hands. When his father observed his talents, he started bringing Haas to work, as he was a tennis coach.\n\nAt five, Haas won his first youth tournament, in Hamburg. At eight, he won his second, in [[Munich]]. Between 11 and 13, Haas twice won the Austrian Championship, the German Championship, and the European Championship. Haas is also a good friend of Swiss great Roger Federate.\n\nHaas's talents were noted by tennis guru [[Nick Bollettieri]]. He was so impressed by the young German's talent that he offered Haas the chance to stay and train at his Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Florida for free, and Haas began attending at age 11.<ref name=\"atpworldtour.com\"/> At 13, speaking little English, Haas moved full-time to Florida to train at the academy.<ref name=\"atpworldtour.com\"/>\n\n==Tennis career==\n===Juniors===\nAs a junior Haas reached as high as No. 11 in the junior world singles rankings in 1995 (and No. 5 in doubles).\n\n===1996\u20132000: World Team Cup champion, first title, Grand Slam Cup final, Olympic Silver===\nIn 1996, Haas became a professional tennis player. He played his first Grand Slam tournament at the US Open, losing in the first round to compatriot [[Michael Stich]] in four sets. He gained attention as a future star when he won his first [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] title in 1999, made it to the semifinals of the Australian Open, and was a finalist in the [[Grand Slam Cup]]. The following year, he won a silver medal at the [[Sydney Olympics]] defeating [[Wayne Ferreira]], [[Andreas Vinciguerra]], [[\u00c0lex Corretja]], [[Max Mirnyi]] and [[Roger Federer]] en route to the gold medal match where he lost to [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]]. He also beat [[Andre Agassi]] at the [[1998 Wimbledon Championships]] in the second round.\n\n===2001\u20132005: World No. 2, Masters champion, second World Team Cup victory and injuries===\n[[File:Tommy Haas serves.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Haas at the public training for the [[World Team Cup]] in D\u00fcsseldorf, 2005]]\n\nIn 2001, he won four ATP titles, including his first Masters shield, finishing 2001 as world No. 8 and only missing out on playing in the season-ending [[ATP World Tour Finals|Masters Cup]] because of [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]]'s [[2001 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|Wimbledon]] victory, which meant Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 took the eighth and final spot.  In the 2002 Australian Open, he won in five sets against [[Todd Martin]] and Roger Federer, and in four against [[Marcelo Rios]] to reach the semifinals. He led Marat Safin two sets to one but suffered from a stiff shoulder after a rain delay, and Safin won the match, taking the final two sets 6\u20130, 6\u20132. Haas was quickly rising to the top of the tennis ranks when his career was suddenly halted at No. 2 in the world by a severe accident that nearly claimed the lives of his parents, leaving his father in a coma. Haas spent much of 2002 taking care of his family. At the end of this lay-off, he injured his shoulder, requiring a major operation. He was plagued by further injuries and related complications afterwards and did not return to professional tennis fully until 2004. Before his parents' accident and his injuries, he had a winning record against several former and future No. 1 ranked players: 3\u20130 against [[Andy Roddick]], 2\u20131 against Roger Federer, 2\u20131 against [[Marat Safin]], and 2\u20130 against [[Jim Courier]], as well as 5\u20135 against [[Pete Sampras]]. Haas won two more ATP titles in his return year of 2004, while trying to gain back his form.\n\n===2006: Three titles, second US Open quarterfinal===\n[[File:Tommy Haas serves2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Haas at the 2006 Cincinnati Masters]]\nIn 2006, Haas won three ATP Tournaments and reached the quarterfinals at the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], where he was knocked out by [[Nikolay Davydenko]] after having been up two sets. Haas began having severe cramps in his legs in the third set. During the match he was visibly disturbed, repeatedly hitting his legs with his racquet, frustrated at the cramps.\n\nAt the end of the year, he had to win the Paris Masters to qualify for the [[Masters Cup]], the ATP year-end final. He lost after a semifinal run to [[Dominik Hrbat\u00fd]] with health problems and did not play again for the rest of the year.\n\n===2007: Australian Open and Davis Cup semifinals, back to top 10===\nIn 2007, Haas, with his long hair now cut short, had battled his way to his third Australian Open semifinal, which included matches against [[David Nalbandian]] and a five-set quarterfinal rematch against Nikolay Davydenko. He lost his semifinal match against first-time [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] finalist [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez]] from Chile in straight sets. Despite this loss, Haas returned to the top 10 of the world rankings for the first time since 2002.\n\nOn 25 February, at the [[Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup|Regions Morgan Keegan Championships]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Haas stopped Andy Roddick's quest for the final, winning in two sets. This was the first time Haas had won a title without facing a single break point in any of his matches, as well as the first time he had won titles in consecutive seasons. Haas also became only the second player to win three titles at Memphis, the other being [[Jimmy Connors]], who won in 1979, 1983, and 1984.\n\nHaas reached the quarterfinals of the [[Pacific Life Open]], an [[ATP Masters Series]] tournament held in Indian Wells, California, where he lost to [[Andy Murray]] in a third-set tiebreaker. In the 2007 ATP Champion's Race, Haas, the 13th seed (10th-ranked), not known for being much of a grass court player, advanced to the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time, defeating [[Zack Fleishman]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Z\u00edb]], and No. 21 seed [[Dmitry Tursunov]]. His run came to an end after he suffered a torn abdominal muscle and had to withdraw a day before playing Roger Federer.\n\nAt the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Haas equaled his best result in New York by reaching the quarterfinals with five-set wins over [[S\u00e9bastien Grosjean]] and [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]]. He beat Blake in a fifth-set tiebreak, saving match points. His run ended, however, with a three-set loss to Nikolay Davydenko.\n\n===2008\u20132009: Injuries, Wimbledon semifinal, return to top 20===\nIn the first half of 2008, Haas was derailed by injuries, causing him to miss both the Australian Open and the French Open. This dropped him significantly in the rankings, as he was unable to back up his semifinal performance at the Australian Open the year before. He made it to the quarterfinals of the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, defeating Andy Murray in three sets. He was then forced to withdraw from his quarterfinal match against Roger Federer due to injury.\n\nHe reached the third round at Wimbledon with a four-set win over [[Guillermo Ca\u00f1as]] and a straight-set win over 23rd seed [[Tommy Robredo]]. He then fell to Andy Murray in four sets.\n\nIn the hard-court season, he got to the semifinals of the [[Legg Mason Tennis Classic]] in Washington, D.C., but lost to [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]]. At the Rogers Cup in Toronto, he beat former world No. 1 [[Carlos Moy\u00e0]], and then lost to Nikolay Davydenko in the second round. At the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], he beat 12th seed [[Richard Gasquet]] in five sets. He then fell to [[Gilles M\u00fcller]] of Luxembourg in five sets, despite cruising in the first two sets.\n\nAt the beginning of the new season, Haas pulled out of the [[Qatar ExxonMobil Open]] due to elbow problems. However, he appeared in the Kooyong Exhibition game, where he beat [[Mardy Fish]].\n\nAt the [[2009 Australian Open]], Haas beat [[Eduardo Schwank]] in the first round and [[Flavio Cipolla]] in the second. In the third round, he fell to the tournament's first seed and eventual champion [[Rafael Nadal]].\n\nAt the [[SAP Open]] in San Jose, California, he joined forces with Czech [[Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]] to clinch his first doubles title, after losing in the singles quarterfinals to defending champion Andy Roddick.\n\nHaas lost in the first round in both Memphis and Delray Beach. He did not succeed in defending his quarterfinal points at the [[BNP Paribas Open]] in Indian Wells, as he fell to [[Novak Djokovic]] in the third round, after defeating [[\u00d3scar Hern\u00e1ndez (tennis)|\u00d3scar Hern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Rainer Sch\u00fcttler]]. He suffered another failure in the Miami Masters, losing to [[Mikhail Kukushkin]].\n\nIn Houston, Texas, at the River Oaks Men's Clay Championship, Haas was defeated by [[Bj\u00f6rn Phau]] in the quarterfinals, after he defeated defending champion [[Marcel Granollers]] in the second round.\n\nAs a qualifier in [[2009 Mutua Madrile\u00f1a Madrid Open|Madrid]], he defeated [[Ernests Gulbis]], before losing to Andy Roddick.\n\nAt the [[2009 French Open|French Open]], Haas matched his best result since 2002. He defeated [[Andrei Pavel]] in straight sets, and then won a five-setter against [[Leonardo Mayer]]. After defeating [[J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy]] in the third round, Haas was narrowly defeated by the former world No. 1 and eventual champion, Roger Federer, in the fourth round. At a crucial stage in the third set, Haas was only five points away from his biggest win on clay, but was unable to convert a break point that would have seen him serve for the match at 5\u20133.

\u02c8ha\u02d0s}}; born 3 April 1978) is a [[Germans|German]] former professional [[tennis]] player. He competed on the [[ATP Tour]] from 1996 to 2017. After breaking into the world top 100 in 1997, and reaching a career-high singles ranking of world No. 2 in May 2002, his career was interrupted by injuries: Haas twice dropped out of the world rankings due to being unable to play for twelve months.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/729898-tommy-haas-renaissance-man Tommy Haas: Renaissance Man] Bleacher Report. 9 June 2011. Accessed 18 October 2011.</ref> His first period of injury saw him miss the whole of the [[2003 ATP Tour|2003 season]], and he did not return to the world's top 10 until 2007. He also missed over a year's tennis between February 2010 and June 2011, but afterwards returned to play on the tour. He returned to world No. 11 in 2013, after reaching the quarterfinals at the [[2013 French Open \u2013 Men's Singles|French Open]] for the first time in his career.\n\nHaas reached the semifinals of the [[Australian Open]] three times, and in [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] once. He reached the quarterfinal stage of each of the Grand Slam events. He won 15 career titles in singles, including one [[ATP Masters|Masters tournament]] (Stuttgart) in 2001, and has a silver medal from the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles|2000 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Hamburg]], Germany to Brigitte and Peter Haas,<ref name=\"atpworldtour.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Tommy-Haas.aspx|title=Tommy Haas \u2013 Overview \u2013 ATP World Tour \u2013 Tennis|work=ATP World Tour}}</ref> Tommy started playing his own version of tennis when he was four years old,<ref>http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=10009389</ref> using a wooden plank to hit balls against the wall or into his father's hands. When his father observed his talents, he started bringing Haas to work, as he was a tennis coach.\n\nAt five, Haas won his first youth tournament, in Hamburg. At eight, he won his second, in [[Munich]]. Between 11 and 13, Haas twice won the Austrian Championship, the German Championship, and the European Championship. Haas is also a good friend of Swiss great Roger Federer.\n\nHaas's talents were noted by tennis guru [[Nick Bollettieri]]. He was so impressed by the young German's talent that he offered Haas the chance to stay and train at his Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Florida for free, and Haas began attending at age 11.<ref name=\"atpworldtour.com\"/> At 13, speaking little English, Haas moved full-time to Florida to train at the academy.<ref name=\"atpworldtour.com\"/>\n\n==Tennis career==\n===Juniors===\nAs a junior Haas reached as high as No. 11 in the junior world singles rankings in 1995 (and No. 5 in doubles).\n\n===1996\u20132000: World Team Cup champion, first title, Grand Slam Cup final, Olympic Silver===\nIn 1996, Haas became a professional tennis player. He played his first Grand Slam tournament at the US Open, losing in the first round to compatriot [[Michael Stich]] in four sets. He gained attention as a future star when he won his first [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] title in 1999, made it to the semifinals of the Australian Open, and was a finalist in the [[Grand Slam Cup]]. The following year, he won a silver medal at the [[Sydney Olympics]] defeating [[Wayne Ferreira]], [[Andreas Vinciguerra]], [[\u00c0lex Corretja]], [[Max Mirnyi]] and [[Roger Federer]] en route to the gold medal match where he lost to [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]]. He also beat [[Andre Agassi]] at the [[1998 Wimbledon Championships]] in the second round.\n\n===2001\u20132005: World No. 2, Masters champion, second World Team Cup victory and injuries===\n[[File:Tommy Haas serves.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Haas at the public training for the [[World Team Cup]] in D\u00fcsseldorf, 2005]]\n\nIn 2001, he won four ATP titles, including his first Masters shield, finishing 2001 as world No. 8 and only missing out on playing in the season-ending [[ATP World Tour Finals|Masters Cup]] because of [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]]'s [[2001 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|Wimbledon]] victory, which meant Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 took the eighth and final spot.  In the 2002 Australian Open, he won in five sets against [[Todd Martin]] and Roger Federer, and in four against [[Marcelo Rios]] to reach the semifinals. He led Marat Safin two sets to one but suffered from a stiff shoulder after a rain delay, and Safin won the match, taking the final two sets 6\u20130, 6\u20132. Haas was quickly rising to the top of the tennis ranks when his career was suddenly halted at No. 2 in the world by a severe accident that nearly claimed the lives of his parents, leaving his father in a coma. Haas spent much of 2002 taking care of his family. At the end of this lay-off, he injured his shoulder, requiring a major operation. He was plagued by further injuries and related complications afterwards and did not return to professional tennis fully until 2004. Before his parents' accident and his injuries, he had a winning record against several former and future No. 1 ranked players: 3\u20130 against [[Andy Roddick]], 2\u20131 against Roger Federer, 2\u20131 against [[Marat Safin]], and 2\u20130 against [[Jim Courier]], as well as 5\u20135 against [[Pete Sampras]]. Haas won two more ATP titles in his return year of 2004, while trying to gain back his form.\n\n===2006: Three titles, second US Open quarterfinal===\n[[File:Tommy Haas serves2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Haas at the 2006 Cincinnati Masters]]\nIn 2006, Haas won three ATP Tournaments and reached the quarterfinals at the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], where he was knocked out by [[Nikolay Davydenko]] after having been up two sets. Haas began having severe cramps in his legs in the third set. During the match he was visibly disturbed, repeatedly hitting his legs with his racquet, frustrated at the cramps.\n\nAt the end of the year, he had to win the Paris Masters to qualify for the [[Masters Cup]], the ATP year-end final. He lost after a semifinal run to [[Dominik Hrbat\u00fd]] with health problems and did not play again for the rest of the year.\n\n===2007: Australian Open and Davis Cup semifinals, back to top 10===\nIn 2007, Haas, with his long hair now cut short, had battled his way to his third Australian Open semifinal, which included matches against [[David Nalbandian]] and a five-set quarterfinal rematch against Nikolay Davydenko. He lost his semifinal match against first-time [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] finalist [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez]] from Chile in straight sets. Despite this loss, Haas returned to the top 10 of the world rankings for the first time since 2002.\n\nOn 25 February, at the [[Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup|Regions Morgan Keegan Championships]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Haas stopped Andy Roddick's quest for the final, winning in two sets. This was the first time Haas had won a title without facing a single break point in any of his matches, as well as the first time he had won titles in consecutive seasons. Haas also became only the second player to win three titles at Memphis, the other being [[Jimmy Connors]], who won in 1979, 1983, and 1984.\n\nHaas reached the quarterfinals of the [[Pacific Life Open]], an [[ATP Masters Series]] tournament held in Indian Wells, California, where he lost to [[Andy Murray]] in a third-set tiebreaker. In the 2007 ATP Champion's Race, Haas, the 13th seed (10th-ranked), not known for being much of a grass court player, advanced to the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time, defeating [[Zack Fleishman]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Z\u00edb]], and No. 21 seed [[Dmitry Tursunov]]. His run came to an end after he suffered a torn abdominal muscle and had to withdraw a day before playing Roger Federer.\n\nAt the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Haas equaled his best result in New York by reaching the quarterfinals with five-set wins over [[S\u00e9bastien Grosjean]] and [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]]. He beat Blake in a fifth-set tiebreak, saving match points. His run ended, however, with a three-set loss to Nikolay Davydenko.\n\n===2008\u20132009: Injuries, Wimbledon semifinal, return to top 20===\nIn the first half of 2008, Haas was derailed by injuries, causing him to miss both the Australian Open and the French Open. This dropped him significantly in the rankings, as he was unable to back up his semifinal performance at the Australian Open the year before. He made it to the quarterfinals of the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, defeating Andy Murray in three sets. He was then forced to withdraw from his quarterfinal match against Roger Federer due to injury.\n\nHe reached the third round at Wimbledon with a four-set win over [[Guillermo Ca\u00f1as]] and a straight-set win over 23rd seed [[Tommy Robredo]]. He then fell to Andy Murray in four sets.\n\nIn the hard-court season, he got to the semifinals of the [[Legg Mason Tennis Classic]] in Washington, D.C., but lost to [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]]. At the Rogers Cup in Toronto, he beat former world No. 1 [[Carlos Moy\u00e0]], and then lost to Nikolay Davydenko in the second round. At the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], he beat 12th seed [[Richard Gasquet]] in five sets. He then fell to [[Gilles M\u00fcller]] of Luxembourg in five sets, despite cruising in the first two sets.\n\nAt the beginning of the new season, Haas pulled out of the [[Qatar ExxonMobil Open]] due to elbow problems. However, he appeared in the Kooyong Exhibition game, where he beat [[Mardy Fish]].\n\nAt the [[2009 Australian Open]], Haas beat [[Eduardo Schwank]] in the first round and [[Flavio Cipolla]] in the second. In the third round, he fell to the tournament's first seed and eventual champion [[Rafael Nadal]].\n\nAt the [[SAP Open]] in San Jose, California, he joined forces with Czech [[Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]] to clinch his first doubles title, after losing in the singles quarterfinals to defending champion Andy Roddick.\n\nHaas lost in the first round in both Memphis and Delray Beach. He did not succeed in defending his quarterfinal points at the [[BNP Paribas Open]] in Indian Wells, as he fell to [[Novak Djokovic]] in the third round, after defeating [[\u00d3scar Hern\u00e1ndez (tennis)|\u00d3scar Hern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Rainer Sch\u00fcttler]]. He suffered another failure in the Miami Masters, losing to [[Mikhail Kukushkin]].\n\nIn Houston, Texas, at the River Oaks Men's Clay Championship, Haas was defeated by [[Bj\u00f6rn Phau]] in the quarterfinals, after he defeated defending champion [[Marcel Granollers]] in the second round.\n\nAs a qualifier in [[2009 Mutua Madrile\u00f1a Madrid Open|Madrid]], he defeated [[Ernests Gulbis]], before losing to Andy Roddick.\n\nAt the [[2009 French Open|French Open]], Haas matched his best result since 2002. He defeated [[Andrei Pavel]] in straight sets, and then won a five-setter against [[Leonardo Mayer]]. After defeating [[J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy]] in the third round, Haas was narrowly defeated by the former world No. 1 and eventual champion, Roger Federer, in the fourth round. At a crucial stage in the third set, Haas was only five points away from his biggest win on clay, but was unable to convert a break point that would have seen him serve for the match at 5\u20133. Federer hit a vital winner to level the score at 4\u20134, en route to a comeback victory 6\u20137<sup>(4)</sup>, 5\u20137, 6\u20134, 6\u20130, 6\u20132.\n\nAt the [[Gerry Weber Open]], Haas won his first title on grass in his 21st [[ATP World Tour]] final. In the process, he defeated fourth seed [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]] in the second round, [[Mischa Zverev]] in the quarterfinals, and [[Philipp Kohlschreiber]] in the semifinals. He defeated the tournament's second seed [[Novak Djokovic]], in the final.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/8099645.stm|title=Haas beats Djokovic to win title|date=14 June 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nThis victory made Haas one of a small group of players to have won ATP titles on all three major surfaces (grass, clay, and hard courts.) With Haas' success at this tournament and at the French Open, his ranking rose to no. 35.\n\nAt [[2009 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Haas won a five-set match against [[Marin \u010cili\u0107]]. Haas was up two sets to love and had match points in the fourth set, then had to save two match points serving at 5\u20136 before the match was suspended due to darkness after over four hours of play, at 6\u20136 in the fifth. The next day, Haas broke Cilic at 8\u20138 and eventually held on to win. Haas then comfortably defeated [[Igor Andreev]] to reach the quarterfinals. There, he defeated Novak Djokovic for the second time in three weeks to reach the semifinals at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for the first time in his career, where he faced Roger Federer in a rematch of their encounter in Paris. Haas lost, ensuring Federer's historic seventh Wimbledon final. This success at Wimbledon made Haas rise considerably in ATP ranking, reaching No. 19.\n\nHaas continued his late career resurgence by making it to the semifinals at the [[LA Tennis Open]], defeating [[Marat Safin]] in the quarterfinals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gototennisblog.com/2009/08/01/tommy-haas-sees-the-light-thinks-marat-safin-could-too/|title=Haas beats Safin at LA Open quarters|date=31 July 2009|work=GOTOTENNIS|accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref> before losing to [[Sam Querrey]]. He made it to the third round at the [[2009 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|US Open]], losing narrowly to [[Fernando Verdasco]], after being up a break in each set.\n\n===2010\u20132011: Continued injuries and absence ===\nFollowing his comeback, however, Haas suffered from another bout of injury. He made the third round of the [[2010 Australian Open]], defeating [[Simon Greul]] and [[Janko Tipsarevi\u0107]], but did not play after February 2010, spending time recovering from right hip and right shoulder surgeries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gainey|first=Tom|title=Tommy Haas Undergoes Hip Surgery, Out Indefinitely|url=http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2010-03-02/3436.php|publisher=TennisX|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref> He missed the rest of the 2010 season and once more dropped out of the ATP rankings.

He also went down in the first round at Wimbledon, but reached the third round of the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], losing to [[Juan M\u00f3naco]] in four sets. Other than Grand Slams, he played little tennis, competing in only ten other tournaments, mainly in July, August, and October.\n\n===2012: 13th title, second ATP Comeback Player of the Year award===\n[[File:Haas 12 US Open.JPG|thumb|Tommy Haas at the 2012 US Open]]\nHaas began the 2012 season at the [[2012 Brisbane International \u2013 Men's Singles|Brisbane International]], but had to withdraw in the second round.<ref>{{cite news|title=Injured Haas in doubt for Australian Open|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/injured-haas-in-doubt-for-australian-open-20120104-1pkhr.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 January 2012|date=4 January 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, he competed more regularly in 2012 than in previous seasons.

Nick Bollettieri noted Haas as having \"one of the greatest backhands in the world,\" praising its versatility and power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisplayer.net/public/tour_strokes/nick_bollettieri/nick_bollet_haas_backhand_images/nick_bollet_haas_backhand.html|title=Tommy Haas: The World's Best Backhand?|last=Bollettieri|first=Nick|work=Tennisplayer.net}}</ref> Haas also possessed a powerful slice backhand, which he used to disrupt the rhythm of the point and to construct offensive positions. He also possessed a strong serve and a functional set of volleys.\n\nHaas was known for his refined footwork and racquet skills, both of which he used to construct quick defensive-to-offensive transitions. He was widely considered as one of the best players to have never won a grand slam, having been restricted by numerous injuries. Reviewers described him as having nice \"fluidity\" and how his game overall allows him to adapt to most situations, as demonstrated by his equal win percentage over both right and left-handed players, as well as his relatively even win percentages on all surfaces. Haas' mental game was described as solid, boasting a positive win record in deciding sets (3rd or 5th).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 27 January 2010, Haas became a United States citizen, but continued to represent Germany in tennis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/02/Haas-Receives-US-Citizenship.aspx|title=German Haas Receives US Citizenship|work=ATP|date=4 February 2010|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206193731/http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/02/Haas-Receives-US-Citizenship.aspx|archivedate=6 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHaas married actress [[Sara Foster]] in 2010.

But I think he loves the action and he is so passionate that he rushes in without thinking. George is very exciting as a new character. He's passionate and he loves his job.

George is the first officer on the scene, but the paramedics are already there. He has to try to understand what's going on very quickly. George takes control of the situation immediately. It's a really nice way to be introduced, showing him as someone who's trustworthy and who can take control of a dangerous situation. I think there'll be a lot of those, over the course of the next year.\nSo far my scenes have been with the teachers at the school. I have shared scenes with Nancy, Sally, John Paul, and then a few of the worried parents as well. I've also been with DS Cohen a few times. She's my boss and she's very good at her job, so George is keen to impress! You'll see that George is a police officer for the right reasons and his heart is in it.

George is the first officer on the scene, but the paramedics are already there. He has to try to understand what's going on very quickly. George takes control of the situation immediately. It's a really nice way to be introduced, showing him as someone who's trustworthy and who can take control of a dangerous situation. I think there'll be a lot of those, over the course of the next year.\nSo far my scenes have been with the teachers at the school. I have shared scenes with Nancy, Sally, John Paul, and then a few of the worried parents as well. I've also been with DS Cohen a few times. She's my boss and she's very good at her job, so George is keen to impress! You'll see that George is a police officer for the right reasons and his heart is in it.

It's said that is the place where Arthur was taken to his final rest after fighting Mordred. Avalon was associated from an early date with mystical practices and figures such as [[Morgan le Fay]]. It is traditionally identified as the former island of [[Glastonbury Tor]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] referred to it in [[Latin]] as  ''Insula Avallonis'' in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (c. 1136). In the later ''[[Vita Merlini]]'' (c. 1150) he called it ''Insula Pomorum'' the \"isle of fruit trees\" (from Latin ''p\u014dmus'' \"fruit tree\"). The name is generally considered to be of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] origin (though an [[Cornish Language|Old Cornish]] or [[Breton language|Old Breton]] origin is also possible), derived from [[Old Welsh]], [[Old Cornish]], or [[Old Breton]] ''aball'' or ''avallen(n)'', \"apple tree, fruit tree\" (cf. ''afal'' in [[Modern Welsh]], derived from [[Common Celtic]] *''abaln\u0101'', literally \"fruit-bearing (thing)\").<ref>Matasovi\u0107, Ranko, ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'', Brill, 2008, p. 23.</ref><ref name=\"Koch, John 2006, p. 146\">Koch, John.

At a depth of 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;feet) the monks were said to have discovered a massive [[treetrunk coffin]] and a lead cross bearing the inscription:\n\n[[File:Glastonbury cross-camden-1607edition-p166.jpg|thumb|upright|Lead cross inscribed with Arthur's epitaph, published in [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (1607)]]\n\n{{quote|''Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arturius in insula Avalonia.'' <br />(\"Here lies entombed the renowned king Arthur in the island of Avalon.\")}}\n\nAccounts of the exact inscription vary, with five different versions existing.

His transcript reads: \"Here lies buried the famous ''Arthurus'' with ''Wenneveria'' his second wife in the isle of Avalon.\" Inside the coffin were two bodies, whom Giraldus refers to as Arthur and \"his queen\"; the bones of the male body were described as being gigantic.

He too advanced to the neighbourhood of Burgundy. He too was betrayed by a deputy ruler who treated with barbarian enemies. He, too, is last located in Gaul among the pro-Roman Burgundians. He, too, disappears after a fatal battle, without any recorded death.

It first appears in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 1136  ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (\"The History of the Kings of Britain\") as the place where [[King Arthur]]'s sword [[Excalibur]] was forged and later where Arthur was taken to recover from his wounds after the [[Battle of Camlann]].

It is traditionally identified as the former island of [[Glastonbury Tor]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] referred to it in [[Latin]] as  ''Insula Avallonis'' in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (c. 1136). In the later ''[[Vita Merlini]]'' (c. 1150) he called it ''Insula Pomorum'' the \"isle of fruit trees\" (from Latin ''p\u014dmus'' \"fruit tree\"). The name is generally considered to be of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] origin (though an [[Cornish Language|Old Cornish]] or [[Breton language|Old Breton]] origin is also possible), derived from [[Old Welsh]], [[Old Cornish]], or [[Old Breton]] ''aball'' or ''avallen(n)'', \"apple tree, fruit tree\" (cf. ''afal'' in [[Modern Welsh]], derived from [[Common Celtic]] *''abaln\u0101'', literally \"fruit-bearing (thing)\").<ref>Matasovi\u0107, Ranko, ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'', Brill, 2008, p. 23.</ref><ref name=\"Koch, John 2006, p. 146\">Koch, John.

Years ago the district had also been called ''Ynys Gutrin'' in Welsh, that is the Island of Glass, and from these words the invading Saxons later coined the place-name \"Glastingebury\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/debarri.html|title=Two Accounts of the Exhumation of Arthur's Body: Gerald of Wales|work=britannia.com|accessdate=1 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003182610/http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/debarri.html|archive-date=3 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\nAround 1190, monks at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] claimed to have discovered the bones of Arthur and his wife Guinevere. The discovery of the burial is described by chroniclers, notably Gerald, as being just after King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s reign when the new abbot of Glastonbury, [[Henry de Sully (died 1195)|Henry de Sully]], commissioned a search of the abbey grounds. At a depth of 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;feet) the monks were said to have discovered a massive [[treetrunk coffin]] and a lead cross bearing the inscription:\n\n[[File:Glastonbury cross-camden-1607edition-p166.jpg|thumb|upright|Lead cross inscribed with Arthur's epitaph, published in [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (1607)]]\n\n{{quote|''Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arturius in insula Avalonia.'' <br />(\"Here lies entombed the renowned king Arthur in the island of Avalon.\")}}\n\nAccounts of the exact inscription vary, with five different versions existing. The earliest is by Gerald in ''Liber de Principis instructione'' c.&nbsp;1193, who wrote that he viewed the cross in person and traced the lettering. His transcript reads: \"Here lies buried the famous ''Arthurus'' with ''Wenneveria'' his second wife in the isle of Avalon.\" Inside the coffin were two bodies, whom Giraldus refers to as Arthur and \"his queen\"; the bones of the male body were described as being gigantic. The account of the burial by the chronicle of [[Margam Abbey]] says three bodies were found, the other being that of [[Mordred]]; [[Richard Barber]] argues that Mordred's name was airbrushed out of the story once his reputation as a traitor was appreciated.<ref>[[Richard Barber]], \"Was Mordred buried at Glastonbury?: Arthurian tradition at Glastonbury in the middle ages\", in {{Harvnb|Carley|2001|pp=145\u201359, 316}}</ref> The story is today seen as an example of [[pseudoarchaeology]].

The later development of the legends of the [[Holy Grail]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]] by [[Robert de Boron]] interconnected these legends with Glastonbury and with Avalon, an identification which also seems to be made in ''[[Perlesvaus]]''.

Arthurian literature also continues to use Glastonbury as an important location as in ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'', and ''[[The Bones of Avalon]]''. Even the fact that [[Somerset]] has many apple orchards has been drawn in to support the connection. Glastonbury's connection to Avalon continues to make it a site of tourism and the area has great religious significance for [[Modern Paganism|neo-Pagans]], [[Neo-Druidism|neo-Druids]] and as a [[New Age communities|New Age community]], as well as Christians.

Again, we glimpse an earlier and different passing of Arthur, on the Continent and not in Britain. (p. 96) Riothamus too led an army of Britons into Gaul, and was the only British King who did. He too advanced to the neighbourhood of Burgundy. He too was betrayed by a deputy ruler who treated with barbarian enemies. He, too, is last located in Gaul among the pro-Roman Burgundians. He, too, disappears after a fatal battle, without any recorded death.

He took a Scriptural view of the origin of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]]s, Egyptians, and other races of ancient Africa, arguing that they were descended from the four sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]; and showed from classic authority the high civilisation to which they had attained when Greece was yet barbarous, and before Rome arose. [[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid.
