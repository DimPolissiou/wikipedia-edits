Maurice Finocchiaro writes that the Galileo affair epitomizes the common view of \"the conflict between enlightened science and obscurantist religion,\" and that this view promotes \"the myth that alleges the incompatibility between science and religion.\" Finocchiaro writes, \"I believe that such a thesis is erroneous, misleading, and simplistic,\" and refers to John Draper, Andrew White, Voltaire, Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Karl Popper as writers or icons who have promoted it.<ref name=\"Trial Galileo Essential\" /> Finocchiaro also describes as mythical the notion that Galileo \"saw\" the Earth's motion, since this direct observation was only possible in the 21st century, and the idea that Galileo was \"imprisoned\", since he was \"actually held under house arrest.\"<ref name=\"Trial Galileo Essential\" /> He notes that the situation was complex and objections to the Copernican system included arguments that were philosophical and scientific, as well as theological.<ref name=\"Trial Galileo Essential\" />\n\nThe Galileo affair was a sequence of events that begin around 1610,<ref>Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.2). Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.50) dates the start of the Galileo affair to 1610. Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoaffair00uisi/page/1 p.1]) puts it a few years later, in 1613.</ref> culminating with the trial and condemnation of [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman Catholic Inquisition]] in 1633 for his support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoaffair00uisi/page/1 p.1]): \"By the 'Galileo affair' is meant the sequence of developments which began in 1613 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633.\"</ref> In 1610, Galileo published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]], namely the phases of [[Venus]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter. With these observations he promoted the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616, the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical. Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to refrain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.<ref name=h218>Heilbron (2010), p.218</ref>\n\nPope Urban VIII had been an admirer and supporter of Galileo, and there is evidence he did not believe the Inquisition's declaration rendered heliocentrism a heresy. Urban may have rather viewed heliocentrism as a potentially dangerous or rash doctrine that nevertheless had utility in astronomical calculations.<ref name=\"Trial Galileo Essential\">{{cite book|last1=Finocchiaro|first1=Maurice A.|title=The Trial of Galileo : Essential Documents|date=2014|isbn=978-1624661327|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> In 1632, Galileo published his  ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was popular. Pope Urban VIII had asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book, and were voiced by a character named \"Simplicio\", who was a simpleton.<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoonworldsy00gali/page/82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&Wallace-2003|Moss & Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&pg=PA11 p. 11]</ref><ref>See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133\u2013134)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than on Pope Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in [[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|''The Sleepwalkers'']] [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says \"this of course is untrue\" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].</ref> This angered the Pope and weakened Galileo's position politically.<ref>{{cite web|last = Lindberg|first = David|title = Beyond War and Peace: A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}</ref> Responding to mounting controversy over [[theology]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]], the [[Roman Inquisition]] tried Galileo in 1633 and found him \"vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]\", sentencing him to [[indefinite imprisonment]].

In the study, the strength of religiosity in the home in which a scientist was raised, current religious attendance, peers' attitudes toward religion, all had an impact on whether or not scientists saw religion and science as in conflict. Scientists who had grown up with a religion and retained that identity or had identified as spiritual or had religious attendance tended to perceive less or no conflict. However, those not attending religious services were more likely to adopt a conflict paradigm.

Maurice Finocchiaro writes that the Galileo affair epitomizes the common view of \"the conflict between enlightened science and obscurantist religion,\" and that this view promotes \"the myth that alleges the incompatibility between science and religion.\" Finocchiaro writes, \"I believe that such a thesis is erroneous, misleading, and simplistic,\" and refers to John Draper, Andrew White, Voltaire, Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Karl Popper as writers or icons who have promoted it.<ref name=\"Trial Galileo Essential\" /> Finocchiaro also describes as mythical the notion that Galileo \"saw\" the Earth's motion, since this direct observation was only possible in the 21st century, and the idea that Galileo was \"imprisoned\", since he was \"actually held under house arrest.\"<ref name=\"Trial Galileo Essential\" /> He notes that the situation was complex and objections to the Copernican system included arguments that were philosophical and scientific, as well as theological.<ref name=\"Trial Galileo Essential\" />\n\nThe Galileo affair was a sequence of events that begin around 1610,<ref>Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.2).

Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoaffair00uisi/page/1 p.1]) puts it a few years later, in 1613.</ref> culminating with the trial and condemnation of [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman Catholic Inquisition]] in 1633 for his support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoaffair00uisi/page/1 p.1]): \"By the 'Galileo affair' is meant the sequence of developments which began in 1613 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633.\"</ref> In 1610, Galileo published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]], namely the phases of [[Venus]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter. With these observations he promoted the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616, the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical. Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to refrain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.<ref name=h218>Heilbron (2010), p.218</ref>\n\nPope Urban VIII had been an admirer and supporter of Galileo, and there is evidence he did not believe the Inquisition's declaration rendered heliocentrism a heresy.

He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]].

In the study, the strength of religiosity in the home in which a scientist was raised, current religious attendance, peers' attitudes toward religion, all had an impact on whether or not scientists saw religion and science as in conflict. Scientists who had grown up with a religion and retained that identity or had identified as spiritual or had religious attendance tended to perceive less or no conflict.

After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, ''[[Madness and Civilization|The History of Madness]]'' (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], he produced ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with [[structuralism]], from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a [[historiography|historiographical]] technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology.\"\n\nFrom 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the [[University of Tunis]] before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of [[Paris VIII]]. Foucault subsequently published ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of [[left-wing]] groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975) and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.\n\nFoucault died in Paris of [[HIV/AIDS]]; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease. His partner [[Daniel Defert]] founded the [[AIDES]] charity in his memory.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Early Years: 1926\u20131938===\nPaul-Michel Foucault was born on {{Date|15 October 1926|DMY}} in the city of [[Poitiers]], west-central [[France]], as the second of three children in a prosperous, [[social conservatism|socially-conservative]], [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] family.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father, Paul Foucault (1893\u20131959), but his mother insisted on the addition of \"Michel;\" referred to as \"Paul\" at school, he would express a preference for \"Michel\" throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=4\u20135|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=39}}\n\nHis father, a successful local surgeon born in [[Fontainebleau]], moved to Poitiers, where he set up his own practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132}} He would marry Anne Malapert, the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the [[University of Poitiers]]' School of Medicine.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=1}} Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while Anne took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of [[Vendeuvre-du-Poitou]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=2}} Together the couple had three children\u2014a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys\u2014who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3}} The children were raised to be nominal [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an [[altar boy]], none of the family was devout.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=4}}\n\nIn later life, Foucault revealed very little about his childhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=4|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Describing himself as a \"juvenile delinquent,\" he claimed his father was a \"bully\" who sternly punished him.{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=39}} In 1930, two years early, Foucault began his schooling at the local [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV|Lyc\u00e9e Henry-IV]]. There he would undertake two years of elementary education before entering the main ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'', where he stayed until 1936. Afterwards, he would take his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin, and history, though doing poorly at mathematics, including [[arithmetic]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|pp=8\u20139}} \n\n=== Teens to Young Adulthood: 1939\u20131945 ===\nIn 1939, the [[Second World War]] would break out, followed by [[Nazi Germany]]'s occupation of France in 1940. Foucault's parents opposed the occupation and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], but did not join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=7}} That year, Foucault's mother would enroll him in the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Stanislas, a strict Roman Catholic institution run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. Though going on to describing his years there as an \"ordeal,\" Foucault would excel academically, particularly in philosophy, history, and literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=10|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=39\u201340|4a1=Smart|4y=2002|4p=19}} In 1942 he entered his final year, the ''terminale'', where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]'' in 1943.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=10}}\n\nReturning to the local Lyc\u00e9e Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year,{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=13}} aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher {{ill|Louis Girard (philosopher)|lt=Louis Girard|fr|Louis Girard}}.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=9|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=11}} Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to [[Paris]], where he enrolled in one of the country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]]. Here he studied under the philosopher [[Jean Hyppolite]], an [[existentialism|existentialist]] and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the [[dialectics|dialectical theories]] of Hegel and [[Karl Marx]]. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=11, 14\u201321|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=15\u201317|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and University of Paris: 1946\u20131951===\n{{rquote|right|''I wasn't always smart, I was actually very stupid in school ...

Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates, he lived in the school's communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d'Ulm.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=24\u201325|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=17\u201322|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=45}}\nHe remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously.  His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by Spanish artist [[Francisco Goya]], and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=45}} Prone to [[self-harm]], in 1948 Foucault allegedly [[suicide attempt|attempted suicide]]; his father sent him to see the psychiatrist [[Jean Delay]] at the [[Sainte-Anne Hospital Center]].  Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide, Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years, praising suicide in later writings.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=27\u201328|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=54\u201355}} The ENS's doctor examined Foucault's state of mind, suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality, because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|3p=55}} At the time, Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian [[gay scene]], also indulging in drug use; according to biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]], he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=30|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=55\u201356}}\n\nAlthough studying various subjects, Foucault soon gravitated towards philosophy, reading not only Hegel and Marx but also [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and most significantly, [[Martin Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=34|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=46}} He began reading the publications of philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]], taking a particular interest in his work exploring the [[history of science]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=35|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=60\u201361}} He graduated from the ENS with a DES (''{{Interlanguage link multi|dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]]) in Philosophy in 1949.<ref name=\"Schrift p. 126\"/> His DES thesis under the direction of Hyppolite was titled ''La Constitution d'un transcendental dans La Ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologie de l'esprit de Hegel'' (''The Constitution of a Historical Transcendental in Hegel's [[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'').<ref name=\"Schrift p. 126\"/>\n\nIn 1948, the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] became a tutor at the ENS. A [[Marxism|Marxist]], he influenced both Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the [[French Communist Party]] (''Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais'', PCF). Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] viewpoint, refuting core Marxist tenets such as [[class struggle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=32\u201336, 51\u201355|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=23\u201326, 37\u201340|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=57}} He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced [[homophobia]] and was appalled by the [[anti-semitism]] exhibited during the 1952-1953 \"[[Doctors' plot]]\" in the [[Soviet Union]]. He left the Communist Party in 1953, but remained Althusser's friend and defender for the rest of his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=56\u201357|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=39\u201340|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=57\u201358}} Although failing at the first attempt in 1950, he passed his ''[[agr\u00e9gation]]'' in philosophy on the second try, in 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=36\u201338|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=43\u201345|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=61}} Excused from [[national service]] on medical grounds, he decided to start a doctorate at the [[Fondation Dosne-Thiers|Fondation Thiers]] in 1951, focusing on the philosophy of psychology,{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=39\u201340|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=45\u201346, 49}} but he relinquished it after only one year in 1952.<ref>Robbins, Derek. 2012.

Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] sexual activity.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=65\u201368|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=50\u201353|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=66, 79\u201382, 89\u201391}} In August 1953, Foucault and Barraqu\u00e9 holidayed in Italy, where the philosopher immersed himself in ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'' (1873\u201376), a set of four essays by the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

His erudition derives from years pondering, to cite [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], '[[The Raven|over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore]]', and his learning is not always worn lightly.''|Foucault biographer [[David Macey]], 1993{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=96}}}}\n\nIn West Germany, Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis (''th\u00e8se principale'') for his [[State doctorate]], entitled ''[[Madness and Civilization|Folie et d\u00e9raison: Histoire de la folie \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge classique]]'' (trans. \"Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age\"), a philosophical work based upon his studies into the [[history of medicine]]. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with [[Insanity|madness]], arguing that it was a social construct distinct from [[mental illness]]. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the [[Renaissance]], the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright [[Antonin Artaud]], who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.{{Sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=102|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=96}}\n\n''Histoire de la folie'' was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} Foucault submitted it at the [[University of Paris]], although the university's regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=90\u201392|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=88\u201389}} Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process.

The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: '''sovereign''' power, '''disciplinary''' power, and '''biopower'''.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\">Lynch, R. A. (2011) Foucault's theory of power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 13-26). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nFoucault is generally critical to \"theories\" that try to give absolute answers to \"everything.\" Therefore, he considered his own \"theory\" of power to be closer to a method than a typical \"theory.\" According to Foucault, most people misunderstand power. For this reason, he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as:<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n\n* A group of institutions and/or mechanisms whose aim it is for a citizen to obey and yield to the state (a typical [[liberalism|liberal]] definition of power);<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n* Yielding to rules (a typical [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] definition of power);<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" /> or\n* A general and oppressing system where one societal class or group oppresses another (a typical [[feminism|feminist]] or [[Orthodox Marxism|Orthodox Marxist]] definition of power).<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n\nFoucault is not critical of considering these phenomena as \"power\", but rather so that these theories of power cannot completely describe ''all'' forms of power. Foucault also claims that liberal definition of power has effectively hidden other forms of power to the extent that people have uncritically accepted them.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nFoucault's own theory of power begins on micro-level, with singular \"force relations\". [[Richard A. Lynch]] defines Foucault's concept of \"force relation\" as \"whatever in one's social interactions that pushes, urges or compels one to do something.\"<ref>Lynch (2011), p. 19</ref> According to Foucault, force relations are an effect of difference, inequality or unbalance that exists in other forms of relationships (such as sexual or economic). Force, and power, is however not something that a person or group \"holds\" (such as in the sovereign definition of power), but rather so is power a complex group of forces that comes from \"everything\" and therefore exists everywhere. That relations of power always result from inequality, difference or unbalance also means that power always has a goal or purpose. Power comes in two forms: tactics and strategies. Tactics is power on the micro-level, which can for example be how a person chooses to express themselves through their clothes. Strategies on the other hand, is power on macro-level, which can be the state of fashion at any moment. Strategies consist of a combination of tactics. At the same time, power is non-subjective according to Foucault. This posits a paradox, according to Lynch, since \"someone\" has to exert power, while at the same time there can be no \"someone\" exerting this power.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/> According to Lynch this paradox can be solved with two observations:\n* By looking at power as something which reaches further than the influence of single people or groups. Even if individuals and groups try to influence fashion, for example, their actions will often get unexpected consequences.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n* Even if individuals and groups have a free choice, they are also affected and limited by their context/situation.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, force relations are constantly changing, constantly interacting with other force relations which may weaken, strengthen or change one another. Foucault writes that power always includes resistance, which means there is always a possibility that power and force relations will change in some way. According to Richard A. Lynch, the purpose of Foucault's theory of power is to increase peoples' awareness of how power has shaped their way of being, thinking and acting, and by increasing this awareness making it possible for them to change their way of being, thinking and acting.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\n==== Sovereign power ====\nWith \"sovereign power\" Foucault alludes to a power structure that is similar to a pyramid, where one person or a group of people (at the top of the pyramid) holds the power, while the \"normal\" (and oppressed) people are at the bottom of the pyramid. In the middle parts of the pyramid are the people who enforce the sovereigns orders. A typical example of sovereign power is [[absolute monarchy]].<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nIn historical absolute monarchies, crimes has been considered as a personal offense against the sovereign and his/her power. The punishment was often public and spectacular, partly to deter others from committing crimes, but also to reinstate the sovereigns power. This was however both expensive and ineffective \u2013 it led far too often to people sympathizing with the criminal. In modern times, when disciplinary power is dominant, criminals are instead subjected to various disciplinary techniques in order to \"remold\" the criminal into a \"law abiding citizen\".<ref name=\"May2011\">May, T.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chlo\u00eb Taylor]], a characteristic for sovereign power is that the sovereign has the right to take life, wealth, services, labor and products. The sovereign has a right to subtract \u2013 to take life, to enslave life, etc. \u2013 but not the right to control life in the way that later happens in disciplinary systems of power. According to Taylor, the form of power that the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] is concerned about, is sovereign power. According to Hobbes, people are \"free\" so long they are not literally placed in chains.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\">Taylor, C. (2011) Biopower. In Taylor, D. (red.)

(2011) Disciplinary power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 27-39). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> The more useful the body becomes, the more obedient it also has to become. The purpose of this is not only to use the bodies' skills, but also prevent these skills from being used to revolt against the power.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nDisciplinary power has \"individuals\" as its object, target and instrument. According to Foucault, \"individual\" is however a construct created by disciplinary power.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/> The disciplinary power's techniques creates a \"rational self-control\",<ref name=\"Vintges2011\">Vintges, K. (2011) Freedom and spirituality. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 99-110). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> which in practice means that the disciplinary power is internalized and therefore doesn't continuously need external force. Foucault says that disciplinary power is primarily not an oppressing form of power, but rather so a productive form of power. Disciplinary power doesn't oppress interests or desires, but instead subjects bodies to reconstructed patterns of behavior in order to reconstruct their thoughts, desires and interests. According to Foucault this happens in factories, schools, hospitals and prisons.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\">Oksala, J. (2011) Freedom and bodies. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 85-97). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> Disciplinary power creates a certain type of individual by producing new movements, habits and skills. It focuses on details, single movements, their timing and speed. It organizes bodies in time and space, and controls every movement for maximal effect. It uses rules, surveillance, exams and controls.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/> The activities follows certain plans, whose purpose it is to lead the bodies to certain pre-determined goals. The bodies are also combined with each other, in order to reach a productivity that is greater than the sum of all bodies activities.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nDisciplinary power has according to Foucault been especially successful due to its usage of three technologies: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgement and exams.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/> By hierarchical observation, the bodies become constantly visible to the power. The observation is hierarchical since there is not a single observer, but rather so a \"hierarchy\" of observers. An example of this is [[mental asylum]]s during the 19th century, when the psychiatrist was not the only observer, but also nurses and auxiliary staff. From these observations and scientific discourses, a norm is established and used to judge the observed bodies. For the disciplinary power to continue to exist, this judgement has to be normalized. Foucault mentions several characteristics of this judgement: (1) all deviations, even small ones, from correct behavior is punished, (2) repeated rule violations are punished extra, (3) exercises are used as a behavior correcting technique and punishment, (4) rewards are used together with punishment to establish a hierarchy of good and bad behavior/people, (5) rank/grades/etc. are used as punishment and reward. Examinations combine the hierarchical observation with judgement. Exams objectivity and individualize the observed bodies by creating extensive documentation about every observed body. The purpose of the exams is therefore to gather further information about each individual, track their development and compare their results to the norm.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, the \"formula\" for disciplinary power can be seen in philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s plan for the \"optimal prison\": the [[panopticon]]. Such a prison consists of a circle-formed building where every cell is inhabited by only one prisoner. In every cell there are two windows \u2013 one to let in light from outside and one pointing to the middle of the circle-formed building. In this middle there is a tower where a guard can be placed to observe the prisoners. Since the prisoners will never be able to know whether they are being watched or not at a given moment, they will internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior (''as if'' they were constantly being watched). Foucault says this construction (1) creates an individuality by separating prisoners from each other in the physical room, (2) since the prisoners cannot know if they are being watched at any given moment, they internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior as if they were always watched, (3) the surveillance makes it possible to create extensive documentation about each prisoner and their behavior. According to Foucault the panopticon has been used as a model also for other disciplinary institutions, such as mental asylums in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\n===== F. W. Taylor's ''The Principles of Scientific Management''=====\n{{see also|Taylorism}}\n[[Marcelo Hoffman]] posits that an example of disciplinary power can be seen in [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]s book ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]''. Taylor's purpose was to increase the efficacy of workers by having their behavior controlled by the company's management. He mentions as an example an attempt to increase the amount of [[pig iron]] carried by each worker during a day from 12,5 tonnes to 47 tonnes, without causing the workers to strike. Here, Hoffman says, is a clear example of how the disciplinary power tries to make the body more obedient the more useful it becomes. Taylor describes that he started out with observing his 75 workers to pick out the most skilled workers. He had studied the workers history, character, habits and ambitions. Here is an example of how the disciplinary power creates an individuality. One of the selected workers, \"Schmidt\", was according to Taylor a man with high ambitions that valued a high salary. Schmidt accepted the terms given: He would earn 61% more if he agreed to obey without protest the orders given to him by an appointed instructor. Schmidt was thereafter observed and controlled in every detail of his working day \u2013 he was told when and how to work, when to rest, etc. According to Taylor, Schmidt never failed to obey during the three years during which he was subjected to this detailed control and higher workload.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nAnother example mentioned by Taylor is taken from a different industry, where Taylor had calculated the \"optimal\" workload for each worker. There Taylor had developed a system where every worker was not only continuously observed, but also punished if they had failed to reach up to the daily quota the previous workday. Every day the workers received a yellow or white note at the end of each shift, where yellow notes were given to those who had not reached the daily quota. Those who were given yellow notes were then threatened with redeployment to a \"working role better fit for their productive capacities\", which according to Taylor effectively led the workers to work harder. According to Taylor, the workers who were given yellow notes were not immediately redeployed. Instead, Taylor writes that a \"skilled teacher\" were sent to teach the workers how to do the work properly. The teachers job was however not only to \"teach\" the workers how to work more effectively, but also to observe them and their working capacity. Besides this teacher, Taylor also describes that the workers were observed by others, such as administrators, managers, etc.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\n==== Biopower ====\n{{Further|Biopower}}\nWith \"biopower\" Foucault refers to power over ''bios'' (life) \u2013 power over [[population]]s. Biopower primarily rests on norms which are internalized by people, rather than external force. It encourages, strengthens, controls, observes, optimizes and organize the forces below it. Foucault has sometimes described biopower as separate from disciplinary power, but at other times he has described disciplinary power as an expression of biopower. Biopower can use disciplinary techniques, but in contrast to disciplinary power its target is populations rather than individuals.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nBiopower studies populations regarding (for example) number of births, life expectancy, public health, housing, migration, crime, which social groups are over-represented in deviations from the norm (regarding health, crime, etc.) and try to adjust, control or eliminate these norm-deviations. One example is the age distribution in a population. Biopower is interested in age distribution in order to compensate for future (or current) lacks of labor power, retirement homes, etc. Another example is the French-Canadian province [[Qu\u00e9bec]], which has had a high interest in sustaining the French language in the region. To accomplish this, economic incentives has been created for French-speaking people to move to Qu\u00e9bec, and non-French-speaking children have had French taught as a compulsory subject in school. Yet another example is sex: because sex is connected to population-growth, sex and sexuality have been of great interest to biopower. On a disciplinary level, people who engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts have been treated for psychiatric diagnoses such as \"perversion\", \"frigidity\" and \"sexual dysfunction\". On a biopower-level, the usage of contraceptives has been studied, some social groups have (by various means) been encouraged to have children, while others (such as poor, sick, unmarried women, criminals or people with disability) have been discouraged or prevented from having children.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nIn the era of biopower, death has become a scandal and a catastrophe, but despite this biopower has according to Foucault killed more people than any other form of power has ever done before it. Under sovereign power, the sovereign king could kill people to exert his power or start wars simply to extend his kingdom, but during the era of biopower wars have instead been motivated by an ambition to \"protect life itself\". Similar motivations has also been used for genocide. For example, Nazi Germany motivated its attempt to eradicate Jews, the mentally ill and disabled with the motivation that Jews were \"a threat to the German health\", and that the money spent on healthcare for mentally ill and disabled would be better spent on \"viable Germans\". Chlo\u00eb Taylor also mentions the [[Iraq War]] was motivated by similar tenets. The motivation was at first that Iraq was thought to have weapons of mass destruction and connections to [[Al-Qaeda]]. However, when the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush-]] and [[Blair ministry|Blair]]-administrations didn't find any evidence to support either of these theories, the motivation for the war was changed. In the new motivation, the cause of the war was said to be that [[Saddam Hussein]] had committed crimes against his own population. Taylor means that in modern times, war has to be \"concealed\" under a rhetoric of humanitarian aid, despite the fact that these wars often cause humanitarian crises.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th-century, slums were increasing in number and size across the western world. Criminality, illness, alcoholism and prostitution was common in these areas, and the middle class considered the people who lived in these slums as \"unmoral\" and \"lazy\". The middle class also feared that this underclass sooner or later would \"take over\" because the population growth was greater in these slums than it was in the middle class. This fear gave rise to the scientific study of [[eugenics]], whose founder [[Francis Galton]] had been inspired by [[Charles Darwin]] and his theory of natural selection. According to Galton, society was preventing natural selection by helping \"the weak\", thus causing a spread of the \"negative qualities\" into the rest of the population.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\n=== Theory of the Body and Sexuality ===\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not something objective that stands outside of history and culture. Instead, Foucault argues, the body has been and is continuously shaped by society and history \u2013 by work, diet, body ideals, exercise, medical interventions, etc. Foucault presents no \"theory\" of the body, but does write about it in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' as well as in ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''. Foucault was critical of all purely biological explanations of phenomena such as sexuality, madness and criminality. Further, Foucault argues, that the body is not sufficient as a basis for self-understanding and understanding of others.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\" />\n\nIn ''Discipline and Punish'', Foucault shows how power and the body are tied together, for example by the disciplinary power primarily focusing on individual bodies and their behavior. Foucault argues that power, by manipulating bodies/behavior, also manipulates people's minds. Foucault turns the common saying \"the body is the prison of the soul\" and instead posits that \"the soul is the prison of the body.\"<ref name=\"Oksala2011\" />\n\nAccording to Foucault, [[sexology]] has tried to exert itself as a \"science\" by referring to the material (the body). In contrast to this, Foucault argues that sexology is a pseudoscience, and that \"sex\" is a pseudo-scientific idea. For Foucault the idea of a natural, biologically grounded and fundamental sexuality is a normative historical construct that has also been used as an instrument of power. By describing sex as the biological and fundamental cause to peoples' [[gender identity]], sexual identity and sexual behavior, power has effectively been able to normalize sexual and gendered behavior. This has made it possible to evaluate, pathologize and \"correct\" peoples' sexual and gendered behavior, by comparing bodies behaviors to the constructed \"normal\" behavior. For Foucault, a \"normal sexuality\" is as much of a construct as a \"natural sexuality\". Therefore, Foucault was also critical of the popular discourse that dominated the debate over sexuality during the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, the popular discourse argued for a \"liberation\" of sexuality from a cultural, moral and capitalistic oppression. Foucault, however, argues that peoples' opinions about and experiences of sexuality are ''always'' a result of cultural and power mechanisms. To \"liberate\" sexuality from one group of norms only means that another group of norms takes it place. This, however, does not mean that Foucault considers resistance to be futile. What Foucault argues for is rather that it is impossible to become completely free from power, and that there is simply no \"natural\" sexuality. Power always involves a dimension of resistance, and therefore also a possibility for change. Although Foucault considers it impossible to step outside of power-networks, it is always possible to change these networks or navigate them differently.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not only a \"obedient and passive object\" that is dominated by discourses and power. The body is also the \"seed\" to resistance against dominant discourses and power techniques. The body is never fully compliant, and experiences can never fully be reduced to linguistic descriptions. There is always a possibility to experience something that is not possible to describe with words, and in this discrepancy there is also a possibility for resistance against dominant discourses.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nFoucault's view of the historical construction of the body has influenced many feminist and queer-theorists. According to [[Johanna Oksala]], Foucault's influence on queer theory has been so great than he can be considered one of the founders of queer theory. The fundamental idea behind queer theory is that there is no natural fundament that lies behind identities such as gay, lesbian, heterosexual, etc. Instead these identities are considered cultural constructions that have been constructed through normative discourses and relations of power. Feminists has with the help of Foucault's ideas studied different ways that women form their bodies: through plastic surgery, diet, eating disorders, etc. Foucault's historization of sex has also affected feminist theorists such as [[Judith Butler]], who used Foucault's theories about the relation between subject, power and sex to question gendered subjects. Butler follows Foucault by saying that there is no \"true\" gender behind gender identity that constitutes its biological and objective fundament. However, Butler is critical of Foucault. She argues Foucault \"naively\" presents bodies and pleasures as a ground for resistance against power, without extending his historization of sexuality to gendered subjects/bodies. Foucault has received criticism from other feminists, such as [[Susan Bordo]] and [[Kate Soper]].<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nJohanna Oksala argues that Foucault, by saying that sex/sexuality are constructs, doesn't deny the existence of sexuality. Oksala also argues that the goal of critical theories such as Foucault is not to liberate the body and sexuality from oppression, but rather so question and deny the identities that are posited as \"natural\" and \"essential\" by showing how these identities are historical and cultural constructions.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\n=== Theory of Subjectivity ===\nFoucault considered his primary project to be the investigation of how people through history has been made into \"subjects.\"<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\">Taylor, D.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> According to Foucault, \"the subject\" has, by western philosophers, usually been considered as something given; natural and objective. On the contrary, Foucault considers subjectivity to be a construction created by power.<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\" /> Foucault talks of \"assujettissement\", which is a French term that for Foucault refers to a process where power creates subjects while also oppressing them using social norms. For Foucault \"social norms\" are standards that people are encouraged to follow, that are also used to compare and define people. As an example of \"assujettissement\", Foucault mentions \"homosexual\", a historically contingent type of subjectivity that was created by sexology. Foucault writes that [[sodomy]] was previously considered a serious sexual deviation, but a temporary one. Homosexuality, however, became a \"species\", a past, a childhood and a type of life. \"Homosexuals\" has by the same power that created this subjectivity been discriminated against, due to homosexuality being considered as a deviation from the \"normal\" sexuality. However, Foucault argues, the creation of a subjectivity such as \"homosexuality\" does not only have negative consequences for the people who are subjectivised \u2013 the subjectivity of homosexuality has also led to the creation of gay bars and the [[pride parade]].<ref name=\"Heyes2011\">Heyes, C. J. (2011) Subjectivity and power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 159-172). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Foucault, scientific discourses have played an important role in the disciplinary power system, by classifying and categorizing people, observing their behavior and \"treating\" them when their behavior has been considered \"abnormal\". Sciences such as psychiatry, biology, medicine, economy, psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology, ethnology, pedagogy and criminology have all categorized behaviors as rational, irrational, normal, abnormal, human, inhuman, etc. By doing so, they have all created various types of subjectivity and norms,<ref name=\"Vintges2011\"/> which are then internalized by people as \"truths\". People have then adapted their behavior in order to get closer to what these sciences has labeled as \"normal\".<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/> For example, Foucault claims that psychological observation/surveillance and psychological discourses has created a type of psychology-centered subjectivity, which has led to people considering unhappiness a fault in their psychology rather than in society. This has also, according to Foucault, been a way for society to resist criticism \u2013 criticism against society has been turned against the individual and their psychological health.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\n==== Obesity as a form of subjectivity ====\n[[Cressida J. Heyes]] argues that a modern example of subjectivity is obesity. Subjects are created in two levels: by biopower and by disciplinary power. Biopower has during the 21th-century considered obesity as a \"corruption in the body politics\" and a \"public health catastrophe\". Heyes argues that during the 21th century there has been an anti-obesity discourse that has been enabled by population statistics and public health campaigns. These expressions of bio power, however, relies on disciplinary power, for example by health care institutions gathering information about individuals weight, length, age, etc. that is then used by biopower. The biopower tries to reduce the ''populations\u2032'' deviance from the weight-norm, and disciplinary power tries to reduce the ''individuals\u2032'' deviance from the weight-norm. Biopower and disciplinary power thus create various forms of subjectivity: obesity, underweight, normal weight, and so on. To be obese is not simply a question of where the individual lies in relation to the weight-norm, but it is also considered a marker for the individuals incapacity to regulate their own weight and behavior. This becomes the case not only through the disciplinary institutions (such as health care institutions) exertion of power, but also by a \"confession discourse\" where people are encouraged and expected to \"confess\" their consumption habits, weight, fat percentage, exercising habits, etc. Heyes argues that a modern-day example of this can be seen in online forums centered around weight and weight-loss. These forums contain, according to Heyes, profiles where every individual describes their starting weight, current weight and goal weight. Another example of this that Heyes mentions is video-blogs where people create a \"biography\" centered around their \"weight-loss-journey\". In these ways people also constitute their own subjectivity. However, as with other forms of subjectivity, Heyes argues that these people also experience benefits from constituting themselves as \"obese people\". According to Heyes, these people can feel better, learn new things (about nutrition, for example) and acquire new skills. At the same time, Heyes argues, by accepting this subjectivity people are dragged deeper into a disciplinary power system.<ref name=\"Heyes2011\"/>\n\n==== Subjectivity constituted by individuals in relation to themselves ====\nAccording to Foucault, subjectivity is not necessarily something that is forced upon people externally \u2013 it is also something that is established in a person's relation to themselves.<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\"/> This can, for example, happen when a person is trying to \"find themselves\" or \"be themselves\", something [[Edward McGushin]] describes as a typical modern activity. In this quest for the \"true self\", the self is established in two levels: as a passive object (the \"true self\" that is searched for) and as an active \"searcher\". The ancient [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] and the 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] posited that the \"true self\" can only be found by going through great hardship and/or danger. The ancient [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and 17th-century philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], however, argued that the \"self\" can be found by quiet and solitary introspection. Yet another example is [[Socrates]], who argued that self-awareness can only be found by having debates with others, where the debaters question each other's foundational views and opinions. Foucault, however, argued that \"subjectivity\" is a process, rather than a state of being. As such, Foucault argued that there is no \"true self\" to be found. Rather so, the \"self\" is constituted/created in activities such as the ones employed to \"find\" the \"self\". In other words, exposing oneself to hardships and danger does not \"reveal\" the \"true self\", according to Foucault, but rather creates a particular type of self and subjectivity. However, according to Foucault the \"form\" for the subject is in great part already constituted by power, before these self-constituting practices are employed. Schools, workplaces, households, government institutions, entertainment media and the healthcare sector all, through disciplinary power, contribute to forming people into being particular types of subjects.<ref name=\"McGushin2011\">McGushin, E.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of Freedom ===\nTodd May defines Foucault's concept of freedom as: that which we can do of ourselves within our specific historical context. A condition for this, according to Foucault, is that we are aware of our situation and how it has been created/affected (and is still being affected) by power. According to May, two of the aspects of how power has shaped peoples\u2032 way of being, thinking and acting is described in the books where Foucault describes disciplinary power and the history of sexuality. However, May argues, there will always be aspects of peoples\u2032 formation that will be unknown to them, hence the constant necessity for the type of analyses that Foucault did.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\nFoucault argues that the forces that have affected people can be changed; people always have the capacity to change the factors that limits their freedom.<ref name=\"May2011\"/> Freedom is thus not a state of being, but a practice \u2013 a way of being in relation to oneself, to others and to the world.<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\">Mendieta, E.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> According to Todd May Foucault's concept of freedom also includes constructing histories like the ones Foucault did about the history of disciplinary power and sexuality \u2013 histories that investigate and describe the forces that have influenced people into becoming who they are. From the knowledge that is reached from such investigations, people can thereafter decide which forces they believe are acceptable and which they consider to be intolerable and has to be changed. Freedom is for Foucault a type of \"experimentation\" with different \"transformations\". Since these experiments cannot be controlled completely, May argues they may lead to the reconstruction of intolerable power relations or the creation of new ones. Thus, May argues, it is always necessary to continue with such experimentation and Foucauldian analyses.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\n==== Practice of Critique ====\nFoucault's \"alternative\" to the modern subjectivity is described by Cressida Heyes as \"critique.\" For Foucault there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of subjectivity, since they are all a result of power relations.<ref name=\"Heyes2011\" /> In the same way, Foucault argues there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" norms. All norms and institutions are at the same time enabling as they are oppressing. Therefore, Foucault argues, it is always crucial to continue with the practice of \"critique\".<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\" /> Critique is for Foucault a practice that searches for the processes and events that led to our way of being \u2013 a questioning of who we \"are\" and how this \"we\" came to be. Such a \"critical [[ontology]] of the present\" shows that peoples\u2032 current \"being\" is in fact a historically contingent, unstable and changeable construction. Foucault emphasizes that since the current way of being is not a necessity, it is also possible to change it.<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\" /> Critique also includes investigating how and when people are being enabled and when they are being oppressed by the current norms and institutions, finding ways to reduce limitations on freedom, resist normalization and develop new and different way of relating to oneself and others. Foucault argues that it is impossible to go beyond power relations, but that it is always possible to navigate power relations in a different way.<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\" />\n\n====''Epimeleia heautou'', \"care for the self\" ====\nAs an alternative to the modern \"search\" for the \"true self\",<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" /> and as a part of \"the work of freedom\",<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\" /> Foucault discusses the antique Greek term ''epimeleia heautou'', \"care for the self.\" According to Foucault, among the ancient Greek philosophers, self-awareness was not a goal in itself, but rather something that was sought after in order to \"care for oneself\". Care for the self consists of what Foucault calls \"the art of living\" or \"technologies of the self.\"<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" /> The goal of these techniques was, according to Foucault, to transform oneself into a more ethical person. As an example of this, Foucault mentions [[meditation]],<ref name=\"Vintges2011\" /> the [[stoicism|stoic]] activity of contemplating past and future actions and evaluating if these actions are in line with ones values and goals, and \"contemplation of nature.\" Contemplation of nature is another stoic activity, that consists of reflecting on how \"small\" one's existence is when compared to the greater [[cosmos]].<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" />\n\n=== Theory of Knowledge ===\n{{Main|Power-knowledge}}\nFoucault is described by [[Mary Beth Mader]] as an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] and [[historicism|historicist]].<ref name=\"Mader2014\">Mader, M. B. (2014) Knowledge. Ur Lawlor, L. (red.) & Nale, J. (red.) ''The Cambridge Foucault Lexicon'' (s. 226-236). Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-11921-4}}</ref> Foucault is critical of the idea that humans can reach \"absolute\" knowledge about the world. A fundamental goal in many of Foucault's works is to show how that which has traditionally been considered as absolute, universal and true in fact are historically contingent. To Foucault, even the idea of absolute knowledge is a historically contingent idea. This does however not lead to epistemological nihilism; rather, Foucault argues that we \"always begin anew\" when it comes to knowledge.<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\" /> At the same time Foucault is critical of modern western philosophy for lacking \"spirituality\". With \"spirituality\" Foucault refers to a certain type of ethical being, and the processes that lead to this state of being. Foucault argues that such a spirituality was a natural part of the ancient Greek philosophy, where knowledge was considered as something that was only accessible to those that had an ethical character. According to Foucault this changed in the \"cartesian moment\", the moment when [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] reached the \"insight\" that self-awareness was something given ([[Cogito ergo sum]], \"I think, therefore I am\"), and from this \"insight\" Descartes drew conclusions about God, the world, and knowledge. According to Foucault, since Descartes knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times, Foucault argues, anyone can reach \"knowledge\", as long as they are rational beings, educated, willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this \"modern\" view of knowledge.<ref>Stone, B. E. (2011) Subjectivity and truth. Ur Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (s. 143-157). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nFoucault describes two types of \"knowledge\": \"savoir\" and \"connaissance\", two French terms that both can be translated as \"knowledge\" but with separate meanings for Foucault. By \"savoir\" Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created, while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences, subjects such as \"the rational person\", \"the mentally ill person\", \"the law abiding person\", \"the criminal\", etc. are created, and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is \"connaicance\", while the process in which subjects and knowledge is created is \"savoir\".<ref name=\"Mader2014\"/> A similar term in Foucaults corpus is \"pouvoir/savoir\" (power/knowledge). With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered \"common sense\", but that is created and withheld in that position (as \"common sense\") by power. The term power/knowledge comes from [[Jeremy Bentham]]s idea that [[panopticon]]s wouldn't only be prisons, but would be used for experiments where the criminals\u2032 behaviour would be studied. Power/knowledge thus refers to forms of power where the power compares individuals, measures differences, establishes a norm and then forces this norm unto the subjects. This is especially successful when the established norm is internalized and institutionalized (by \"institutionalized\" Foucault refers to when the norm is omnipresent). Because then, when the norm is internalized and institutionalized, it has effectively become a part of peoples' \"common sense\" \u2013 the \"obvious\", the \"given\", the \"natural\". When this has happened, this \"common sense\" also affects the explicit knowledge (scientific knowledge), Foucault argues. [[Ellen K. Feder]] mean that the premise \"the world consists of women and men\" is an example of this. This premise, Feder argues, has been considered \"common sense\", and has led to the creation of the psychiatric diagnosis [[gender identity disorder]] (GID). For example, during the 1970s, children with behavior that was not considered appropriate for their gender was diagnosed with GID. The treatment then consisted of trying to make the child adapt to the prevailing gender norms. Feder argues that this is an example of power/knowledge since psychiatry, from the \"common sense\" premise \"the world consists of women and men\" (a premise which is upheld in this status by power), created a new diagnosis, a new type of subject and a whole body of knowledge surrounding this new subject.<ref name=\"Feder2011\">Fader, E.

Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive\u2014even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm in order to mount the critique led philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] to describe Foucault's thinking as  \"crypto-normativist\", covertly reliant on the very [[age of enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles he attempts to argue against.<ref>Ashenden, S., & Owen, D. (Eds.). (1999). Foucault contra Habermas: Recasting the dialogue between genealogy and critical theory. Sage.</ref> A similar critique has been advanced by [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]], and by [[Nancy Fraser]] who argues that \"Foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself recourse to concepts such as 'freedom' and 'justice', and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives.\"<ref>Taylor, D. (2010). Michel Foucault: key concepts. Acumen. pp. 2\u20133</ref> Likewise, scholar [[Nancy Pearcey]] points out Foucault's paradoxical stance: \"[when someone] states that it is impossible to attain objectivity, is that an objective statement? The theory undercuts its own claims.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Finding Truth|last=Pearcey|first=Nancy|year=2015|isbn=978-0781413084|location=|page=208}}</ref>\n\n====Genealogy as historical method====\nThe philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that Foucault's \"archaeology of knowledge\" is fundamentally negative, and thus fails to adequately establish any \"new\" theory of knowledge ''per se''. Rather, Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes:\n\n{{quote|As far as I can see, all he has to offer are brilliant redescriptions of the past, supplemented by helpful hints on how to avoid being trapped by old historiographical assumptions. These hints consist largely of saying: \"do not look for progress or meaning in history; do not see the history of a given activity, of any segment of culture, as the development of rationality or of freedom; do not use any philosophical vocabulary to characterize the essence of such activity or the goal it serves; do not assume that the way this activity is presently conducted gives any clue to the goals it served in the past\".<ref>Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.</ref>}}\n\nFoucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses.<ref>Mills, S. (2003). Michel Foucault: Routledge Critical Thinkers. Chicago p. 23</ref> For example, [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] harshly criticized Foucault in 1998.<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', pp. 45\u201395. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref> Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is \"desperatingly undifferentiated\", and Foucault's thesis of a \"disciplinary society\" is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy.<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 81. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref> In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's \"francocentrism\" because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like [[Max Weber]] and [[Norbert Elias]]. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is \"because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism\".<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 91. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref>\n\n====Feminist critiques====\nThough American feminists have built on Foucault's critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality, some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes.<ref name=\"Downing, Lisa 2008\">Downing, Lisa. \"The Cambridge Introduction to Michel Foucault.\" (2008). Cambridge University Press. pp. 104-117</ref>\n\n====Sexuality====\nThe philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] argues in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) that Foucault was incorrect to claim, in ''The History of Sexuality'', that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a \"problematisation\" of the sexual did not occur, concluding that, \"No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|author-link=Roger Scruton|publisher=Phoenix Books|year=1994|isbn=978-1-85799-100-0|location=London|pages=34, 362}}</ref>\n\nFoucault's approach to sexuality, which he sees as socially constructed, has become influential in [[queer theory]]. Foucault's resistance to identity politics, and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of \"object choice\", stands at odds with some theories of queer identity.<ref name=\"Downing, Lisa 2008\"/>\n\n====Social constructionism and human nature====\nFoucault is sometimes criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of [[social constructionism]], which some see as an affront to the concept of [[truth]]. In Foucault's 1971 [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice.<ref>Wilkin, P. (1999). Chomsky and Foucault on human nature and politics: an essential difference?. Social Theory and Practice, pp. 177\u2013210.</ref> Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating \"He struck me as completely amoral, I'd never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something.\"<ref>James Miller, Jim Miller. 1993.  The Passion of Michel Foucault. Harvard University Press, pp. 201\u201303</ref>\n\n====Education and authority====\nPeruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], while acknowledging that Foucault contributed to give a right of citizenship in cultural life to certain marginal and eccentric experiences (of sexuality, of cultural repression, of madness), asserts that his radical critique of authority was detrimental to education.<ref>Vargas Llosa, Mario (2010).

After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, ''[[Madness and Civilization|The History of Madness]]'' (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], he produced ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with [[structuralism]], from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a [[historiography|historiographical]] technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology.\"\n\nFrom 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the [[University of Tunis]] before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of [[Paris VIII]]. Foucault subsequently published ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of [[left-wing]] groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975) and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.\n\nFoucault died in Paris of [[HIV/AIDS]]; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease. His partner [[Daniel Defert]] founded the [[AIDES]] charity in his memory.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Early Years: 1926\u20131938===\nPaul-Michel Foucault was born on {{Date|15 October 1926|DMY}} in the city of [[Poitiers]], west-central [[France]], as the second of three children in a prosperous, [[social conservatism|socially-conservative]], [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] family.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father, Paul Foucault (1893\u20131959), but his mother insisted on the addition of \"Michel;\" referred to as \"Paul\" at school, he would express a preference for \"Michel\" throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=4\u20135|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=39}}\n\nHis father, a successful local surgeon born in [[Fontainebleau]], moved to Poitiers, where he set up his own practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132}} He would marry Anne Malapert, the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the [[University of Poitiers]]' School of Medicine.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=1}} Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while Anne took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of [[Vendeuvre-du-Poitou]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=2}} Together the couple had three children\u2014a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys\u2014who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3}} The children were raised to be nominal [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an [[altar boy]], none of the family was devout.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=4}}\n\nIn later life, Foucault revealed very little about his childhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=4|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Describing himself as a \"juvenile delinquent,\" he claimed his father was a \"bully\" who sternly punished him.{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=39}} In 1930, two years early, Foucault began his schooling at the local [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV|Lyc\u00e9e Henry-IV]]. There he would undertake two years of elementary education before entering the main ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'', where he stayed until 1936. Afterwards, he would take his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin, and history, though doing poorly at mathematics, including [[arithmetic]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|pp=8\u20139}} \n\n=== Teens to Young Adulthood: 1939\u20131945 ===\nIn 1939, the [[Second World War]] would break out, followed by [[Nazi Germany]]'s occupation of France in 1940. Foucault's parents opposed the occupation and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], but did not join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=7}} That year, Foucault's mother would enroll him in the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Stanislas, a strict Roman Catholic institution run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. Though going on to describing his years there as an \"ordeal,\" Foucault would excel academically, particularly in philosophy, history, and literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=10|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=39\u201340|4a1=Smart|4y=2002|4p=19}} In 1942 he entered his final year, the ''terminale'', where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]'' in 1943.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=10}}\n\nReturning to the local Lyc\u00e9e Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year,{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=13}} aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher {{ill|Louis Girard (philosopher)|lt=Louis Girard|fr|Louis Girard}}.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=9|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=11}} Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to [[Paris]], where he enrolled in one of the country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]]. Here he studied under the philosopher [[Jean Hyppolite]], an [[existentialism|existentialist]] and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the [[dialectics|dialectical theories]] of Hegel and [[Karl Marx]]. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=11, 14\u201321|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=15\u201317|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and University of Paris: 1946\u20131951===\n{{rquote|right|''I wasn't always smart, I was actually very stupid in school ...

Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates, he lived in the school's communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d'Ulm.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=24\u201325|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=17\u201322|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=45}}\nHe remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously.  His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by Spanish artist [[Francisco Goya]], and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=45}} Prone to [[self-harm]], in 1948 Foucault allegedly [[suicide attempt|attempted suicide]]; his father sent him to see the psychiatrist [[Jean Delay]] at the [[Sainte-Anne Hospital Center]].  Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide, Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years, praising suicide in later writings.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=27\u201328|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=54\u201355}} The ENS's doctor examined Foucault's state of mind, suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality, because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|3p=55}} At the time, Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian [[gay scene]], also indulging in drug use; according to biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]], he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=30|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=55\u201356}}\n\nAlthough studying various subjects, Foucault soon gravitated towards philosophy, reading not only Hegel and Marx but also [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and most significantly, [[Martin Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=34|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=46}} He began reading the publications of philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]], taking a particular interest in his work exploring the [[history of science]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=35|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=60\u201361}} He graduated from the ENS with a DES (''{{Interlanguage link multi|dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]]) in Philosophy in 1949.<ref name=\"Schrift p. 126\"/> His DES thesis under the direction of Hyppolite was titled ''La Constitution d'un transcendental dans La Ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologie de l'esprit de Hegel'' (''The Constitution of a Historical Transcendental in Hegel's [[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'').<ref name=\"Schrift p. 126\"/>\n\nIn 1948, the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] became a tutor at the ENS. A [[Marxism|Marxist]], he influenced both Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the [[French Communist Party]] (''Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais'', PCF). Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] viewpoint, refuting core Marxist tenets such as [[class struggle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=32\u201336, 51\u201355|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=23\u201326, 37\u201340|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=57}} He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced [[homophobia]] and was appalled by the [[anti-semitism]] exhibited during the 1952-1953 \"[[Doctors' plot]]\" in the [[Soviet Union]].

Referencing the work of [[Sociology|sociologists]] and anthropologists such as [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] and [[Margaret Mead]], he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=68\u201370|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=63\u201366|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=63}} Biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]] noted that while the book exhibited \"erudition and evident intelligence,\" it lacked the \"kind of fire and flair\" which Foucault exhibited in subsequent works.{{Sfn|Miller|1993|pp=63}} It was largely critically ignored, receiving only one review at the time.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=67}} Foucault grew to despise it, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=70}}\n\n===Sweden, Poland, and West Germany: 1955\u20131960===\nFoucault spent the next five years abroad, first in [[Sweden]], working as cultural diplomat at the [[University of Uppsala]], a job obtained through his acquaintance with historian of religion [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=73\u201374|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=70\u201371}} At [[Uppsala]] he was appointed a Reader in French language and literature, while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France, thus opening the possibility of a cultural-diplomatic career.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=76\u201378|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=73, 76}} Although finding it difficult to adjust to the \"Nordic gloom\" and long winters, he developed close friendships with two Frenchmen, biochemist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Miquel and physicist Jacques Papet-L\u00e9pine, and entered into romantic and sexual relationships with various men. In Uppsala, he became known for his heavy alcohol consumption and reckless driving in his new [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar car]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=74\u201377|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=74\u201375}} In spring 1956, Barraqu\u00e9 broke from his relationship with Foucault, announcing that he wanted to leave the \"vertigo of madness\".{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=68|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=81|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=91}} In Uppsala, Foucault spent much of his spare time in the university's ''[[Carolina Rediviva]]'' library, making use of their Bibliotheca Walleriana collection of texts on the history of medicine for his ongoing research.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=78}} Finishing his doctoral thesis, Foucault hoped it would be accepted by Uppsala University, but [[Sten Lindroth]], a [[positivism|positivistic]] historian of science there, was unimpressed, asserting that it was full of speculative generalisations and was a poor work of history; he refused to allow Foucault to be awarded a doctorate at Uppsala. In part because of this rejection, Foucault left Sweden.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=83\u201386|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=79\u201380}} Later, Foucault admitted that the work was a first draft with certain lack of quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=190}}\n\nAgain at Dum\u00e9zil's recognition, in October 1958 Foucault arrived in the capital of [[Polish People's Republic]], [[Warsaw]] and was placed in charge of the [[University of Warsaw]]'s Centre Fran\u00e7ais.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=87|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=84|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=91}} Foucault found life in Poland difficult due to the lack of material goods and services following the destruction of the Second World War. Witnessing the aftermath of the [[Polish October]] in which students had protested against the governing communist [[Polish United Workers' Party]], he felt that most Poles despised their government as a [[puppet regime]] of the [[Soviet Union]], and thought that the system ran \"badly\".{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=194|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=84\u201385}} Considering the university a liberal enclave, he traveled the country giving lectures; proving popular, he adopted the position of ''de facto'' cultural attach\u00e9.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=88|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=85\u201386}} As in France and Sweden, homosexual activity was legal but socially frowned upon in Poland, and he undertook relationships with a number of men; one was a Polish security agent who hoped to trap Foucault in an embarrassing situation, which would therefore reflect badly on the French embassy. Wracked in diplomatic scandal, he was ordered to leave Poland for a new destination.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=89|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=86\u201387}} Various positions were available in [[West Germany]], and so Foucault relocated to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut fran\u00e7ais Hamburg|de}} (where he was director in 1958\u201360), teaching the same courses he had given in Uppsala and Warsaw.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=89\u201390|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=87\u201388}}<ref name=\"21st Century\">Binkley Sam, and Jorge Capetillo, eds. 2009.

Foucault refers to a bewildering variety of sources, ranging from well-known authors such as [[Erasmus]] and [[Moli\u00e8re]] to archival documents and forgotten figures in the history of medicine and psychiatry. His erudition derives from years pondering, to cite [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], '[[The Raven|over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore]]', and his learning is not always worn lightly.''|Foucault biographer [[David Macey]], 1993{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=96}}}}\n\nIn West Germany, Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis (''th\u00e8se principale'') for his [[State doctorate]], entitled ''[[Madness and Civilization|Folie et d\u00e9raison: Histoire de la folie \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge classique]]'' (trans. \"Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age\"), a philosophical work based upon his studies into the [[history of medicine]]. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with [[Insanity|madness]], arguing that it was a social construct distinct from [[mental illness]]. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the [[Renaissance]], the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright [[Antonin Artaud]], who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.{{Sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=102|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=96}}\n\n''Histoire de la folie'' was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} Foucault submitted it at the [[University of Paris]], although the university's regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=90\u201392|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=88\u201389}} Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process. The first step was to obtain a ''rapporteur'', or \"sponsor\" for the work: Foucault chose [[Georges Canguilhem]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=101\u201302|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=103\u201306}} The second was to find a publisher, and as a result ''Folie et d\u00e9raison'' would be published in French in May 1961 by the company [[Plon]], whom Foucault chose over [[Presses Universitaires de France]] after being rejected by [[Gallimard]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=105\u201307|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=106\u201309|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=117\u201318}} In 1964, a heavily abridged version was published as a mass market paperback, then translated into English for publication the following year as ''Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason''.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=122|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=118}}\n\n''Folie et d\u00e9raison'' received a mixed reception in France and in foreign journals focusing on French affairs. Although it was critically acclaimed by [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Michel Serres]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], and [[Fernand Braudel]], it was largely ignored by the leftist press, much to Foucault's disappointment.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=116|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=113\u201319|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=118}} It was notably criticised for advocating [[metaphysics]] by young philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in a March 1963 lecture at the [[University of Paris]]. Responding with a vicious retort, Foucault criticised Derrida's interpretation of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]. The two remained bitter rivals until reconciling in 1981.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=119\u201321|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=142\u201345|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=118\u201319}} In the English-speaking world, the work became a significant influence on the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement during the 1960s; Foucault took a mixed approach to this, associating with a number of anti-psychiatrists but arguing that most of them misunderstood his work.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=122\u201326}}\n\nFoucault's secondary thesis ({{Lang-fr|th\u00e8se compl\u00e9mentaire}}), written in Hamburg between 1959 and 1960, was a translation and commentary on German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798);<ref name=\"21st Century\"/> the thesis would be titled \"[[Introduction to Kant's Anthropology|Introduction \u00e0 l{{'}}''Anthropologie'']].\"<ref>[http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm \"Introduction to Kant's Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view\" (English translation)]</ref> Largely consisting of Foucault's discussion of textual dating\u2014an \"archaeology of the Kantian text\"\u2014he rounded off the thesis with an evocation of Nietzsche, his biggest philosophical influence.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=110|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=89}} This work's ''rapporteur'' was Foucault's old tutor and then-director of the ENS, Hyppolite, who was well acquainted with German philosophy.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} After both theses were championed and reviewed, he underwent his public defense, the ''soutenance de th\u00e8se'', on 20 May 1961.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=111\u201313}} The academics responsible for reviewing his work were concerned about the unconventional nature of his major thesis; reviewer [[Henri Gouhier]] noted that it was not a conventional work of history, making sweeping generalisations without sufficient particular argument, and that Foucault clearly \"thinks in allegories\".{{Sfn|Miller|1993|pp=104\u201305}} They all agreed however that the overall project was of merit, awarding Foucault his doctorate \"despite reservations.\"{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=115}}\n\n===University of Clermont-Ferrand, ''The Birth of the Clinic'', and ''The Order of Things'': 1960\u20131966===\nIn October 1960, Foucault took a tenured post in philosophy at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], commuting to the city every week from Paris,{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=129|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=109}} where he lived in a high-rise block on the rue du Dr Finlay.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=92}} Responsible for teaching psychology, which was subsumed within the philosophy department, he was considered a \"fascinating\" but \"rather traditional\" teacher at Clermont.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=140\u201341}} The department was run by [[Jules Vuillemin]], who soon developed a friendship with Foucault.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=131|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=109}} Foucault then took Vuillemin's job when the latter was elected to the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] in 1962.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=137}} In this position, Foucault took a dislike to another staff member whom he considered stupid: [[Roger Garaudy]], a senior figure in the Communist Party.

Although initially accepting this description, Foucault soon vehemently rejected it.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pages=1605\u2013162, 167}} Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press. Both Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] attacked Foucault's ideas as \"[[bourgeois]]\", while Foucault retaliated against their Marxist beliefs by proclaiming that \"Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought as a fish exists in water; that is, it ceases to breathe anywhere else.\"{{Sfn|Macey|1993|pp=173\u201377}}\n\n===University of Tunis and Vincennes: 1966\u20131970===\n{{rquote|right|''I lived [in Tunisia] for two and a half years.

Although highly critical of the violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=192\u201393}} While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]], Foucault started to write a book about the [[impressionism|impressionist]] artist [[\u00c9douard Manet]], but never completed it.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=190|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=173}}\n\nIn 1968, Foucault returned to Paris, moving into an apartment on the Rue de Vaugirard.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=198}} After the May 1968 student protests, Minister of Education [[Edgar Faure]] responded by founding new universities with greater autonomy. Most prominent of these was the [[Paris VIII|Centre Exp\u00e9rimental de Vincennes]] in [[Vincennes]] on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the Centre's departments, and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=201\u201302}} Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes, Foucault's desire was to obtain \"the best in French philosophy today\" for his department, employing [[Michel Serres]], [[Judith Miller (philosopher)|Judith Miller]], [[Alain Badiou]], [[Jacques Ranci\u00e8re]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Regnault]], [[Henri Weber]], [[\u00c9tienne Balibar]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e2telet]]; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=203\u201305}}\n\nLectures began at the university in January 1969, and straight away its students and staff, including Foucault, were involved in occupations and clashes with police, resulting in arrests.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=205}} In February, Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Latin Quarter of the Mutualit\u00e9.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=206}} Such actions marked Foucault's embrace of the ultra-left,{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=201}} undoubtedly influenced by Defert, who had gained a job at Vincennes' sociology department and who had become a [[Maoism|Maoist]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=209}} Most of the courses at Foucault's philosophy department were [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] oriented, although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche, \"The end of Metaphysics\", and \"The Discourse of Sexuality\", which were highly popular and over-subscribed.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=207}} While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution, new Minister of Education [[Olivier Guichard]] was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams, with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner. He refused national accreditation of the department's degrees, resulting in a public rebuttal from Foucault.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=207\u201308}}\n\n== Later Life (1970\u20131984) ==\n\n===Coll\u00e8ge de France and ''Discipline and Punish'': 1970\u20131975===\nFoucault desired to leave Vincennes and become a fellow of the prestigious [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]]. He requested to join, taking up a chair in what he called the \"history of systems of thought,\" and his request was championed by members Dum\u00e9zil, Hyppolite, and Vuillemin. In November 1969, when an opening became available, Foucault was elected to the Coll\u00e8ge, though with opposition by a large minority.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=212\u201318}} He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970, which was subsequently published as ''L'Ordre du discours'' (''The Discourse of Language'').{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=212, 219}} He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a year\u2014and did so for the rest of his life\u2014covering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became \"one of the events of Parisian intellectual life\" and were repeatedly packed out events.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=222\u201323}} On Mondays, he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a \"Foulcauldian tribe\" who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and collective research, and together they published a number of short books.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=256\u201358}} Working at the Coll\u00e8ge allowed him to travel widely, giving lectures in Brazil, Japan, Canada, and the United States over the next 14 years.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=310}}  In 1970 and 1972, Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the [[University at Buffalo]] in Buffalo, New York.<ref>Miller, James, ''The Passion of Michel Foucault'', Harvard University Press, 2000, p. 246.</ref>\n\nIn May 1971, Foucault co-founded the Groupe d'Information sur les Prisons (GIP) along with historian [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] and journalist [[Jean-Marie Domenach]]. The GIP aimed to investigate and expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. It was highly critical of the penal system, believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=224\u201329}} The GIP gave press conferences and staged protests surrounding the events of the Toul prison riot in December 1971, alongside other prison riots that it sparked off; in doing so it faced a police crackdown and repeated arrests.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=231\u201332}} The group became active across France, with 2,000 to 3,000, members, but disbanded before 1974.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=233\u201334}} Also campaigning against the [[death penalty]], Foucault co-authored a short book on the case of the convicted murderer [[Pierre Rivi\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=234\u201335}} After his research into the penal system, Foucault published ''Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison'' (''[[Discipline and Punish]]'') in 1975, offering a history of the system in western Europe.

This campaign was formalised as the Committee for the Defence of the Rights of Immigrants, but there was tension at their meetings as Foucault opposed the anti-Israeli sentiment of many Arab workers and Maoist activists.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=238\u201342}} At a December 1972 protest against the police killing of Algerian worker Mohammad Diab, both Foucault and Genet were arrested, resulting in widespread publicity.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=241\u201342}} Foucault was also involved in founding the Agence de Press-Lib\u00e9ration (APL), a group of leftist journalists who intended to cover news stories neglected by the mainstream press. In 1973, they established the daily newspaper ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]'', and Foucault suggested that they establish committees across France to collect news and distribute the paper, and advocated a column known as the \"Chronicle of the Workers' Memory\" to allow workers to express their opinions. Foucault wanted an active journalistic role in the paper,  but this proved untenable, and he soon became disillusioned with ''Lib\u00e9ration'', believing that it distorted the facts; he did not publish in it until 1980.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=250\u201354}} In 1975 he had a [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] experience with Simeon Wade in [[Death Valley]], California and later wrote \u201cit was the greatest experience of his life, and that it profoundly changed his life and his work\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2017/09/when-michel-foucault-tripped-on-acid-in-death-valley-and-called-it-the-greatest-experience-of-my-life-1975.html|title=When Michel Foucault Tripped on Acid in Death Valley and Called It \"The Greatest Experience of My Life\" (1975)|last=September 15th|first=in Philosophy {{!}}|last2=Comments|first2=2017 6|website=Open Culture|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-15}}</ref>\n\n===''The History of Sexuality'' and Iranian Revolution: 1976\u20131979===\nIn 1976, Gallimard published Foucault's ''[[The History of Sexuality|Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9: la volont\u00e9 de savoir]]'' (''The History of Sexuality: The Will to Knowledge''), a short book exploring what Foucault called the \"repressive hypothesis\".

The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: '''sovereign''' power, '''disciplinary''' power, and '''biopower'''.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\">Lynch, R. A. (2011) Foucault's theory of power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 13-26). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nFoucault is generally critical to \"theories\" that try to give absolute answers to \"everything.\" Therefore, he considered his own \"theory\" of power to be closer to a method than a typical \"theory.\" According to Foucault, most people misunderstand power. For this reason, he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as:<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n\n* A group of institutions and/or mechanisms whose aim it is for a citizen to obey and yield to the state (a typical [[liberalism|liberal]] definition of power);<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n* Yielding to rules (a typical [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] definition of power);<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" /> or\n* A general and oppressing system where one societal class or group oppresses another (a typical [[feminism|feminist]] or [[Orthodox Marxism|Orthodox Marxist]] definition of power).<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n\nFoucault is not critical of considering these phenomena as \"power\", but rather so that these theories of power cannot completely describe ''all'' forms of power. Foucault also claims that liberal definition of power has effectively hidden other forms of power to the extent that people have uncritically accepted them.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nFoucault's own theory of power begins on micro-level, with singular \"force relations\". [[Richard A. Lynch]] defines Foucault's concept of \"force relation\" as \"whatever in one's social interactions that pushes, urges or compels one to do something.\"<ref>Lynch (2011), p. 19</ref> According to Foucault, force relations are an effect of difference, inequality or unbalance that exists in other forms of relationships (such as sexual or economic). Force, and power, is however not something that a person or group \"holds\" (such as in the sovereign definition of power), but rather so is power a complex group of forces that comes from \"everything\" and therefore exists everywhere. That relations of power always result from inequality, difference or unbalance also means that power always has a goal or purpose. Power comes in two forms: tactics and strategies. Tactics is power on the micro-level, which can for example be how a person chooses to express themselves through their clothes. Strategies on the other hand, is power on macro-level, which can be the state of fashion at any moment. Strategies consist of a combination of tactics. At the same time, power is non-subjective according to Foucault. This posits a paradox, according to Lynch, since \"someone\" has to exert power, while at the same time there can be no \"someone\" exerting this power.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/> According to Lynch this paradox can be solved with two observations:\n* By looking at power as something which reaches further than the influence of single people or groups. Even if individuals and groups try to influence fashion, for example, their actions will often get unexpected consequences.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n* Even if individuals and groups have a free choice, they are also affected and limited by their context/situation.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, force relations are constantly changing, constantly interacting with other force relations which may weaken, strengthen or change one another. Foucault writes that power always includes resistance, which means there is always a possibility that power and force relations will change in some way. According to Richard A. Lynch, the purpose of Foucault's theory of power is to increase peoples' awareness of how power has shaped their way of being, thinking and acting, and by increasing this awareness making it possible for them to change their way of being, thinking and acting.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\n==== Sovereign power ====\nWith \"sovereign power\" Foucault alludes to a power structure that is similar to a pyramid, where one person or a group of people (at the top of the pyramid) holds the power, while the \"normal\" (and oppressed) people are at the bottom of the pyramid. In the middle parts of the pyramid are the people who enforce the sovereigns orders. A typical example of sovereign power is [[absolute monarchy]].<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nIn historical absolute monarchies, crimes has been considered as a personal offense against the sovereign and his/her power. The punishment was often public and spectacular, partly to deter others from committing crimes, but also to reinstate the sovereigns power. This was however both expensive and ineffective \u2013 it led far too often to people sympathizing with the criminal. In modern times, when disciplinary power is dominant, criminals are instead subjected to various disciplinary techniques in order to \"remold\" the criminal into a \"law abiding citizen\".<ref name=\"May2011\">May, T.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chlo\u00eb Taylor]], a characteristic for sovereign power is that the sovereign has the right to take life, wealth, services, labor and products. The sovereign has a right to subtract \u2013 to take life, to enslave life, etc. \u2013 but not the right to control life in the way that later happens in disciplinary systems of power. According to Taylor, the form of power that the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] is concerned about, is sovereign power. According to Hobbes, people are \"free\" so long they are not literally placed in chains.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\">Taylor, C. (2011) Biopower. In Taylor, D. (red.)

(2011) Disciplinary power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 27-39).

The purpose of this is not only to use the bodies' skills, but also prevent these skills from being used to revolt against the power.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nDisciplinary power has \"individuals\" as its object, target and instrument. According to Foucault, \"individual\" is however a construct created by disciplinary power.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/> The disciplinary power's techniques creates a \"rational self-control\",<ref name=\"Vintges2011\">Vintges, K. (2011) Freedom and spirituality. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 99-110). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> which in practice means that the disciplinary power is internalized and therefore doesn't continuously need external force. Foucault says that disciplinary power is primarily not an oppressing form of power, but rather so a productive form of power. Disciplinary power doesn't oppress interests or desires, but instead subjects bodies to reconstructed patterns of behavior in order to reconstruct their thoughts, desires and interests. According to Foucault this happens in factories, schools, hospitals and prisons.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\">Oksala, J. (2011) Freedom and bodies. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 85-97). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> Disciplinary power creates a certain type of individual by producing new movements, habits and skills. It focuses on details, single movements, their timing and speed. It organizes bodies in time and space, and controls every movement for maximal effect. It uses rules, surveillance, exams and controls.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/> The activities follows certain plans, whose purpose it is to lead the bodies to certain pre-determined goals. The bodies are also combined with each other, in order to reach a productivity that is greater than the sum of all bodies activities.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nDisciplinary power has according to Foucault been especially successful due to its usage of three technologies: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgement and exams.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/> By hierarchical observation, the bodies become constantly visible to the power. The observation is hierarchical since there is not a single observer, but rather so a \"hierarchy\" of observers. An example of this is [[mental asylum]]s during the 19th century, when the psychiatrist was not the only observer, but also nurses and auxiliary staff. From these observations and scientific discourses, a norm is established and used to judge the observed bodies. For the disciplinary power to continue to exist, this judgement has to be normalized. Foucault mentions several characteristics of this judgement: (1) all deviations, even small ones, from correct behavior is punished, (2) repeated rule violations are punished extra, (3) exercises are used as a behavior correcting technique and punishment, (4) rewards are used together with punishment to establish a hierarchy of good and bad behavior/people, (5) rank/grades/etc. are used as punishment and reward. Examinations combine the hierarchical observation with judgement. Exams objectivity and individualize the observed bodies by creating extensive documentation about every observed body. The purpose of the exams is therefore to gather further information about each individual, track their development and compare their results to the norm.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, the \"formula\" for disciplinary power can be seen in philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s plan for the \"optimal prison\": the [[panopticon]]. Such a prison consists of a circle-formed building where every cell is inhabited by only one prisoner. In every cell there are two windows \u2013 one to let in light from outside and one pointing to the middle of the circle-formed building. In this middle there is a tower where a guard can be placed to observe the prisoners. Since the prisoners will never be able to know whether they are being watched or not at a given moment, they will internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior (''as if'' they were constantly being watched). Foucault says this construction (1) creates an individuality by separating prisoners from each other in the physical room, (2) since the prisoners cannot know if they are being watched at any given moment, they internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior as if they were always watched, (3) the surveillance makes it possible to create extensive documentation about each prisoner and their behavior. According to Foucault the panopticon has been used as a model also for other disciplinary institutions, such as mental asylums in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\n===== F. W. Taylor's ''The Principles of Scientific Management''=====\n{{see also|Taylorism}}\n[[Marcelo Hoffman]] posits that an example of disciplinary power can be seen in [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]s book ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]''. Taylor's purpose was to increase the efficacy of workers by having their behavior controlled by the company's management. He mentions as an example an attempt to increase the amount of [[pig iron]] carried by each worker during a day from 12,5 tonnes to 47 tonnes, without causing the workers to strike. Here, Hoffman says, is a clear example of how the disciplinary power tries to make the body more obedient the more useful it becomes. Taylor describes that he started out with observing his 75 workers to pick out the most skilled workers. He had studied the workers history, character, habits and ambitions. Here is an example of how the disciplinary power creates an individuality. One of the selected workers, \"Schmidt\", was according to Taylor a man with high ambitions that valued a high salary. Schmidt accepted the terms given: He would earn 61% more if he agreed to obey without protest the orders given to him by an appointed instructor. Schmidt was thereafter observed and controlled in every detail of his working day \u2013 he was told when and how to work, when to rest, etc. According to Taylor, Schmidt never failed to obey during the three years during which he was subjected to this detailed control and higher workload.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nAnother example mentioned by Taylor is taken from a different industry, where Taylor had calculated the \"optimal\" workload for each worker. There Taylor had developed a system where every worker was not only continuously observed, but also punished if they had failed to reach up to the daily quota the previous workday. Every day the workers received a yellow or white note at the end of each shift, where yellow notes were given to those who had not reached the daily quota. Those who were given yellow notes were then threatened with redeployment to a \"working role better fit for their productive capacities\", which according to Taylor effectively led the workers to work harder. According to Taylor, the workers who were given yellow notes were not immediately redeployed. Instead, Taylor writes that a \"skilled teacher\" were sent to teach the workers how to do the work properly. The teachers job was however not only to \"teach\" the workers how to work more effectively, but also to observe them and their working capacity. Besides this teacher, Taylor also describes that the workers were observed by others, such as administrators, managers, etc.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\n==== Biopower ====\n{{Further|Biopower}}\nWith \"biopower\" Foucault refers to power over ''bios'' (life) \u2013 power over [[population]]s. Biopower primarily rests on norms which are internalized by people, rather than external force. It encourages, strengthens, controls, observes, optimizes and organize the forces below it. Foucault has sometimes described biopower as separate from disciplinary power, but at other times he has described disciplinary power as an expression of biopower. Biopower can use disciplinary techniques, but in contrast to disciplinary power its target is populations rather than individuals.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nBiopower studies populations regarding (for example) number of births, life expectancy, public health, housing, migration, crime, which social groups are over-represented in deviations from the norm (regarding health, crime, etc.) and try to adjust, control or eliminate these norm-deviations. One example is the age distribution in a population. Biopower is interested in age distribution in order to compensate for future (or current) lacks of labor power, retirement homes, etc. Another example is the French-Canadian province [[Qu\u00e9bec]], which has had a high interest in sustaining the French language in the region. To accomplish this, economic incentives has been created for French-speaking people to move to Qu\u00e9bec, and non-French-speaking children have had French taught as a compulsory subject in school. Yet another example is sex: because sex is connected to population-growth, sex and sexuality have been of great interest to biopower. On a disciplinary level, people who engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts have been treated for psychiatric diagnoses such as \"perversion\", \"frigidity\" and \"sexual dysfunction\". On a biopower-level, the usage of contraceptives has been studied, some social groups have (by various means) been encouraged to have children, while others (such as poor, sick, unmarried women, criminals or people with disability) have been discouraged or prevented from having children.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nIn the era of biopower, death has become a scandal and a catastrophe, but despite this biopower has according to Foucault killed more people than any other form of power has ever done before it. Under sovereign power, the sovereign king could kill people to exert his power or start wars simply to extend his kingdom, but during the era of biopower wars have instead been motivated by an ambition to \"protect life itself\". Similar motivations has also been used for genocide. For example, Nazi Germany motivated its attempt to eradicate Jews, the mentally ill and disabled with the motivation that Jews were \"a threat to the German health\", and that the money spent on healthcare for mentally ill and disabled would be better spent on \"viable Germans\". Chlo\u00eb Taylor also mentions the [[Iraq War]] was motivated by similar tenets. The motivation was at first that Iraq was thought to have weapons of mass destruction and connections to [[Al-Qaeda]]. However, when the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush-]] and [[Blair ministry|Blair]]-administrations didn't find any evidence to support either of these theories, the motivation for the war was changed. In the new motivation, the cause of the war was said to be that [[Saddam Hussein]] had committed crimes against his own population. Taylor means that in modern times, war has to be \"concealed\" under a rhetoric of humanitarian aid, despite the fact that these wars often cause humanitarian crises.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th-century, slums were increasing in number and size across the western world. Criminality, illness, alcoholism and prostitution was common in these areas, and the middle class considered the people who lived in these slums as \"unmoral\" and \"lazy\". The middle class also feared that this underclass sooner or later would \"take over\" because the population growth was greater in these slums than it was in the middle class. This fear gave rise to the scientific study of [[eugenics]], whose founder [[Francis Galton]] had been inspired by [[Charles Darwin]] and his theory of natural selection. According to Galton, society was preventing natural selection by helping \"the weak\", thus causing a spread of the \"negative qualities\" into the rest of the population.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\n=== Theory of the Body and Sexuality ===\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not something objective that stands outside of history and culture. Instead, Foucault argues, the body has been and is continuously shaped by society and history \u2013 by work, diet, body ideals, exercise, medical interventions, etc. Foucault presents no \"theory\" of the body, but does write about it in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' as well as in ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''. Foucault was critical of all purely biological explanations of phenomena such as sexuality, madness and criminality. Further, Foucault argues, that the body is not sufficient as a basis for self-understanding and understanding of others.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\" />\n\nIn ''Discipline and Punish'', Foucault shows how power and the body are tied together, for example by the disciplinary power primarily focusing on individual bodies and their behavior. Foucault argues that power, by manipulating bodies/behavior, also manipulates people's minds. Foucault turns the common saying \"the body is the prison of the soul\" and instead posits that \"the soul is the prison of the body.\"<ref name=\"Oksala2011\" />\n\nAccording to Foucault, [[sexology]] has tried to exert itself as a \"science\" by referring to the material (the body). In contrast to this, Foucault argues that sexology is a pseudoscience, and that \"sex\" is a pseudo-scientific idea. For Foucault the idea of a natural, biologically grounded and fundamental sexuality is a normative historical construct that has also been used as an instrument of power. By describing sex as the biological and fundamental cause to peoples' [[gender identity]], sexual identity and sexual behavior, power has effectively been able to normalize sexual and gendered behavior. This has made it possible to evaluate, pathologize and \"correct\" peoples' sexual and gendered behavior, by comparing bodies behaviors to the constructed \"normal\" behavior. For Foucault, a \"normal sexuality\" is as much of a construct as a \"natural sexuality\". Therefore, Foucault was also critical of the popular discourse that dominated the debate over sexuality during the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, the popular discourse argued for a \"liberation\" of sexuality from a cultural, moral and capitalistic oppression. Foucault, however, argues that peoples' opinions about and experiences of sexuality are ''always'' a result of cultural and power mechanisms. To \"liberate\" sexuality from one group of norms only means that another group of norms takes it place. This, however, does not mean that Foucault considers resistance to be futile. What Foucault argues for is rather that it is impossible to become completely free from power, and that there is simply no \"natural\" sexuality. Power always involves a dimension of resistance, and therefore also a possibility for change. Although Foucault considers it impossible to step outside of power-networks, it is always possible to change these networks or navigate them differently.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not only a \"obedient and passive object\" that is dominated by discourses and power. The body is also the \"seed\" to resistance against dominant discourses and power techniques. The body is never fully compliant, and experiences can never fully be reduced to linguistic descriptions. There is always a possibility to experience something that is not possible to describe with words, and in this discrepancy there is also a possibility for resistance against dominant discourses.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nFoucault's view of the historical construction of the body has influenced many feminist and queer-theorists. According to [[Johanna Oksala]], Foucault's influence on queer theory has been so great than he can be considered one of the founders of queer theory. The fundamental idea behind queer theory is that there is no natural fundament that lies behind identities such as gay, lesbian, heterosexual, etc. Instead these identities are considered cultural constructions that have been constructed through normative discourses and relations of power. Feminists has with the help of Foucault's ideas studied different ways that women form their bodies: through plastic surgery, diet, eating disorders, etc. Foucault's historization of sex has also affected feminist theorists such as [[Judith Butler]], who used Foucault's theories about the relation between subject, power and sex to question gendered subjects. Butler follows Foucault by saying that there is no \"true\" gender behind gender identity that constitutes its biological and objective fundament. However, Butler is critical of Foucault. She argues Foucault \"naively\" presents bodies and pleasures as a ground for resistance against power, without extending his historization of sexuality to gendered subjects/bodies. Foucault has received criticism from other feminists, such as [[Susan Bordo]] and [[Kate Soper]].<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nJohanna Oksala argues that Foucault, by saying that sex/sexuality are constructs, doesn't deny the existence of sexuality. Oksala also argues that the goal of critical theories such as Foucault is not to liberate the body and sexuality from oppression, but rather so question and deny the identities that are posited as \"natural\" and \"essential\" by showing how these identities are historical and cultural constructions.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\n=== Theory of Subjectivity ===\nFoucault considered his primary project to be the investigation of how people through history has been made into \"subjects.\"<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\">Taylor, D.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> According to Foucault, \"the subject\" has, by western philosophers, usually been considered as something given; natural and objective. On the contrary, Foucault considers subjectivity to be a construction created by power.<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\" /> Foucault talks of \"assujettissement\", which is a French term that for Foucault refers to a process where power creates subjects while also oppressing them using social norms. For Foucault \"social norms\" are standards that people are encouraged to follow, that are also used to compare and define people. As an example of \"assujettissement\", Foucault mentions \"homosexual\", a historically contingent type of subjectivity that was created by sexology. Foucault writes that [[sodomy]] was previously considered a serious sexual deviation, but a temporary one. Homosexuality, however, became a \"species\", a past, a childhood and a type of life. \"Homosexuals\" has by the same power that created this subjectivity been discriminated against, due to homosexuality being considered as a deviation from the \"normal\" sexuality. However, Foucault argues, the creation of a subjectivity such as \"homosexuality\" does not only have negative consequences for the people who are subjectivised \u2013 the subjectivity of homosexuality has also led to the creation of gay bars and the [[pride parade]].<ref name=\"Heyes2011\">Heyes, C. J. (2011) Subjectivity and power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 159-172). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Foucault, scientific discourses have played an important role in the disciplinary power system, by classifying and categorizing people, observing their behavior and \"treating\" them when their behavior has been considered \"abnormal\". Sciences such as psychiatry, biology, medicine, economy, psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology, ethnology, pedagogy and criminology have all categorized behaviors as rational, irrational, normal, abnormal, human, inhuman, etc. By doing so, they have all created various types of subjectivity and norms,<ref name=\"Vintges2011\"/> which are then internalized by people as \"truths\". People have then adapted their behavior in order to get closer to what these sciences has labeled as \"normal\".<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/> For example, Foucault claims that psychological observation/surveillance and psychological discourses has created a type of psychology-centered subjectivity, which has led to people considering unhappiness a fault in their psychology rather than in society. This has also, according to Foucault, been a way for society to resist criticism \u2013 criticism against society has been turned against the individual and their psychological health.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\n==== Obesity as a form of subjectivity ====\n[[Cressida J. Heyes]] argues that a modern example of subjectivity is obesity. Subjects are created in two levels: by biopower and by disciplinary power. Biopower has during the 21th-century considered obesity as a \"corruption in the body politics\" and a \"public health catastrophe\". Heyes argues that during the 21th century there has been an anti-obesity discourse that has been enabled by population statistics and public health campaigns. These expressions of bio power, however, relies on disciplinary power, for example by health care institutions gathering information about individuals weight, length, age, etc. that is then used by biopower. The biopower tries to reduce the ''populations\u2032'' deviance from the weight-norm, and disciplinary power tries to reduce the ''individuals\u2032'' deviance from the weight-norm. Biopower and disciplinary power thus create various forms of subjectivity: obesity, underweight, normal weight, and so on. To be obese is not simply a question of where the individual lies in relation to the weight-norm, but it is also considered a marker for the individuals incapacity to regulate their own weight and behavior. This becomes the case not only through the disciplinary institutions (such as health care institutions) exertion of power, but also by a \"confession discourse\" where people are encouraged and expected to \"confess\" their consumption habits, weight, fat percentage, exercising habits, etc. Heyes argues that a modern-day example of this can be seen in online forums centered around weight and weight-loss. These forums contain, according to Heyes, profiles where every individual describes their starting weight, current weight and goal weight. Another example of this that Heyes mentions is video-blogs where people create a \"biography\" centered around their \"weight-loss-journey\". In these ways people also constitute their own subjectivity. However, as with other forms of subjectivity, Heyes argues that these people also experience benefits from constituting themselves as \"obese people\". According to Heyes, these people can feel better, learn new things (about nutrition, for example) and acquire new skills. At the same time, Heyes argues, by accepting this subjectivity people are dragged deeper into a disciplinary power system.<ref name=\"Heyes2011\"/>\n\n==== Subjectivity constituted by individuals in relation to themselves ====\nAccording to Foucault, subjectivity is not necessarily something that is forced upon people externally \u2013 it is also something that is established in a person's relation to themselves.<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\"/> This can, for example, happen when a person is trying to \"find themselves\" or \"be themselves\", something [[Edward McGushin]] describes as a typical modern activity. In this quest for the \"true self\", the self is established in two levels: as a passive object (the \"true self\" that is searched for) and as an active \"searcher\". The ancient [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] and the 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] posited that the \"true self\" can only be found by going through great hardship and/or danger. The ancient [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and 17th-century philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], however, argued that the \"self\" can be found by quiet and solitary introspection. Yet another example is [[Socrates]], who argued that self-awareness can only be found by having debates with others, where the debaters question each other's foundational views and opinions. Foucault, however, argued that \"subjectivity\" is a process, rather than a state of being. As such, Foucault argued that there is no \"true self\" to be found. Rather so, the \"self\" is constituted/created in activities such as the ones employed to \"find\" the \"self\". In other words, exposing oneself to hardships and danger does not \"reveal\" the \"true self\", according to Foucault, but rather creates a particular type of self and subjectivity. However, according to Foucault the \"form\" for the subject is in great part already constituted by power, before these self-constituting practices are employed. Schools, workplaces, households, government institutions, entertainment media and the healthcare sector all, through disciplinary power, contribute to forming people into being particular types of subjects.<ref name=\"McGushin2011\">McGushin, E.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of Freedom ===\nTodd May defines Foucault's concept of freedom as: that which we can do of ourselves within our specific historical context. A condition for this, according to Foucault, is that we are aware of our situation and how it has been created/affected (and is still being affected) by power. According to May, two of the aspects of how power has shaped peoples\u2032 way of being, thinking and acting is described in the books where Foucault describes disciplinary power and the history of sexuality. However, May argues, there will always be aspects of peoples\u2032 formation that will be unknown to them, hence the constant necessity for the type of analyses that Foucault did.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\nFoucault argues that the forces that have affected people can be changed; people always have the capacity to change the factors that limits their freedom.<ref name=\"May2011\"/> Freedom is thus not a state of being, but a practice \u2013 a way of being in relation to oneself, to others and to the world.<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\">Mendieta, E. (2011) The practice of freedom. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 111-124). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> According to Todd May Foucault's concept of freedom also includes constructing histories like the ones Foucault did about the history of disciplinary power and sexuality \u2013 histories that investigate and describe the forces that have influenced people into becoming who they are. From the knowledge that is reached from such investigations, people can thereafter decide which forces they believe are acceptable and which they consider to be intolerable and has to be changed. Freedom is for Foucault a type of \"experimentation\" with different \"transformations\". Since these experiments cannot be controlled completely, May argues they may lead to the reconstruction of intolerable power relations or the creation of new ones. Thus, May argues, it is always necessary to continue with such experimentation and Foucauldian analyses.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\n==== Practice of Critique ====\nFoucault's \"alternative\" to the modern subjectivity is described by Cressida Heyes as \"critique.\" For Foucault there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of subjectivity, since they are all a result of power relations.<ref name=\"Heyes2011\" /> In the same way, Foucault argues there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" norms. All norms and institutions are at the same time enabling as they are oppressing. Therefore, Foucault argues, it is always crucial to continue with the practice of \"critique\".<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\" /> Critique is for Foucault a practice that searches for the processes and events that led to our way of being \u2013 a questioning of who we \"are\" and how this \"we\" came to be. Such a \"critical [[ontology]] of the present\" shows that peoples\u2032 current \"being\" is in fact a historically contingent, unstable and changeable construction. Foucault emphasizes that since the current way of being is not a necessity, it is also possible to change it.<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\" /> Critique also includes investigating how and when people are being enabled and when they are being oppressed by the current norms and institutions, finding ways to reduce limitations on freedom, resist normalization and develop new and different way of relating to oneself and others. Foucault argues that it is impossible to go beyond power relations, but that it is always possible to navigate power relations in a different way.<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\" />\n\n====''Epimeleia heautou'', \"care for the self\" ====\nAs an alternative to the modern \"search\" for the \"true self\",<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" /> and as a part of \"the work of freedom\",<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\" /> Foucault discusses the antique Greek term ''epimeleia heautou'', \"care for the self.\" According to Foucault, among the ancient Greek philosophers, self-awareness was not a goal in itself, but rather something that was sought after in order to \"care for oneself\". Care for the self consists of what Foucault calls \"the art of living\" or \"technologies of the self.\"<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" /> The goal of these techniques was, according to Foucault, to transform oneself into a more ethical person. As an example of this, Foucault mentions [[meditation]],<ref name=\"Vintges2011\" /> the [[stoicism|stoic]] activity of contemplating past and future actions and evaluating if these actions are in line with ones values and goals, and \"contemplation of nature.\" Contemplation of nature is another stoic activity, that consists of reflecting on how \"small\" one's existence is when compared to the greater [[cosmos]].<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" />\n\n=== Theory of Knowledge ===\n{{Main|Power-knowledge}}\nFoucault is described by [[Mary Beth Mader]] as an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] and [[historicism|historicist]].<ref name=\"Mader2014\">Mader, M. B. (2014) Knowledge. Ur Lawlor, L. (red.) & Nale, J. (red.) ''The Cambridge Foucault Lexicon'' (s. 226-236). Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-11921-4}}</ref> Foucault is critical of the idea that humans can reach \"absolute\" knowledge about the world. A fundamental goal in many of Foucault's works is to show how that which has traditionally been considered as absolute, universal and true in fact are historically contingent. To Foucault, even the idea of absolute knowledge is a historically contingent idea. This does however not lead to epistemological nihilism; rather, Foucault argues that we \"always begin anew\" when it comes to knowledge.<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\" /> At the same time Foucault is critical of modern western philosophy for lacking \"spirituality\". With \"spirituality\" Foucault refers to a certain type of ethical being, and the processes that lead to this state of being. Foucault argues that such a spirituality was a natural part of the ancient Greek philosophy, where knowledge was considered as something that was only accessible to those that had an ethical character. According to Foucault this changed in the \"cartesian moment\", the moment when [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] reached the \"insight\" that self-awareness was something given ([[Cogito ergo sum]], \"I think, therefore I am\"), and from this \"insight\" Descartes drew conclusions about God, the world, and knowledge. According to Foucault, since Descartes knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times, Foucault argues, anyone can reach \"knowledge\", as long as they are rational beings, educated, willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this \"modern\" view of knowledge.<ref>Stone, B. E. (2011) Subjectivity and truth. Ur Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (s. 143-157). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nFoucault describes two types of \"knowledge\": \"savoir\" and \"connaissance\", two French terms that both can be translated as \"knowledge\" but with separate meanings for Foucault. By \"savoir\" Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created, while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences, subjects such as \"the rational person\", \"the mentally ill person\", \"the law abiding person\", \"the criminal\", etc. are created, and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is \"connaicance\", while the process in which subjects and knowledge is created is \"savoir\".<ref name=\"Mader2014\"/> A similar term in Foucaults corpus is \"pouvoir/savoir\" (power/knowledge). With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered \"common sense\", but that is created and withheld in that position (as \"common sense\") by power. The term power/knowledge comes from [[Jeremy Bentham]]s idea that [[panopticon]]s wouldn't only be prisons, but would be used for experiments where the criminals\u2032 behaviour would be studied. Power/knowledge thus refers to forms of power where the power compares individuals, measures differences, establishes a norm and then forces this norm unto the subjects. This is especially successful when the established norm is internalized and institutionalized (by \"institutionalized\" Foucault refers to when the norm is omnipresent). Because then, when the norm is internalized and institutionalized, it has effectively become a part of peoples' \"common sense\" \u2013 the \"obvious\", the \"given\", the \"natural\". When this has happened, this \"common sense\" also affects the explicit knowledge (scientific knowledge), Foucault argues. [[Ellen K. Feder]] mean that the premise \"the world consists of women and men\" is an example of this. This premise, Feder argues, has been considered \"common sense\", and has led to the creation of the psychiatric diagnosis [[gender identity disorder]] (GID). For example, during the 1970s, children with behavior that was not considered appropriate for their gender was diagnosed with GID. The treatment then consisted of trying to make the child adapt to the prevailing gender norms. Feder argues that this is an example of power/knowledge since psychiatry, from the \"common sense\" premise \"the world consists of women and men\" (a premise which is upheld in this status by power), created a new diagnosis, a new type of subject and a whole body of knowledge surrounding this new subject.<ref name=\"Feder2011\">Fader, E.

Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive\u2014even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm in order to mount the critique led philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] to describe Foucault's thinking as  \"crypto-normativist\", covertly reliant on the very [[age of enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles he attempts to argue against.<ref>Ashenden, S., & Owen, D. (Eds.). (1999). Foucault contra Habermas: Recasting the dialogue between genealogy and critical theory. Sage.</ref> A similar critique has been advanced by [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]], and by [[Nancy Fraser]] who argues that \"Foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself recourse to concepts such as 'freedom' and 'justice', and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives.\"<ref>Taylor, D. (2010). Michel Foucault: key concepts. Acumen. pp. 2\u20133</ref> Likewise, scholar [[Nancy Pearcey]] points out Foucault's paradoxical stance: \"[when someone] states that it is impossible to attain objectivity, is that an objective statement? The theory undercuts its own claims.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Finding Truth|last=Pearcey|first=Nancy|year=2015|isbn=978-0781413084|location=|page=208}}</ref>\n\n====Genealogy as historical method====\nThe philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that Foucault's \"archaeology of knowledge\" is fundamentally negative, and thus fails to adequately establish any \"new\" theory of knowledge ''per se''. Rather, Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes:\n\n{{quote|As far as I can see, all he has to offer are brilliant redescriptions of the past, supplemented by helpful hints on how to avoid being trapped by old historiographical assumptions. These hints consist largely of saying: \"do not look for progress or meaning in history; do not see the history of a given activity, of any segment of culture, as the development of rationality or of freedom; do not use any philosophical vocabulary to characterize the essence of such activity or the goal it serves; do not assume that the way this activity is presently conducted gives any clue to the goals it served in the past\".<ref>Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.</ref>}}\n\nFoucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses.<ref>Mills, S. (2003). Michel Foucault: Routledge Critical Thinkers. Chicago p. 23</ref> For example, [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] harshly criticized Foucault in 1998.<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', pp. 45\u201395. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref> Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is \"desperatingly undifferentiated\", and Foucault's thesis of a \"disciplinary society\" is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy.<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 81. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref> In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's \"francocentrism\" because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like [[Max Weber]] and [[Norbert Elias]]. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is \"because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism\".<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 91. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref>\n\n====Feminist critiques====\nThough American feminists have built on Foucault's critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality, some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes.<ref name=\"Downing, Lisa 2008\">Downing, Lisa. \"The Cambridge Introduction to Michel Foucault.\" (2008). Cambridge University Press. pp. 104-117</ref>\n\n====Sexuality====\nThe philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] argues in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) that Foucault was incorrect to claim, in ''The History of Sexuality'', that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a \"problematisation\" of the sexual did not occur, concluding that, \"No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|author-link=Roger Scruton|publisher=Phoenix Books|year=1994|isbn=978-1-85799-100-0|location=London|pages=34, 362}}</ref>\n\nFoucault's approach to sexuality, which he sees as socially constructed, has become influential in [[queer theory]]. Foucault's resistance to identity politics, and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of \"object choice\", stands at odds with some theories of queer identity.<ref name=\"Downing, Lisa 2008\"/>\n\n====Social constructionism and human nature====\nFoucault is sometimes criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of [[social constructionism]], which some see as an affront to the concept of [[truth]]. In Foucault's 1971 [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice.<ref>Wilkin, P. (1999). Chomsky and Foucault on human nature and politics: an essential difference?. Social Theory and Practice, pp. 177\u2013210.</ref> Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating \"He struck me as completely amoral, I'd never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something.\"<ref>James Miller, Jim Miller. 1993.  The Passion of Michel Foucault.

{"title_page": "History of the Colorado Rockies", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2012}}\n{{Update|date=October 2012}}\n}}\n\nThe '''History of the Colorado Rockies''' began in 1991 when a [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[expansion team|expansion franchise]] for [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]] was granted to an ownership group headed by John Antonucci.  In [[1993 Colorado Rockies season|1993]], the [[Colorado Rockies]] started play in the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West]] division.  Since that date, the Rockies have reached the MLB postseason four times, each time as the National League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team.  Twice (1995 and 2009) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.  In 2007, the Rockies advanced all the way to the [[World Series]], only to be swept by the [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\n==Creation of the Rockies==\n{{Main|1993 Major League Baseball expansion}}\n\nSeveral previous attempts to bring Major League Baseball to Colorado had failed.  In 1958, New York lawyer [[William Shea]] proposed the new  [[Continental League]] as a rival to the two existing major leagues.  In 1960, the Continental League announced that play would begin in April 1961 with eight teams, including one in Denver headed by [[Bob Howsam]].  However, the new league quickly evaporated, without ever playing a game, when the National League reached expansion agreements to put teams in [[New York Mets|New York City]] and [[Houston Colt 45s|Houston]], removing much of the impetus behind the Continental League effort.  Later on, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] were rumored to be relocating to Denver following the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]] in 1985, but that move did not happen. Repeated rumors of a move to Denver by the [[Oakland Athletics]] also proved false. Nonetheless, by the late 1980s a team seemed to be a possibility in Denver.\n\nThe Colorado Baseball Commission, led by banking executive Larry Varnell, was successful in getting Denver voters to approve a 0.1 percent sales tax to help finance a new baseball stadium. Also, an advisory committee was formed in 1990 by then-Governor of Colorado [[Roy Romer]] to recruit an ownership group. The group selected was led by John Antonucci, an Ohio beverage distributor, and [[Michael I. Monus]], the head of the [[Phar-Mor]] drugstore chain. Local and regional companies\u2014such as Erie Lake, Hensel Phelps Construction, [[KOA (AM)|KOA Radio]], and the [[Rocky Mountain News]]\u2014rounded out the group. On July 5, 1991, the National League approved Denver and [[Miami Marlins|South Florida]] as the sites for two expansion teams to begin play in 1993; with this, MLB now had teams in all four time zones in the contiguous U.S.; the Rockies were the league's first [[Mountain Time Zone]]-based team. The name \"Rockies\" was chosen due to Denver's proximity to the Rocky Mountains, which is reflected in their logo; the name was previously used by the city's first NHL team (who are now the New Jersey Devils).\n\nThe Rockies' first pick in the [[1992 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] was pitcher [[David Nied]] from the [[Atlanta Braves]] organization. Nied pitched 4 seasons for the Rockies.\n\n==Ownership issues==\nAfter a 1992 accounting and [[embezzlement]] scandal at Phar-Mor tarnished Monus' reputation, both Monus and Antonucci were forced to sell their stakes in the franchise.  For a time, no credible offers surfaced from Denver interests, and it looked like the franchise might move to [[Tampa, Florida]] before even playing a game.  Finally, trucking-company executive [[Jerry McMorris]] became head of the ownership group and served as the initial public face of management. His relationship with the other partners was somewhat poor, and his role in the leadership of the franchise diminished over time.  His situation was not helped by the 1999 failure of his trucking firm and subsequent related legal issues.\n\nFinally, in 2005, McMorris was forced to sell his stake in the team to [[Monfort brothers|Charlie and Dick Monfort]].  The Monforts were former executives with [[ConAgra]], which acquired their family's meatpacking and distribution firm in 1987.  Charlie had been CEO of the team since 2003, and Dick had been vice chairman since 1997.  In 2011, Dick succeeded Charlie as chairman and CEO.\n\n==Inaugural season==\n{{main|1993 Colorado Rockies season}}\n\nThe first game in Rockies history was played on April 5, 1993, against the [[1993 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] at [[Shea Stadium]]. [[David Nied]] was the starting pitcher in a game the Rockies lost, 3\u20130. The franchise's first home game at [[Mile High Stadium]], and first win in franchise history, came four days later with an 11\u20134 win over the [[1993 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]. The winning pitcher was [[Bryn Smith]] who beat his former team for the win. One of the most memorable plays in the game, and in team history, occurred in the bottom of the first inning when 2nd baseman, [[Eric Young (baseball)|Eric Young]] of the Rockies hit a [[Leadoff hitter|leadoff]] [[home run]].<ref>{{cite web|author=C.J.

During one stretch in May, the team went 2\u201317. The team did not experience its first winning month until September, when they went 17\u20139. Still, the team finished the season with 67 wins, setting a record for a National League expansion franchise. In addition, despite the losses, the club saw a home attendance of 4,483,350 for the season, setting a Major League record that still stands and isn't likely to be broken. Rockies first baseman [[Andr\u00e9s Galarraga]] won the batting title, hitting .370 for the season after Manager [[Don Baylor]] persuaded Galarraga to change from a standard batting stance into an open one in which he squarely faced the pitcher, allowing him to see incoming pitches properly.\n\n==The mid-1990s==\n{{main|1994 Colorado Rockies season}}\n\n[[Image:Rockiesdinger.JPG|thumb|120px|right|The mascot \"Dinger\" dinosaur.]]\nOn April 17, 1994, the Rockies beat [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal]] 6\u20135, moving the team's record to 6\u20135\u2014the first time in franchise history that the club had a winning record. However, that was the only time during that season that the club had a record over .500, finishing at 53\u201364 and in last place in the National League West in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1994 Major League Baseball season|season]]. Despite the club's poor record, several Rockies hitters gained notoriety for their exploits at the plate, assisted by the thin and dry air of Denver, which purportedly allows balls to carry farther than at sea-level ballparks. Andr\u00e9s Galarraga, a year after winning the batting title, hit 31 home runs, and teammate [[Dante Bichette]] hit 27; projected over a 162-game season, the two would have hit 43 and 37 home runs, respectively. The park's characteristics did not affect just home runs either: 33-year-old outfielder [[Mike Kingery]], a career .252 hitter who did not play in the majors in 1993, batted .349 in 301 at-bats. The club once again led the majors in attendance, drawing 3,281,511 fans for the season.  Had it not been for the strike that ended the season, they may have broken their own season attendance record, as they were on a pace to do just that.\n\n===1995 playoff run and the opening of Coors Field===\n{{main|1995 Colorado Rockies season}}\n\nPrior to the 1995 season, the Rockies acquired free-agent outfielder [[Larry Walker]], previously of the [[Montreal Expos]].  He was one of the four Rockies known collectively as the \"Blake Street Bombers\" -\u2014 named after the street on which the new ballpark ([[Coors Field]]) was located\u2014along with Galarraga, Bichette, and third baseman [[Vinny Castilla]], who had played sparingly with the Rockies during the previous season. The quartet combined to hit 139 homers\u2014each hitting 30 or more\u2014in the strike-shortened [[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995 season]], with Bichette leading the way with 40. The team debuted in its new ballpark on April 26, 1995, in an 11\u20139 win over the [[1995 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], and proceeded to win seven of their first eight games in the new season. The season ended with a 77\u201367 record, good for second place in the West division and the club's first playoff appearance as the Wild Card winner. Although most of the attention focused on the power-hitting lineup, much of the club's success was due to a strong bullpen, as relievers [[Darren Holmes (baseball)|Darren Holmes]], [[Curt Leskanic]], [[Steve Reed (baseball)|Steve Reed]], and [[Bruce Ruffin (baseball)|Bruce Ruffin]] all posted earned-run averages below 3.40. The pitching staff's ERA of 4.97 was the lowest in club history until the 2006 team had a 4.66 ERA. The Rockies lost in the [[1995 National League Division Series|NLDS]] to the eventual [[1995 World Series]] champion [[1995 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], 3 games to 1. The Rockies once again led the league in attendance for the season.\n\n===Post-1995===\nIn 1996, with all four Blake Street Bombers returning, the Rockies expected to contend, but an injury to Walker hurt the team. Walker played in only 83 games and batted .276 with 18 homers. However, outfielder [[Ellis Burks]] picked up the slack with an All-Star season, batting .344 with 40 homers and 128 RBI\u2014one of three Rockies to hit forty or more homers that season, along with Galarraga and Castilla. The four Blake Street Bombers\u2014now consisting of Bichette, Burks, Castilla, and Galarraga\u2014once again hit at least 30 home runs each. The team set a major-league record by scoring 658 runs at home on the season, and Burks and Bichette became the first pair of teammates since [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]] of the 1987 [[New York Mets]] to both steal 30 bases and hit 30 homers in the same season. However, the pitching staff\u2014a strong point for the team in 1995\u2014was beset by injuries: [[Bill Swift]], who went 9\u20133 in 1995, started just three games, and the staff ERA ballooned to 5.60. As a result, the Rockies fell back to third place in the West with an 83\u201379 record.\n\nA healthy Walker became the first player in club history to win the NL [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] award in 1997, batting .366 with 49 homers and 130 RBI. Walker came very close to winning the Triple Crown that year, leading the league in home runs but finishing second to [[Tony Gwynn]] in batting average and third in RBI (teammate Galarraga led the league.) Once again, three Rockies (Walker, Galarraga, and Castilla) hit 40 or more homers; Walker also won the first [[Gold Glove]] in franchise history. As in 1996, though, the team's pitchers struggled and had a 5.25 ERA, and the Rockies could not improve upon their finish from the previous season.\n\n==The beginning of the Helton era==\n[[Image:Rockiespic.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Left to right, Troy Tulowitzki, Todd Helton, and Jamey Carroll in 2007.]]\n[[Image:Coloradorockies.JPG|220px|thumb|left|Colorado Rockies celebrate their second straight victory against the [[New York Yankees]] in [[Coors Field]] on June 19, 2007.]]\nThe Rockies were broken up after the 1997 season when an aging Galarraga signed with the [[Atlanta Braves]] as a free agent. His replacement was [[Todd Helton]], who had been the club's first-round draft pick in 1995 out of the [[University of Tennessee]]. After a 4\u20131 start, the club lost its next eight games and struggled to a 77\u201385 record, finishing only ahead of the expansion [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the NL West. Pitcher [[Darryl Kile]], signed as a free agent in the offseason, struggled in Colorado, going 13\u201317 with a 5.20 ERA\u2014a far cry from his numbers the prior year as a member of the [[Houston Astros]], when he went 19\u20137 with a 2.57 ERA. Kile became one of a long line of free-agent pitchers who struggled after signing with the Rockies. The team's struggles led to the firing of manager [[Don Baylor]], the only manager in franchise history, following the season.\n\n[[Jim Leyland]], a two-time NL [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] who had won the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] with the [[Florida Marlins]] two years earlier, was expected to bring the Rockies back into contention in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]]. Instead, the Rockies dropped even further, finishing 72\u201390 and in last place in the West as the [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] won the division in just their second year of existence. Helton was blossoming into a young developed hitter, batting .320 with 35 homers and 113 RBI; Castilla, Walker, and Bichette also hit more than 30 homers each. Once again, though, the team's pitching was a glaring weakness, as the staff had an ERA of 6.02. Kile, who was being paid over $8 million for the season, struggled mightily, going 8\u201313 with a 6.61 ERA, and he wound up being traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] following the season. Kile finished fifth in voting for the [[Cy Young Award]] the following year, as he had in 1997 (the year before he joined the Rockies). The Leyland era lasted just one year, as a frustrated Leyland retired following the season, not to manage in the majors again until 2006, when he won an AL Pennant with the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\nOn April 4, 1999, the Rockies made history as they played their [[Opening Day]] game against the defending National League champion [[1999 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] at [[Estadio de Beisbol Monterrey]] in [[Monterrey]], Mexico \u2013 marking the first time Major League Baseball opened the regular season outside the United States or Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/events/opening_day.jsp?content=od_facts |title=The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Events: Opening Day |publisher=Pressbox.mlb.com |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/notebook?page=bbtn |title=Baseball Tonight Clubhouse: Looking Up \u2013 MLB |publisher=ESPN  |date=November 2, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6D81139F936A35757C0A96F958260 | work=The New York Times | title=BASEBALL; Bichette and Castilla Spark Rockies in Opener in Mexico | date=April 5, 1999 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>  Colorado beat San Diego, 8\u20132, in front of a crowd of 27,104 people. Only a little over 2 weeks later, the [[Columbine High School massacre]] postponed a home game with the [[Montreal Expos]] (it was made up as part of a doubleheader in August).\n\n==The beginning of the Dan O'Dowd era==\nOn August 20, 1999, [[Bob Gebhard]], the only general manager in franchise history, announced his resignation. A month later, the Rockies named [[Dan O'Dowd]] as his replacement. After hiring [[Buddy Bell]] as the club's third manager, O'Dowd proceeded to make a series of offseason deals that changed the face of the franchise. Popular outfielder [[Dante Bichette]] was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Later, he traded Kile to the Cardinals and, in a four-team trade, sent [[Vinny Castilla]] to the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]. With those two deals, [[Larry Walker]] remained as the only player of the Blake Street Bombers still with the team. Walker wound up playing in only 87 games in 2000 due to injuries and hit just nine homers, as the Rockies had a completely different look from prior years. Perhaps not surprisingly given the injury to Walker and the trading of two of the team's most popular players, the Rockies finished third in the National League in attendance in 2000, marking the first time in club history that it did not lead the league in attendance.\n\nDespite the major changes made to the team in the offseason, the team wound up with its first winning season since 1997. Helton, in his third full year in the majors, was becoming a bona fide superstar, winning the batting title with a .372 average and also leading the league with 147 RBI while hitting 42 homers. However, he finished just fifth in MVP voting, perhaps because the team finished fourth in the division and also possibly due to bias by voters because he played half of his games in hitter-friendly [[Coors Field]]. 2000 also marked the first of five consecutive [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearances for Helton. The pitching staff also improved its ERA to 5.26, helping the team to an 82\u201380 record.\n\nAlthough previous big-name pitchers, including [[Bill Swift]], [[Bret Saberhagen]], and [[Darryl Kile]], had struggled in Colorado, following the 2000 season O'Dowd made two very splashy signings in the free-agent market, signing [[Denny Neagle]] to a five-year contract worth $51 million, followed five days later by signing [[Mike Hampton]] to an eight-year, $121 million contract. Two years earlier, Hampton had won 22 games and finished second in voting for the [[Cy Young Award]] as a member of the [[Houston Astros]], while Neagle had been a 20-game winner in 1997 for the [[Atlanta Braves]] and had won fifteen games in 2000. The two star pitchers were expected by the Rockies to change the team's fortunes.\n\nInstead, the two flopped, much as their predecessors had. Hampton, after a strong first half in 2001, completely fell apart in 2002, going 7\u201315 with a 6.15 ERA and demanding a trade following the season. Neagle went 19\u201323 in three years with the Rockies; he was injured in 2003 and never pitched in the majors again before the Rockies released him after the 2004 season. The Rockies went 73\u201389 in both years that Hampton and Neagle were in Colorado, and the amount of money owed them (the Rockies paid a sizable portion of Hampton's salary even after he was traded to the Atlanta Braves) crippled the team for the next several years.\n\nUnder previous general manager Gebhard, the Rockies had largely neglected their farm system and mostly relied on signing veteran free agents from other clubs; this was possible due to the high attendance numbers in the club's first few years of attendance. However, as attendance began to dwindle\u2014the Rockies fell to just sixth in the National League in attendance in 2002, and ninth in 2003 and 2004\u2014the club could no longer afford to build through big-name free agents. In 1999, the Rockies spent their first-round draft pick on [[Baylor University]] pitcher [[Jason Jennings]]; three years later, Jennings went 16\u20138 with a 4.52 ERA. In the process, Jennings became the first Rockies player to win the National League [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award.\n\nWith Hampton out of town and Neagle injured much of the year, Jennings became the centerpiece of the Rockies' pitching staff in 2003. Despite a fourth straight All-Star season by Helton and 36 homers by outfielder [[Preston Wilson]], the Rockies finished just 74\u201388. In addition to Jennings, though, young pitchers [[Shawn Chac\u00f3n]] and [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]] showed promise.\n\nIn 2004, the Rockies acquired [[Vinny Castilla]], who had been with the club for its inaugural 1993 season, once again, and he hit 35 homers. However, Wilson and [[Larry Walker]] spent much of the season on the disabled list, forcing the Rockies to play [[Matt Holliday]], who had been slated to start the season at Triple-A. While the Rockies struggled to a 68\u201394 record\u2014the second worst record in club history\u2014the club's Triple-A affiliate, the [[Colorado Springs Sky Sox]], went 78\u201365. Declining attendance meant that the club's payroll could no longer support a franchise stocked largely with veterans from other clubs. In addition, Walker, who had been with the team since 1995 and was widely regarded as the best player in team history, was now 37 years old, and injuries prevented him from playing much of the time. Because he could still be useful to a contending team, the Rockies traded him to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in August for three minor-leaguers.\n\n==Generation-R==\n[[Image:ColoradoRockies01.JPG|thumb|right|250px| Former manager [[Clint Hurdle]] making a pitching change.]]\n[[Image:Rockiescelebratewin.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Colorado Rockies on June 19, 2007 in Coors Field.]]\nThe trade of Walker set in motion a series of moves that led to an overhaul of the club's roster. Castilla and [[Jeromy Burnitz]], who led the team with 37 homers in 2004, were allowed to leave as free agents following the season. Catcher [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]], who had been acquired along with Wilson in the Hampton trade, was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]]. [[Royce Clayton]], the club's starting shortstop in 2004, also was allowed to leave. Along with Holliday, who had performed ably while Wilson and Walker were out, the club promoted [[Garrett Atkins]], [[Brad Hawpe]], [[Clint Barmes]], and [[J.D. Closser]], who spent most of 2004 in Triple-A. Jennings and Chacon combined with [[Joe Kennedy (baseball)|Joe Kennedy]], [[Byung-hyun Kim]], and top prospect [[Jeff Francis]] to form the team's starting rotation. Other than Helton and Wilson, virtually all of the team's regular players were under the age of 30; the Rockies dubbed this group \"Generation-R.\"\n\n===2005 season===\n{{Main|2005 Colorado Rockies season}}\nThe result of all the moves was a 67\u201395 record in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], which tied for the worst record in franchise history, as the young players\u2014many of whom had never been everyday players in the majors prior to that season\u2014struggled. Helton and Wilson\u2014virtually the only experienced players on the team\u2014struggled as well; Helton hit just 20 homers, the fewest of his career, and missed the All-Star Game for the first time since 1999 and also went on the disabled list for the first time in his career. Wilson also spent time on the disabled list and, as the Rockies fell out of contention, was traded to the [[Washington Nationals]]. After starting the season 15\u201335, though, the team had some success later in the year, going a respectable 30\u201328 in August and September as the youngsters became more experienced. However, perhaps because of the trade of Walker and several consecutive losing seasons, the team fell all the way to fourteenth in the National League in attendance; for the first time in team history, the Rockies drew under 2 million fans for the season.\n\n===2006 season===\n{{Main|2006 Colorado Rockies season}}\nThe [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006 season]] started with some promise; the Rockies were 44\u201343 in the first half of the season and were in contention in the NL West for much of the season. However, the team faded in the second half and wound up at 76\u201386, tied for fourth place in the division. Despite this, several of the young players showed promise. [[Matt Holliday]] hit 34 homers and was named to the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]; [[Garrett Atkins]] batted .329 and hit 29 homers. In addition, the pitching staff posted a 4.66 ERA\u2014the best in team history\u2014and starters [[Jason Jennings]], [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]], and [[Jeff Francis]] had good seasons.\n\n===2007: \"Rocktober\"&nbsp;\u2013 A World Series birth===\n{{Main|2007 Colorado Rockies season}}\nThe Rockies trailed the [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], the [[2007 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the [[2007 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] for most of [[2007 Major League Baseball season]]; however by August, Colorado showed a steady series of wins, while the Division-leading Dodgers began to struggle.\n\nBy September, the Dodgers were eliminated by the Rockies from playoff contention, and the Diamondbacks were expected to clinch the [[National League West]] division title. The Padres held a steady lead on the [[National League]] [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] spot. The Diamondbacks eventually clinched the NL West division title, but the Rockies shot up with one of the greatest comebacks in baseball history.

His successor as manager was [[Jim Tracy (baseball)|Jim Tracy]], who was originally hired as bench coach for the Colorado Rockies in November 2008. In June 2009, the team rapidly improved and by the end of June, the Rockies set a franchise record for victories in a month with 21 in a 28-game stretch (one win better than the September 2007 Rocktober run).  This improved their record from 20\u201329 and nine games under .500, to 41\u201336 and 5 games over .500.  During June, the Rockies led all of major league baseball with 151 total runs.  The Rockies had two players selected to the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]: right fielder [[Brad Hawpe]] and starting pitcher [[Jason Marquis]]. On August 10, [[Troy Tulowitzki]] hit the team's 5th franchise [[hit for the cycle|cycle]].  He became the second player in major league history to hit for the cycle and have an [[unassisted triple play]], which he did on April 29, 2007, in his career.\n\nOn August 24, the Rockies faced the [[San Francisco Giants]] in what ended up being a 14 inning game which lasted close to 5 hours(4:57), the second longest game in Rockies history. After multiple scoreless innings, the Giants managed to score three runs in the top of the 14th to place them ahead of the Rockies, 4\u20131. After several Colorado at-bats, the bases were loaded and [[Ryan Spilborghs]] stepped up to the plate. Spilborghs hit the first walk-off [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] in Rockies history, his second career grand slam, and his first [[walk-off homer]] in the 14th inning to squeak by the Giants, 6\u20134, Monday in front of about half of the 27,670 fans who remained at [[Coors Field]].  The play has since been dubbed \"SpillySlam\".{{According to whom|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis particular win expanded the Rockies' [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]] lead to four games over Giants. In an ecstatic interview after the game, [[Jim Tracy (baseball)|Jim Tracy]] stated that he told the Rockies' preceding batter, [[relief pitcher]] [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], not to swing: \"Even if Miller threw three balls down the Middle, take the strikeout because I wanted Spilly to get a chance to hit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=290824127 |title=Spilborghs' 14th-inning grand slam rallies Rockies by Giants \u2013 MLB |publisher=ESPN  |date=August 25, 2009 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}</ref>  The strategy worked in the Rockies' favor; Eaton [[walk (baseball)|walked]] with the bases loaded, scoring [[Dexter Fowler]] to cut the Giants' lead to 4\u20132.\n\nFollowing the win, Colorado hosted [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]] with a chance to pull into a tie for the division lead if they could sweep.  On August 25, the Rockies won 5\u20134 on another walk-off thanks to Troy Tulowitzki's bases loaded, one out [[Single (baseball)|single]] in the bottom of the 10th. However, Los Angeles, won the next two games, and with their wild card lead down to 3 games, the Rockies traveled to San Francisco for another 3-game set.  After losing each of the first two games by two runs, the Rockies opened up a 5\u20132 lead against [[Matt Cain]] in the finale of the series on August 30.  But with two outs and the bases loaded in the 7th, in a scene eerily similar to the Ryan Spilborghs walk-off, [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] hit a go-ahead grand slam off of [[Rafael Betancourt]], propelling the Giants to a 9\u20135 win and a tie in the Wild Card standings entering September.\n\nColorado responded by winning 10 of their first 11 games in September, including a 9\u20131 home stand.  When they returned to San Francisco for their final series with the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] on September 14, the Rockies had once again built a large Wild Card lead.  But as in the previous series, San Francisco won the first two games behind [[Tim Lincecum]] and [[Barry Zito]], cutting the Rockies wild card lead to 2.5 games.  In a pivotal swing game that could have had the Rockies leave San Francisco with either a 1.5 game lead or a 3.5 game lead, Colorado once again built a large lead against [[Matt Cain]] in the finale of the series on September 16.  Thanks to 8 brilliant innings from [[Jorge de la Rosa]], and [[home runs]] from [[Troy Tulowitzki]] and [[Ian Stewart (baseball)|Ian Stewart]], the Rockies took a 4\u20130 lead into the bottom of the 9th.  With closer [[Huston Street]] injured, the Rockies turned to [[Franklin Morales]], but the Giants started the inning with 3 straight hits to pull to within 4\u20131. [[Rafael Betancourt]] was summoned once again, and induced a [[ground ball]] off [[Juan Uribe]]'s bat.  However, an errant throw by Tulowitzki sailed past [[Clint Barmes]] and into [[right field]], scoring another [[run (baseball)|run]] and putting runners at 1st and 3rd.  Pinch runner [[Eugenio V\u00e9lez]] then stole second base, putting the tying run in scoring position.  In a rematch of their August match-up, Betancourt got [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] to pop out on the [[infield]] for the first out.  However, [[pinch hitter]] [[Randy Winn]] followed with an RBI [[Baseball rules|groundout]], cutting the deficit to 4\u20133 and moving the tying run to 3rd.  With a full count, [[Rafael Betancourt|Betancourt]] struck out [[pinch hitter]] [[Nate Schierholtz]] to secure the [[save (baseball)|save]].\n\nAs the Giants began to fade, the [[Atlanta Braves]] started making a run at the Rockies that was starting to look similar to Colorado's 2007 run.  From September 8 through September 28, the Braves won 16 of 19 to pull from nearly 7 back to just 2 back in the season's final week.  It took several dramatic wins for Colorado to hang on to its lead.  On September 25, the Rockies played host to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].  With [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]] returning from an injury, the Rockies won 2\u20131 in the bottom of the 9th on a [[Yorvit Torrealba]] [[sacrifice fly]].  Two days later, the Rockies took a 4\u20133 lead into the bottom of the 9th.  Back from injury, [[Huston Street]] attempted to close out a two inning save, but got into a jam.  The [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] put runners on the corners with one out for [[Ryan Ludwick]]. Ludwick flared a flyball into shallow right. Rockies second baseman [[Clint Barmes]], playing in, made a miraculous over the shoulder diving catch after a long run, and doubled off [[Albert Pujols]], who thought the ball was going to drop and was nearly at third base, to end the game.  Much like the 2007 play-in game when it was not clear whether or not [[Matt Holliday]] had touched [[home plate]] with the game-winning run, there was question as to whether Barmes actually caught the ball, as photos later emerged showing the ball apparently sliding down his arm as he went to the ground.  Ironically, Holliday, traded from [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]] to St. Louis in July, was in the opposing [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] watching the play.\n[[Image:Coors Crowded.jpg|thumb|right|230pix|Coors Field during Game 3 of the NLDS.]]\n\nOn September 29, their lead down to 2 games and their magic number at 5, the Rockies opened their final home series against [[Milwaukee Brewers|Milwaukee]].  During the game, Atlanta had their 7-game win streak snapped by Florida 5\u20134, meaning the Rockies could reduce their magic number to 3 with a win.  Colorado built a 5\u20132 lead and turned the ball to Street.  However, with one out and two on, Street blew his first save of the season, allowing a game-tying home run to [[Jason Kendall]].  In the bottom of the 11th, [[Chris Iannetta]] pinch hit with the winning run on first.  Seldom used and having batted only 12 times in the month, Iannetta hit a 3\u20132 pitch from [[David Weathers]] deep to [[right field]] for a walk-off 2-run home run, propelling Colorado to a 7\u20135 win.  The win combined with the Braves loss seemed to once again shift momentum.  The Braves lost again the following night, and the Rockies 10\u20136 win set their magic number at 1.\n\nOn October 1, the Rockies beat the Milwaukee Brewers 9\u20132, completing a season sweep of the Brewers and clinching the Rockies' second playoff appearance in three years.  The victory also marked the club's 91st win of the season, breaking the franchise record set in 2007. The team broke its record of 22 games over .500 in this victory also. Despite making the race very close, in the 161st game of the season, the Dodgers snapped their five-game losing streak \u2013 and the Rockies' five-game winning streak \u2013 to clinch the West title.

Michael Cuddyer had a franchise record 27-game hitting streak. However, both Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez missed time with injuries. The club faded in the second half of season, finishing in last place at 74\u201388. Towards the end of the season, Todd Helton announced his retirement after a seventeen-year career, playing his final home game on September 24.

Following the season, Walt Weiss was not retained as the team's manager and was replaced by [[Bud Black]].\n\n===2017===\n{{Main|2017 Colorado Rockies season}}\nWith the aim of contending in 2017, the Rockies signed free agents [[Greg Holland]] and [[Ian Desmond]].\n\nThe 2017 season saw the Rockies sprint to a 47\u201326 record and first place in the division by June 20. Though the team cooled off significantly afterwards, they still managed to finish in third place with an 87\u201375 record, their first winning season since 2010 and good enough for the National League's second Wild Card. The season ended with an 11\u20138 loss to the division rival [[Arizona Diamondbacks|Diamondbacks]] in the [[2017 National League Wild Card Game]].\n\n===2018===\n{{Main|2018 Colorado Rockies season}}\nLooking to build on the previous year, the Rockies spent significant money on their bullpen, signing relievers [[Wade Davis (baseball)|Wade Davis]] and [[Bryan Shaw (baseball)|Bryan Shaw]] to multi-year contracts.\n\nThe team suffered from inconsistent play and bullpen struggles throughout the first three months, falling to 38\u201342 with a loss to the Giants on June 27. Following that, the team immediately began to turn things around, going 53-29 the rest of the season. The Rockies entered September battling with the Dodgers and Diamondbacks for the division title. The Rockies clinched a playoff spot on September 28, marking the first back-to-back postseason appearances for the team. However the Rockies would lose to the Dodgers in the [[2018 National League West tie-breaker game]], finishing at 91\u201372, their best mark since 2009 and in the second Wild Card position.

Five days later on October 22, California-based ticket vendor Paciolan, Inc., the sole contractor authorized by the Colorado Rockies to distribute tickets, was forced to suspend sales after less than an hour due to an overwhelming number of attempts to purchase tickets.\n\nAn official release from the baseball organization claimed that they were the victims of a [[denial of service attack]].

In [[1993 Colorado Rockies season|1993]], the [[Colorado Rockies]] started play in the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West]] division.  Since that date, the Rockies have reached the MLB postseason four times, each time as the National League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team.  Twice (1995 and 2009) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.  In 2007, the Rockies advanced all the way to the [[World Series]], only to be swept by the [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\n==Creation of the Rockies==\n{{Main|1993 Major League Baseball expansion}}\n\nSeveral previous attempts to bring Major League Baseball to Colorado had failed.  In 1958, New York lawyer [[William Shea]] proposed the new  [[Continental League]] as a rival to the two existing major leagues.  In 1960, the Continental League announced that play would begin in April 1961 with eight teams, including one in Denver headed by [[Bob Howsam]].  However, the new league quickly evaporated, without ever playing a game, when the National League reached expansion agreements to put teams in [[New York Mets|New York City]] and [[Houston Colt 45s|Houston]], removing much of the impetus behind the Continental League effort.  Later on, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] were rumored to be relocating to Denver following the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]] in 1985, but that move did not happen. Repeated rumors of a move to Denver by the [[Oakland Athletics]] also proved false. Nonetheless, by the late 1980s a team seemed to be a possibility in Denver.\n\nThe Colorado Baseball Commission, led by banking executive Larry Varnell, was successful in getting Denver voters to approve a 0.1 percent sales tax to help finance a new baseball stadium. Also, an advisory committee was formed in 1990 by then-Governor of Colorado [[Roy Romer]] to recruit an ownership group. The group selected was led by John Antonucci, an Ohio beverage distributor, and [[Michael I. Monus]], the head of the [[Phar-Mor]] drugstore chain. Local and regional companies\u2014such as Erie Lake, Hensel Phelps Construction, [[KOA (AM)|KOA Radio]], and the [[Rocky Mountain News]]\u2014rounded out the group. On July 5, 1991, the National League approved Denver and [[Miami Marlins|South Florida]] as the sites for two expansion teams to begin play in 1993; with this, MLB now had teams in all four time zones in the contiguous U.S.; the Rockies were the league's first [[Mountain Time Zone]]-based team. The name \"Rockies\" was chosen due to Denver's proximity to the Rocky Mountains, which is reflected in their logo; the name was previously used by the city's first NHL team (who are now the New Jersey Devils).\n\nThe Rockies' first pick in the [[1992 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] was pitcher [[David Nied]] from the [[Atlanta Braves]] organization. Nied pitched 4 seasons for the Rockies.\n\n==Ownership issues==\nAfter a 1992 accounting and [[embezzlement]] scandal at Phar-Mor tarnished Monus' reputation, both Monus and Antonucci were forced to sell their stakes in the franchise.  For a time, no credible offers surfaced from Denver interests, and it looked like the franchise might move to [[Tampa, Florida]] before even playing a game.  Finally, trucking-company executive [[Jerry McMorris]] became head of the ownership group and served as the initial public face of management. His relationship with the other partners was somewhat poor, and his role in the leadership of the franchise diminished over time.  His situation was not helped by the 1999 failure of his trucking firm and subsequent related legal issues.\n\nFinally, in 2005, McMorris was forced to sell his stake in the team to [[Monfort brothers|Charlie and Dick Monfort]].  The Monforts were former executives with [[ConAgra]], which acquired their family's meatpacking and distribution firm in 1987.  Charlie had been CEO of the team since 2003, and Dick had been vice chairman since 1997.  In 2011, Dick succeeded Charlie as chairman and CEO.\n\n==Inaugural season==\n{{main|1993 Colorado Rockies season}}\n\nThe first game in Rockies history was played on April 5, 1993, against the [[1993 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] at [[Shea Stadium]]. [[David Nied]] was the starting pitcher in a game the Rockies lost, 3\u20130. The franchise's first home game at [[Mile High Stadium]], and first win in franchise history, came four days later with an 11\u20134 win over the [[1993 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]. The winning pitcher was [[Bryn Smith]] who beat his former team for the win. One of the most memorable plays in the game, and in team history, occurred in the bottom of the first inning when 2nd baseman, [[Eric Young (baseball)|Eric Young]] of the Rockies hit a [[Leadoff hitter|leadoff]] [[home run]].<ref>{{cite web|author=C.J.

During one stretch in May, the team went 2\u201317. The team did not experience its first winning month until September, when they went 17\u20139. Still, the team finished the season with 67 wins, setting a record for a National League expansion franchise. In addition, despite the losses, the club saw a home attendance of 4,483,350 for the season, setting a Major League record that still stands and isn't likely to be broken. Rockies first baseman [[Andr\u00e9s Galarraga]] won the batting title, hitting .370 for the season after Manager [[Don Baylor]] persuaded Galarraga to change from a standard batting stance into an open one in which he squarely faced the pitcher, allowing him to see incoming pitches properly.\n\n==The mid-1990s==\n{{main|1994 Colorado Rockies season}}\n\n[[Image:Rockiesdinger.JPG|thumb|120px|right|The mascot \"Dinger\" dinosaur.]]\nOn April 17, 1994, the Rockies beat [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal]] 6\u20135, moving the team's record to 6\u20135\u2014the first time in franchise history that the club had a winning record. However, that was the only time during that season that the club had a record over .500, finishing at 53\u201364 and in last place in the National League West in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1994 Major League Baseball season|season]]. Despite the club's poor record, several Rockies hitters gained notoriety for their exploits at the plate, assisted by the thin and dry air of Denver, which purportedly allows balls to carry farther than at sea-level ballparks. Andr\u00e9s Galarraga, a year after winning the batting title, hit 31 home runs, and teammate [[Dante Bichette]] hit 27; projected over a 162-game season, the two would have hit 43 and 37 home runs, respectively. The park's characteristics did not affect just home runs either: 33-year-old outfielder [[Mike Kingery]], a career .252 hitter who did not play in the majors in 1993, batted .349 in 301 at-bats. The club once again led the majors in attendance, drawing 3,281,511 fans for the season.  Had it not been for the strike that ended the season, they may have broken their own season attendance record, as they were on a pace to do just that.\n\n===1995 playoff run and the opening of Coors Field===\n{{main|1995 Colorado Rockies season}}\n\nPrior to the 1995 season, the Rockies acquired free-agent outfielder [[Larry Walker]], previously of the [[Montreal Expos]].  He was one of the four Rockies known collectively as the \"Blake Street Bombers\" -\u2014 named after the street on which the new ballpark ([[Coors Field]]) was located\u2014along with Galarraga, Bichette, and third baseman [[Vinny Castilla]], who had played sparingly with the Rockies during the previous season. The quartet combined to hit 139 homers\u2014each hitting 30 or more\u2014in the strike-shortened [[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995 season]], with Bichette leading the way with 40. The team debuted in its new ballpark on April 26, 1995, in an 11\u20139 win over the [[1995 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], and proceeded to win seven of their first eight games in the new season. The season ended with a 77\u201367 record, good for second place in the West division and the club's first playoff appearance as the Wild Card winner. Although most of the attention focused on the power-hitting lineup, much of the club's success was due to a strong bullpen, as relievers [[Darren Holmes (baseball)|Darren Holmes]], [[Curt Leskanic]], [[Steve Reed (baseball)|Steve Reed]], and [[Bruce Ruffin (baseball)|Bruce Ruffin]] all posted earned-run averages below 3.40. The pitching staff's ERA of 4.97 was the lowest in club history until the 2006 team had a 4.66 ERA. The Rockies lost in the [[1995 National League Division Series|NLDS]] to the eventual [[1995 World Series]] champion [[1995 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], 3 games to 1. The Rockies once again led the league in attendance for the season.\n\n===Post-1995===\nIn 1996, with all four Blake Street Bombers returning, the Rockies expected to contend, but an injury to Walker hurt the team. Walker played in only 83 games and batted .276 with 18 homers. However, outfielder [[Ellis Burks]] picked up the slack with an All-Star season, batting .344 with 40 homers and 128 RBI\u2014one of three Rockies to hit forty or more homers that season, along with Galarraga and Castilla. The four Blake Street Bombers\u2014now consisting of Bichette, Burks, Castilla, and Galarraga\u2014once again hit at least 30 home runs each. The team set a major-league record by scoring 658 runs at home on the season, and Burks and Bichette became the first pair of teammates since [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]] of the 1987 [[New York Mets]] to both steal 30 bases and hit 30 homers in the same season. However, the pitching staff\u2014a strong point for the team in 1995\u2014was beset by injuries: [[Bill Swift]], who went 9\u20133 in 1995, started just three games, and the staff ERA ballooned to 5.60. As a result, the Rockies fell back to third place in the West with an 83\u201379 record.\n\nA healthy Walker became the first player in club history to win the NL [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] award in 1997, batting .366 with 49 homers and 130 RBI. Walker came very close to winning the Triple Crown that year, leading the league in home runs but finishing second to [[Tony Gwynn]] in batting average and third in RBI (teammate Galarraga led the league.) Once again, three Rockies (Walker, Galarraga, and Castilla) hit 40 or more homers; Walker also won the first [[Gold Glove]] in franchise history. As in 1996, though, the team's pitchers struggled and had a 5.25 ERA, and the Rockies could not improve upon their finish from the previous season.\n\n==The beginning of the Helton era==\n[[Image:Rockiespic.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Left to right, Troy Tulowitzki, Todd Helton, and Jamey Carroll in 2007.]]\n[[Image:Coloradorockies.JPG|220px|thumb|left|Colorado Rockies celebrate their second straight victory against the [[New York Yankees]] in [[Coors Field]] on June 19, 2007.]]\nThe Rockies were broken up after the 1997 season when an aging Galarraga signed with the [[Atlanta Braves]] as a free agent. His replacement was [[Todd Helton]], who had been the club's first-round draft pick in 1995 out of the [[University of Tennessee]]. After a 4\u20131 start, the club lost its next eight games and struggled to a 77\u201385 record, finishing only ahead of the expansion [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the NL West. Pitcher [[Darryl Kile]], signed as a free agent in the offseason, struggled in Colorado, going 13\u201317 with a 5.20 ERA\u2014a far cry from his numbers the prior year as a member of the [[Houston Astros]], when he went 19\u20137 with a 2.57 ERA. Kile became one of a long line of free-agent pitchers who struggled after signing with the Rockies. The team's struggles led to the firing of manager [[Don Baylor]], the only manager in franchise history, following the season.\n\n[[Jim Leyland]], a two-time NL [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] who had won the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] with the [[Florida Marlins]] two years earlier, was expected to bring the Rockies back into contention in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]]. Instead, the Rockies dropped even further, finishing 72\u201390 and in last place in the West as the [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] won the division in just their second year of existence. Helton was blossoming into a young developed hitter, batting .320 with 35 homers and 113 RBI; Castilla, Walker, and Bichette also hit more than 30 homers each. Once again, though, the team's pitching was a glaring weakness, as the staff had an ERA of 6.02. Kile, who was being paid over $8 million for the season, struggled mightily, going 8\u201313 with a 6.61 ERA, and he wound up being traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] following the season. Kile finished fifth in voting for the [[Cy Young Award]] the following year, as he had in 1997 (the year before he joined the Rockies). The Leyland era lasted just one year, as a frustrated Leyland retired following the season, not to manage in the majors again until 2006, when he won an AL Pennant with the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\nOn April 4, 1999, the Rockies made history as they played their [[Opening Day]] game against the defending National League champion [[1999 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] at [[Estadio de Beisbol Monterrey]] in [[Monterrey]], Mexico \u2013 marking the first time Major League Baseball opened the regular season outside the United States or Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/events/opening_day.jsp?content=od_facts |title=The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Events: Opening Day |publisher=Pressbox.mlb.com |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/notebook?page=bbtn |title=Baseball Tonight Clubhouse: Looking Up \u2013 MLB |publisher=ESPN  |date=November 2, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6D81139F936A35757C0A96F958260 | work=The New York Times | title=BASEBALL; Bichette and Castilla Spark Rockies in Opener in Mexico | date=April 5, 1999 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>  Colorado beat San Diego, 8\u20132, in front of a crowd of 27,104 people. Only a little over 2 weeks later, the [[Columbine High School massacre]] postponed a home game with the [[Montreal Expos]] (it was made up as part of a doubleheader in August).\n\n==The beginning of the Dan O'Dowd era==\nOn August 20, 1999, [[Bob Gebhard]], the only general manager in franchise history, announced his resignation. A month later, the Rockies named [[Dan O'Dowd]] as his replacement. After hiring [[Buddy Bell]] as the club's third manager, O'Dowd proceeded to make a series of offseason deals that changed the face of the franchise. Popular outfielder [[Dante Bichette]] was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Later, he traded Kile to the Cardinals and, in a four-team trade, sent [[Vinny Castilla]] to the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]. With those two deals, [[Larry Walker]] remained as the only player of the Blake Street Bombers still with the team. Walker wound up playing in only 87 games in 2000 due to injuries and hit just nine homers, as the Rockies had a completely different look from prior years. Perhaps not surprisingly given the injury to Walker and the trading of two of the team's most popular players, the Rockies finished third in the National League in attendance in 2000, marking the first time in club history that it did not lead the league in attendance.\n\nDespite the major changes made to the team in the offseason, the team wound up with its first winning season since 1997. Helton, in his third full year in the majors, was becoming a bona fide superstar, winning the batting title with a .372 average and also leading the league with 147 RBI while hitting 42 homers. However, he finished just fifth in MVP voting, perhaps because the team finished fourth in the division and also possibly due to bias by voters because he played half of his games in hitter-friendly [[Coors Field]]. 2000 also marked the first of five consecutive [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearances for Helton. The pitching staff also improved its ERA to 5.26, helping the team to an 82\u201380 record.\n\nAlthough previous big-name pitchers, including [[Bill Swift]], [[Bret Saberhagen]], and [[Darryl Kile]], had struggled in Colorado, following the 2000 season O'Dowd made two very splashy signings in the free-agent market, signing [[Denny Neagle]] to a five-year contract worth $51 million, followed five days later by signing [[Mike Hampton]] to an eight-year, $121 million contract. Two years earlier, Hampton had won 22 games and finished second in voting for the [[Cy Young Award]] as a member of the [[Houston Astros]], while Neagle had been a 20-game winner in 1997 for the [[Atlanta Braves]] and had won fifteen games in 2000. The two star pitchers were expected by the Rockies to change the team's fortunes.\n\nInstead, the two flopped, much as their predecessors had. Hampton, after a strong first half in 2001, completely fell apart in 2002, going 7\u201315 with a 6.15 ERA and demanding a trade following the season. Neagle went 19\u201323 in three years with the Rockies; he was injured in 2003 and never pitched in the majors again before the Rockies released him after the 2004 season. The Rockies went 73\u201389 in both years that Hampton and Neagle were in Colorado, and the amount of money owed them (the Rockies paid a sizable portion of Hampton's salary even after he was traded to the Atlanta Braves) crippled the team for the next several years.\n\nUnder previous general manager Gebhard, the Rockies had largely neglected their farm system and mostly relied on signing veteran free agents from other clubs; this was possible due to the high attendance numbers in the club's first few years of attendance. However, as attendance began to dwindle\u2014the Rockies fell to just sixth in the National League in attendance in 2002, and ninth in 2003 and 2004\u2014the club could no longer afford to build through big-name free agents. In 1999, the Rockies spent their first-round draft pick on [[Baylor University]] pitcher [[Jason Jennings]]; three years later, Jennings went 16\u20138 with a 4.52 ERA. In the process, Jennings became the first Rockies player to win the National League [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award.\n\nWith Hampton out of town and Neagle injured much of the year, Jennings became the centerpiece of the Rockies' pitching staff in 2003. Despite a fourth straight All-Star season by Helton and 36 homers by outfielder [[Preston Wilson]], the Rockies finished just 74\u201388. In addition to Jennings, though, young pitchers [[Shawn Chac\u00f3n]] and [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]] showed promise.\n\nIn 2004, the Rockies acquired [[Vinny Castilla]], who had been with the club for its inaugural 1993 season, once again, and he hit 35 homers. However, Wilson and [[Larry Walker]] spent much of the season on the disabled list, forcing the Rockies to play [[Matt Holliday]], who had been slated to start the season at Triple-A. While the Rockies struggled to a 68\u201394 record\u2014the second worst record in club history\u2014the club's Triple-A affiliate, the [[Colorado Springs Sky Sox]], went 78\u201365. Declining attendance meant that the club's payroll could no longer support a franchise stocked largely with veterans from other clubs. In addition, Walker, who had been with the team since 1995 and was widely regarded as the best player in team history, was now 37 years old, and injuries prevented him from playing much of the time. Because he could still be useful to a contending team, the Rockies traded him to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in August for three minor-leaguers.\n\n==Generation-R==\n[[Image:ColoradoRockies01.JPG|thumb|right|250px| Former manager [[Clint Hurdle]] making a pitching change.]]\n[[Image:Rockiescelebratewin.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Colorado Rockies on June 19, 2007 in Coors Field.]]\nThe trade of Walker set in motion a series of moves that led to an overhaul of the club's roster. Castilla and [[Jeromy Burnitz]], who led the team with 37 homers in 2004, were allowed to leave as free agents following the season. Catcher [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]], who had been acquired along with Wilson in the Hampton trade, was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]]. [[Royce Clayton]], the club's starting shortstop in 2004, also was allowed to leave. Along with Holliday, who had performed ably while Wilson and Walker were out, the club promoted [[Garrett Atkins]], [[Brad Hawpe]], [[Clint Barmes]], and [[J.D. Closser]], who spent most of 2004 in Triple-A. Jennings and Chacon combined with [[Joe Kennedy (baseball)|Joe Kennedy]], [[Byung-hyun Kim]], and top prospect [[Jeff Francis]] to form the team's starting rotation. Other than Helton and Wilson, virtually all of the team's regular players were under the age of 30; the Rockies dubbed this group \"Generation-R.\"\n\n===2005 season===\n{{Main|2005 Colorado Rockies season}}\nThe result of all the moves was a 67\u201395 record in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], which tied for the worst record in franchise history, as the young players\u2014many of whom had never been everyday players in the majors prior to that season\u2014struggled. Helton and Wilson\u2014virtually the only experienced players on the team\u2014struggled as well; Helton hit just 20 homers, the fewest of his career, and missed the All-Star Game for the first time since 1999 and also went on the disabled list for the first time in his career. Wilson also spent time on the disabled list and, as the Rockies fell out of contention, was traded to the [[Washington Nationals]]. After starting the season 15\u201335, though, the team had some success later in the year, going a respectable 30\u201328 in August and September as the youngsters became more experienced. However, perhaps because of the trade of Walker and several consecutive losing seasons, the team fell all the way to fourteenth in the National League in attendance; for the first time in team history, the Rockies drew under 2 million fans for the season.\n\n===2006 season===\n{{Main|2006 Colorado Rockies season}}\nThe [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006 season]] started with some promise; the Rockies were 44\u201343 in the first half of the season and were in contention in the NL West for much of the season. However, the team faded in the second half and wound up at 76\u201386, tied for fourth place in the division. Despite this, several of the young players showed promise. [[Matt Holliday]] hit 34 homers and was named to the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]; [[Garrett Atkins]] batted .329 and hit 29 homers. In addition, the pitching staff posted a 4.66 ERA\u2014the best in team history\u2014and starters [[Jason Jennings]], [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]], and [[Jeff Francis]] had good seasons.\n\n===2007: \"Rocktober\"&nbsp;\u2013 A World Series birth===\n{{Main|2007 Colorado Rockies season}}\nThe Rockies trailed the [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], the [[2007 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the [[2007 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] for most of [[2007 Major League Baseball season]]; however by August, Colorado showed a steady series of wins, while the Division-leading Dodgers began to struggle.\n\nBy September, the Dodgers were eliminated by the Rockies from playoff contention, and the Diamondbacks were expected to clinch the [[National League West]] division title. The Padres held a steady lead on the [[National League]] [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] spot. The Diamondbacks eventually clinched the NL West division title, but the Rockies shot up with one of the greatest comebacks in baseball history. They were a major-league best 20\u20138 in September, after trailing 6 games on September 1.<ref>{{cite web|author=C.J.

A Colorado home run was called back early in the game despite the fact that it clearly cleared the fence, hit a chair, and bounced back onto the field. The game lasted 13 innings, and although the Padres got two runs off of a [[Scott Hairston]] [[home run]] in the top of the 13th inning to break a 6\u20136 tie, the Rockies came back in the bottom of the 13th by scoring three runs off of [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Trevor Hoffman]] to win 9\u20138.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=271001127 |title=Padres vs. Rockies \u2013 Recap \u2013 October 01, 2007 |publisher=ESPN  |date=October 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Harding |url=http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20071001&content_id=2244506&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=col |title=The Official Site of The Colorado Rockies: News: Colorado Rockies News |publisher=Colorado.rockies.mlb.com |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> [[Second baseman]] [[Kazuo Matsui]] started off the inning by hitting a double.

Holliday's winning run came off of a controversial slide in which home plate umpire [[Tim McClelland]] called Holliday safe, despite replays showing Holliday may have never touched the plate. McClelland educated the media and fans after the game as to the call: Padres catcher Michael Barrett  blocked the plate before securing possession of the ball, resulting in an automatic ruling of safe and making Holliday's apparent failure to touch the plate irrelevant.

The Rockies had two players selected to the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]: right fielder [[Brad Hawpe]] and starting pitcher [[Jason Marquis]]. On August 10, [[Troy Tulowitzki]] hit the team's 5th franchise [[hit for the cycle|cycle]].  He became the second player in major league history to hit for the cycle and have an [[unassisted triple play]], which he did on April 29, 2007, in his career.\n\nOn August 24, the Rockies faced the [[San Francisco Giants]] in what ended up being a 14 inning game which lasted close to 5 hours(4:57), the second longest game in Rockies history. After multiple scoreless innings, the Giants managed to score three runs in the top of the 14th to place them ahead of the Rockies, 4\u20131. After several Colorado at-bats, the bases were loaded and [[Ryan Spilborghs]] stepped up to the plate. Spilborghs hit the first walk-off [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] in Rockies history, his second career grand slam, and his first [[walk-off homer]] in the 14th inning to squeak by the Giants, 6\u20134, Monday in front of about half of the 27,670 fans who remained at [[Coors Field]].  The play has since been dubbed \"SpillySlam\".{{According to whom|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis particular win expanded the Rockies' [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]] lead to four games over Giants. In an ecstatic interview after the game, [[Jim Tracy (baseball)|Jim Tracy]] stated that he told the Rockies' preceding batter, [[relief pitcher]] [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], not to swing: \"Even if Miller threw three balls down the Middle, take the strikeout because I wanted Spilly to get a chance to hit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=290824127 |title=Spilborghs' 14th-inning grand slam rallies Rockies by Giants \u2013 MLB |publisher=ESPN  |date=August 25, 2009 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}</ref>  The strategy worked in the Rockies' favor; Eaton [[walk (baseball)|walked]] with the bases loaded, scoring [[Dexter Fowler]] to cut the Giants' lead to 4\u20132.\n\nFollowing the win, Colorado hosted [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]] with a chance to pull into a tie for the division lead if they could sweep.  On August 25, the Rockies won 5\u20134 on another walk-off thanks to Troy Tulowitzki's bases loaded, one out [[Single (baseball)|single]] in the bottom of the 10th. However, Los Angeles, won the next two games, and with their wild card lead down to 3 games, the Rockies traveled to San Francisco for another 3-game set.  After losing each of the first two games by two runs, the Rockies opened up a 5\u20132 lead against [[Matt Cain]] in the finale of the series on August 30.  But with two outs and the bases loaded in the 7th, in a scene eerily similar to the Ryan Spilborghs walk-off, [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] hit a go-ahead grand slam off of [[Rafael Betancourt]], propelling the Giants to a 9\u20135 win and a tie in the Wild Card standings entering September.\n\nColorado responded by winning 10 of their first 11 games in September, including a 9\u20131 home stand.  When they returned to San Francisco for their final series with the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] on September 14, the Rockies had once again built a large Wild Card lead.  But as in the previous series, San Francisco won the first two games behind [[Tim Lincecum]] and [[Barry Zito]], cutting the Rockies wild card lead to 2.5 games.  In a pivotal swing game that could have had the Rockies leave San Francisco with either a 1.5 game lead or a 3.5 game lead, Colorado once again built a large lead against [[Matt Cain]] in the finale of the series on September 16.  Thanks to 8 brilliant innings from [[Jorge de la Rosa]], and [[home runs]] from [[Troy Tulowitzki]] and [[Ian Stewart (baseball)|Ian Stewart]], the Rockies took a 4\u20130 lead into the bottom of the 9th.  With closer [[Huston Street]] injured, the Rockies turned to [[Franklin Morales]], but the Giants started the inning with 3 straight hits to pull to within 4\u20131. [[Rafael Betancourt]] was summoned once again, and induced a [[ground ball]] off [[Juan Uribe]]'s bat.  However, an errant throw by Tulowitzki sailed past [[Clint Barmes]] and into [[right field]], scoring another [[run (baseball)|run]] and putting runners at 1st and 3rd.  Pinch runner [[Eugenio V\u00e9lez]] then stole second base, putting the tying run in scoring position.  In a rematch of their August match-up, Betancourt got [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] to pop out on the [[infield]] for the first out.  However, [[pinch hitter]] [[Randy Winn]] followed with an RBI [[Baseball rules|groundout]], cutting the deficit to 4\u20133 and moving the tying run to 3rd.  With a full count, [[Rafael Betancourt|Betancourt]] struck out [[pinch hitter]] [[Nate Schierholtz]] to secure the [[save (baseball)|save]].\n\nAs the Giants began to fade, the [[Atlanta Braves]] started making a run at the Rockies that was starting to look similar to Colorado's 2007 run.  From September 8 through September 28, the Braves won 16 of 19 to pull from nearly 7 back to just 2 back in the season's final week.  It took several dramatic wins for Colorado to hang on to its lead.  On September 25, the Rockies played host to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].  With [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]] returning from an injury, the Rockies won 2\u20131 in the bottom of the 9th on a [[Yorvit Torrealba]] [[sacrifice fly]].  Two days later, the Rockies took a 4\u20133 lead into the bottom of the 9th.  Back from injury, [[Huston Street]] attempted to close out a two inning save, but got into a jam.  The [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] put runners on the corners with one out for [[Ryan Ludwick]]. Ludwick flared a flyball into shallow right. Rockies second baseman [[Clint Barmes]], playing in, made a miraculous over the shoulder diving catch after a long run, and doubled off [[Albert Pujols]], who thought the ball was going to drop and was nearly at third base, to end the game.  Much like the 2007 play-in game when it was not clear whether or not [[Matt Holliday]] had touched [[home plate]] with the game-winning run, there was question as to whether Barmes actually caught the ball, as photos later emerged showing the ball apparently sliding down his arm as he went to the ground.  Ironically, Holliday, traded from [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]] to St. Louis in July, was in the opposing [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] watching the play.\n[[Image:Coors Crowded.jpg|thumb|right|230pix|Coors Field during Game 3 of the NLDS.]]\n\nOn September 29, their lead down to 2 games and their magic number at 5, the Rockies opened their final home series against [[Milwaukee Brewers|Milwaukee]].  During the game, Atlanta had their 7-game win streak snapped by Florida 5\u20134, meaning the Rockies could reduce their magic number to 3 with a win.  Colorado built a 5\u20132 lead and turned the ball to Street.  However, with one out and two on, Street blew his first save of the season, allowing a game-tying home run to [[Jason Kendall]].  In the bottom of the 11th, [[Chris Iannetta]] pinch hit with the winning run on first.  Seldom used and having batted only 12 times in the month, Iannetta hit a 3\u20132 pitch from [[David Weathers]] deep to [[right field]] for a walk-off 2-run home run, propelling Colorado to a 7\u20135 win.  The win combined with the Braves loss seemed to once again shift momentum.  The Braves lost again the following night, and the Rockies 10\u20136 win set their magic number at 1.\n\nOn October 1, the Rockies beat the Milwaukee Brewers 9\u20132, completing a season sweep of the Brewers and clinching the Rockies' second playoff appearance in three years.  The victory also marked the club's 91st win of the season, breaking the franchise record set in 2007. The team broke its record of 22 games over .500 in this victory also. Despite making the race very close, in the 161st game of the season, the Dodgers snapped their five-game losing streak \u2013 and the Rockies' five-game winning streak \u2013 to clinch the West title. The Rockies entered the playoffs against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] as the NL Wild Card for the second time in three years. They lost to the Phillies 3\u20131 in the NLDS.\n\n===2010===\n{{Main|2010 Colorado Rockies season}}\nOn April 17, [[Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez]] pitched the first [[no-hitter]] in franchise history against the Atlanta Braves. [[Keli McGregor]], President of the Rockies, was found dead on April 20, 2010; it was later revealed that he had died of a rare occurrence of viral myocarditis.<ref>[http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=150460&catid=339  Family reveals Rockies' president died of rare virus]</ref> On May 24, [[Kazuo Matsui]], former Rockies second baseman during the 2007 championship season, was resigned to the club following his unconditional release from the [[Houston Astros]].  The Rockies placed Matsui in the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Colorado Springs Sky Sox]] minor league team. On July 6, the Rockies were losing 9\u20133 in the 9th inning against the visiting [[St. Louis Cardinals]], when the Rockies stormed back for 9 runs in the inning. Rockies [[Chris Iannetta]] and [[Seth Smith]] each hit 3-run home runs off of closer [[Ryan Franklin]], with Smith's homer being a [[walk-off home run]]. It is currently the largest 9th inning come-from-behind victory in franchise history. On July 30, the Rockies hit an MLB record-setting 11 consecutive hits against the [[Chicago Cubs]].  The Rockies sent 18 batters to the plate and score 12 runs, eventually beating the Cubs by a score of 17 to 2.  The hit streak consisted of four singles, four doubles, two home runs and a triple.  The Rockies also broke a franchise record with 13 hits in a single inning.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Harding |url=http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100731&content_id=12837356&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=col |title=MLB-record 11 straight hits power Rox in rout &#124; ColoradoRockies.com: News |publisher=Colorado.rockies.mlb.com |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/playbyplay?gameId=300730127&teams=chicago-cubs-vs-colorado-rockies |title=Chicago Cubs vs. Colorado Rockies \u2013 Play By Play \u2013 July 30, 2010 \u2013 ESPN |publisher=ESPN  |date=July 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nRockies ended the season with a total record of 83\u201379 (finishing 3rd overall) by losing 13 of its last 14 games after getting close to 2\u20133 wins from the NL West leader at one point at almost the end of the season.\n\n===2011===\n{{Main|2011 Colorado Rockies season}}\nAfter a 17-8 start to the season in April, the Rockies went 8-21 in May and struggled the rest of the year, finishing in fourth place with a record of 73-89. [[Jorge de la Rosa]] was lost for the season due to Tommy John Surgery and did not return until the end of the 2012 season. On July 30 with the team out of contention, the Rockies traded Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez to the [[Cleveland Indians]] for [[Alex White (baseball)|Alex White]], [[Matt McBride]], and [[Drew Pomeranz]].\n\n===2012===\n{{Main|2012 Colorado Rockies season}}\nOn April 17, [[Jamie Moyer]] became the oldest pitcher in MLB history to record a win. Troy Tulowitzki suffered a season-ending groin injury in late May. The Rockies finished the year with a 64-98 record, the worst in franchise history. At the end of the season, Jim Tracy resigned as manager and was replaced by [[Walt Weiss]].\n\n===2013===\n{{Main|2013 Colorado Rockies season}}\nThe Rockies surprised in early 2013, starting the season 13-4, and remaining around the .500 mark through the end of June. Michael Cuddyer had a franchise record 27-game hitting streak. However, both Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez missed time with injuries. The club faded in the second half of season, finishing in last place at 74-88. Towards the end of the season, Todd Helton announced his retirement after a seventeen-year career, playing his final home game on September 24. Gonzalez and rookie third baseman [[Nolan Arenado]] both received Gold Gloves at the end of the season.\n\n===2014===\n{{Main|2014 Colorado Rockies season}}\nEarly in the season, Nolan Arenado broke Michael Cuddyer's franchise record hit streak by hitting safely in 28 straight games. Like 2013, the Rockies started the season surprisingly well at 22-14. After that point, the Rockies began to fade quickly as bad pitching and injuries began to take their toll. Tulowitzki and Gonzalez both suffered season ending injuries in July. The Rockies ultimately finished 66-96, in fourth place.\n\nOn August 17, the Rockies officially retired Todd Helton's number. After the season, both Dan O'Dowd and Bill Geivett resigned from their front office roles and were replaced by [[Jeff Bridich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_26685903/dan-odowd-bill-geivett-resign-from-colorado-rockies|title=Dan O'Dowd, Bill Geivett resign from Colorado Rockies; Jeff Bridich new GM|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=October 8, 2014|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2015===\n{{Main|2015 Colorado Rockies season}}\nThe 2015 Rockies once again finished in last place at 68-94, as Troy Tulowitzki was traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]] shortly before the July trade deadline.\n\n===2016===\n{{Main|2016 Colorado Rockies season}}\nAfter staying close to the .500 mark most of the season and even posting a 54-53 (.505) record on August 3, the Rockies went an MLB-worst 21-34 the rest of the season to finish in third place with a record of 75-87. Following the season, Walt Weiss was not retained as the team's manager and was replaced by [[Bud Black]].\n\n===2017===\n{{Main|2017 Colorado Rockies season}}\nWith the aim of contending in 2017, the Rockies signed free agents [[Greg Holland]] and [[Ian Desmond]].\n\nThe 2017 season saw the Rockies sprint to a 47-26 record and first place in the division by June 20. Though the team cooled off significantly afterwards, they still managed to finish in third place with an 87-75 record, their first winning season since 2010 and good enough for the National League's second Wild Card. The season ended with an 11-8 loss to the division rival [[Arizona Diamondbacks|Diamondbacks]] in the [[2017 National League Wild Card Game]].\n\n===2018===\n{{Main|2018 Colorado Rockies season}}\nLooking to build on the previous year, the Rockies spent significant money on their bullpen, signing relievers [[Wade Davis (baseball)|Wade Davis]] and [[Bryan Shaw (baseball)|Bryan Shaw]] to multi-year contracts.\n\nThe team suffered from inconsistent play and bullpen struggles throughout the first three months, falling to 38-42 with a loss to the Giants on June 27. Following that, the team immediately began to turn things around, going 53-29 the rest of the season. The Rockies entered September battling with the Dodgers and Diamondbacks for the division title. The Rockies clinched a playoff spot on September 28, marking the first back-to-back postseason appearances for the team. However the Rockies would lose to the Dodgers in the [[2018 National League West tie-breaker game]], finishing at 91-72, their best mark since 2009 and in the second Wild Card position. The Rockies' 44-38 road record was also the best mark in franchise history.\n\nThe Rockies defeated the [[Chicago Cubs]] 2-1 in 13 innings in the [[2018 National League Wild Card Game]], with [[Kyle Freeland]] recording the first ever scoreless postseason start by a Rockies pitcher. The Rockies' season ended after being swept by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in the [[2018 National League Division Series]].\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===2006 controversy over Christian rules===\nOn June 1, 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that Rockies management, including manager [[Clint Hurdle]], had instituted an explicitly Christian code of conduct for the team's players, banning men's magazines (such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]'') and sexually explicit music from the team's clubhouse.<ref>{{Citation |last=Nightengale |first=Bob |title=Baseball's Rockies seek revival on two levels |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/rockies/2006-05-30-rockies-cover_x.htm |accessdate=2007-09-26 | work=USA Today | date=June 1, 2006}}</ref> The newspaper reported:\n\n:''Behind the scenes, [the Rockies] quietly have become an organization guided by Christianity&nbsp;\u2013 open to other religious beliefs but embracing a Christian-based code of conduct they believe will bring them focus and success.''\n\n:''From ownership on down, it's an approach the Rockies are proud of&nbsp;\u2013 and something they are wary about publicizing. \"We're nervous, to be honest with you\", Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd says. \"It's the first time we ever talked about these issues publicly.

Five days later on October 22, California-based ticket vendor Paciolan, Inc., the sole contractor authorized by the Colorado Rockies to distribute tickets, was forced to suspend sales after less than an hour due to an overwhelming number of attempts to purchase tickets.\n\nAn official release from the baseball organization claimed that they were the victims of a [[denial of service attack]].

{"title_page": "Journey Without Maps", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n[[File:JourneyWithoutMaps.jpg|thumb|First edition cover ([[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]], UK)]]\n\n'''''Journey Without Maps''''' (1936) is a [[travel literature|travel account]] by [[Graham Greene]], about a 350-mile, 4-week walk through the interior of [[Liberia]] in 1935. It was Greene's first trip outside of Europe. He hoped to leave civilization and find the \"heart of darkness\" in Africa. The interior of Liberia was at the time unmapped (an American government map had the interior as a large white space marked \"cannibals\"), and so he relied on local guides and porters.\n\nGreene set off from the northernmost point of the country bordering [[Sierra Leone]] near the town of [[Kailahun]] (near [[Pendembu]]) and travelled in a south-easterly direction through the jungle highlands. He crossed through a section of [[French Guinea]], going between the Liberian towns of [[Zorzor]] and [[Ganta]], before turning south-west and arriving at the coast at [[Grand Bassa]]. He then traveled by sea to [[Monrovia]].\n\nGreene's account provides many insights into what Liberia was like in 1935. The country has not modernised much since, in particular away from the coast, so much of it remains unchanged to this day. Greene did encounter a number of white people along the way including American and English missionaries, a German adventurer, gold seekers and beachcombers. Most of the villages he passed through had encountered whites before, but it had been years, and so for many of the younger people it was a new experience. Greene documents the deplorable public health; there were only a handful of doctors in the whole country. A long list of diseases visibly ravaged the typical Liberian (venereal disease and malaria in particular were almost universal, with various weeping sores and wounds from insects and occasionally leprosy). Greene drank whisky during the entire trip, going through cases of it. He became ill halfway through the journey, during their stay at Zigiter, and almost died while in Zigi's Town, near the end of the trip. During this experience he discovered that he had a \"passionate interest in living\" which \"seemed that night an important discovery\".<ref>Graham Greene (1936) Journey Without Maps (1957 Ed. P.216)</ref>  The trip also shaped his future writing career.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pike|first=Duncan|title=The Innocence Abroad: Graham Greene in West Africa|journal=The Graduate History Review|year=2010|volume=2|url=http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ghr/article/view/524}}</ref>\n\nGreene travelled with his cousin, Barbara Greene, who in 1938 produced her own memoir of the trip, ''Land Benighted'' (republished in 1981 as ''Too Late to Turn Back''<ref name=barbara>Barbara Greene.

It was Greene's first trip outside of Europe. He hoped to leave civilization and find the \"heart of darkness\" in Africa. The interior of Liberia was at the time unmapped (an American government map had the interior as a large white space marked \"cannibals\"), and so he relied on local guides and porters.\n\nGreene set off from the northernmost point of the country bordering [[Sierra Leone]] near the town of [[Kailahun]] (near [[Pendembu]]) and travelled in a south-easterly direction through the jungle highlands. He crossed through a section of [[French Guinea]], going between the Liberian towns of [[Zorzor]] and [[Ganta]], before turning south-west and arriving at the coast at [[Grand Bassa]]. He then traveled by sea to [[Monrovia]].\n\nGreene's account provides many insights into what Liberia was like in 1935. The country has not modernised much since, in particular away from the coast, so much of it remains unchanged to this day. Greene did encounter a number of white people along the way including American and English missionaries, a German adventurer, gold seekers and beachcombers. Most of the villages he passed through had encountered whites before, but it had been years, and so for many of the younger people it was a new experience. Greene documents the deplorable public health; there were only a handful of doctors in the whole country. A long list of diseases visibly ravaged the typical Liberian (venereal disease and malaria in particular were almost universal, with various weeping sores and wounds from insects and occasionally leprosy). Greene drank whisky during the entire trip, going through cases of it. He became ill halfway through the journey, during their stay at Zigiter, and almost died while in Zigi's Town, near the end of the trip. During this experience he discovered that he had a \"passionate interest in living\" which \"seemed that night an important discovery\".<ref>Graham Greene (1936) Journey Without Maps (1957 Ed.

In the twentieth century, the Armenian duduk began to be standardized [[diatonic scale|diatonic]] in scale and single-[[octave]] in range. [[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]], or [[chromatic scale|chromatics]] are achieved using fingering techniques. The instrument's body also has different lengths depending upon the range of the instrument and region.

Unlike other double-reed instruments, the reed is quite wide, helping to give the duduk both its unique, mournful sound, as well as its remarkable breath requirements. The duduk player is called ''dudukahar'' ([[wikt:\u0564\u0578\u0582\u0564\u0578\u0582\u056f\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0580|\u0564\u0578\u0582\u0564\u0578\u0582\u056f\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0580]]) in Armenian.\n\nThe performer uses air stored in their cheeks to keep playing the instrument while they inhale air into their lungs.

In the twentieth century, the Armenian duduk began to be standardized [[diatonic scale|diatonic]] in scale and single-[[octave]] in range. [[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]], or [[chromatic scale|chromatics]] are achieved using fingering techniques. The instrument's body also has different lengths depending upon the range of the instrument and region.

Unlike other double-reed instruments, the reed is quite wide, helping to give the duduk both its unique, mournful sound, as well as its remarkable breath requirements. The duduk player is called ''dudukahar'' ([[wikt:\u0564\u0578\u0582\u0564\u0578\u0582\u056f\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0580|\u0564\u0578\u0582\u0564\u0578\u0582\u056f\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0580]]) in Armenian.\n\nThe performer uses air stored in their cheeks to keep playing the instrument while they inhale air into their lungs.

Since then, pawnbrokers are required to be licensed establishments.<ref>The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers\u2019 Association Limited. http://www.pawn.com.hk/?mod=site_pawn_assoc_history . Extracted on 04 November 2013</ref> These regulations broadened the industry's appeal. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}.\n\nThe activities of the pawnbrokers were limited by the Japanese during the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] in the [[Second World War]]. In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War, and the [[Japanese military yen]] became useless paper. Most people go to a pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers' and goldsmiths' shops are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items, which are under strict verification and registration.

The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid embarrassment.\n\n==== Pawning counter ====\nThe counter of the pawn shop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to give their mortgaged properties upward to the pawning counter. This design shows the higher status of the pawnbrokers. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design{{Citation needed|reason=Need a source for psychological effect|date=January 2018}}. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security. It is hard for passersby and clients to see the environment and workers inside the pawn shop.\n\n=== Names of pawn shops ===\nPawn shops are a traditional industry in China. The majority of the shops use names including words meaning harmonious (for example 'tung' (\u540c), 'wo' (\u548c)) and/or prosperous (for example 'chang' (\u660c), 'fat' (\u767c), 'fung' (\u8c50)).

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War, and the [[Japanese military yen]] became useless paper. Most people go to a pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items, which are under strict verification and registration.

The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid embarrassment.\n\n==== Pawning counter ====\nThe counter of the pawn shop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to give their mortgaged properties upward to the pawning counter. This design shows the higher status of the pawnbrokers. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design{{Citation needed|reason=Need a source for psychological effect|date=January 2018}}. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security. It is hard for passersby and clients to see the environment and workers inside the pawn shop.\n\n=== Names of pawn shops ===\nPawn shops are a traditional industry in China. The majority of the shops use names including words meaning harmonious (for example 'tung' (\u540c), 'wo' (\u548c)) and/or prosperous (for example 'chang' (\u660c), 'fat' (\u767c), 'fung' (\u8c50)).

Also in that game, [[Marcos Coll]] scored the only [[olympic goal]] in World Cup history so far. Unfortunately, the Colombian campaign in 1962 ended with a 5\u20130 defeat against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], who end up in fourth place in the tournament.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|Pos|Position}}\n!width=165|Team\n!width=20|{{abbr|Pld|Matches played}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|W|Matches won}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|D|Matches drawn}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|L|Matches lost}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|GF|Goals for}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|GA|Goals against}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|GAv|Goal average}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|Pts|Points}}\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|1\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|URS|1955}}\n|3||2||1||0||8||5||1.60||'''5'''\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|2\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|YUG}}\n|3||2||0||1||8||3||2.67||'''4'''\n|-\n|3\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|URU}}\n|3||1||0||2||4||6||0.67||'''2'''\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|align=\"left\"|'''{{fb|COL}}'''\n|'''3'''||'''0'''||'''1'''||'''2'''||'''5'''||'''11'''||'''0.45'''||'''1'''\n|}\n\n===From 1962 to 1990===\nColombia had to wait 28 years to come back in a World Cup.

In 1970, before the start of the World Cup in Mexico, England prepared a friendly against Colombia to prepare the team for the high [[altitudes]] of Mexico.

The continent's nine remaining sides were split into three groups with the two automatic qualifying berths going to the two best group winners, in this instance Uruguay and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. The group winner with the worst record would advance to the CONMEBOL / OFC Intercontinental Play-off. Thus Colombia had to take on the winners of the Oceania zone. Curiously, this turned out to be [[Israel national football team|Israel]], after they finished ahead of [[Australia national football team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] in the final qualifying group.

Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favourites to win the tournament.\n\nThe match between Colombia and Romania was the first game for either side in the group phase. Romania took the lead in the 16th minute with their first attack of the match when Raducioiu took on three defenders before firing home a low shot. On the half-hour mark, Hagi made it 2\u20130 when he noticed C\u00f3rdoba out of position and dipped a cross over his head into the net. Valencia pulled a goal back for the Colombians in the 43rd minute when he headed in a corner from Perez. In the second half, Raducioiu put the result beyond doubt with his second goal in the final few minutes.\n\nThe team went into their second group game against the United States knowing they had to win to have any chance of progressing. On the 35th minute [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]] attempted to cut out a cross but accidentally deflected the ball into his own net. Earnie Stewart took the US two goals in front after scoring in the 56th minute. Valencia scored a consolation goal for Colombia in the closing minutes of the match.\nThey did win their final group match 2\u20130 over Switzerland, but it was not enough to help them progress. Tragically, Escobar died on 2 July 1994 as it is believed that his own goal, vs the United States, caused huge losses for Colombia's drug lords.\n\n'''Group A'''\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:60%;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150|Team\n!width=20|{{Abbr|Pld|Matches played}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|W|Matches won}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|D|Matches drawn}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|L|Matches lost}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|GF|Goals for}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|GA|Goals against}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|GD|Goal difference}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|Pts|Points}}\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|ROU}}\n|3||2||0||1||5||5||0||'''6'''\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|SUI}}\n|3||1||1||1||5||4||+1||'''4'''\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|USA}}\n|3||1||1||1||3||3||0||'''4'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|COL}}\n|3||1||0||2||4||5||\u22121||'''3'''\n|}\n| style=\"width:40%;\"|\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[United States men's national soccer team|USA]]'''\n|align=center|'''1 \u2013 1'''||'''[[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''Colombia'''\n|align=center|'''1 \u2013 3'''||'''[[Romania national football team|Romania]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'''\n|align=center|'''4 \u2013 1'''||'''[[Romania national football team|Romania]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[United States men's national soccer team|USA]]'''\n|align=center|'''2 \u2013 1'''||'''Colombia'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'''\n|align=center|'''0 \u2013 2'''||'''Colombia'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[United States men's national soccer team|USA]]'''\n|align=center|'''0 \u2013 1'''||'''[[Romania national football team|Romania]]'''\n|}\n|}\n\n===1998 FIFA World Cup===\nColombia began their qualification rounds in South America well and ended in third place with 28 points, 2 points below Argentina who was in 1st place with 30 points.

Prior to the tournament, three meetings were held by CONMEBOL authorities who were concerned about potential security issues in Colombia, for what Venezuela offered to host the competition. At the last minute, CONMEBOL decided to return the organization to Colombia, and the tournament was held on schedule. Complaining for the sudden decision, and claiming that Argentine players had received death threats from terrorist groups, the Argentine Football Association decided to withdraw from the competition. Because Canada and Argentina withdrew, on July 6 and July 10 respectively, Honduras and Costa Rica were invited. There were no terrorist incidents within the competition. Colombia was placed in Group A with Venezuela, Chile, and Ecuador, and they finished on top of the group with nine points.\n\nGroup Stage:\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=165|Team\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n!width=20|Pts\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=left|{{fb|COL}}\n|3||3||0||0||5||0||+5||'''9'''\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=left|{{fb|CHI}}\n|3||2||0||1||5||3||+2||'''6'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{fb|ECU}}\n|3||1||0||2||5||5||0||'''3'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{fb|VEN}}\n|3||0||0||3||0||7||\u22127||'''0'''\n|}\n\n'''Quarter-Finals:'''\n\n{{football box\n|date=2001-07-23\n|time=19:45\n|team1={{fb-rt|COL}}\n|score=3\u20130\n|report=(0\u20130)\n|team2={{fb|PER}}\n|goals1=[[V\u00edctor Aristiz\u00e1bal|Aristiz\u00e1bal]] {{goal|50||69}}<br />[[Giovanny Hern\u00e1ndez|Hern\u00e1ndez]] {{goal|66}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium=[[Estadio Centenario (Armenia, Colombia)|Estadio Centenario]], [[Armenia, Colombia|Armenia]]\n|attendance=\n|referee=[[Gilberto Alcal\u00e1]] ([[Federaci\u00f3n Mexicana de F\u00fatbol Asociaci\u00f3n|Mexico]]) }}\n\n'''Semi-Finals:'''\n\n{{football box\n|date=2001-07-26\n|time=19:45\n|team1={{fb-rt|COL}}\n|score=2\u20130\n|report=(1\u20130)\n|team2={{fb|HON}}\n|goals1=[[Gerardo Bedoya|Bedoya]] {{goal|6}}<br />[[V\u00edctor Aristiz\u00e1bal|Aristiz\u00e1bal]] {{goal|63}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium=[[Estadio Palogrande]], [[Manizales]]\n|attendance=\n|referee=[[Mario S\u00e1nchez Yanten|Mario S\u00e1nchez]] ([[Federaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de Chile|Chile]]) }}\n\n'''Final:'''\n\n{{football box\n|date=2001-07-29\n|time=16:30\n|team1={{fb-rt|COL}}\n|score=1\u20130\n|report=(0\u20130)\n|team2={{fb|MEX}}\n|goals1=[[Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba|I.

Their captain [[Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba]] scored the decisive goal early in the second half with a header from a free kick. It was a fairytale success for Colombia after the decision to go ahead with the tournament after it had initially been cancelled. Even the fact that Argentina, regarded by most observers as the strongest side in the region, elected not to take part and that most countries fielded weakened teams failed to dampen the celebrations in Bogot\u00e1. It was also noted the following year that Brazil was then considered to be the strongest in the region at the time following their 2002 FIFA World Cup victory, thus making the event \"legitimate\". This is also credited to the fact that Argentina failed to make it out of the group stage at the 2002 World Cup.\n\n===2002 FIFA World Cup===\nFor [[2002 FIFA World Cup|Korea/Japan 2002]], hopes were high for Colombia, but a weak attack and internal turmoil crushed their hopes. Colombia only managed to place sixth in the qualification round. Uruguay and Colombia had both 27 points but due to goal difference, Uruguay advanced to the play-offs with Australia.\n\n'''Final Standings'''\n{|\n|-\n|\n{{2002 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONMEBOL\n| expanded = yes\n| fixtures = yes\n}}\n|\n|}\n\n===2005 CONCACAF Copa de Oro===\n[[Image:Colombia vs England.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Colombian team playing a friendly match against [[England national football team|England]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], United States (2005)]]\n\nThe 2005 CONCACAF Copa de Oro, or Gold Cup, was played in July 2005 in the United States. Colombia and South Africa were invited guests. Colombia was placed in Group A with Panama, Honduras, and Trinidad and Tobago. There were three groups with four teams each, which meant that all three first- and second-place finishers would advance to the quarter-finals and so would the best two third-place finishers\n\nGroup Stage: Panama: 1\u20130 : Colombia\n\nColombia's opening match was against Panama where they lost 1\u20130.\nTejada, who plays for Colombian club [[Millonarios]], netted the game's lone score in the 70th minute.\n\nGroup Stage: Honduras: 2\u20131 : Colombia\n\nThe next match was against Honduras where they lost again 2\u20131. Two late goals gave Honduras the advantage as the catrachos defeated Colombia 2\u20131 in Group A action of the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup\nThe win is the first for Honduras in the tournament since 2000, when they also defeated Colombia.\n\nGroup Stage: Trinidad and Tobago: 0\u20132 : Colombia\n\nThe third match was against Trinidad and Tobago where they won a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nQuarterfinals: Colombia: 2\u20131 : Mexico\n\nColombia reached the quarterfinals to face Mexico. Colombia beat Mexico 2\u20131 as an unexpected goal from Abel Aguilar helped the South American squad advance to the semifinals.\n\nSemifinals: Panama: 3\u20132 : Colombia\n\nColombia reached the semifinals only to be defeated by Panama, the underdogs of the tournament. Panama clipped Colombia 3\u20132 in front of more than 40,000 people at Giants Stadium.\n\n===2006 FIFA World Cup===\n2006 FIFA World Cup -Germany was an important moment for Colombia, having failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. Head coach [[Francisco Maturana]] led the team through four FIFA qualifiers and was fired after losing to Brazil 2\u20131 in Barranquilla, getting thrashed 4\u20130 by a weak Bolivia and suffering a shocking 1\u20130 defeat at home to Venezuela. Following a 1\u20131 tie with Argentina he was fired and Reinaldo Rueda was placed as the new coach. Colombia seemed to have improved and defeated Peru and Uruguay 5\u20130 during qualifying, managed a 3\u20130 victory over arch-rivals Ecuador, and tied with Brazil 0\u20130 in S\u00e3o Paulo. Towards the end Colombia (21 pts), Chile (21pts), and Uruguay (22 pts) had a chance to target the playoffs with Australia. Colombia (21 pts) traveled to Asunci\u00f3n hoping for three points against Paraguay (28), who sealed their place in Germany while Chile battled against Ecuador and Uruguay against Argentina. As in the 2002 qualifiers, the last match of Argentina was against Uruguay, and in both occasions Uruguay needed a favourable result to reach fifth place in order to make the playoffs to earn a place in the World Cup. Even though Colombia won its match against Paraguay, Uruguay also won the match against Argentina, again reaching the position to play the playoff for the last ticket to Germany. Both Argentina and Paraguay had already qualified. Colombia ended with 24 points, once again behind Uruguay, with 25 points.\n\n'''Final Standings'''\n{|\n|-\n|\n{{2006 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONMEBOL\n| expanded = yes\n| fixtures = yes\n}}\n|\n|}\n\n===2006 Central American and Caribbean Games===\nGroup Stage\n{|\n|-\n|July 16\n|\n|Colombia\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|\u2013\n|align=center|0\n|[[Netherlands Antilles national football team|Netherlands Antilles]]\n| at\n|[[Cartagena, Colombia]]\n|-\n|\n|}\n\n{|\n|-\n|July 20\n|\n|Colombia\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|\u2013\n|align=center|3\n|[[Panama national football team|Panama]]\n| at\n|[[Cartagena, Colombia]]\n|-\n|\n|}\n\nQuarter Finals\n\n===After Copa Am\u00e9rica 2007===\nAfter Copa Am\u00e9rica 2007, the Colombian national football team boomed with recent success in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|South American 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]]. After embarrassing losses against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, many Colombians nonetheless anticipated a successful run for [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] classification. In the first match of the qualifying round, Colombia, defying expectations that they would lose to Brazil, drew 0\u20130 with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at home. Not long after that, Colombia surprisingly tied 0\u20130 again with [[Bolivia national football team]], but many argue that this was largely due to the fact that the altitude of [[La Paz]] contributes to usual losses or ties for non-Bolivian teams.\nHowever, Colombia would find their very first win after defeating a weak [[Venezuela national football team]] 1\u20130, with a stupendous free kick courtesy of [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Bustos]]. In their next game, Colombia would defy expectations again by beating Argentina, at the time ranked first in the world. On November 17, 2007, In [[Bogot\u00e1]] against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Lionel Messi]] beat the defense before scoring past goalkeeper [[Agust\u00edn Julio]]. Colombia turned the game around in the second half, however, when Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Bustos got his second free kick goal of the qualifying campaign, and not long after that, [[Dayro Moreno]] scored his first international goal for [[Colombia]]. Colombia won the match 2\u20131, obtaining 4th place in the world cup qualifiers. On June 14, 2008 Colombia tied [[Peru national football team|Peru]] 1\u20131 moving Colombia up to 3rd place in the world cup qualifiers after a Brazilian loss to Paraguay. Another 0\u20130 between Ecuador and Colombia in Quito was on June 18, 2008 and Colombia remain at 3rd place and as the only undefeated country in the qualification after Bolivia won Paraguay 4\u20132.\nSuccessive defeats to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] at home, and a thrashing away to [[Chile national football team|Chile]], however, left Colombia in an extremely dangerous position knocking them out of the top five and forcing them to set their sights on the fifth play-off spot only. As of September 25, 2009, they are eighth after a 3\u20131 defeat at the hands of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Montevideo. On October 10, 2009, Colombia lost 4\u20132 in Colombia against Chile, losing any possibility of assisting to 2010 World Cup. After that, on October 14, 2009, they played their last qualification match against Paraguay, in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, beating 2\u20130 and finishing in 7th place in the table standings with 23 points, one point behind Uruguay, who went on to compete in the play-offs, and eventually play in the World Cup\n\n===2010 World Cup and Aftermath===\n[[File:Colombia vs Brasil.jpg|thumb|280 px|left|National anthems in a match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].]]\nColombia failed to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], mainly because their constant change of formations and struggles to score goals in the last games of the qualification. They played an Exhibition Match against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] a month before the World Cup started, which they lost 2\u20131. The game was the first soccer match played in the recently built [[Soccer City Stadium]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. All three goals of the match were scored by penalty kicks, and the match was highly criticized because both of the South Africa penalty kicks did not seem to be fouls at all, and because of the reported partiality of the referee towards the South Africa team. Another Exhibition Match was played in England against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], a match that ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Both matches were the first ones that coach [[Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo G\u00f3mez]] directed after his designation and return to Colombia's coaching. With a 2\u20130 win over Venezuela, and a 1\u20130 win against Ecuador, they wanted success over USA (which ended 0\u20130). In between all that they lost to Mexico 1\u20130. Los Cafeteros tied with Peru 1\u20131 but loss in an action packed duel against champions Spain 1\u20130. They successfully defeated Ecuador again 2\u20130 but suffered a 2\u20130 defeat to Chile in March even after many goal attempts. Colombia had beaten Hounduras 2-0 after two spectacular goals from Teo, although many fans complain games such as this one aren't testing their full potential. In Ft. Lauderdale, Colombia beat Jamaica 2\u20130 with Jackson Martinez and Teo scoring to test Leonel \u00c1lvarez's side as a coach.\n\n{{Main article|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)}}\n{{:2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|show_matches=n|title=2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification Standings|showteam=COL}}\n\n=== 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica ===\n{{main article|2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica Group A}}\n\n[[File:Metro-ColChi.JPG|230px|thumb|left| The [[Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Mel\u00e9ndez|Estadio Metropolitano]], [[Barranquilla]] before a match between Colombia and Chile, game that would end in a 3\u20133 draw.]]\nIn Copa Am\u00e9rica 2011, Colombia showed great skill beating Costa Rica 1\u20130 goal given by [[Adri\u00e1n Ramos]] thanks to an assist by [[Fredy Guar\u00edn]].

Finally, they crushed Bolivia 2\u20130 both goals by [[Radamel Falcao]], one via a penalty. This resulted in shocking the host nation Argentina, who were favourites to win the group. After that, they confronted Peru with high expectations. Before extra time, Falcao was given a penalty only to miss by a wide shot, leading to extra time.

Unfortunately, the Colombian campaign in 1962 ended with a 5\u20130 defeat against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], who end up in fourth place in the tournament.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|Pos|Position}}\n!width=165|Team\n!width=20|{{abbr|Pld|Matches played}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|W|Matches won}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|D|Matches drawn}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|L|Matches lost}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|GF|Goals for}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|GA|Goals against}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|GAv|Goal average}}\n!width=20|{{abbr|Pts|Points}}\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|1\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|URS|1955}}\n|3||2||1||0||8||5||1.60||'''5'''\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|2\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|YUG}}\n|3||2||0||1||8||3||2.67||'''4'''\n|-\n|3\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|URU}}\n|3||1||0||2||4||6||0.67||'''2'''\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|align=\"left\"|'''{{fb|COL}}'''\n|'''3'''||'''0'''||'''1'''||'''2'''||'''5'''||'''11'''||'''0.45'''||'''1'''\n|}\n\n===From 1962 to 1990===\nColombia had to wait 28 years to come back in a World Cup.

In 1970, before the start of the World Cup in Mexico, England prepared a friendly against Colombia to prepare the team for the high [[altitudes]] of Mexico.

Colombia won 3\u20130 at home and lost 1\u20130 away, however the overall score 3\u20131 allowed them to advance to the final, where they faced [[Peru national football team|Peru]]. Colombia won at home 1\u20130, but lost 2\u20130 away, so that the champion was defined on neutral ground (in Caracas) where Peru beat Colombia with a 25th-minute goal from [[Hugo Sotil]].

The continent's nine remaining sides were split into three groups with the two automatic qualifying berths going to the two best group winners, in this instance Uruguay and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. The group winner with the worst record would advance to the CONMEBOL / OFC Intercontinental Play-off. Thus Colombia had to take on the winners of the Oceania zone. Curiously, this turned out to be [[Israel national football team|Israel]], after they finished ahead of [[Australia national football team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] in the final qualifying group.

Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favourites to win the tournament.\n\nThe match between Colombia and Romania was the first game for either side in the group phase. Romania took the lead in the 16th minute with their first attack of the match when Raducioiu took on three defenders before firing home a low shot. On the half-hour mark, Hagi made it 2\u20130 when he noticed C\u00f3rdoba out of position and dipped a cross over his head into the net. Valencia pulled a goal back for the Colombians in the 43rd minute when he headed in a corner from Perez. In the second half, Raducioiu put the result beyond doubt with his second goal in the final few minutes.\n\nThe team went into their second group game against the United States knowing they had to win to have any chance of progressing. On the 35th minute [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]] attempted to cut out a cross but accidentally deflected the ball into his own net. Earnie Stewart took the US two goals in front after scoring in the 56th minute. Valencia scored a consolation goal for Colombia in the closing minutes of the match.\nThey did win their final group match 2\u20130 over Switzerland, but it was not enough to help them progress. Tragically, Escobar died on 2 July 1994 as it is believed that his own goal, vs the United States, caused huge losses for Colombia's drug lords.\n\n'''Group A'''\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:60%;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150|Team\n!width=20|{{Abbr|Pld|Matches played}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|W|Matches won}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|D|Matches drawn}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|L|Matches lost}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|GF|Goals for}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|GA|Goals against}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|GD|Goal difference}}\n!width=20|{{Abbr|Pts|Points}}\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|ROU}}\n|3||2||0||1||5||5||0||'''6'''\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|SUI}}\n|3||1||1||1||5||4||+1||'''4'''\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|USA}}\n|3||1||1||1||3||3||0||'''4'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|COL}}\n|3||1||0||2||4||5||\u22121||'''3'''\n|}\n| style=\"width:40%;\"|\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[United States men's national soccer team|USA]]'''\n|align=center|'''1 \u2013 1'''||'''[[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''Colombia'''\n|align=center|'''1 \u2013 3'''||'''[[Romania national football team|Romania]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'''\n|align=center|'''4 \u2013 1'''||'''[[Romania national football team|Romania]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[United States men's national soccer team|USA]]'''\n|align=center|'''2 \u2013 1'''||'''Colombia'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'''\n|align=center|'''0 \u2013 2'''||'''Colombia'''\n|-\n| style=\"width:40%; text-align:right;\"|'''[[United States men's national soccer team|USA]]'''\n|align=center|'''0 \u2013 1'''||'''[[Romania national football team|Romania]]'''\n|}\n|}\n\n===1998 FIFA World Cup===\nColombia began their qualification rounds in South America well and ended in third place with 28 points, 2 points below Argentina who was in 1st place with 30 points.

Prior to the tournament, three meetings were held by CONMEBOL authorities who were concerned about potential security issues in Colombia, for what Venezuela offered to host the competition. At the last minute, CONMEBOL decided to return the organization to Colombia, and the tournament was held on schedule. Complaining for the sudden decision, and claiming that Argentine players had received death threats from terrorist groups, the Argentine Football Association decided to withdraw from the competition. Because Canada and Argentina withdrew, on July 6 and July 10 respectively, Honduras and Costa Rica were invited. There were no terrorist incidents within the competition. Colombia was placed in Group A with Venezuela, Chile, and Ecuador, and they finished on top of the group with nine points.\n\nGroup Stage:\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=165|Team\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n!width=20|Pts\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=left|{{fb|COL}}\n|3||3||0||0||5||0||+5||'''9'''\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=left|{{fb|CHI}}\n|3||2||0||1||5||3||+2||'''6'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{fb|ECU}}\n|3||1||0||2||5||5||0||'''3'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{fb|VEN}}\n|3||0||0||3||0||7||\u22127||'''0'''\n|}\n\n'''Quarter-Finals:'''\n\n{{football box\n|date=2001-07-23\n|time=19:45\n|team1={{fb-rt|COL}}\n|score=3\u20130\n|report=(0\u20130)\n|team2={{fb|PER}}\n|goals1=[[V\u00edctor Aristiz\u00e1bal|Aristiz\u00e1bal]] {{goal|50||69}}<br />[[Giovanny Hern\u00e1ndez|Hern\u00e1ndez]] {{goal|66}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium=[[Estadio Centenario (Armenia, Colombia)|Estadio Centenario]], [[Armenia, Colombia|Armenia]]\n|attendance=\n|referee=[[Gilberto Alcal\u00e1]] ([[Federaci\u00f3n Mexicana de F\u00fatbol Asociaci\u00f3n|Mexico]]) }}\n\n'''Semi-Finals:'''\n\n{{football box\n|date=2001-07-26\n|time=19:45\n|team1={{fb-rt|COL}}\n|score=2\u20130\n|report=(1\u20130)\n|team2={{fb|HON}}\n|goals1=[[Gerardo Bedoya|Bedoya]] {{goal|6}}<br />[[V\u00edctor Aristiz\u00e1bal|Aristiz\u00e1bal]] {{goal|63}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium=[[Estadio Palogrande]], [[Manizales]]\n|attendance=\n|referee=[[Mario S\u00e1nchez Yanten|Mario S\u00e1nchez]] ([[Federaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de Chile|Chile]]) }}\n\n'''Final:'''\n\n{{football box\n|date=2001-07-29\n|time=16:30\n|team1={{fb-rt|COL}}\n|score=1\u20130\n|report=(0\u20130)\n|team2={{fb|MEX}}\n|goals1=[[Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba|I.

Their captain [[Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba]] scored the decisive goal early in the second half with a header from a free kick. It was a fairytale success for Colombia after the decision to go ahead with the tournament after it had initially been cancelled. Even the fact that Argentina, regarded by most observers as the strongest side in the region, elected not to take part and that most countries fielded weakened teams failed to dampen the celebrations in Bogot\u00e1. It was also noted the following year that Brazil was then considered to be the strongest in the region at the time following their 2002 FIFA World Cup victory, thus making the event \"legitimate\". This is also credited to the fact that Argentina failed to make it out of the group stage at the 2002 World Cup.\n\n===2002 FIFA World Cup===\nFor [[2002 FIFA World Cup|Korea/Japan 2002]], hopes were high for Colombia, but a weak attack and internal turmoil crushed their hopes. Colombia only managed to place sixth in the qualification round. Uruguay and Colombia had both 27 points but due to goal difference, Uruguay advanced to the play-offs with Australia.\n\n'''Final Standings'''\n{|\n|-\n|\n{{2002 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONMEBOL\n| expanded = yes\n| fixtures = yes\n}}\n|\n|}\n\n===2005 CONCACAF Copa de Oro===\n[[Image:Colombia vs England.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Colombian team playing a friendly match against [[England national football team|England]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], United States (2005)]]\n\nThe 2005 CONCACAF Copa de Oro, or Gold Cup, was played in July 2005 in the United States. Colombia and South Africa were invited guests. Colombia was placed in Group A with Panama, Honduras, and Trinidad and Tobago. There were three groups with four teams each, which meant that all three first- and second-place finishers would advance to the quarter-finals and so would the best two third-place finishers\n\nGroup Stage: Panama: 1\u20130 : Colombia\n\nColombia's opening match was against Panama where they lost 1\u20130.\nTejada, who plays for Colombian club [[Millonarios]], netted the game's lone score in the 70th minute.\n\nGroup Stage: Honduras: 2\u20131 : Colombia\n\nThe next match was against Honduras where they lost again 2\u20131. Two late goals gave Honduras the advantage as the catrachos defeated Colombia 2\u20131 in Group A action of the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup\nThe win is the first for Honduras in the tournament since 2000, when they also defeated Colombia.\n\nGroup Stage: Trinidad and Tobago: 0\u20132 : Colombia\n\nThe third match was against Trinidad and Tobago where they won a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nQuarterfinals: Colombia: 2\u20131 : Mexico\n\nColombia reached the quarterfinals to face Mexico.

Panama clipped Colombia 3\u20132 in front of more than 40,000 people at Giants Stadium.\n\n===2006 FIFA World Cup===\n2006 FIFA World Cup -Germany was an important moment for Colombia, having failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. Head coach [[Francisco Maturana]] led the team through four FIFA qualifiers and was fired after losing to Brazil 2\u20131 in Barranquilla, getting thrashed 4\u20130 by a weak Bolivia and suffering a shocking 1\u20130 defeat at home to Venezuela. Following a 1\u20131 tie with Argentina he was fired and Reinaldo Rueda was placed as the new coach. Colombia seemed to have improved and defeated Peru and Uruguay 5\u20130 during qualifying, managed a 3\u20130 victory over arch-rivals Ecuador, and tied with Brazil 0\u20130 in S\u00e3o Paulo. Towards the end Colombia (21 pts), Chile (21pts), and Uruguay (22 pts) had a chance to target the playoffs with Australia. Colombia (21 pts) traveled to Asunci\u00f3n hoping for three points against Paraguay (28), who sealed their place in Germany while Chile battled against Ecuador and Uruguay against Argentina. As in the 2002 qualifiers, the last match of Argentina was against Uruguay, and in both occasions Uruguay needed a favourable result to reach fifth place in order to make the playoffs to earn a place in the World Cup. Even though Colombia won its match against Paraguay, Uruguay also won the match against Argentina, again reaching the position to play the playoff for the last ticket to Germany. Both Argentina and Paraguay had already qualified. Colombia ended with 24 points, once again behind Uruguay, with 25 points.\n\n'''Final Standings'''\n{|\n|-\n|\n{{2006 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONMEBOL\n| expanded = yes\n| fixtures = yes\n}}\n|\n|}\n\n===2006 Central American and Caribbean Games===\nGroup Stage\n{|\n|-\n|July 16\n|\n|Colombia\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|\u2013\n|align=center|0\n|[[Netherlands Antilles national football team|Netherlands Antilles]]\n| at\n|[[Cartagena, Colombia]]\n|-\n|\n|}\n\n{|\n|-\n|July 20\n|\n|Colombia\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|\u2013\n|align=center|3\n|[[Panama national football team|Panama]]\n| at\n|[[Cartagena, Colombia]]\n|-\n|\n|}\n\nQuarter Finals\n\n===After Copa Am\u00e9rica 2007===\nAfter Copa Am\u00e9rica 2007, the Colombian national football team boomed with recent success in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|South American 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]]. After embarrassing losses against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, many Colombians nonetheless anticipated a successful run for [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] classification. In the first match of the qualifying round, Colombia, defying expectations that they would lose to Brazil, drew 0\u20130 with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at home. Not long after that, Colombia surprisingly tied 0\u20130 again with [[Bolivia national football team]], but many argue that this was largely due to the fact that the altitude of [[La Paz]] contributes to usual losses or ties for non-Bolivian teams.\nHowever, Colombia would find their very first win after defeating a weak [[Venezuela national football team]] 1\u20130, with a stupendous free kick courtesy of [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Bustos]]. In their next game, Colombia would defy expectations again by beating Argentina, at the time ranked first in the world. On November 17, 2007, In [[Bogot\u00e1]] against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Lionel Messi]] beat the defense before scoring past goalkeeper [[Agust\u00edn Julio]]. Colombia turned the game around in the second half, however, when Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Bustos got his second free kick goal of the qualifying campaign, and not long after that, [[Dayro Moreno]] scored his first international goal for [[Colombia]]. Colombia won the match 2\u20131, obtaining 4th place in the world cup qualifiers. On June 14, 2008 Colombia tied [[Peru national football team|Peru]] 1\u20131 moving Colombia up to 3rd place in the world cup qualifiers after a Brazilian loss to Paraguay. Another 0\u20130 between Ecuador and Colombia in Quito was on June 18, 2008 and Colombia remain at 3rd place and as the only undefeated country in the qualification after Bolivia won Paraguay 4\u20132.\nSuccessive defeats to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] at home, and a thrashing away to [[Chile national football team|Chile]], however, left Colombia in an extremely dangerous position knocking them out of the top five and forcing them to set their sights on the fifth play-off spot only. As of September 25, 2009, they are eighth after a 3\u20131 defeat at the hands of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Montevideo. On October 10, 2009, Colombia lost 4\u20132 in Colombia against Chile, losing any possibility of assisting to 2010 World Cup. After that, on October 14, 2009, they played their last qualification match against Paraguay, in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, beating 2\u20130 and finishing in 7th place in the table standings with 23 points, one point behind Uruguay, who went on to compete in the play-offs, and eventually play in the World Cup\n\n===2010 World Cup and Aftermath===\n[[File:Colombia vs Brasil.jpg|thumb|280 px|left|National anthems in a match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].]]\nColombia failed to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], mainly because their constant change of formations and struggles to score goals in the last games of the qualification. They played an Exhibition Match against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] a month before the World Cup started, which they lost 2\u20131. The game was the first soccer match played in the recently built [[Soccer City Stadium]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. All three goals of the match were scored by penalty kicks, and the match was highly criticized because both of the South Africa penalty kicks did not seem to be fouls at all, and because of the reported partiality of the referee towards the South Africa team. Another Exhibition Match was played in England against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], a match that ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Both matches were the first ones that coach [[Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo G\u00f3mez]] directed after his designation and return to Colombia's coaching. With a 2\u20130 win over Venezuela, and a 1\u20130 win against Ecuador, they wanted success over USA (which ended 0\u20130). In between all that they lost to Mexico 1\u20130. Los Cafeteros tied with Peru 1\u20131 but loss in an action packed duel against champions Spain 1\u20130. They successfully defeated Ecuador again 2\u20130 but suffered a 2\u20130 defeat to Chile in March even after many goal attempts. Colombia had beaten Hounduras 2-0 after two spectacular goals from Teo, although many fans complain games such as this one aren't testing their full potential. In Ft. Lauderdale, Colombia beat Jamaica 2-0 with Jackson Martinez and Teo scoring to test Leonel \u00c1lvarez's side as a coach.\n\n{{Main article|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)}}\n{{:2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|show_matches=n|title=2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification Standings|showteam=COL}}\n\n=== 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica ===\n{{main article|2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica Group A}}\n\n[[File:Metro-ColChi.JPG|230px|thumb|left| The [[Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Mel\u00e9ndez|Estadio Metropolitano]], [[Barranquilla]] before a match between Colombia and Chile, game that would end in a 3\u20133 draw.]]\nIn Copa Am\u00e9rica 2011, Colombia showed great skill beating Costa Rica 1\u20130 goal given by [[Adri\u00e1n Ramos]] thanks to an assist by [[Fredy Guar\u00edn]].

After that, they confronted Peru with high expectations. Before extra time, Falcao was given a penalty only to miss by a wide shot, leading to extra time.
