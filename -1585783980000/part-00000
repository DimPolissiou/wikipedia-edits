In 1995, he directed a short film, ''[[The Hard Case]]'', followed by the crime-comedy, ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998), his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in a feature film.

He went on to direct ''[[Revolver (2005 film)|Revolver]]'' (2005) and ''[[RocknRolla]]'' (2008), which were less successful and received mixed audience reviews. In 2009 and 2011, he directed two box-office hits, ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'', respectively. The former was nominated for two [[Academy Awards|Academy Awards\u2014]][[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]].\n\nHis other directed films are ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

In 2009 and 2011, he directed two box-office hits, ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'', respectively.

On September 9, 1886, he became Superintendent of the Naval Academy. He was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] on April 9, 1889, reported to the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]] to fit out the [[protected cruiser]] {{USS|San Francisco|C-5|2}}, and assumed command when she was commissioned on November 15, 1889.

Rear Admiral Sampson, in [[flagship]] {{USS|New York|CA-2|2}}, put to sea from [[Key West]]. Sampson's early involvement in the conflict included his supervision of the Cuban blockade, which lasted for the duration of the war, as well as the bombardment of the city of San Juan on May 12, 1898. After initially being sent to blockade Havana itself, Sampson was given orders to intercept Admiral Cevera's squadron, but with only a vague notion of Cevera's current location, he was unable to actively pursue. Awaiting further information on Cevera's whereabouts, Sampson sailed east to San Juan and carried out a bombardment on May 10 that lasted several days, dealing minor infrastructural damage to the city. After this preliminary bombardment, Sampson helped lead a land-sea attack on San Juan, along with General [[William Rufus Shafter|William Shafter]], taking the city. On July 1, following the successful invasion, Sampson returned to Cuba, reinforcing the blockades in Santiago and Cienfuegos.\n\nOn May 29, elements of Sampson's command spotted Admiral Cevera's squadron moving into Santiago harbor and the naval presence there was greatly increased to prevent Cevera's escape. On the morning of July 3, 1898, Cervera's fleet came out of the harbor. Sampson was ashore at a conference with General Shafter, making plans for a coordinated attack on Santiago.<ref name=\"wb\" /> Rear Admiral [[Winfield Scott Schley]] was in command of the [[Flying Squadron (US Navy)|Flying Squadron]] in Sampson's absence and met the Spanish fleet, completely destroying every Spanish vessel in a running sea battle lasting five hours. The next day, Rear Admiral Sampson sent his famous message: \"The Fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present, the whole of Cervera's Fleet\".\n\nSampson's message omitted any mention of Schley's leadership in the battle, leading to a controversy as to who was responsible for the victory. While Sampson also arguably played a significant role in the victory, having laid down the strategic framework and determining the favorable positions of his own forces, it was of course Schley who had actually commanded the fleet during the battle.<ref name=\"wb\" /> Schley appealed for a court of inquiry, which he got in 1901. In the Navy, the quarrel was so divisive that the rank-and-file identified themselves as either a \"Schley man\" or a \"Sampson man.\" The court of inquiry heard testimony in support of Schley by his own men and, despite some criticism of Schley, exonerated the commander of the Flying Squadron.\n\nAfter the Battle of Santiago Bay, Sampson was appointed Cuban Commissioner on August 20, 1898, but resumed command of the [[North Atlantic Squadron|North Atlantic Fleet]] in December. He became Commandant of the [[Boston Navy Yard]] in October 1899 and transferred to the Retired List on February 9, 1902.\n\nSampson was a companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] and the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]].

She came from the [[Beecher family]], a famous religious family, and is best known for her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which depicts the harsh conditions for enslaved African Americans. The book reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United States and Great Britain, energizing anti-slavery forces in the [[Northern United States|American North]], while provoking widespread anger in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Stowe wrote 30 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and her public stances and debates on social issues of the day.\n\n==Life and work==\nHarriet Elisabeth Beecher was born in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]], on June 14, 1811.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McFarland, Philip.

Her notable siblings included a sister, [[Catharine Beecher]], who became an educator and author, as well as brothers who became ministers: including [[Henry Ward Beecher]], who became a famous preacher and abolitionist, [[Charles Beecher]], and [[Edward Beecher]].<ref>Applegate, Debby (2006).

[[Cincinnati riots of 1829|In 1829 the ethnic Irish attacked blacks]], wrecking areas of the city, trying to push out these competitors for jobs.

The biggest event ever to take place at Lane, it was the series of debates held on 18 days in February 1834, between [[American Colonization Society|colonization]] and abolition defenders, decisively won by [[Theodore Weld]] and other abolitionists.

Stowe showed that slavery touched all of society, beyond the people directly involved as masters, traders and slaves. Her novel added to the debate about abolition and slavery, and aroused opposition in the South. In the South, Stowe was depicted as out of touch, arrogant, and guilty of slander. Within a year, 300 babies in Boston alone were named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eva|Eva (one of the book's characters)]], and a play based on the book opened in New York in November.<ref>Morgan, Jo-Ann.

By 1888, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that as a result of dementia the 77-year-old Stowe started writing ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' over again. She imagined that she was engaged in the original composition, and for several hours every day she industriously used pen and paper, inscribing passages of the book almost exactly word for word. This was done unconsciously from memory, the authoress imagining that she composed the matter as she went along. To her diseased mind the story was brand new, and she frequently exhausted herself with labor which she regarded as freshly created.<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/articles/n2ar19cmt.html \"Rewriting Uncle Tom\"] Retrieved September 6, 2013.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Mark Twain]], a neighbor of Stowe's in Hartford, recalled her last years in the following passage of his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure.  She wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular Irish woman.  Among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always stood open in pleasant weather.  Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free will, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do it.  She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and fetch a war whoop that would jump that person out of his clothes.  And she had other moods.  Sometimes we would hear gentle music in the drawing-room and would find her there at the piano singing ancient and melancholy songs with infinitely touching effect.<ref>{{cite book |title=Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Harriet Elinor |year=2010 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00twai_0/page/438 438\u201339] |isbn=978-0-520-26719-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00twai_0/page/438 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nModern researchers now speculate that at the end of her life Harriet was suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{sfn|Hedrick|1994|p=384}}\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe died on July 1, 1896, in [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], 17 days after her 85th birthday.\nShe is buried in the historic cemetery at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]],<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Her husband was teaching theology at nearby [[Bowdoin College]], and she regularly invited students from the college and friends to read and discuss the chapters before publication. Future [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general, and later Governor, [[Joshua Chamberlain]] was then a student at the college and later described the setting. \"On these occasions,\" Chamberlain noted, \"a chosen circle of friends, mostly young, were favored with the freedom of her house, the rallying point being, however, the reading before publication, of the successive chapters of her Uncle Tom's Cabin, and the frank discussion of them.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2001 [[Bowdoin College]] purchased the house, together with a newer attached building, and was able to raise the substantial funds necessary to restore the house. It is now open to the public.\n\nThe [[Harriet Beecher Stowe House (Connecticut)|Harriet Beecher Stowe House]] in [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], is the house where Stowe lived for the last 23 years of her life. It was next door to the house of fellow author [[Mark Twain]]. In this {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} cottage-style house, there are many of Beecher Stowe's original items and items from the time period. In the research library, which is open to the public, there are numerous letters and documents from the Beecher family. The house is open to the public and offers house tours on the hour.<ref>https://www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org/visit/the-stowe-center/</ref>\n\nIn 1833, during Stowe's time in [[Cincinnati]], the city was afflicted with a serious [[cholera]] epidemic. To avoid illness, Stowe made a visit to [[Washington, Kentucky]], a major community of the era just south of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]]. She stayed with the Marshall Key family, one of whose daughters was a student at Lane Seminary. It is recorded that Mr. Key took her to see a slave auction, as they were frequently held in Maysville. Scholars believe she was strongly moved by the experience. The Marshall Key home still stands in Washington. Key was a prominent Kentuckian; his visitors also included [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]].<ref>Calvert and Klee, ''Towns of Mason County [KY]'', {{LCCN|8662637}}{{dead link|date=June 2019}}, 1986, Maysville and Mason County Library, Historical, and Scientific Association.</ref>\n\nThe Uncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site is part of the restored Dawn Settlement at [[Dresden, Ontario]], which is 20 miles east of [[Algonac, Michigan]]. The community for freed slaves founded by the Rev. Josiah Henson and other abolitionists in the 1830s has been restored. There's also a museum.

She came from the [[Beecher family]], a famous religious family, and is best known for her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which depicts the harsh conditions for enslaved African Americans. The book reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United States and Great Britain, energizing anti-slavery forces in the [[Northern United States|American North]], while provoking widespread anger in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Stowe wrote 30 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and her public stances and debates on social issues of the day.\n\n==Life and work==\nHarriet Elisabeth Beecher was born in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]], on June 14, 1811.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McFarland, Philip. ''Loves of Harriet Beecher Stowe''. New York: Grove Press, 2007: 112. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-4390-7}}</ref> She was the sixth of 11 children {{sfn|Hedrick|1994|p=6}} born to outspoken [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] preacher [[Lyman Beecher]]. Her mother was his first wife, Roxana (Foote), a deeply religious woman who died when Stowe was only five years old. Roxana's maternal grandfather was General Andrew Ward of the Revolutionary War. Her notable siblings included a sister, [[Catharine Beecher]], who became an educator and author, as well as brothers who became ministers: including [[Henry Ward Beecher]], who became a famous preacher and abolitionist, [[Charles Beecher]], and [[Edward Beecher]].<ref>Applegate, Debby (2006).

Stowe showed that slavery touched all of society, beyond the people directly involved as masters, traders and slaves. Her novel added to the debate about abolition and slavery, and aroused opposition in the South. In the South, Stowe was depicted as out of touch, arrogant, and guilty of slander.

By 1888, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that as a result of dementia the 77-year-old Stowe started writing ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' over again. She imagined that she was engaged in the original composition, and for several hours every day she industriously used pen and paper, inscribing passages of the book almost exactly word for word. This was done unconsciously from memory, the authoress imagining that she composed the matter as she went along. To her diseased mind the story was brand new, and she frequently exhausted herself with labor which she regarded as freshly created.<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/articles/n2ar19cmt.html \"Rewriting Uncle Tom\"] Retrieved September 6, 2013.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Mark Twain]], a neighbor of Stowe's in Hartford, recalled her last years in the following passage of his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure.  She wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular Irish woman.  Among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always stood open in pleasant weather.  Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free will, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do it.  She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and fetch a war whoop that would jump that person out of his clothes.  And she had other moods.
