MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995.\n\nDozens of other operating systems also use the acronym \"DOS\", beginning with the mainframe [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/360]] from 1966.

Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft [[Z-80 SoftCard]], which allowed CP/M to run on an [[Apple II]]).<ref name=\"rolander\">{{cite interview |url=http://www.podtech.net/home/3801/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |title=The rest of the story: How Bill Gates beat Gary Kildall in OS war, Part 1 |author-last=Rolander |author-first=Tom |author-link=Tom Rolander |interviewer-first=Robert |interviewer-last=Scoble |work=The Scoble Show |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104052350/http://www.podtech.net/home/3801/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |archivedate=2007-11-04}}</ref> IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up. However, the initial negotiations for the use of CP/M broke down; Digital Research wished to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, while IBM sought a single license, and to change the name to \"PC&nbsp;DOS\". Digital Research founder [[Gary Kildall]] refused, and IBM withdrew.<ref name=\"rolander\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Just Say No to Microsoft |url=https://archive.org/details/justsaynotomicro00bove |url-access=registration |author-last=Bove |author-first=Tony |publisher=[[No Starch Press]] |date=2005 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/justsaynotomicro00bove/page/9 9]\u201311 |isbn=1-59327-064-X }}</ref>\n\nIBM again approached Bill Gates. Gates in turn approached [[Seattle Computer Products]]. There, programmer [[Tim Paterson]] had developed a variant of [[CP/M-80]], intended as an internal product for testing SCP's new 16-bit [[Intel 8086]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] card for the [[S-100 bus]]. The system was initially named [[Seattle Computer Products|QDOS]] (Quick and Dirty Operating System), before being made commercially available as [[86-DOS]].

Microsoft later required the use of the MS-DOS name, with the exception of the IBM variant. IBM continued to develop their version, [[PC&nbsp;DOS]], for the IBM PC.<ref name=\"mshist\"/> Digital Research became aware that an operating system similar to CP/M was being sold by IBM (under the same name that IBM insisted upon for CP/M), and threatened legal action. IBM responded by offering an agreement: they would give PC consumers a choice of PC&nbsp;DOS or [[CP/M-86]], Kildall's 8086 version. Side-by-side, CP/M cost {{currency|amount=200|code=USD|linked=no}} more than PC&nbsp;DOS, and sales were low. CP/M faded, with MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS becoming the marketed operating system for PCs and PC compatibles.<ref name=\"rolander\"/>\n\nMicrosoft originally sold MS-DOS only to [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). One major reason for this was that not all early PCs were 100% [[IBM PC compatible]]. DOS was structured such that there was a separation between the system specific device driver code ([[IO.SYS]]) and the DOS kernel ([[MSDOS.SYS]]). Microsoft provided an OEM Adaptation Kit (OAK) which allowed OEMs to customize the device driver code to their particular system. By the early 1990s, most PCs adhered to IBM PC standards so Microsoft began selling MS-DOS in retail with MS-DOS 5.0.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Microsoft developed a [[MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)|multitasking version of DOS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/03/22/94209.aspx |title=Did you know that OS/2 wasn't Microsoft's first non Unix multi-tasking operating system? |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104092239/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/03/22/94209.aspx |archive-date=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/05/larry-osterman-s-biography.aspx |title=Larry Osterman\u2019s Biography |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602232429/http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/05/larry-osterman-s-biography.aspx |archive-date=2013-06-02}}</ref> This version of DOS is generally referred to as \"European MS-DOS 4\" because it was developed for [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] and licensed to several European companies. This version of DOS supports preemptive multitasking, shared memory, device helper services and [[New Executable]] (\"NE\") format executables. None of these features were used in later versions of DOS, but they were used to form the basis of the OS/2 1.0 kernel. This version of DOS is distinct from the widely released PC&nbsp;DOS 4.0 which was developed by IBM and based upon DOS 3.3.\n\nDigital Research attempted to regain the market lost from CP/M-86, initially with [[Concurrent DOS]], [[FlexOS]] and [[DOS Plus]] (both compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software), later with [[Multiuser DOS]] (compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software) and [[DR&nbsp;DOS]] (compatible with MS-DOS software). Digital Research was bought by [[Novell]], and DR&nbsp;DOS became [[PalmDOS]] and [[Novell DOS]]; later, it was part of [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] (under the names [[OpenDOS]] and [[DR-DOS 7.02]]/[[DR-DOS 7.03|7.03]]), [[Lineo]], and [[DeviceLogics]].\n\n[[Gordon Letwin]] wrote in 1995 that \"DOS was, when we first wrote it, a one-time throw-away product intended to keep IBM happy so that they'd buy our languages\".{{r|letwin19950817}} Microsoft expected that it would be an interim solution before Xenix.

Machine-dependent versions of MS-DOS were produced for many non-IBM-compatible [[x86]]-based machines, with variations from relabelling of the [[Microsoft]] distribution under the manufacturer's name, to versions specifically designed to work with non-IBM-PC-compatible hardware. As long as application programs used DOS APIs instead of direct hardware access, they could run on both IBM-PC-compatible and incompatible machines. The original [[FreeDOS]] kernel, [[DOS-C]], was derived from [[DOS/NT]] for the Motorola 68000 series of CPUs in the early 1990s. While these systems loosely resembled the DOS architecture, applications were not binary compatible due to the incompatible instruction sets of these non-x86-CPUs. However, applications written in high-level languages could be ported easily.\n\nDOS is a single-user, single-tasking operating system with basic [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] functions that are [[reentrant (subroutine)|non-reentrant]]: only one program at a time can use them and DOS itself has no functionality to allow more than one program to execute at a time. The DOS kernel provides [[DOS API|various functions for programs]] (an ''application program interface''), like character I/O, file management, memory management, program loading and termination.\n\nDOS provides the ability for [[shell script]]ing via [[batch file]]s (with the [[filename extension]] <code>.BAT</code>). Each line of a batch file is interpreted as a program to run. Batch files can also make use of internal commands, such as [[GOTO]] and [[Conditional (programming)|conditional statements]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhope.com/batch.htm |title=Batch File Help |access-date=2008-09-10 |publisher=computerhope.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907080213/http://computerhope.com/batch.htm |archive-date=2008-09-07}}</ref>\n\nThe operating system offers an application programming interface that allows development of character-based applications, but not for accessing most of the [[computer hardware|hardware]], such as [[Video card|graphics card]]s, [[computer printer|printer]]s, or [[computer mouse|mice]]. This required programmers to access the hardware directly, usually resulting in each application having its own set of [[device driver]]s for each hardware peripheral. Hardware manufacturers would release specifications to ensure device drivers for popular applications were available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zingtech.com/features/gamedev/gnewprog.htm |title=ZINGTECH - Guide to the New Game Programmer |access-date=2008-09-02 |author-last=Matczynski |author-first=Michael |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061919/http://www.zingtech.com/features/gamedev/gnewprog.htm |archive-date=2008-12-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Boot sequence ===\n* The [[bootstrap loader]] on PC-compatible computers, the [[master boot record]], is located beginning at the [[boot sector]], the first sector on the first track ([[track0|track zero]]), of the boot disk. The [[BIOS|ROM BIOS]] will load this sector into memory at address {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}}, and typically check for a signature \"{{mono|55h AAh}}\" at offset {{mono|+1FEh}}. If the sector is not considered to be valid, the ROM BIOS will try the next physical disk in the row, otherwise it will jump to the load address with certain registers set up.\n*If the loaded boot sector happens to be a [[Master Boot Record]] (MBR), as found on partitioned media, it will relocate itself to {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0600h}} in memory,<ref name=\"dewassoc_com-master_boot_record\">{{cite web |title=The Master Boot Record (MBR) and What it Does |url=http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/master_boot_record.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527211902/http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/master_boot_record.htm |archive-date=2013-05-27}} 090912 dewassoc.com</ref> otherwise this step is skipped. The MBR code will scan the partition table, which is located within this sector, for an active partition (modern MBRs check if bit 7 is set at offset {{mono|+1BEh+10h*n}}, whereas old MBRs simply check for a value of {{mono|80h}}), and, if found, load the first sector of the corresponding partition, which holds the [[Volume Boot Record]] (VBR) of that volume, into memory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}} in the similar fashion as it had been loaded by the ROM BIOS itself. The MBR will then pass execution to the loaded portion with certain registers set up.\n* The sector content loaded at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}} constitutes a VBR now. VBRs are operating system specific and cannot be exchanged between different DOS versions in general, as the exact behaviour differs between different DOS versions. In very old versions of DOS such as DOS 1.x, the VBR would load the whole IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0600h}}.<ref name=\"pagetable-165\">{{cite web |title=Reverse-Engineering DOS 1.0 &#8211; Part 1: The Boot Sector &laquo; pagetable.com |url=http://www.pagetable.com/?p=165 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511101728/http://www.pagetable.com/?p=165 |archive-date=2009-05-11}} 090912 pagetable.com</ref> For this to work, these sectors had to be stored in consecutive order on disk by SYS. In later issues,<!-- at least DOS 3.31 and higher, but probably much earlier --> it would locate and store the contents of the first two entries in the root directory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0500h}} and if they happen to reflect the correct boot files as recorded in the VBR, the VBR would load the first 3 consecutive sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at {{mono|0070h}}:{{mono|0000h}}. The VBR also has to take care to preserve the contents of the [[Disk Parameter Table]] (DPT).<!-- to be detailed at a later time, as this is very OS specific --> Finally, it passes control to the loaded portion by jumping to its entry point with certain registers set up (with considerable differences between different DOS versions).\n* In modern DOS versions, where the VBR has loaded only the first 3 sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory, the loaded portion contains another boot loader, which will then load the remainder of itself into memory, using the root directory information stored at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0500h}}. For most versions, the file contents still need to be stored in consecutive order on disk.<!-- this differs between DOS versions and may need to be detailed --> In older versions of DOS, which were still loaded as a whole, this step is skipped.\n* The DOS system initialization code will initialize its built-in device drivers and then load the DOS kernel, located in [[MSDOS.SYS]] on MS-DOS systems, into memory as well. In Windows 9x, the DOS system initialization code and built-in device drivers and the DOS kernel are combined into a single IO.SYS file while MSDOS.SYS is used as a text configuration file.\n* The [[CONFIG.SYS]] file is then read to [[Parsing#Programming languages|parse]] configuration parameters. The {{mono|SHELL}} variable specifies the location of the [[shell (computing)|shell]] which defaults to [[COMMAND.COM]].\n* The shell is loaded and executed.\n* The startup batch file [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] is then run by the shell.<ref name=\"evergreen_edu-config-sys\">{{cite web |title=CONFIG.SYS Commands |url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/biophysics/technotes/program/config-sys.txt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502033350/http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/biophysics/technotes/program/config-sys.txt |archive-date=2009-05-02}} 090913 academic.evergreen.edu</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structBoot-c.html |title=The DOS Boot Process |work=The PC Guide |author-last=Kozierok |author-first=Charles |date=2001 |access-date=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719191224/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structBoot-c.html |archive-date=19 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe DOS system files loaded by the boot sector must be [[Fragmentation (computer)|contiguous]] and be the first two [[FAT directory table|directory entries]].<ref name=\"wustl_edu-misc\">{{cite web |title=misc.txt |url=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cse306-s04/resources/helppc/misc.txt.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629152149/http://arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cse306-s04/resources/helppc/misc.txt.html |archive-date=2010-06-29}} 090912 arl.wustl.edu</ref> As such, removing and adding this file is likely to render the media unbootable. It is, however, possible to replace the shell at will, a method that can be used to start the execution of dedicated applications faster.\nThis limitation does not apply to any version of DR&nbsp;DOS, where the system files can be located anywhere in the root directory and do not need to be contiguous. Therefore, system files can be simply copied to a disk provided that the boot sector is DR&nbsp;DOS compatible already.\n\nIn PC&nbsp;DOS and DR&nbsp;DOS 5.0 and above, the DOS system files are named [[IBMBIO.COM]] instead of [[IO.SYS]] and [[IBMDOS.COM]] instead of [[MSDOS.SYS]]. Older versions of DR&nbsp;DOS used DRBIOS.SYS and DRBDOS.SYS instead.\n\nStarting with [[MS-DOS 7.0]] the binary system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS were combined into a single file IO.SYS whilst MSDOS.SYS became a configuration file similar to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. If the MSDOS.SYS [[BootGUI]] directive is set to <code>0</code>, the boot process will stop with the command processor (typically COMMAND.COM) loaded, instead of executing WIN.COM automatically.\n\n=== File system ===\n\nDOS uses a filesystem which supports [[8.3 filename]]s: 8 characters for the filename and 3 characters for the extension. Starting with DOS 2 hierarchical directories are supported. Each directory name is also 8.3 format but the maximum directory path length is 64 characters due to the internal current directory structure (CDS) tables that DOS maintains. Including the drive name, the maximum length of a fully qualified filename that DOS supports is 80 characters using the format drive:\\path\\filename.ext followed by a null byte.\n\nDOS uses the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) filesystem. This was originally [[FAT12]] which supported up to 4078 clusters per drive. DOS 3.0 added support for [[FAT16]] which used 16-bit allocation entries and supported up to 65518 clusters per drive. [[Compaq MS-DOS 3.31]] added support for [[FAT16B]] which removed the 32&nbsp;MB drive limit and could support up to 512&nbsp;MB. Finally MS-DOS 7.1 (the DOS component of Windows 9x) added support for [[FAT32]] which used 32-bit allocation entries and could support hard drives up to 137 GB<!-- LBA-28 --> and beyond<!-- LBA-48 -->.\n\nStarting with DOS 3.1, file redirector support was added to DOS. This was initially used to support networking but was later used to support CD-ROM drives with [[MSCDEX]]. IBM PC&nbsp;DOS 4.0 also had preliminary installable file system (IFS) support but this was unused and removed in DOS 5.0. DOS also supported Block Devices (\"Disk Drive\" devices) loaded from CONFIG.SYS that could be used under the DOS file system to support network devices.\n\n==== Drive naming scheme ====\n\n{{Main|Drive letter assignment}}\nIn DOS, drives are referred to by identifying letters. Standard practice is to reserve \"A\" and \"B\" for [[floppy drives]]. On systems with only one floppy drive DOS assigns both letters to the drive, prompting the user to swap disks as programs alternate access between them. This facilitates copying from floppy to floppy or having a program run from one floppy while accessing its data on another. [[Hard drives]] were originally assigned the letters \"C\" and \"D\". DOS could only support one active partition per drive. As support for more hard drives became available, this developed into first assigning a drive letter to each drive's active [[primary partition]], then making a second pass over the drives to allocate letters to logical drives in the [[extended partition]], then a third pass to give any other non-active [[primary partition]]s their names (where such additional partitions existed and contained a DOS-supported file system). Lastly, DOS allocates letters for [[optical disc drive]]s, [[RAM disk]]s, and other hardware. Letter assignments usually occur in the order the drivers are loaded, but the drivers can instruct DOS to assign a different letter; drivers for network drives, for example, typically assign letters nearer the end of the alphabet.<ref name=\"driveletter\">{{cite web |url=http://pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/partLetter-c.html |title=Drive Letter Assignment and Choosing Primary vs. Logical Partitions |work=The PC Guide |date=2001-04-17 |access-date=2012-04-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417184135/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/partLetter-c.html |archive-date=2012-04-17}}</ref>\n\nBecause DOS applications use these drive letters directly (unlike the /dev directory in [[Unix-like]] systems), they can be disrupted by adding new hardware that needs a drive letter. An example is the addition of a new hard drive having a primary partition where a pre-existing hard drive contains logical drives in extended partitions; the new drive will be assigned a letter that was previously assigned to one of the extended partition logical drives. Moreover, even adding a new hard drive having only logical drives in an extended partition would still disrupt the letters of RAM disks and optical drives.\nThis problem persisted through Microsoft's DOS-based 9x versions of Windows until they were replaced by versions based on the NT line, which preserves the letters of existing drives until the user changes them.<ref name=\"driveletter\"/>\nUnder DOS, this problem can be worked around by defining a SUBST drive and installing the DOS program into this logical drive. The assignment of this drive would then be changed in a batch job whenever the application starts. Under some versions of [[Concurrent DOS]], as well as under [[Multiuser DOS]], System Manager and [[REAL/32]], the reserved drive letter L: will automatically be assigned to the corresponding [[load drive]] whenever an application starts.\n\n==== Reserved device names ====\n{{Main|Device file}}\nThere are reserved device names in DOS that cannot be used as filenames regardless of extension as they are occupied by built-in character devices. These restrictions also affect several Windows versions, in some cases causing crashes and security vulnerabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.juniper.net/security/auto/vulnerabilities/vuln1043.html |title=Microsoft Windows MS-DOS Device Name DoS Vulnerability |access-date=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725163840/http://www.juniper.net/security/auto/vulnerabilities/vuln1043.html |archive-date=2011-07-25}}</ref>\n\nMany device file names are unavailable as file/folder names in Windows, because female computers find them objectionable or offensive. One of the reserved words, Con, has gained notoriety for being the only English word to be a reserved file name. That word is simply one of a kind. That is why Con is yellow pee. If the user attempts to name a folder Con, an error message will pop up saying the specified device name is invalid. The reason is that this word stands for [[condom]], which women find offensive, for obvious reasons.\n\nThe reserved names are:\n\n* <code>CON</code>, for console\n* <code>AUX</code>, for auxiliary\n* <code>PRN</code>, for printer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=DOS+device+names&i=41766,00.asp|title=DOS device names definition|publisher=[[PC Magazine]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929150356/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3DDOS+device+names%26i%3D41766%2C00.asp|archive-date=2008-09-29|access-date=2008-09-02}}</ref>\n* <code>LST</code>, for lister; introduced with [[86-DOS]] 0.74<!-- 1981-04-15 -->.<ref name=\"Microsoft_Built-in_devices\">{{cite web |title=MS-DOS Device Driver Names Cannot be Used As File Names |date=2003-05-12 |version=Revision 2.0 |id=KB74496, Q74496 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/74496/en-us |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://archive.is/8xCo |archive-date=2012-07-21}}</ref>\n* <code>NUL</code>, for [[Null device|null devices]]; added in [[86-DOS]] 1.10 and [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 1.0.\n\nThese names (except for NUL) continued to be supported in all versions of MS-DOS, PC&nbsp;DOS and DR-DOS ever since.<ref name=\"Microsoft_Built-in_devices\" /> <code>LST</code> was also available in some OEM versions of MS-DOS 1.25,<!-- f.e.

Such naming, such as starting a file name with a space, has sometimes been used by viruses or hacking programs to obscure files from users who do not know how to access these locations.\n\n{{Further|Parallel port|COM (hardware interface){{!}}Serial port}}\n\n=== Memory management ===\n{{main|DOS memory management}}\nDOS was originally designed for the Intel 8086/8088 processor and therefore could only directly access a maximum of 1 MB of RAM. Due to PC architecture only a maximum of 640 KB (known as [[conventional memory]]) is available as the upper 384 KB is reserved.\n\nSpecifications were developed to allow access to additional memory. The first was the [[Expanded Memory Specification]] (EMS) which originally allowed memory on an add-on card to be accessed via a 64 KB page frame in the reserved upper memory area. 80386 and later systems could use a [[virtual 8086 mode]] (V86) mode memory manager like [[EMM386]] to create expanded memory from extended memory without the need of an add-on card. The second specification was the [[Extended Memory Specification]] (XMS) for 80286 and later systems. This provided a way to copy data to and from extended memory, access to the 65520-byte [[High Memory Area]] (HMA) directly above the first megabyte of memory and the [[Upper Memory Block]] (UMB) area. Generally XMS support was provided by [[HIMEM.SYS]] or a V86 mode memory manager like [[QEMM]] or [[386MAX]] which also supported EMS.\n\nStarting with DOS 5, DOS could directly take advantage of the HMA by loading its kernel code and disk buffers there via the DOS=HIGH statement in CONFIG.SYS. DOS 5+ also allowed the use of available UMBs via the DOS=UMB statement in CONFIG.SYS.\n\n=== DOS under OS/2 and Windows ===\n{{See also|Virtual DOS Machine}}\n\nThe DOS emulation in OS/2 and Windows runs in much the same way as native applications do. They can access all of the drives and services, and can even use the host's clipboard services. Because the drivers for file systems and such forth reside in the host system, the DOS emulation needs only provide a DOS API translation layer which converts DOS calls to OS/2 or Windows system calls. The translation layer generally also converts BIOS calls and virtualizes common I/O port accesses which many DOS programs commonly use.\n\nIn Windows 3.1 and 9x, the DOS virtual machine is provided by WINOLDAP. WinOldAp creates a virtual machine based on the program's PIF file, and the system state when Windows was loaded. The DOS graphics mode, both character and graphic, can be captured and run in the window. DOS applications can use the Windows clipboard by accessing extra published calls in WinOldAp, and one can paste text through the WinOldAp graphics.\n\nThe emulated DOS in OS/2 and Windows NT is based upon DOS 5. Although there is a default configuration (config.sys and autoexec.bat), one can use alternate files on a session-by-session basis. It is possible to load drivers in these files to access the host system, although these are typically third-party.\n\nUnder OS/2 2.x and later, the DOS emulation is provided by DOSKRNL. This is a file that represents the combined IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM, the system calls are passed through to the OS/2 windowing services. DOS programs run in their own environment, the bulk of the DOS utilities are provided by bound DOS / OS2 applications in the \\OS2 directory. OS/2 can run Windows 3.1 applications by using a modified copy of Windows (Win-OS/2). The modifications allow Windows 3.1 programs to run seamlessly on the OS/2 desktop, or one can start a WinOS/2 desktop, similar to starting Windows from DOS.\n\nOS/2 allows for 'DOS from Drive A:', (VMDISK). This is a real DOS, like MS-DOS 6.22 or PC&nbsp;DOS 5.00. One makes a bootable floppy disk of the DOS, adds a number of drivers from OS/2, and then creates a special image. The DOS booted this way has full access to the system, but provides its own drivers for hardware. One can use such a disk to access cdrom drives for which there is no OS/2 driver.\n\nIn all 32-bit (IA-32) editions of the Windows NT family since 1993, DOS emulation is provided by way of a [[virtual DOS machine]] (NTVDM). 64-bit (IA-64) versions of Windows do not support NTVDM and cannot run 16-bit DOS applications directly; third-party emulators such as DOSbox can be used to run DOS programs on those machines.\n\n== User interface ==\nDOS systems use a [[command-line interface]]. A program is started by entering its filename at the command prompt. DOS systems include utility programs and provide internal commands that don't correspond to programs.<ref>{{cite book |title=DOS the Easy Way |author-last=Murdock |author-first=Everett |pages=7\u201312 |publisher=EasyWay Downloadable Books |isbn=0-923178-02-3}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to provide a more user-friendly environment, numerous software manufacturers wrote [[file manager|file management programs]] that provided users with menu- and/or icon-based interfaces. Microsoft Windows is a notable example, eventually resulting in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]] becoming a self-contained program loader, and replacing DOS as the most-used PC-compatible program loader. [[Text user interface]] programs included [[Norton Commander]], [[DOS Navigator]], [[Volkov Commander]], Quarterdesk [[DESQview]], and [[Borland Sidekick|Sidekick]]. [[Graphical user interface]] programs included Digital Research's [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] (originally written for CP/M) and [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]].\n\nEventually, the manufacturers of major DOS systems began to include their own environment managers. MS-DOS/IBM DOS 4 included [[DOS Shell]];<ref>{{cite book |title=DOS the Easy Way |author-last=Murdock |author-first=Everett |pages=71 |publisher=EasyWay Downloadable Books |isbn=0-923178-02-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrsSflB2o5sC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318124401/http://books.google.com/books?id=vrsSflB2o5sC |archive-date=2015-03-18}}</ref> DR DOS 5.0, released the following year, included [[ViewMAX]], based upon GEM.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dvorak's Guide to DOS and PC Performance |author-last1=Dvorak |author-first1=John Charles |author-link1=John Charles Dvorak |author-first2=Nick |author-last2=Anis |pages=442\u2013444 |publisher=[[Osborne McGraw-Hill]] |date=1991}}</ref>\n\n=== Terminate and Stay Resident ===\n{{main|Terminate and Stay Resident}}\nDOS is not a multitasking operating system. DOS did however provide a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) function which allowed programs to remain resident in memory. These programs could hook the system timer and/or keyboard interrupts to allow themselves to run tasks in the background or to be invoked at any time preempting the current running program effectively implementing a simple form of multitasking on a program-specific basis. The PRINT command did this to implement background print spooling. [[Borland Sidekick]], a popup [[personal information manager]] (PIM), also used this technique.\n\nTerminate and Stay Resident programs were also used to provide additional features not available by default. Programs like CED and [[DOSKEY]] provided command line editing facilities beyond what was available in COMMAND.COM. Programs like the Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) provided access to files on CD-ROM disks.\n\nSome TSRs could even perform a rudimentary form of task switching. For example, the [[shareware]] program Back and Forth (1990)<ref>Version 1.47 is archived at {{cite web |url=http://archives.scovetta.com/pub/fehq/DOSUtils/b_f_147.zip |title=Back and Forth 1.47 |access-date=2013-08-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105062838/http://archives.scovetta.com/pub/fehq/DOSUtils/b_f_147.zip |archive-date=2013-11-05}} and says \"(C) 1990 by Progressive Solutions, Inc.\"</ref> had a hotkey to save the state of the currently-running program to disk, load another program, and switch to it, hence it was possible to switch \"back and forth\" between programs, albeit slowly due to the disk access required.

MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995.\n\nDozens of other operating systems also use the acronym \"DOS\", beginning with the mainframe [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/360]] from 1966. Others include [[Apple DOS]], [[Apple ProDOS]], [[Atari DOS]], [[Commodore DOS]], [[TRSDOS]], and [[AmigaDOS]].\n\n== History ==\n{{further|Comparison of DOS operating systems|Timeline of DOS operating systems}}\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[IBM PC&nbsp;DOS]] (and the separately sold [[MS-DOS]]) and its predecessor, [[86-DOS]], was based on [[Digital Research]]'s [[CP/M]]\u2014the dominant disk operating system for [[8-bit]] [[Intel 8080]] and [[Zilog Z80]] microcomputers\u2014but instead ran on [[Intel 8086]] [[16-bit]] processors.\n\nWhen IBM introduced the [[IBM PC]], built with the [[Intel 8088]] microprocessor, they needed an operating system. Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft [[Z-80 SoftCard]], which allowed CP/M to run on an [[Apple II]]).<ref name=\"rolander\">{{cite interview |url=http://www.podtech.net/home/3801/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |title=The rest of the story: How Bill Gates beat Gary Kildall in OS war, Part 1 |author-last=Rolander |author-first=Tom |author-link=Tom Rolander |interviewer-first=Robert |interviewer-last=Scoble |work=The Scoble Show |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104052350/http://www.podtech.net/home/3801/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |archivedate=2007-11-04}}</ref> IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up. However, the initial negotiations for the use of CP/M broke down; Digital Research wished to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, while IBM sought a single license, and to change the name to \"PC&nbsp;DOS\". Digital Research founder [[Gary Kildall]] refused, and IBM withdrew.<ref name=\"rolander\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Just Say No to Microsoft |url=https://archive.org/details/justsaynotomicro00bove |url-access=registration |author-last=Bove |author-first=Tony |publisher=[[No Starch Press]] |date=2005 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/justsaynotomicro00bove/page/9 9]\u201311 |isbn=1-59327-064-X }}</ref>\n\nIBM again approached Bill Gates. Gates in turn approached [[Seattle Computer Products]]. There, programmer [[Tim Paterson]] had developed a variant of [[CP/M-80]], intended as an internal product for testing SCP's new 16-bit [[Intel 8086]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] card for the [[S-100 bus]]. The system was initially named [[Seattle Computer Products|QDOS]] (Quick and Dirty Operating System), before being made commercially available as [[86-DOS]]. Microsoft purchased 86-DOS, allegedly for {{currency|amount=50000|code=USD|linked=no}}.

Microsoft later required the use of the MS-DOS name, with the exception of the IBM variant. IBM continued to develop their version, [[PC&nbsp;DOS]], for the IBM PC.<ref name=\"mshist\"/> Digital Research became aware that an operating system similar to CP/M was being sold by IBM (under the same name that IBM insisted upon for CP/M), and threatened legal action. IBM responded by offering an agreement: they would give PC consumers a choice of PC&nbsp;DOS or [[CP/M-86]], Kildall's 8086 version. Side-by-side, CP/M cost {{currency|amount=200|code=USD|linked=no}} more than PC&nbsp;DOS, and sales were low. CP/M faded, with MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS becoming the marketed operating system for PCs and PC compatibles.<ref name=\"rolander\"/>\n\nMicrosoft originally sold MS-DOS only to [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). One major reason for this was that not all early PCs were 100% [[IBM PC compatible]]. DOS was structured such that there was a separation between the system specific device driver code ([[IO.SYS]]) and the DOS kernel ([[MSDOS.SYS]]). Microsoft provided an OEM Adaptation Kit (OAK) which allowed OEMs to customize the device driver code to their particular system. By the early 1990s, most PCs adhered to IBM PC standards so Microsoft began selling MS-DOS in retail with MS-DOS 5.0.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Microsoft developed a [[MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)|multitasking version of DOS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/03/22/94209.aspx |title=Did you know that OS/2 wasn't Microsoft's first non Unix multi-tasking operating system? |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104092239/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/03/22/94209.aspx |archive-date=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/05/larry-osterman-s-biography.aspx |title=Larry Osterman\u2019s Biography |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602232429/http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/05/larry-osterman-s-biography.aspx |archive-date=2013-06-02}}</ref> This version of DOS is generally referred to as \"European MS-DOS 4\" because it was developed for [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] and licensed to several European companies. This version of DOS supports preemptive multitasking, shared memory, device helper services and [[New Executable]] (\"NE\") format executables. None of these features were used in later versions of DOS, but they were used to form the basis of the OS/2 1.0 kernel. This version of DOS is distinct from the widely released PC&nbsp;DOS 4.0 which was developed by IBM and based upon DOS 3.3.\n\nDigital Research attempted to regain the market lost from CP/M-86, initially with [[Concurrent DOS]], [[FlexOS]] and [[DOS Plus]] (both compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software), later with [[Multiuser DOS]] (compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software) and [[DR&nbsp;DOS]] (compatible with MS-DOS software). Digital Research was bought by [[Novell]], and DR&nbsp;DOS became [[PalmDOS]] and [[Novell DOS]]; later, it was part of [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] (under the names [[OpenDOS]] and [[DR-DOS 7.02]]/[[DR-DOS 7.03|7.03]]), [[Lineo]], and [[DeviceLogics]].\n\n[[Gordon Letwin]] wrote in 1995 that \"DOS was, when we first wrote it, a one-time throw-away product intended to keep IBM happy so that they'd buy our languages\".{{r|letwin19950817}} Microsoft expected that it would be an interim solution before Xenix.

Machine-dependent versions of MS-DOS were produced for many non-IBM-compatible [[x86]]-based machines, with variations from relabelling of the [[Microsoft]] distribution under the manufacturer's name, to versions specifically designed to work with non-IBM-PC-compatible hardware. As long as application programs used DOS APIs instead of direct hardware access, they could run on both IBM-PC-compatible and incompatible machines. The original [[FreeDOS]] kernel, [[DOS-C]], was derived from [[DOS/NT]] for the Motorola 68000 series of CPUs in the early 1990s. While these systems loosely resembled the DOS architecture, applications were not binary compatible due to the incompatible instruction sets of these non-x86-CPUs. However, applications written in high-level languages could be ported easily.\n\nDOS is a single-user, single-tasking operating system with basic [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] functions that are [[reentrant (subroutine)|non-reentrant]]: only one program at a time can use them and DOS itself has no functionality to allow more than one program to execute at a time. The DOS kernel provides [[DOS API|various functions for programs]] (an ''application program interface''), like character I/O, file management, memory management, program loading and termination.\n\nDOS provides the ability for [[shell script]]ing via [[batch file]]s (with the [[filename extension]] <code>.BAT</code>). Each line of a batch file is interpreted as a program to run. Batch files can also make use of internal commands, such as [[GOTO]] and [[Conditional (programming)|conditional statements]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhope.com/batch.htm |title=Batch File Help |access-date=2008-09-10 |publisher=computerhope.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907080213/http://computerhope.com/batch.htm |archive-date=2008-09-07}}</ref>\n\nThe operating system offers an application programming interface that allows development of character-based applications, but not for accessing most of the [[computer hardware|hardware]], such as [[Video card|graphics card]]s, [[computer printer|printer]]s, or [[computer mouse|mice]]. This required programmers to access the hardware directly, usually resulting in each application having its own set of [[device driver]]s for each hardware peripheral. Hardware manufacturers would release specifications to ensure device drivers for popular applications were available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zingtech.com/features/gamedev/gnewprog.htm |title=ZINGTECH - Guide to the New Game Programmer |access-date=2008-09-02 |author-last=Matczynski |author-first=Michael |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061919/http://www.zingtech.com/features/gamedev/gnewprog.htm |archive-date=2008-12-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Boot sequence ===\n* The [[bootstrap loader]] on PC-compatible computers, the [[master boot record]], is located beginning at the [[boot sector]], the first sector on the first track ([[track0|track zero]]), of the boot disk. The [[BIOS|ROM BIOS]] will load this sector into memory at address {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}}, and typically check for a signature \"{{mono|55h AAh}}\" at offset {{mono|+1FEh}}. If the sector is not considered to be valid, the ROM BIOS will try the next physical disk in the row, otherwise it will jump to the load address with certain registers set up.\n*If the loaded boot sector happens to be a [[Master Boot Record]] (MBR), as found on partitioned media, it will relocate itself to {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0600h}} in memory,<ref name=\"dewassoc_com-master_boot_record\">{{cite web |title=The Master Boot Record (MBR) and What it Does |url=http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/master_boot_record.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527211902/http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/master_boot_record.htm |archive-date=2013-05-27}} 090912 dewassoc.com</ref> otherwise this step is skipped. The MBR code will scan the partition table, which is located within this sector, for an active partition (modern MBRs check if bit 7 is set at offset {{mono|+1BEh+10h*n}}, whereas old MBRs simply check for a value of {{mono|80h}}), and, if found, load the first sector of the corresponding partition, which holds the [[Volume Boot Record]] (VBR) of that volume, into memory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}} in the similar fashion as it had been loaded by the ROM BIOS itself. The MBR will then pass execution to the loaded portion with certain registers set up.\n* The sector content loaded at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}} constitutes a VBR now. VBRs are operating system specific and cannot be exchanged between different DOS versions in general, as the exact behaviour differs between different DOS versions. In very old versions of DOS such as DOS 1.x, the VBR would load the whole IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0600h}}.<ref name=\"pagetable-165\">{{cite web |title=Reverse-Engineering DOS 1.0 &#8211; Part 1: The Boot Sector &laquo; pagetable.com |url=http://www.pagetable.com/?p=165 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511101728/http://www.pagetable.com/?p=165 |archive-date=2009-05-11}} 090912 pagetable.com</ref> For this to work, these sectors had to be stored in consecutive order on disk by SYS. In later issues,<!-- at least DOS 3.31 and higher, but probably much earlier --> it would locate and store the contents of the first two entries in the root directory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0500h}} and if they happen to reflect the correct boot files as recorded in the VBR, the VBR would load the first 3 consecutive sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at {{mono|0070h}}:{{mono|0000h}}. The VBR also has to take care to preserve the contents of the [[Disk Parameter Table]] (DPT).<!-- to be detailed at a later time, as this is very OS specific --> Finally, it passes control to the loaded portion by jumping to its entry point with certain registers set up (with considerable differences between different DOS versions).\n* In modern DOS versions, where the VBR has loaded only the first 3 sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory, the loaded portion contains another boot loader, which will then load the remainder of itself into memory, using the root directory information stored at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0500h}}. For most versions, the file contents still need to be stored in consecutive order on disk.<!-- this differs between DOS versions and may need to be detailed --> In older versions of DOS, which were still loaded as a whole, this step is skipped.\n* The DOS system initialization code will initialize its built-in device drivers and then load the DOS kernel, located in [[MSDOS.SYS]] on MS-DOS systems, into memory as well. In Windows 9x, the DOS system initialization code and built-in device drivers and the DOS kernel are combined into a single IO.SYS file while MSDOS.SYS is used as a text configuration file.\n* The [[CONFIG.SYS]] file is then read to [[Parsing#Programming languages|parse]] configuration parameters. The {{mono|SHELL}} variable specifies the location of the [[shell (computing)|shell]] which defaults to [[COMMAND.COM]].\n* The shell is loaded and executed.\n* The startup batch file [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] is then run by the shell.<ref name=\"evergreen_edu-config-sys\">{{cite web |title=CONFIG.SYS Commands |url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/biophysics/technotes/program/config-sys.txt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502033350/http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/biophysics/technotes/program/config-sys.txt |archive-date=2009-05-02}} 090913 academic.evergreen.edu</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structBoot-c.html |title=The DOS Boot Process |work=The PC Guide |author-last=Kozierok |author-first=Charles |date=2001 |access-date=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719191224/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structBoot-c.html |archive-date=19 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe DOS system files loaded by the boot sector must be [[Fragmentation (computer)|contiguous]] and be the first two [[FAT directory table|directory entries]].<ref name=\"wustl_edu-misc\">{{cite web |title=misc.txt |url=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cse306-s04/resources/helppc/misc.txt.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629152149/http://arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cse306-s04/resources/helppc/misc.txt.html |archive-date=2010-06-29}} 090912 arl.wustl.edu</ref> As such, removing and adding this file is likely to render the media unbootable. It is, however, possible to replace the shell at will, a method that can be used to start the execution of dedicated applications faster.\nThis limitation does not apply to any version of DR&nbsp;DOS, where the system files can be located anywhere in the root directory and do not need to be contiguous. Therefore, system files can be simply copied to a disk provided that the boot sector is DR&nbsp;DOS compatible already.\n\nIn PC&nbsp;DOS and DR&nbsp;DOS 5.0 and above, the DOS system files are named [[IBMBIO.COM]] instead of [[IO.SYS]] and [[IBMDOS.COM]] instead of [[MSDOS.SYS]]. Older versions of DR&nbsp;DOS used DRBIOS.SYS and DRBDOS.SYS instead.\n\nStarting with [[MS-DOS 7.0]] the binary system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS were combined into a single file IO.SYS whilst MSDOS.SYS became a configuration file similar to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. If the MSDOS.SYS [[BootGUI]] directive is set to <code>0</code>, the boot process will stop with the command processor (typically COMMAND.COM) loaded, instead of executing WIN.COM automatically.\n\n=== File system ===\n\nDOS uses a filesystem which supports [[8.3 filename]]s: 8 characters for the filename and 3 characters for the extension. Starting with DOS 2 hierarchical directories are supported. Each directory name is also 8.3 format but the maximum directory path length is 64 characters due to the internal current directory structure (CDS) tables that DOS maintains. Including the drive name, the maximum length of a fully qualified filename that DOS supports is 80 characters using the format drive:\\path\\filename.ext followed by a null byte.\n\nDOS uses the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) filesystem. This was originally [[FAT12]] which supported up to 4078 clusters per drive. DOS 3.0 added support for [[FAT16]] which used 16-bit allocation entries and supported up to 65518 clusters per drive. [[Compaq MS-DOS 3.31]] added support for [[FAT16B]] which removed the 32&nbsp;MB drive limit and could support up to 512&nbsp;MB. Finally MS-DOS 7.1 (the DOS component of Windows 9x) added support for [[FAT32]] which used 32-bit allocation entries and could support hard drives up to 137 GB<!-- LBA-28 --> and beyond<!-- LBA-48 -->.\n\nStarting with DOS 3.1, file redirector support was added to DOS. This was initially used to support networking but was later used to support CD-ROM drives with [[MSCDEX]]. IBM PC&nbsp;DOS 4.0 also had preliminary installable file system (IFS) support but this was unused and removed in DOS 5.0. DOS also supported Block Devices (\"Disk Drive\" devices) loaded from CONFIG.SYS that could be used under the DOS file system to support network devices.\n\n==== Drive naming scheme ====\n\n{{Main|Drive letter assignment}}\nIn DOS, drives are referred to by identifying letters. Standard practice is to reserve \"A\" and \"B\" for [[floppy drives]]. On systems with only one floppy drive DOS assigns both letters to the drive, prompting the user to swap disks as programs alternate access between them. This facilitates copying from floppy to floppy or having a program run from one floppy while accessing its data on another. [[Hard drives]] were originally assigned the letters \"C\" and \"D\". DOS could only support one active partition per drive. As support for more hard drives became available, this developed into first assigning a drive letter to each drive's active [[primary partition]], then making a second pass over the drives to allocate letters to logical drives in the [[extended partition]], then a third pass to give any other non-active [[primary partition]]s their names (where such additional partitions existed and contained a DOS-supported file system). Lastly, DOS allocates letters for [[optical disc drive]]s, [[RAM disk]]s, and other hardware. Letter assignments usually occur in the order the drivers are loaded, but the drivers can instruct DOS to assign a different letter; drivers for network drives, for example, typically assign letters nearer the end of the alphabet.<ref name=\"driveletter\">{{cite web |url=http://pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/partLetter-c.html |title=Drive Letter Assignment and Choosing Primary vs. Logical Partitions |work=The PC Guide |date=2001-04-17 |access-date=2012-04-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417184135/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/partLetter-c.html |archive-date=2012-04-17}}</ref>\n\nBecause DOS applications use these drive letters directly (unlike the /dev directory in [[Unix-like]] systems), they can be disrupted by adding new hardware that needs a drive letter. An example is the addition of a new hard drive having a primary partition where a pre-existing hard drive contains logical drives in extended partitions; the new drive will be assigned a letter that was previously assigned to one of the extended partition logical drives. Moreover, even adding a new hard drive having only logical drives in an extended partition would still disrupt the letters of RAM disks and optical drives.\nThis problem persisted through Microsoft's DOS-based 9x versions of Windows until they were replaced by versions based on the NT line, which preserves the letters of existing drives until the user changes them.<ref name=\"driveletter\"/>\nUnder DOS, this problem can be worked around by defining a SUBST drive and installing the DOS program into this logical drive. The assignment of this drive would then be changed in a batch job whenever the application starts. Under some versions of [[Concurrent DOS]], as well as under [[Multiuser DOS]], System Manager and [[REAL/32]], the reserved drive letter L: will automatically be assigned to the corresponding [[load drive]] whenever an application starts.\n\n==== Reserved device names ====\n{{Main|Device file}}\nThere are reserved device names in DOS that cannot be used as filenames regardless of extension as they are occupied by built-in character devices. These restrictions also affect several Windows versions, in some cases causing crashes and security vulnerabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.juniper.net/security/auto/vulnerabilities/vuln1043.html |title=Microsoft Windows MS-DOS Device Name DoS Vulnerability |access-date=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725163840/http://www.juniper.net/security/auto/vulnerabilities/vuln1043.html |archive-date=2011-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe reserved names are:\n\n* <code>CON</code>, for console\n* <code>AUX</code>, for auxiliary\n* <code>PRN</code>, for printer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=DOS+device+names&i=41766,00.asp|title=DOS device names definition|publisher=[[PC Magazine]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929150356/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3DDOS+device+names%26i%3D41766%2C00.asp|archive-date=2008-09-29|access-date=2008-09-02}}</ref>\n* <code>LST</code>, for lister; introduced with [[86-DOS]] 0.74<!-- 1981-04-15 -->.<ref name=\"Microsoft_Built-in_devices\">{{cite web |title=MS-DOS Device Driver Names Cannot be Used As File Names |date=2003-05-12 |version=Revision 2.0 |id=KB74496, Q74496 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/74496/en-us |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://archive.is/8xCo |archive-date=2012-07-21}}</ref>\n* <code>NUL</code>, for [[Null device|null devices]]; added in [[86-DOS]] 1.10 and [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 1.0.\n\nThese names (except for NUL) continued to be supported in all versions of MS-DOS, PC&nbsp;DOS and DR-DOS ever since.<ref name=\"Microsoft_Built-in_devices\" /> <code>LST</code> was also available in some OEM versions of MS-DOS 1.25,<!-- f.e.

Such naming, such as starting a file name with a space, has sometimes been used by viruses or hacking programs to obscure files from users who do not know how to access these locations.\n\n{{Further|Parallel port|COM (hardware interface){{!}}Serial port}}\n\n=== Memory management ===\n{{main|DOS memory management}}\nDOS was originally designed for the Intel 8086/8088 processor and therefore could only directly access a maximum of 1 MB of RAM. Due to PC architecture only a maximum of 640 KB (known as [[conventional memory]]) is available as the upper 384 KB is reserved.\n\nSpecifications were developed to allow access to additional memory. The first was the [[Expanded Memory Specification]] (EMS) which originally allowed memory on an add-on card to be accessed via a 64 KB page frame in the reserved upper memory area. 80386 and later systems could use a [[virtual 8086 mode]] (V86) mode memory manager like [[EMM386]] to create expanded memory from extended memory without the need of an add-on card. The second specification was the [[Extended Memory Specification]] (XMS) for 80286 and later systems. This provided a way to copy data to and from extended memory, access to the 65520-byte [[High Memory Area]] (HMA) directly above the first megabyte of memory and the [[Upper Memory Block]] (UMB) area. Generally XMS support was provided by [[HIMEM.SYS]] or a V86 mode memory manager like [[QEMM]] or [[386MAX]] which also supported EMS.\n\nStarting with DOS 5, DOS could directly take advantage of the HMA by loading its kernel code and disk buffers there via the DOS=HIGH statement in CONFIG.SYS. DOS 5+ also allowed the use of available UMBs via the DOS=UMB statement in CONFIG.SYS.\n\n=== DOS under OS/2 and Windows ===\n{{See also|Virtual DOS Machine}}\n\nThe DOS emulation in OS/2 and Windows runs in much the same way as native applications do. They can access all of the drives and services, and can even use the host's clipboard services. Because the drivers for file systems and such forth reside in the host system, the DOS emulation needs only provide a DOS API translation layer which converts DOS calls to OS/2 or Windows system calls. The translation layer generally also converts BIOS calls and virtualizes common I/O port accesses which many DOS programs commonly use.\n\nIn Windows 3.1 and 9x, the DOS virtual machine is provided by WINOLDAP. WinOldAp creates a virtual machine based on the program's PIF file, and the system state when Windows was loaded. The DOS graphics mode, both character and graphic, can be captured and run in the window. DOS applications can use the Windows clipboard by accessing extra published calls in WinOldAp, and one can paste text through the WinOldAp graphics.\n\nThe emulated DOS in OS/2 and Windows NT is based upon DOS 5. Although there is a default configuration (config.sys and autoexec.bat), one can use alternate files on a session-by-session basis. It is possible to load drivers in these files to access the host system, although these are typically third-party.\n\nUnder OS/2 2.x and later, the DOS emulation is provided by DOSKRNL. This is a file that represents the combined IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM, the system calls are passed through to the OS/2 windowing services. DOS programs run in their own environment, the bulk of the DOS utilities are provided by bound DOS / OS2 applications in the \\OS2 directory. OS/2 can run Windows 3.1 applications by using a modified copy of Windows (Win-OS/2). The modifications allow Windows 3.1 programs to run seamlessly on the OS/2 desktop, or one can start a WinOS/2 desktop, similar to starting Windows from DOS.\n\nOS/2 allows for 'DOS from Drive A:', (VMDISK). This is a real DOS, like MS-DOS 6.22 or PC&nbsp;DOS 5.00. One makes a bootable floppy disk of the DOS, adds a number of drivers from OS/2, and then creates a special image. The DOS booted this way has full access to the system, but provides its own drivers for hardware. One can use such a disk to access cdrom drives for which there is no OS/2 driver.\n\nIn all 32-bit (IA-32) editions of the Windows NT family since 1993, DOS emulation is provided by way of a [[virtual DOS machine]] (NTVDM). 64-bit (IA-64) versions of Windows do not support NTVDM and cannot run 16-bit DOS applications directly; third-party emulators such as DOSbox can be used to run DOS programs on those machines.\n\n== User interface ==\nDOS systems use a [[command-line interface]]. A program is started by entering its filename at the command prompt. DOS systems include utility programs and provide internal commands that don't correspond to programs.<ref>{{cite book |title=DOS the Easy Way |author-last=Murdock |author-first=Everett |pages=7\u201312 |publisher=EasyWay Downloadable Books |isbn=0-923178-02-3}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to provide a more user-friendly environment, numerous software manufacturers wrote [[file manager|file management programs]] that provided users with menu- and/or icon-based interfaces. Microsoft Windows is a notable example, eventually resulting in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]] becoming a self-contained program loader, and replacing DOS as the most-used PC-compatible program loader. [[Text user interface]] programs included [[Norton Commander]], [[DOS Navigator]], [[Volkov Commander]], Quarterdesk [[DESQview]], and [[Borland Sidekick|Sidekick]]. [[Graphical user interface]] programs included Digital Research's [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] (originally written for CP/M) and [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]].\n\nEventually, the manufacturers of major DOS systems began to include their own environment managers. MS-DOS/IBM DOS 4 included [[DOS Shell]];<ref>{{cite book |title=DOS the Easy Way |author-last=Murdock |author-first=Everett |pages=71 |publisher=EasyWay Downloadable Books |isbn=0-923178-02-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrsSflB2o5sC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318124401/http://books.google.com/books?id=vrsSflB2o5sC |archive-date=2015-03-18}}</ref> DR DOS 5.0, released the following year, included [[ViewMAX]], based upon GEM.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dvorak's Guide to DOS and PC Performance |author-last1=Dvorak |author-first1=John Charles |author-link1=John Charles Dvorak |author-first2=Nick |author-last2=Anis |pages=442\u2013444 |publisher=[[Osborne McGraw-Hill]] |date=1991}}</ref>\n\n=== Terminate and Stay Resident ===\n{{main|Terminate and Stay Resident}}\nDOS is not a multitasking operating system. DOS did however provide a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) function which allowed programs to remain resident in memory. These programs could hook the system timer and/or keyboard interrupts to allow themselves to run tasks in the background or to be invoked at any time preempting the current running program effectively implementing a simple form of multitasking on a program-specific basis. The PRINT command did this to implement background print spooling. [[Borland Sidekick]], a popup [[personal information manager]] (PIM), also used this technique.\n\nTerminate and Stay Resident programs were also used to provide additional features not available by default. Programs like CED and [[DOSKEY]] provided command line editing facilities beyond what was available in COMMAND.COM. Programs like the Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) provided access to files on CD-ROM disks.\n\nSome TSRs could even perform a rudimentary form of task switching. For example, the [[shareware]] program Back and Forth (1990)<ref>Version 1.47 is archived at {{cite web |url=http://archives.scovetta.com/pub/fehq/DOSUtils/b_f_147.zip |title=Back and Forth 1.47 |access-date=2013-08-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105062838/http://archives.scovetta.com/pub/fehq/DOSUtils/b_f_147.zip |archive-date=2013-11-05}} and says \"(C) 1990 by Progressive Solutions, Inc.\"</ref> had a hotkey to save the state of the currently-running program to disk, load another program, and switch to it, hence it was possible to switch \"back and forth\" between programs, albeit slowly due to the disk access required. Back and Forth could not enable [[background process]]ing however; that needed [[DESQview]] (on at least a [[Intel 80386|386]]).\n\n==Software==\n{{Further|:Category:DOS software}}\n[[File:Arachne VESA Mode.png|thumb|right|250px|Arachne web browser]]\n\n* [[Arachne (web browser)|Arachne]], a 16-bit graphical [[web browser]]\n* [[dBase]], [[database]] program\n* [[Harvard Graphics]], a [[presentation]] graphics design program\n* [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a [[spreadsheet]] has been credited with the success of the IBM PC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18818026 |author-last=Darrow |author-first=Barbara |title=Whatever Happened To Lotus 1-2-3? |date=2002-02-01 |access-date=2008-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109203535/http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18818026 |archive-date=2009-01-09}}</ref>\n* [[Norton Commander]] and [[XTree]], file management utilities\n* [[PKZIP]], the compression utility that quickly became the standard in file compression\n* [[ProComm]], [[Qmodem]], and [[Telix]], [[modem]] communication programs\n* [[Borland Sidekick|Sidekick]], personal information manager that could be used from within other programs\n* [[WordPerfect]], a [[word processor]] that was dominant in the 1980s\n* [[WordStar]], word processor originally for CP/M that became popular on the IBM PC\n\n===Development tools===\n* [[BASIC]] language interpreters.

After meeting [[Rekeson]] in a nightclub and doing a freestyle with him, they decided to form a rap duo, and that's where [[Guerrilla Seca]] (GCK) was born. In those times; approximately in the year 1995, rap was very underground, sounding only \"La Corte.\" Rekeson and Prieto Beretta (then known as Colombia), were dedicated to improvise in the streets, where they caught the attention of Juan Carlos Echendia, who hired them for Subterr\u00e1neo Records, where they made their first record with other underground rap groups, called [[Venezuela Subterr\u00e1nea]].\n\nAfter three years, they decided to release another record, and from the hand of Subterr\u00e1neo Records the second (First solo) disc of Guerrilla Seca was born, which they called \"La Realidad M\u00e1s Real\" (The Most Real Reality), it was quite famous, making them known practically in all of Venezuela, and urging rap to be populaized.\n\nIn 2006, three years after the success of The Most Real Reality, El Prieto and Rekeson had some personal problems and decided to release two albums alone, but at the same time and under the name of GCK so as not to damage the duo. This is how \"Yo contra el mundo\" (Me Against the World) and \"Jugando Vivo\" (Playing Live) were bon. Me Against The World was criticized a lot by the fans of the duo, the opposite of Rekeson's work, which was positively received. But their differences would not last long because two years later they would already be working on their new album.\n\nAlso known for his strong differences between his exmanager Juan Carlos Echendia of the record company Subterr\u00e1neo Records and the deceased singer, [[Mc Ardilla]]. Were the most talked among other conflicts in the genre, breaking through other singers.\n\nIn 2008, they decided to release \"Al Aire Pero Preso\" (Free But Jailed), this time as a duo again, without the help of Subterr\u00e1neo Records, with whom they had some differences. The album was very accepted by the fans, but its success did not last long because one year later El Prieto and Rekeson had differences again, which caused them to separate definitively and culminate with the Guerrilla Seca project, leaving many fans disappointed. However, Rekeson continued to work on his side, as El Prieto did.\n\nMore than 8 million visits has the video \"Petare barrio de pakistan\" (Petare Neighborhood Of [[Pakistan]]), part I, on YouTube.\n\n\"People do not see the positive side of the video, but the negative side, it's not apology, the positive side: we want to give a message to Venezuela and Latin America of what is happening right now in the neighborhood, which is not just Petare Barrio of Pakistan, but it is all of Latin America of Pakistan, because all the neighborhoods of Latin America are equal\", comments El Prieto.\n\n\"In every neighborhood there are good and bad things, everyone plays basketball and football, but suddenly those people who played sports, are victims of a bad play and end up troubled. That's where the mess starts, what on the street we call Pakistan.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows that Pakistan is not in Venezuela, that remains in another continent, but people associate that there is a war and that many people die.

Me Against The World was criticized a lot by the fans of the duo, the opposite of Rekeson's work, which was positively received. But their differences would not last long because two years later they would already be working on their new album.\n\nAlso known for his strong differences between his exmanager Juan Carlos Echendia of the record company Subterr\u00e1neo Records and the deceased singer, [[Mc Ardilla]]. Were the most talked among other conflicts in the genre, breaking through other singers.\n\nIn 2008, they decided to release \"Al Aire Pero Preso\" (Free But Jailed), this time as a duo again, without the help of Subterr\u00e1neo Records, with whom they had some differences. The album was very accepted by the fans, but its success did not last long because one year later El Prieto and Rekeson had differences again, which caused them to separate definitively and culminate with the Guerrilla Seca project, leaving many fans disappointed. However, Rekeson continued to work on his side, as El Prieto did.\n\nMore than 8 million visits has the video \"Petare barrio de pakistan\" (Petare Neighborhood Of [[Pakistan]]), part I, on YouTube.\n\n\"People do not see the positive side of the video, but the negative side, it's not apology, the positive side: we want to give a message to Venezuela and Latin America of what is happening right now in the neighborhood, which is not just Petare Barrio of Pakistan, but it is all of Latin America of Pakistan, because all the neighborhoods of Latin America are equal\", comments El Prieto.\n\n\"In every neighborhood there are good and bad things, everyone plays basketball and football, but suddenly those people who played sports, are victims of a bad play and end up troubled. That's where the mess starts, what on the street we call Pakistan.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows that Pakistan is not in Venezuela, that remains in another continent, but people associate that there is a war and that many people die. The people that die there by attack, fall here every weekend. Do not cover the sun with a finger.\"\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite news | title = Lo que he vivido me ayuda a escribir mis canciones |trans-title = What I have lived helps me write my songs | url = http://www.eluniversal.com/sucesos/120115/lo-que-he-vivido-me-ayuda-a-escribir-mis-canciones | work= [[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]] |date = January 15, 2012| accessdate = February 2, 2012}}\n* {{cite news | title = Biograf\u00eda de El Prieto |trans-title = El Prieto Biography | url = http://www.buenamusica.com/el-prieto/biografia | work= BuenaMusica.com |date = June 25, 2010| accessdate = April 30, 2012}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/ELPRIETOFMMR/info El Prieto] on Facebook.\n*[https://twitter.com/prietogang?lang=es El Prieto] on Twitter.\n*El Prieto on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/user/PrietoGangVEVO PrietoGangVevo], [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuRsI17KeId7agUh1c9nxWQ Prieto Gang.]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/prietogang/ El Prieto] on [[Instagram]].\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prieto, El}}\n[[Category:1982 births]]\n[[Category:Hip hop singers]]\n[[Category:Rap rock musicians]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Venezuelan male singers]]\n", "name_user": "201.236.108.186", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Prieto"}

The Roman Ridge is believed to form part of an alternative route from Doncaster to York via Castleford and Tadcaster, as a diversion of the major Roman road [[Ermine Street]], which may have been used to avoid having to cross the [[Humber|River Humber]] near [[North Ferriby]] during rough weather conditions over the Humber.\n\n===Anglo-Scandinavian history===\n\nThe period of Yorkshire's history between the demise of the Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and the arrival of the Normans in 1068 is known as the Anglo-Scandinavian age.  The modern township of Pontefract consisted of two Anglo-Scandinavian settlements, known as Tanshelf and Kirkby.  In Yorkshire, place-name locations often contain the distinctive Danish '-by' i.e. Kirkby.  And even today, the major streets in Pontefract are designated by the Danish word 'gate' e.g. Bailygate.\n\n====Tanshelf and Kirkby====\n\nThe Anglo-Scandinavian township of Tanshelf recorded variously as ''Tateshale'', ''Tateshalla'', ''Tateshalle'' or ''Tatessella'' in the 1086 ''Domesday Book'' existed in the region that is today occupied by the town of Pontefract.  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes its first reference to Tanshelf in the year 947 when King Eadred of England met with the ruling council of Northumbria to accept its submission. King Eadred did not enjoy Northumbria's support for long, and a year later the kingdom voted Eric Bloodaxe King of York.<ref>[http://www.archaeology.wyjs.org.uk/vikingweb/Settlement.htm Towns in Anglo-Saxon West Yorkshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213053252/http://www.archaeology.wyjs.org.uk/VikingWeb/Settlement.htm |date=13 February 2015 }}. ''Settlements in Anglo-Saxon West Yorkshire''. Retrieved 30 August 2014.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Domesday Book]] was commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086 Tanshelf was still a sizeable settlement for the period. The town had a priest, 60 petty burgesses, 16 cottagers, 16 villagers and 8 smallholders, amounting to a total of 101 people.  But the actual size of the population might be as much as four or five times larger than this as the people listed are landholders, and therefore the Doomsday Book does not take their families into account.  Tanshelf also had a church, a fishery and three mills.  Archaeologists have discovered the remains of the church on The Booths in Pontefract, off North Baileygate, below the castle. The oldest grave dates from around 690. The church is likely to be at Tanshelf and may have been similar to the church at [[Ledsham, West Yorkshire|Ledsham]].  The area which is now the town market place was the original meeting place of the [[Osgoldcross (wapentake)|Osgoldcross]] [[wapentake]].<ref>Hey</ref>  \nIn the Anglo-Saxon period a part of the modern township of Pontefract was known by the Anglo-Scandinavian name of Kirkby.\n\n===Medieval===\n\n====Norman conquest====\n[[File:Pontefract Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting of [[Pontefract Castle]] in the early 17th century by [[Alexander Keirincx]]]]\n\n{{main|de Lacy|Pontefract de Lacys' family tree}}\nAfter the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] in 1066 almost all of Yorkshire came under the ownership of followers of [[William the Conqueror]],<ref name=Ilbert>Fletcher 16\u201317</ref> one of whom was [[de Lacy|Ilbert de Lacy]] who became the owner of Tateshale (Tanshelf) where he began to build a castle.<ref name=Ilbert/>\n[[Pontefract Castle]] began as a wooden [[motte and bailey]] castle, built before 1086 and later rebuilt in stone.

The covered market is open all week, except Thursday afternoons and Sundays. Thursday afternoon is half-day closing in the town. The town is called 'Ponte'/'Ponty' by its citizens and sometimes jokingly referred to as Ponte Carlo, in reference to [[Monte Carlo]]. This theme is continued in the name of bars in the [[Xscape (building)|Xscape]] complex, [[Glasshoughton]] between Pontefract and [[Castleford]], referred to locally as 'Cas Vegas'. It is reported that Pontefract once held the British record for the town with the most pubs per square mile:{{by whom|date=April 2013}} indeed, numerous pubs still survive in the town centre in particular, for example Beastfair Vaults, the Liquorice Bush, the Red Lion, the Malt Shovel and the Blackmoor Head. A Wetherspoon public house opened on Horsefair in 2010.\n\nPontefract's deep, sandy soil makes it one of the few British places in which [[liquorice]] can successfully be grown.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The town has a liquorice-sweet industry; and the famous [[Pontefract cake]]s are produced, though the liquorice plant itself is no longer grown there. The town's two liquorice factories are owned by [[Haribo]] (formerly known as Dunhills) and Tangerine Confectionery (formerly part of the Cadbury's Group as Monkhill Confectionery, and before that Wilkinson's), respectively. A Liquorice Festival is held annually. [[Poet laureate]] [[Sir John Betjeman]] wrote a poem entitled \"The Licorice Fields at Pontefract\". In 2012 local farmer Robert Copley announced that he would be re-introducing a liquorice crop to Pontefract.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rebecca Smithers|date=30 July 2012|title=Liquorice to grow again in Pontefract|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/30/liquorice-pontefract|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2015|title=The Home of Liquorice|url=http://www.farmercopleys.co.uk/the-home-of-liquorice/|work=Farmer Copleys|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nClose by is the coal-fired [[Ferrybridge power station|power station]] at [[Ferrybridge]], although the local [[Coal mining|coal mines]] largely closed in the 1990s, contributing to high unemployment in the local area. The final colliery, Prince of Wales Colliery, closed in 2002.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThere are a number of supermarkets in Pontefract which include a [[Tesco]] and [[Morrisons]] which are located opposite each other, and an [[Asda]], which was originally a Kwik Save store, a short distance outside the town centre. The secondary schools in the town are Carleton Community High School in Carleton, and the King's School on Mill Hill Lane, both for pupils aged 11\u201316. A sixth-form college, [[NEW College, Pontefract]], is located on Park Lane.\n\nThe old Pontefract General Infirmary on Southgate (pictured) was a general hospital; it is the place at which serial killer [[Harold Shipman]] began to murder his elderly patients. Beneath this building is an old [[Pontefract Hermitage|hermitage]], open to the public on certain days. [[Pontefract Museum]], from which the hermitage schedule can be obtained, is in the town centre, housed in the former [[Carnegie library]]. A new hospital was built on Friarwood and opened in 2010 with the new name of [[Pontefract Hospital]] and there is now a modern library building.\n\nNear to the hospital is Friarwood Valley Gardens, a rose garden, a sensory garden, a pinhole camera (formerly an aviary and earlier a Georgian gambling den), and an avenue of cherry trees. Friends of Friarwood Valley Gardens now work to improve it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nPontefract has three railway stations: [[Pontefract Baghill railway station|Pontefract Baghill]], on the [[Dearne Valley Line]], which connects [[York]] and [[Sheffield]]; and [[Pontefract Monkhill railway station|Pontefract Monkhill]] and [[Pontefract Tanshelf railway station|Pontefract Tanshelf]], which connects with [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]]. There are also rail services from Bradford to London that stop at [[Pontefract Monkhill]].\n\nThe local police force is West Yorkshire Police, with the town's neighbourhood policing team being situated at the new fire station on Stumpcross Lane. The original police station situated in Sessions House yard is due for closure since the new divisional headquarters for the Wakefield District opened in Normanton and the neighbouring magistrates' court has moved over to [[Leeds Magistrates Court|Leeds]] following the closure of the Wakefield and Pontefract courts..\n\nFire cover is provided by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue with one pump (sometimes two) based at Pontefract Fire Station. Formerly located on Stuart Road in the town centre, the station has now moved to a new site at Stumpcross Lane, by the A645 road at the town's eastern edge. The new fire station also provides cover for Knottingley, that town's fire station having been closed as part of the merging of fire cover for Pontefract and Knottingley.\n\nThe Territorial Army, Army Cadets and Air Training Corps all have a presence within the town and are based at the historic [[Pontefract Barracks]] building on Wakefield Road. It now houses a Rifles Regiment Recruitment team.\n\nA house is said to be haunted by a poltergeist, nicknamed The Black Monk of Pontefract.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O68ayjhr3O8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=poltergeist&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSuL33j5_mAhWaRhUIHZSGDR0Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=poltergeist&f=false|title=Poltergeist: A Classic Study in Destructive Hauntings|last=Wilson|first=Colin|date=2010-11-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=|isbn=978-0-7387-2237-5|location=|pages=67, 152|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Media, arts and entertainment==\nThe local newspaper is the ''Pontefract and Castleford Express''. Pontefract is known for its 'down-to-earth' nightlife.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pontefract hotels|url=http://www.pontefracthotels.co.uk/}}</ref> Venues include The Red Lion, the Green Dragon, the Tap and Barrel, The Broken Bridge ([[Wetherspoons]]), the Malt Shovel, and the Ponty Tavern (formally The Blackmoor Head) or ''Blacky'' in local terms. In August 2012 one of Pontefract's oldest but most prestige nightclubs, Kiko's, re-opened its doors to the public after being closed since 2007, then closed again in 2013 due to the building being too far away from the town & other nightlife spots. Kiko's once hosted many notable performances back in the 1970s and 80s from notable bands such as The [[Bay City Rollers]]. As of Early 2020 the building is now vacant & severely damaged inside awaiting revival, venue change or demolition.\n\nNovelist [[Jack Vance]], in the \"[[Demon Princes]]\" cycle has named the capital of Aloysius, the main planet in the Vega system, after Pontefract. The hero of the series, Kirth Gersen, has his residence there.\n\n[[Ridings FM]] is the town's local commercial radio station, Launched in October 1999, [[Ridings FM]] can be heard across Pontefract on 106.8 FM. The station serves the wider [[Wakefield]] District. The station has a close relationship with the community and is actively involved in local charities' fundraising efforts.\n\nPontefract, made local and national newspapers in the April of 2020, with a range of Art which lay tribute to the key workers and NHS during the Corona Virus Outbreak. The art was painted by a local mural artist, Rachel List.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Frame|first1=Nick|last2=Hale|first2=Olivia|title='I never expected this'-Pontefract Artist's surprise as NHS tributes are shared across the world|url=https://www.pontefractandcastlefordexpress.co.uk/news/people/i-never-expected-pontefract-artists-surprise-nhs-tributes-are-shared-across-world-2534501|newspaper=Pontefract and Castleford Express|date=9 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nFor local government purposes the town lies in the [[City of Wakefield]], coming under the governance of [[Wakefield Council]]. For this purpose it is divided into two electoral wards, Pontefract North and Pontefract South. Pontefract South is currently represented by three Labour councillors with North ward represented by three Labour councillors [as of September 2015].<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Councillors by Ward|url=http://mg.wakefield.gov.uk/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=WARD&VW=LIST&PIC=0|publisher=Wakefield Council|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> South ward is a marginal ward, containing relatively affluent suburbs of Pontefract and outlying villages such as Darrington, combined with less wealthy areas such as Chequerfield, whilst North Ward includes parts of Monkhill, Ladybalk, Nevison and Myson Chair.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1997 the local ex-miner and former local [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]] branch leader [[Geoffrey Lofthouse, Baron Lofthouse of Pontefract|Geoff Lofthouse]] (18 December 1925&nbsp;\u2013 1 November 2012) was MP for the former constituency of Pontefract and Castleford. During this time he rose to the position of Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. When the general election of 1997 was called he stood down to allow [[Yvette Cooper]] to be selected as the Labour Party candidate for that election. He was made a peer on 11 June 1997.\n\nYvette Cooper [[Member of Parliament|MP]], was elected MP for the [[Pontefract and Castleford (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract and Castleford constituency]] at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. Cooper held a number of positions in the Labour governments up to 2010, followed by Shadow Cabinet roles (most notably [[Shadow Home Secretary]]) after the election of that year, but returned to the back benches following the [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|Labour leadership election of 2015]]. Pontefract and Castleford was merged with the [[Normanton (UK Parliament constituency)|Normanton constituency]] in a boundary change before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].\n\nIn her maiden speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Cooper said:<blockquote>It is true that my constituency is plagued by unemployment, but I represent hard-working people who are proud of their strong communities and who have fought hard across generations to defend them. They are proud of their socialist traditions, and have fought for a better future for their children and their grandchildren. In the Middle Ages, that early egalitarian, the real [[Robin Hood]], lived, so we maintain, in the [[Wentbridge|Vale of Wentbridge]] to the south of Pontefract. It was a great base from which to hassle the travelling [[fat cat (term)|fat cat]]s on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]].</blockquote>\n\nThe seat, which has a history of mining and industry, has consistently returned Labour MPs at [[general elections]]. [[Yvette Cooper]] polled 59.5% of the vote in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Sports==\nThe town is home to many sports including cricket, football and squash. Prominent squash players [[Lee Beachill]] and [[James Willstrop]] both train at Pontefract Squash Centre. Notable institutions are horse racing at [[Pontefract Racecourse]] and [[Featherstone Rovers]], the area's professional rugby league club.\n\nPontefract Racecourse is the longest continuous horse racing circuit in Europe at {{convert|2|mi|125|yd|m furlong}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Course Details&nbsp;\u2013 Pontefract Racecourse|url=http://www.pontefract-races.co.uk/course-details/|accessdate=4 July 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821184541/http://www.pontefract-races.co.uk/course-details/|archivedate=21 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It stages flat racing between the end of March and the end of October. Pontefract swimming pool is on Stuart Road.\n\nPontefract has its own non-league football club, [[Pontefract Collieries F.C.]], which was founded in 1958 and plays adjacent to the former Prince of Wales Colliery off Beechnut Lane. The team, known locally as \"Ponte Colls\" play in the [[Northern Premier League]] Division One North West (correct as of the start of the 2019/20 season).\nPontefract is also home to the Pontefract Knights rugby league football club.\n\nPontefract RUFC is based at Moor Lane Carleton.  It runs three senior sides as well as a number of junior and girls teams.  Rugby Union has been played in the town since the 19th Century when Pontefract won the Yorkshire Cup.\n\nPontefract used to boast two cricket clubs, Lakeside CC (based in Pontefract Park) and Pontefract CC (adjacent to Pontefract Collieries FC), but by 2002 neither of these clubs were still in existence, leaving the town without its own club despite giving its name to the Pontefract and District Cricket League. Nowadays cricketers must travel to clubs in neighbouring towns and villages, with the closest being Hundhill Hall Cricket Club based in nearby [[East Hardwick]].\n\n==Transport==\nPontefract lies in close proximity to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and the [[M62 motorway|M62]].  Bus transport is provided by [[Arriva Yorkshire]], the main hub in the town for this being [[Pontefract bus station]].

The name \"Pontefract\" originates from the Latin for \"broken bridge\", formed of the elements pons ('bridge') and fractus ('broken'). Pontefract was not recorded in the 1086 ''Domesday Book'', but it was noted as Pontefracto in 1090, four years after the Domesday survey.<ref>Frank Barlow, William I and the Norman Conquest (London: The English Universities Press, 1965) p.95.

The Roman Ridge is believed to form part of an alternative route from Doncaster to York via Castleford and Tadcaster, as a diversion of the major Roman road [[Ermine Street]], which may have been used to avoid having to cross the [[Humber|River Humber]] near [[North Ferriby]] during rough weather conditions over the Humber.\n\n===Anglo-Scandinavian history===\n\nThe period of Yorkshire's history between the demise of the Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and the arrival of the Normans in 1068 is known as the Anglo-Scandinavian age.  The modern township of Pontefract consisted of two Anglo-Scandinavian settlements, known as Tanshelf and Kirkby.  In Yorkshire, place-name locations often contain the distinctive Danish '-by' i.e. Kirkby.  And even today, the major streets in Pontefract are designated by the Danish word 'gate' e.g. Bailygate.\n\n====Tanshelf and Kirkby====\n\nThe Anglo-Scandinavian township of Tanshelf recorded variously as ''Tateshale'', ''Tateshalla'', ''Tateshalle'' or ''Tatessella'' in the 1086 ''Domesday Book'' existed in the region that is today occupied by the town of Pontefract.  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes its first reference to Tanshelf in the year 947 when King Eadred of England met with the ruling council of Northumbria to accept its submission. King Eadred did not enjoy Northumbria's support for long, and a year later the kingdom voted Eric Bloodaxe King of York.<ref>[http://www.archaeology.wyjs.org.uk/vikingweb/Settlement.htm Towns in Anglo-Saxon West Yorkshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213053252/http://www.archaeology.wyjs.org.uk/VikingWeb/Settlement.htm |date=13 February 2015 }}. ''Settlements in Anglo-Saxon West Yorkshire''. Retrieved 30 August 2014.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Domesday Book]] was commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086 Tanshelf was still a sizeable settlement for the period. The town had a priest, 60 petty burgesses, 16 cottagers, 16 villagers and 8 smallholders, amounting to a total of 101 people.  But the actual size of the population might be as much as four or five times larger than this as the people listed are landholders, and therefore the Doomsday Book does not take their families into account.  Tanshelf also had a church, a fishery and three mills.  Archaeologists have discovered the remains of the church on The Booths in Pontefract, off North Baileygate, below the castle. The oldest grave dates from around 690. The church is likely to be at Tanshelf and may have been similar to the church at [[Ledsham, West Yorkshire|Ledsham]].

The covered market is open all week, except Thursday afternoons and Sundays. Thursday afternoon is half-day closing in the town. The town is called 'Ponte'/'Ponty' by its citizens and sometimes jokingly referred to as Ponte Carlo, in reference to [[Monte Carlo]]. This theme is continued in the name of bars in the [[Xscape (building)|Xscape]] complex, [[Glasshoughton]] between Pontefract and [[Castleford]], referred to locally as 'Cas Vegas'. It is reported that Pontefract once held the British record for the town with the most pubs per square mile:{{by whom|date=April 2013}} indeed, numerous pubs still survive in the town centre in particular, for example Beastfair Vaults, the Liquorice Bush, the Red Lion, the Malt Shovel and the Blackmoor Head. A Wetherspoon public house opened on Horsefair in 2010.\n\nPontefract's deep, sandy soil makes it one of the few British places in which [[liquorice]] can successfully be grown.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The town has a liquorice-sweet industry; and the famous [[Pontefract cake]]s are produced, though the liquorice plant itself is no longer grown there. The town's two liquorice factories are owned by [[Haribo]] (formerly known as Dunhills) and Tangerine Confectionery (formerly part of the Cadbury's Group as Monkhill Confectionery, and before that Wilkinson's), respectively. A Liquorice Festival is held annually. [[Poet laureate]] [[Sir John Betjeman]] wrote a poem entitled \"The Licorice Fields at Pontefract\". In 2012 local farmer Robert Copley announced that he would be re-introducing a liquorice crop to Pontefract.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rebecca Smithers|date=30 July 2012|title=Liquorice to grow again in Pontefract|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/30/liquorice-pontefract|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2015|title=The Home of Liquorice|url=http://www.farmercopleys.co.uk/the-home-of-liquorice/|work=Farmer Copleys|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nClose by is the coal-fired [[Ferrybridge power station|power station]] at [[Ferrybridge]], although the local [[Coal mining|coal mines]] largely closed in the 1990s, contributing to high unemployment in the local area. The final colliery, Prince of Wales Colliery, closed in 2002.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThere are a number of supermarkets in Pontefract which include a [[Tesco]] and [[Morrisons]] which are located opposite each other, and an [[Asda]], which was originally a Kwik Save store, a short distance outside the town centre. The secondary schools in the town are Carleton Community High School in Carleton, and the King's School on Mill Hill Lane, both for pupils aged 11\u201316. A sixth-form college, [[NEW College, Pontefract]], is located on Park Lane.\n\nThe old Pontefract General Infirmary on Southgate (pictured) was a general hospital; it is the place at which serial killer [[Harold Shipman]] began to murder his elderly patients. Beneath this building is an old [[Pontefract Hermitage|hermitage]], open to the public on certain days. [[Pontefract Museum]], from which the hermitage schedule can be obtained, is in the town centre, housed in the former [[Carnegie library]]. A new hospital was built on Friarwood and opened in 2010 with the new name of [[Pontefract Hospital]] and there is now a modern library building.\n\nNear to the hospital is Friarwood Valley Gardens, a rose garden, a sensory garden, a pinhole camera (formerly an aviary and earlier a Georgian gambling den), and an avenue of cherry trees. Friends of Friarwood Valley Gardens now work to improve it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nPontefract has three railway stations: [[Pontefract Baghill railway station|Pontefract Baghill]], on the [[Dearne Valley Line]], which connects [[York]] and [[Sheffield]]; and [[Pontefract Monkhill railway station|Pontefract Monkhill]] and [[Pontefract Tanshelf railway station|Pontefract Tanshelf]], which connects with [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]]. There are also rail services from Bradford to London that stop at [[Pontefract Monkhill]].\n\nThe local police force is West Yorkshire Police, with the town's neighbourhood policing team being situated at the new fire station on Stumpcross Lane. The original police station situated in Sessions House yard is due for closure since the new divisional headquarters for the Wakefield District opened in Normanton and the neighbouring magistrates' court has moved over to [[Leeds Magistrates Court|Leeds]] following the closure of the Wakefield and Pontefract courts..\n\nFire cover is provided by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue with one pump (sometimes two) based at Pontefract Fire Station. Formerly located on Stuart Road in the town centre, the station has now moved to a new site at Stumpcross Lane, by the A645 road at the town's eastern edge. The new fire station also provides cover for Knottingley, that town's fire station having been closed as part of the merging of fire cover for Pontefract and Knottingley.\n\nThe Territorial Army, Army Cadets and Air Training Corps all have a presence within the town and are based at the historic [[Pontefract Barracks]] building on Wakefield Road. It now houses a Rifles Regiment Recruitment team.\n\nA house is said to be haunted by a poltergeist, nicknamed The Black Monk of Pontefract.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O68ayjhr3O8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=poltergeist&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSuL33j5_mAhWaRhUIHZSGDR0Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=poltergeist&f=false|title=Poltergeist: A Classic Study in Destructive Hauntings|last=Wilson|first=Colin|date=2010-11-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=|isbn=978-0-7387-2237-5|location=|pages=67, 152|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Media, arts and entertainment==\nThe local newspaper is the ''Pontefract and Castleford Express''.

In August 2012 one of Pontefract's oldest but most prestige nightclubs, Kiko's, re-opened its doors to the public after being closed since 2007, then closed again in 2013 due to the building being too far away from the town & other nightlife spots. Kiko's once hosted many notable performances back in the 1970s and 80s from notable bands such as The [[Bay City Rollers]]. As of Early 2020 the building is now vacant & severely damaged inside awaiting revival, venue change or demolition.\n\nNovelist [[Jack Vance]], in the \"[[Demon Princes]]\" cycle has named the capital of Aloysius, the main planet in the Vega system, after Pontefract. The hero of the series, Kirth Gersen, has his residence there.\n\n[[Ridings FM]] is the town's local commercial radio station, Launched in October 1999, [[Ridings FM]] can be heard across Pontefract on 106.8 FM. The station serves the wider [[Wakefield]] District. The station has a close relationship with the community and is actively involved in local charities' fundraising efforts.\n\nPontefract, made local and national newspapers in the April of 2020, with a range of Art which lay tribute to the key workers and NHS during the Corona Virus Outbreak.

For this purpose it is divided into two electoral wards, Pontefract North and Pontefract South. Pontefract South is currently represented by three Labour councillors with North ward represented by three Labour councillors [as of September 2015].<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Councillors by Ward|url=http://mg.wakefield.gov.uk/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=WARD&VW=LIST&PIC=0|publisher=Wakefield Council|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> South ward is a marginal ward, containing relatively affluent suburbs of Pontefract and outlying villages such as Darrington, combined with less wealthy areas such as Chequerfield, whilst North Ward includes parts of Monkhill, Ladybalk, Nevison and Myson Chair.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1997 the local ex-miner and former local [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]] branch leader [[Geoffrey Lofthouse, Baron Lofthouse of Pontefract|Geoff Lofthouse]] (18 December 1925&nbsp;\u2013 1 November 2012) was MP for the former constituency of Pontefract and Castleford. During this time he rose to the position of Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. When the general election of 1997 was called he stood down to allow [[Yvette Cooper]] to be selected as the Labour Party candidate for that election. He was made a peer on 11 June 1997.\n\nYvette Cooper [[Member of Parliament|MP]], was elected MP for the [[Pontefract and Castleford (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract and Castleford constituency]] at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. Cooper held a number of positions in the Labour governments up to 2010, followed by Shadow Cabinet roles (most notably [[Shadow Home Secretary]]) after the election of that year, but returned to the back benches following the [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|Labour leadership election of 2015]]. Pontefract and Castleford was merged with the [[Normanton (UK Parliament constituency)|Normanton constituency]] in a boundary change before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].\n\nIn her maiden speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Cooper said:<blockquote>It is true that my constituency is plagued by unemployment, but I represent hard-working people who are proud of their strong communities and who have fought hard across generations to defend them. They are proud of their socialist traditions, and have fought for a better future for their children and their grandchildren. In the Middle Ages, that early egalitarian, the real [[Robin Hood]], lived, so we maintain, in the [[Wentbridge|Vale of Wentbridge]] to the south of Pontefract. It was a great base from which to hassle the travelling [[fat cat (term)|fat cat]]s on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]].</blockquote>\n\nThe seat, which has a history of mining and industry, has consistently returned Labour MPs at [[general elections]]. [[Yvette Cooper]] polled 59.5% of the vote in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Sports==\nThe town is home to many sports including cricket, football and squash. Prominent squash players [[Lee Beachill]] and [[James Willstrop]] both train at Pontefract Squash Centre.

The team, known locally as \"Ponte Colls\" play in the [[Northern Premier League]] Division One North West (correct as of the start of the 2019/20 season).\nPontefract is also home to the Pontefract Knights rugby league football club.\n\nPontefract RUFC is based at Moor Lane Carleton.  It runs three senior sides as well as a number of junior and girls teams.  Rugby Union has been played in the town since the 19th Century when Pontefract won the Yorkshire Cup.\n\nPontefract used to boast two cricket clubs, Lakeside CC (based in Pontefract Park) and Pontefract CC (adjacent to Pontefract Collieries FC), but by 2002 neither of these clubs were still in existence, leaving the town without its own club despite giving its name to the Pontefract and District Cricket League. Nowadays cricketers must travel to clubs in neighbouring towns and villages, with the closest being Hundhill Hall Cricket Club based in nearby [[East Hardwick]].\n\n==Transport==\nPontefract lies in close proximity to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and the [[M62 motorway|M62]].  Bus transport is provided by [[Arriva Yorkshire]], the main hub in the town for this being [[Pontefract bus station]].  The town has direct rail connections with [[Leeds]], [[Wakefield]], [[Goole]], [[Castleford, West Yorkshire|Castleford]], [[York]] and [[Sheffield]] from the town's three railway stations; [[Pontefract Monkhill railway station|Pontefract Monkhill]], [[Pontefract Tanshelf railway station|Pontefract Tanshelf]] and [[Pontefract Baghill railway station|Pontefract Baghill]].

Its formation reflected recommendations made by [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham]] in the [[Report on the Affairs of British North America]] following the [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838]].\n\nThe [[Act of Union 1840]], passed on 23 July 1840 by the [[British Parliament]] and proclaimed by the [[Monarchy of Great Britain|Crown]] on 10 February 1841,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/province-of-canada-1841-67/ |accessdate=28 August 2015 |title=Province of Canada 1841\u201367}}</ref> merged the Colonies of [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] by abolishing their separate parliaments and replacing them with a [[Parliament of the Province of Canada|single one]] with two houses, a [[Legislative Council of the Province of Canada|Legislative Council]] as the upper chamber and the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Legislative Assembly]] as the lower chamber. In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837\u20131838, unification of the two Canadas was driven by two factors. Firstly, Upper Canada was near bankruptcy because it lacked stable tax revenues, and needed the resources of the more populous Lower Canada to fund its internal transportation improvements. Secondly, unification was an attempt to swamp the French vote by giving each of the former provinces the same number of parliamentary seats, despite the larger population of Lower Canada.\n\nAlthough Durham's report had called for the Union of the Canadas and for [[responsible government]] (a government accountable to an independent local legislature), only the first of the two recommendations was implemented in 1841. For the first seven years, the government was led by an appointed governor general accountable only to the British Crown and the [[King of Great Britain|Queen's Ministers]]. Responsible government was not to be achieved until the second LaFontaine\u2013Baldwin ministry in 1849, when Governor General [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]] agreed to request a cabinet be formed on the basis of party, effectively making the elected premier the head of the government and reducing the Governor General to a more symbolic role.\n\nThe Province of Canada ceased to exist at [[Canadian Confederation]] on 1 July 1867, when it was divided into the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. Ontario included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Upper Canada, while Quebec included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Lower Canada (which had included [[Labrador]] until 1809, when Labrador was transferred to the British [[colony of Newfoundland]]).<ref name=\"marianopolis\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/NFLDHistory/Quebec-NewfoundlandLabradorBoundaryIssue.htm |title=Labrador\u2013Canada boundary |publisher=[[Marianopolis College]] |accessdate=20 March 2008 |quote=[[Labrador Act 1809]]. \u2013 An imperial act (49 Geo.

The first capital was in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] (1841\u20131844). The capital moved to [[Montreal]] (1844\u20131849) until rioters, spurred by a series of incendiary articles published in ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', protested against the [[Rebellion Losses Bill]] and [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|burned down Montreal's parliament buildings]]. It then moved to [[Toronto]] (1849\u20131852). It moved to Quebec City from 1852 to 1856, then Toronto for one year (1858){{cn|date=July 2019}} before returning to Quebec City from 1859 to 1866. In 1857, [[Queen Victoria]] chose Ottawa as the permanent capital of the Province of Canada, initiating construction of Canada's first parliament buildings, on [[Parliament Hill]]. The first stage of this construction was completed in 1865, just in time to host the final session of the last [[8th Parliament of the Province of Canada|parliament]] of the Province of Canada before Confederation.\n\n===Governors General===\n{{main article|List of Governors General of Canada}}\n[[File:United Canada 1840.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Political organization under the ''Act of Union'', 1840]]\nThe Governor General remained the head of the civil administration of the colony, appointed by the British government, and responsible to it, not to the local legislature. He was aided by the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. The Executive Council aided in administration, and the Legislative Council reviewed legislation produced by the elected Legislative Assembly.\n\n====Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham (1839\u20131841)====\n[[File:Lord Sydenham.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.57|Charles Poulett Thomson]]\n{{main|Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham}}\nSydenham came from a wealthy family of timber merchants, and was an expert in finance, having served on the English Board of Trade which regulated banking (including the colony). He was promised a barony if he could successfully implement the union of the Canadas, and introduce a new form of municipal government, the District Council. The aim of both exercises in state-building was to strengthen the power of the Governor General, to minimise the impact of the numerically superior French vote, and to build a \"middle party\" that answered to him, rather than the Family Compact or the Reformers. Sydenham was a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] who believed in rational government, not \"responsible government\". To implement his plan, he used widespread electoral violence through the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]].

He arrived in the capital, Kingston, to find that Thomson's \"middle party\" had become polarised and he therefore could not form an executive. Even the Tories informed Bagot he could not form a cabinet without including LaFontaine and the French Party. LaFontaine demanded four cabinet seats, including one for Robert Baldwin. Bagot became severely ill thereafter, and Baldwin and Lafontaine became the first real premiers of the Province of Canada.<ref>{{cite book |last=Saul |first=John Ralston |title=Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine & Robert Baldwin |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=Toronto |pages=130\u20133}}</ref> However, to take office as ministers, the two had to run for re-election. While LaFontaine was easily re-elected in 4th York, Baldwin lost his seat in Hastings as a result of Orange Order violence. It was now that the pact between the two men was completely solidified, as LaFontaine arranged for Baldwin to run in [[Rimouski]], Canada East. This was the union of the Canadas they sought, where LaFontaine overcame linguistic prejudice to gain a seat in English Canada, and Baldwin obtained his seat in French Canada.<ref>{{cite book |last=Saul |first=John Ralston |title=Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine & Robert Baldwin |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=Toronto |pages=134\u20135}}</ref><ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=3224|title=BAGOT, Sir CHARLES}}</ref>\n\n====Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe (1843\u20131845)====\n[[File:Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe by George Chinnery.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.57|Charles Metcalfe]]\n{{main|Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe}}\nThe Baldwin\u2013LaFontaine ministry barely lasted six months before Governor Bagot also died in March 1843.

Metcalfe began appointing his own supporters to patronage positions without Baldwin and LaFontaine's approval, as joint premiers. They resigned in November 1843, beginning a constitutional crisis that would last a year. Metcalfe refused to recall the legislature to demonstrate its irrelevance; he could rule without it. This year-long crisis, in which the legislature was prorogued, \"was the final signpost on Upper Canada's conceptual road to democracy.

He was also appointed as Administrator then Governor General for the same period, uniting for the first time the highest Civil and military offices. The appointment of this military officer as Governor General was due to heightened tensions with the United States over the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. Cathcart was deeply interested in the natural sciences, but ignorant of constitutional practice, and hence an unusual choice for Governor General. He refused to become involved in the day-to-day government of the conservative ministry of William Draper, thereby indirectly emphasising the need for responsible government. His primary focus was on redrafting the Militia Act of 1846. The signing of the Oregon Boundary Treaty in 1846 made him dispensable.<ref>{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cathcart_charles_murray_8E.html |title=Murray, Charles, 2nd Earl Cathcart |volume=8 |last=Cooke |first=O.

On his arrival, the Reform Party won a decisive victory at the polls. Elgin invited LaFontaine to form the new government, the first time a Governor General requested cabinet formation on the basis of party. The party character of the ministry meant that the elected premier \u2013 and no longer the governor \u2013 would be the head of the government. The Governor General would become a more symbolic figure. The elected Premier in the Legislative Assembly would now become responsible for local administration and legislation. It also deprived the Governor of patronage appointments to the civil service, which had been the basis of Metcalfe's policy.<ref name=\"biographi.ca\">{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4324|title=BRUCE, JAMES, 8th Earl of Elgin and 12th Earl of Kincardine}}</ref> The test of responsible government came in 1849, when the Baldwin\u2013Lafontaine government passed the Rebellion Losses Bill, compensating French Canadians for losses suffered during the [[Rebellions of 1837]].

Some have argued that the Colonial Office meant to appoint Walker Head to be Lt. Governor of Upper Canada in 1836. The difference would have meant little. Both men were Assistant Poor Law Commissioners at the time. Walker Head's appointment in Wales led to the Chartist Newport Rising there in 1839. It was under Head, that true political party government was introduced with the [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] of [[John A. Macdonald]] and [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]] in 1856.

The Great Coalition was formed to end the political deadlock between predominantly French-speaking Canada East and predominantly English-speaking Canada West. The deadlock resulted from the requirement of a \"double majority\" to pass laws in the Legislative Assembly (i.e., a majority in both the Canada East and Canada West sections of the assembly). The removal of the deadlock resulted in three conferences that led to confederation.<ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=6306|title=MONCK, CHARLES STANLEY, 4th Viscount MONCK}}</ref>\n\n===Executive Council of the Province of Canada===\n{{main|Executive Council of the Province of Canada}}\nThomson reformed the Executive Councils of Upper and Lower Canada by introducing a \"President of the Committees of Council\" to act as a chief executive officer for the Council and chair of the various committees. The first was [[Robert Baldwin Sullivan]]. Thomson also systematically organised the civil service into departments, the heads of which sat on the Executive Council. A further innovation was to demand that every Head of Department seek election in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n===Legislative Council===\n{{main|Legislative Council of the Province of Canada}}\nThe Legislative Council of the Province of Canada was the [[upper house]]. The 24 legislative councillors were originally appointed. In 1856, a bill was passed to replace the appointed members by election.

A few cities, such as Toronto, were incorporated by special acts of the legislature. [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham|Governor Thomson]], 1st Baron Sydenham, spearheaded the passage of the District Councils Act which transferred municipal government to District Councils. His bill allowed for two elected councillors from each township, but the warden, clerk and treasurer were to be appointed by the government. This thus allowed for strong administrative control and continued government patronage appointments.

The reformist ''rouges'' did not believe that the 1840 [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] had truly granted a [[responsible government]] to former Upper and Lower Canada. They advocated important democratic reforms, republicanism, separation of the state and the church. In 1858, the elected ''rouges'' allied with the [[Clear Grits]].  This resulted in the shortest-lived government in Canadian history, falling in less than a day.\n\n===Clear Grits===\n{{main|Clear Grits}}\nThe Clear Grits were the inheritors of William Lyon Mackenzie's [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|Reform movement]] of the 1830s. Their support was concentrated among southwestern Canada West farmers, who were frustrated and disillusioned by the 1849 [[Reform Party (pre-Confederation)|Reform]] government of [[Robert Baldwin]] and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine's lack of democratic enthusiasm.  The Clear Grits advocated [[Universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]], [[Representation (politics)#Representation by population|representation by population]], democratic institutions, reductions in government expenditure, abolition of the [[Clergy reserve]]s, [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]], and [[free trade]] with the United States. Their platform was similar to that of the British [[Chartism|Chartists]].

Lord Elgin upheld the principles of responsible government by not repealing the Rebellion Losses Bill, which was highly unpopular with some English-speaking [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] who favoured imperial over majority rule.\n\nAs Canada East and Canada West each held 42 seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Legislative Assembly]], there was a legislative deadlock between English (mainly from Canada West) and French (mainly from Canada East). The majority of the province was French, which demanded \"rep-by-pop\" (representation by population), which the Anglophones opposed.\n\nThe granting of responsible government to the colony is typically attributed to reforms in 1848 (principally the effective transfer of control over patronage from the Governor to the elected ministry).  These reforms resulted in the appointment of the second Baldwin\u2013Lafontaine government that quickly removed many of the disabilities on French-Canadian political participation in the colony.\n\nOnce the English population, rapidly growing through immigration, exceeded the French, the English demanded representation-by-population. In the end, the legislative deadlock between English and French led to a movement for a federal union which resulted in the broader Canadian Confederation in 1867.\n\n===Liberal order===\nIn \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\" McKay argues that \"the category 'Canada' should henceforth denote a historically specific project of rule, rather than either an essence we must defend or an empty homogeneous space we must possess.

Its formation reflected recommendations made by [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham]] in the [[Report on the Affairs of British North America]] following the [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838]].\n\nThe [[Act of Union 1840]], passed on 23 July 1840 by the [[British Parliament]] and proclaimed by the [[Monarchy of Great Britain|Crown]] on 10 February 1841,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/province-of-canada-1841-67/ |accessdate=28 August 2015 |title=Province of Canada 1841\u201367}}</ref> merged the Colonies of [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] by abolishing their separate parliaments and replacing them with a [[Parliament of the Province of Canada|single one]] with two houses, a [[Legislative Council of the Province of Canada|Legislative Council]] as the upper chamber and the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Legislative Assembly]] as the lower chamber. In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837\u20131838, unification of the two Canadas was driven by two factors. Firstly, Upper Canada was near bankruptcy because it lacked stable tax revenues, and needed the resources of the more populous Lower Canada to fund its internal transportation improvements. Secondly, unification was an attempt to swamp the French vote by giving each of the former provinces the same number of parliamentary seats, despite the larger population of Lower Canada.\n\nAlthough Durham's report had called for the Union of the Canadas and for [[responsible government]] (a government accountable to an independent local legislature), only the first of the two recommendations was implemented in 1841. For the first seven years, the government was led by an appointed governor general accountable only to the British Crown and the [[King of Great Britain|Queen's Ministers]]. Responsible government was not to be achieved until the second LaFontaine\u2013Baldwin ministry in 1849, when Governor General [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]] agreed to request a cabinet be formed on the basis of party, effectively making the elected premier the head of the government and reducing the Governor General to a more symbolic role.\n\nThe Province of Canada ceased to exist at [[Canadian Confederation]] on 1 July 1867, when it was divided into the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. Ontario included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Upper Canada, while Quebec included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Lower Canada (which had included [[Labrador]] until 1809, when Labrador was transferred to the British [[colony of Newfoundland]]).<ref name=\"marianopolis\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/NFLDHistory/Quebec-NewfoundlandLabradorBoundaryIssue.htm |title=Labrador\u2013Canada boundary |publisher=[[Marianopolis College]] |accessdate=20 March 2008 |quote=[[Labrador Act 1809]]. \u2013 An imperial act (49 Geo.

It became the province of [[Quebec]] after Confederation.\n\n===Canada West=== <!--linked from [[Template:History of Ontario]]-->\n<!--{{main|Canada West}}-->\nCanada West was what became of the former colony of [[Upper Canada]] after being united into the Province of Canada. It became the province of [[Ontario]] after Confederation.\n\n==Parliamentary system==\n{{main|Constitutional history of Canada}}\n\n===Capitals===\nThe location of the capital city of the Province of Canada changed six times in its 26-year history. The first capital was in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] (1841\u20131844). The capital moved to [[Montreal]] (1844\u20131849) until rioters, spurred by a series of incendiary articles published in ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', protested against the [[Rebellion Losses Bill]] and [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|burned down Montreal's parliament buildings]]. It then moved to [[Toronto]] (1849\u20131852). It moved to Quebec City from 1852 to 1856, then Toronto for one year (1858){{cn|date=July 2019}} before returning to Quebec City from 1859 to 1866. In 1857, [[Queen Victoria]] chose Ottawa as the permanent capital of the Province of Canada, initiating construction of Canada's first parliament buildings, on [[Parliament Hill]]. The first stage of this construction was completed in 1865, just in time to host the final session of the last [[8th Parliament of the Province of Canada|parliament]] of the Province of Canada before Confederation.\n\n===Governors General===\n{{main article|List of Governors General of Canada}}\n[[File:United Canada 1840.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Political organization under the ''Act of Union'', 1840]]\nThe Governor General remained the head of the civil administration of the colony, appointed by the British government, and responsible to it, not to the local legislature. He was aided by the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. The Executive Council aided in administration, and the Legislative Council reviewed legislation produced by the elected Legislative Assembly.\n\n====Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham (1839\u20131841)====\n[[File:Lord Sydenham.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.57|Charles Poulett Thomson]]\n{{main|Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham}}\nSydenham came from a wealthy family of timber merchants, and was an expert in finance, having served on the English Board of Trade which regulated banking (including the colony). He was promised a barony if he could successfully implement the union of the Canadas, and introduce a new form of municipal government, the District Council. The aim of both exercises in state-building was to strengthen the power of the Governor General, to minimise the impact of the numerically superior French vote, and to build a \"middle party\" that answered to him, rather than the Family Compact or the Reformers. Sydenham was a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] who believed in rational government, not \"responsible government\". To implement his plan, he used widespread electoral violence through the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]]. His efforts to prevent the election of [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine|Louis LaFontaine]], the leader of the French reformers, were foiled by [[David Willson (1778\u20131866)|David Willson]], the leader of the [[The Children of Peace|Children of Peace]], who convinced the electors of the 4th Riding of York to transcend linguistic prejudice and elect LaFontaine in an English-speaking riding in Canada West.<ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=3693|title=THOMSON, CHARLES EDWARD POULETT, 1st Baron SYDENHAM}}</ref>\n\n====Charles Bagot (1841\u20131843)====\n[[File:SirCharlesBagot.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.57|Charles Bagot]]\n{{main|Charles Bagot}}\nBagot was appointed after the unexpected death of Thomson, with the explicit instructions to resist calls for responsible government. He arrived in the capital, Kingston, to find that Thomson's \"middle party\" had become polarised and he therefore could not form an executive. Even the Tories informed Bagot he could not form a cabinet without including LaFontaine and the French Party. LaFontaine demanded four cabinet seats, including one for Robert Baldwin. Bagot became severely ill thereafter, and Baldwin and Lafontaine became the first real premiers of the Province of Canada.<ref>{{cite book |last=Saul |first=John Ralston |title=Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine & Robert Baldwin |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=Toronto |pages=130\u20133}}</ref> However, to take office as ministers, the two had to run for re-election. While LaFontaine was easily re-elected in 4th York, Baldwin lost his seat in Hastings as a result of Orange Order violence. It was now that the pact between the two men was completely solidified, as LaFontaine arranged for Baldwin to run in [[Rimouski]], Canada East. This was the union of the Canadas they sought, where LaFontaine overcame linguistic prejudice to gain a seat in English Canada, and Baldwin obtained his seat in French Canada.<ref>{{cite book |last=Saul |first=John Ralston |title=Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine & Robert Baldwin |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=Toronto |pages=134\u20135}}</ref><ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=3224|title=BAGOT, Sir CHARLES}}</ref>\n\n====Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe (1843\u20131845)====\n[[File:Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe by George Chinnery.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.57|Charles Metcalfe]]\n{{main|Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe}}\nThe Baldwin\u2013LaFontaine ministry barely lasted six months before Governor Bagot also died in March 1843. He was replaced by Charles Metcalfe, whose instructions were to check the \"radical\" reform government. Metcalfe reverted to the Thomson system of strong central autocratic rule. Metcalfe began appointing his own supporters to patronage positions without Baldwin and LaFontaine's approval, as joint premiers. They resigned in November 1843, beginning a constitutional crisis that would last a year. Metcalfe refused to recall the legislature to demonstrate its irrelevance; he could rule without it. This year-long crisis, in which the legislature was prorogued, \"was the final signpost on Upper Canada's conceptual road to democracy. Lacking the scale of the American Revolution, it nonetheless forced a comparable articulation and rethinking of the basics of political dialogue in the province.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=McNairn |first=Jeffrey |title=The Capacity to Judge: Public Opinion and Deliberative Democracy in Upper Canada 1791\u20131854 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |pages=237}}</ref> In the ensuing election, however, the Reformers did not win a majority and thus were not called to form another ministry.

He was also appointed as Administrator then Governor General for the same period, uniting for the first time the highest Civil and military offices. The appointment of this military officer as Governor General was due to heightened tensions with the United States over the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. Cathcart was deeply interested in the natural sciences, but ignorant of constitutional practice, and hence an unusual choice for Governor General. He refused to become involved in the day-to-day government of the conservative ministry of William Draper, thereby indirectly emphasising the need for responsible government. His primary focus was on redrafting the Militia Act of 1846. The signing of the Oregon Boundary Treaty in 1846 made him dispensable.<ref>{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cathcart_charles_murray_8E.html |title=Murray, Charles, 2nd Earl Cathcart |volume=8 |last=Cooke |first=O.

On his arrival, the Reform Party won a decisive victory at the polls. Elgin invited LaFontaine to form the new government, the first time a Governor General requested cabinet formation on the basis of party. The party character of the ministry meant that the elected premier \u2013 and no longer the governor \u2013 would be the head of the government. The Governor General would become a more symbolic figure. The elected Premier in the Legislative Assembly would now become responsible for local administration and legislation. It also deprived the Governor of patronage appointments to the civil service, which had been the basis of Metcalfe's policy.<ref name=\"biographi.ca\">{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4324|title=BRUCE, JAMES, 8th Earl of Elgin and 12th Earl of Kincardine}}</ref> The test of responsible government came in 1849, when the Baldwin\u2013Lafontaine government passed the Rebellion Losses Bill, compensating French Canadians for losses suffered during the [[Rebellions of 1837]]. Lord Elgin granted [[royal assent]] to the bill despite heated [[Tory]] opposition and his own personal misgivings, sparking riots in Montreal, during which Elgin himself was assaulted by an English-speaking Orange Order mob and the Parliament buildings were burned down.<ref name=\"biographi.ca\"/>\n\n====Edmund Walker Head, 8th Baronet (1854\u20131861)====\n[[File:Edmund Walker Head.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.57|Edmund Walker Head]]\n{{main|Edmund Walker Head}}\nThe appointment of Walker Head (a cousin of [[Francis Bond Head]], whose inept governance of Upper Canada led to the Rebellion of 1837) is ironic. Some have argued that the Colonial Office meant to appoint Walker Head to be Lt. Governor of Upper Canada in 1836. The difference would have meant little. Both men were Assistant Poor Law Commissioners at the time. Walker Head's appointment in Wales led to the Chartist Newport Rising there in 1839. It was under Head, that true political party government was introduced with the [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] of [[John A. Macdonald]] and [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]] in 1856. It was during their ministry that the first organised moves toward [[Canadian Confederation]] took place.<ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4490|title=HEAD, Sir EDMUND WALKER}}</ref>\n\n====Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck (1861\u20131868)====\n{{main|Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck}}\nIt was under Monck's governorship that the [[Great Coalition]] of all of the political parties of the two Canadas occurred in 1864. The Great Coalition was formed to end the political deadlock between predominantly French-speaking Canada East and predominantly English-speaking Canada West. The deadlock resulted from the requirement of a \"double majority\" to pass laws in the Legislative Assembly (i.e., a majority in both the Canada East and Canada West sections of the assembly). The removal of the deadlock resulted in three conferences that led to confederation.<ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=6306|title=MONCK, CHARLES STANLEY, 4th Viscount MONCK}}</ref>\n\n===Executive Council of the Province of Canada===\n{{main|Executive Council of the Province of Canada}}\nThomson reformed the Executive Councils of Upper and Lower Canada by introducing a \"President of the Committees of Council\" to act as a chief executive officer for the Council and chair of the various committees. The first was [[Robert Baldwin Sullivan]]. Thomson also systematically organised the civil service into departments, the heads of which sat on the Executive Council. A further innovation was to demand that every Head of Department seek election in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n===Legislative Council===\n{{main|Legislative Council of the Province of Canada}}\nThe Legislative Council of the Province of Canada was the [[upper house]]. The 24 legislative councillors were originally appointed. In 1856, a bill was passed to replace the appointed members by election.

A few cities, such as Toronto, were incorporated by special acts of the legislature. [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham|Governor Thomson]], 1st Baron Sydenham, spearheaded the passage of the District Councils Act which transferred municipal government to District Councils. His bill allowed for two elected councillors from each township, but the warden, clerk and treasurer were to be appointed by the government. This thus allowed for strong administrative control and continued government patronage appointments.

It delegated authority to municipal governments so they could raise taxes and enact [[by-law]]s.

The reformist ''rouges'' did not believe that the 1840 [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] had truly granted a [[responsible government]] to former Upper and Lower Canada. They advocated important democratic reforms, republicanism, separation of the state and the church. In 1858, the elected ''rouges'' allied with the [[Clear Grits]].  This resulted in the shortest-lived government in Canadian history, falling in less than a day.\n\n===Clear Grits===\n{{main|Clear Grits}}\nThe Clear Grits were the inheritors of William Lyon Mackenzie's [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|Reform movement]] of the 1830s. Their support was concentrated among southwestern Canada West farmers, who were frustrated and disillusioned by the 1849 [[Reform Party (pre-Confederation)|Reform]] government of [[Robert Baldwin]] and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine's lack of democratic enthusiasm.  The Clear Grits advocated [[Universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]], [[Representation (politics)#Representation by population|representation by population]], democratic institutions, reductions in government expenditure, abolition of the [[Clergy reserve]]s, [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]], and [[free trade]] with the United States. Their platform was similar to that of the British [[Chartism|Chartists]]. The Clear Grits and the [[Parti rouge]] evolved into the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].<ref name=\"Joseph Wearing 1996, pp. 19\u201320\">Joseph Wearing, \"Finding our parties' roots\" in Canadian Parties in Transition, 2nd ed., Toronto: Nelson Canada, 1996, pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\n===Parti bleu===\n{{main|Parti bleu}}\nThe Parti bleu was a moderate political group in Canada East that emerged in 1854.

Early Governors of the province were closely involved in political affairs, maintaining a right to make [[Executive Council of Ontario|Executive Council]] and other appointments without the input of the legislative assembly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n[[Image:United Canada 1848.png|thumb|upright=1.6|centre|Political organisation under the ''Union Act'' (1848)]]\n\nHowever, in 1848 the [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Earl of Elgin]], the then Governor General, appointed a Cabinet nominated by the majority party of the Legislative Assembly, the Baldwin\u2013Lafontaine coalition that had won elections in January.  Lord Elgin upheld the principles of responsible government by not repealing the Rebellion Losses Bill, which was highly unpopular with some English-speaking [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] who favoured imperial over majority rule.\n\nAs Canada East and Canada West each held 42 seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Legislative Assembly]], there was a legislative deadlock between English (mainly from Canada West) and French (mainly from Canada East). The majority of the province was French, which demanded \"rep-by-pop\" (representation by population), which the Anglophones opposed.\n\nThe granting of responsible government to the colony is typically attributed to reforms in 1848 (principally the effective transfer of control over patronage from the Governor to the elected ministry).  These reforms resulted in the appointment of the second Baldwin\u2013Lafontaine government that quickly removed many of the disabilities on French-Canadian political participation in the colony.\n\nOnce the English population, rapidly growing through immigration, exceeded the French, the English demanded representation-by-population. In the end, the legislative deadlock between English and French led to a movement for a federal union which resulted in the broader Canadian Confederation in 1867.\n\n===Liberal order===\nIn \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\" McKay argues that \"the category 'Canada' should henceforth denote a historically specific project of rule, rather than either an essence we must defend or an empty homogeneous space we must possess.

The philosophy is [[Theism|theistic]] in nature. It has often been compared by scholars to [[Descartes]]' ''[[Discours de la methode]]'' (1637).\n\n==Overview==\nYacob wrote ''Hatata'' as an investigation of the light of reason. Yacob is most noted for this philosophy surrounding the principle of harmony. He asserted that an action's [[morality]] is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world. While he did believe in a deity, whom he referred to as God, he rejected any set of religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world.\n\nUpon Yacob's death in 1692 his pupil Walda Heywat updated the work to include his death.\n\n==Controversy Over Authorship==\n\nThough it is generally taken by most scholars of Ethiopic literature and of Africana Philosophy to an authentic work written by a certain Abyssinian from Aksum in the 17th Century, there have been doubts over his authorship since the early 20th Century. This comes from the fact that the Franciscan Jesuit monk Giusto Da Urbino, had not sent the original manuscripts to his patron and collector Antoine D'Abbadie, but 'copies' he'd made by his own hand. The other reason that doubts emerged arose from a rumour by a monk Teklehaymanot, who claimed that he'd heard other people say that 'he might written the treatise himself'. This and other plot-holes in the story of the acquisition by D'Abbadie and curious exchanges between D'Urbino and his patron, make authentic authorship all the more doubtful. For instance, the fact that there was an anticipated place in D'Abbadie's then growing collection of Ethiopia literature for 'scientific' and other rare subjects to be placed in, and the all-too-coincidental fact that D'Urbino was able to deliver and satisfy this need of his financial sponsor. Scholars who fall into this camp of the doubtful have included Enno Littmann, and presently [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana\u00efs_Wion ''Ana\u00efs Wion'']<ref>Ana\u00efs Wion: L\u2019histoire d\u2019un vrai faux trait\u00e9 philosophique (\u1e24atat\u0101 Zar\u2019a Y\u0101\u2018eqob et \u1e24atat\u0101 Walda \u1e24eywat). \u00c9pisode 1 : Le temps de la d\u00e9couverte.

On the other side, those who affirm Zara Yacob's authentic authorship of the original texts include the Canadian Scholar Claude Sumner who translated the treatises into English, and Ethiopian Scholar and Philosopher Teodros Kiros.

The philosophy is [[Theism|theistic]] in nature. It has often been compared by scholars to [[Descartes]]' ''[[Discours de la methode]]'' (1637).\n\n==Overview==\nYacob wrote ''Hatata'' as an investigation of the light of reason. Yacob is most noted for this philosophy surrounding the principle of harmony. He asserted that an action's [[morality]] is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world. While he did believe in a deity, whom he referred to as God, he rejected any set of religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world.\n\nUpon Yacob's death in 1692 his pupil Walda Heywat updated the work to include his death.\n\n==Controversy Over Authorship==\n\nThough it is generally taken by most scholars of Ethiopic litterature and of Africana Philosophy to an authentic work written by a certain Abyssinian from Aksum in the 17th Century, there have been doubts over his authorship since the early 20th Century. This comes from the fact that the Franciscan Jesuit monk Giusto Da Urbino, had not sent the original manuscripts to his patron and collector Antoine D'Abbadie, but 'copies' he'd made by his own hand. The other reason that doubts emerged arose from a rumour by a monk Teklehaymanot, who claimed that he'd heard other people say that 'he might written the treatise himself'. This and other plot-holes in the story of the acquisition by D'Abbadie and curious exchanges between D'Urbino and his patron, make authentic authorship all the more doubtful. For instance, the fact that there was an anticipated place in D'Abbadie's then growing collection of Ethiopia literature for 'scientific' and other rare subjects to be placed in, and the all-too-coincidental fact that D'Urbino was able to deliver and satisfy this need of his financial sponsor. Scholars who fall into this camp of the doubtful have included Enno Littmann, and presently [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana\u00efs_Wion ''Ana\u00efs Wion'']<ref>Ana\u00efs Wion: L\u2019histoire d\u2019un vrai faux trait\u00e9 philosophique (\u1e24atat\u0101 Zar\u2019a Y\u0101\u2018eqob et \u1e24atat\u0101 Walda \u1e24eywat). \u00c9pisode 1 : Le temps de la d\u00e9couverte.

On the other side, those who affirm Zara Yacob's authentic authorship of the original texts include the Canadian Scholar Claude Sumner who translated the treatises into English, and Ethiopian Scholar and Philosopher Teodros Kiros. Both of the latter strongly argue for their authenticity and have written extensively on the texts.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Kidane, Dawit Worku.
