It was incorporated as a borough in 1872. It is known to many in Schuylkill County as \"Gun-Town\", for reasons unknown.\n\nGirardville is the site of an annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade that is one of the  largest in Pennsylvania.  It made history on March 29, 2008 when former President Bill Clinton joined the marchers to the delight of 30,000 parade goers that lined the streets of the small coal town. The Annual AOH Girardville St. Patrick's Day Parade celebrated its 13th parade in 2016 and becomes more popular every year. It is known as \"The Best and Biggest Little St. Patrick's Day Parade This Side of the Atlantic\". It is truly a \"Pipe Band\" parade and those pipes call people back from all over Pennsylvania, the US, and beyond home to their Girardville roots.\n\nGirardville had five churches, one  New Community Fellowship Church, one Methodist Episcopal, one Lutheran and two Roman Catholic Churches, St. Vincent de Paul and St. Joseph.  St. Joseph's Church was closed in July, 2015, while St. Vincent's was kept open as a worship center for the newly formed Parish of St. Charles Borremeo, with the main church in Ashland (the former St.Joseph's). The Reverend Father Edward B. Connolly was the last Pastor of both Catholic Churches.  Father Connolly has appeared on EWTN in the series \"Road to Cana\". He has since retired.\n\nGirardville was home to radio station [[WQDD-LP]], until its license was cancelled by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] on June 27, 2018.\n\n==Geography==\nGirardville is located at {{coord|40|47|32|N|76|17|4|W|type:city}} (40.792104, -76.284555).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|0.5|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and 1.85% is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Entrance to Girardville, Schuylkill Co PA.JPG|left|thumb|Road to Girardville.]]\n[[File:Anthracite on Main St, Girardville PA.JPG|left|thumb|The Anthracite on Main Street.]]\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 2730\n|1890= 3584\n|1900= 3666\n|1910= 4396\n|1920= 4482\n|1930= 4891\n|1940= 4602\n|1950= 3864\n|1960= 2958\n|1970= 2450\n|1980= 2268\n|1990= 1889\n|2000= 1742\n|2010= 1519\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1449\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 1,742 people, 767 households, and 486 families residing in the borough.

[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.17% of the population.\n\nThere were 767 households out of which 23.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.5% were married couples living together, 14.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.6% were non-families. 34.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 19.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Cody]] (Buffalo Bill), was postmaster and had a small general store in Girardville in 1869\u22121874, leaving town to go out west to find Gold. His poem \"Only a Miner Killed\" about his experiences as a miner in the region was said to be used by [[Bob Dylan]] as the basis for his song \"Only a Hobo.\"\n\nAnother famous citizen was John \"Black Jack\" Kehoe, the high constable of Girardville during the 1870s, whose charismatic leadership in the fight for labor rights by the coal miners of the period earned him a place in local, state, national and world history. Jack Kehoe was a member of the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] and several divisions of the AOH now bear his name. Kehoe has gone down in history as a member of the [[Molly Maguires]], a group of Irish immigrants who committed acts against the mine and railroad owners and was hung along with 19 other alleged Molly Maguires in a series of trials. These hangings are popularly known as \"The Day of the Rope\". Today, Black Jack's tavern in Girardville, The Hibernian House, continues to be operated by his great grandson, Joseph Wayne and is a popular destination for historians, genealogists, and tourists searching for information on the Molly Maguires, the coal region culture, and their Irish roots. Wayne's exhaustive efforts in the 1970s obtained a posthumous pardon for his great grandfather through then Pennsylvania governor [[Milton Shapp]]. John Kehoe, a native of [[County Wicklow|County Wicklow, Ireland]], was buried in old St. Jerome's Cemetery in [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania|Tamaqua]]. His gravesite is a historical site maintained by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nColonel [[Patrick H.

[[Anthracite coal]] deposits are in the region. Coal-mining provided employment and incomes for many of the 3,666 people who lived there in 1900. In 1910, 4,396 individuals called it home. The population was 1,519 at the 2010 census.

It was incorporated as a borough in 1872. It is known to many in Schuylkill County as \"Gun-Town\", for reasons unknown.\n\nGirardville is the site of an annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade that is one of the  largest in Pennsylvania.  It made history on March 29, 2008 when former President Bill Clinton joined the marchers to the delight of 30,000 parade goers that lined the streets of the small coal town. The Annual AOH Girardville St. Patrick's Day Parade celebrated its 13th parade in 2016 and becomes more popular every year. It is known as \"The Best and Biggest Little St. Patrick's Day Parade This Side of the Atlantic\". It is truly a \"Pipe Band\" parade and those pipes call people back from all over Pennsylvania, the US, and beyond home to their Girardville roots.\n\nGirardville had five churches, one  New Community Fellowship Church, one Methodist Episcopal, one Lutheran and two Roman Catholic Churches, St. Vincent de Paul and St. Joseph.  St. Joseph's Church was closed in July, 2015, while St. Vincent's was kept open as a worship center for the newly formed Parish of St. Charles Borremeo, with the main church in Ashland (the former St.Joseph's). The Reverend Father Edward B. Connolly was the last Pastor of both Catholic Churches.  Father Connolly has appeared on EWTN in the series \"Road to Cana\".

Cody]] (Buffalo Bill), was postmaster and had a small general store in Girardville in 1869\u22121874, leaving town to go out west to find Gold. His poem \"Only a Miner Killed\" about his experiences as a miner in the region was said to be used by [[Bob Dylan]] as the basis for his song \"Only a Hobo.\"\n\nAnother famous citizen was John \"Black Jack\" Kehoe, the high constable of Girardville during the 1870s, whose charismatic leadership in the fight for labor rights by the coal miners of the period earned him a place in local, state, national and world history. Jack Kehoe was a member of the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] and several divisions of the AOH now bear his name. Kehoe has gone down in history as a member of the [[Molly Maguires]], a group of Irish immigrants who committed acts against the mine and railroad owners and was hung along with 19 other alleged Molly Maguires in a series of trials. These hangings are popularly known as \"The Day of the Rope\". Today, Black Jack's tavern in Girardville, The Hibernian House, continues to be operated by his great grandson, Joseph Wayne and is a popular destination for historians, genealogists, and tourists searching for information on the Molly Maguires, the coal region culture, and their Irish roots. Wayne's exhaustive efforts in the 1970s obtained a posthumous pardon for his great grandfather through then Pennsylvania governor [[Milton Shapp]]. John Kehoe, a native of [[County Wicklow|County Wicklow, Ireland]], was buried in old St. Jerome's Cemetery in [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania|Tamaqua]]. His gravesite is a historical site maintained by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nColonel [[Patrick H.

During her skiing career Marshall won over 40 [[FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup|World Cup]] medals, including 17 World Cup gold medals. Marshall competed in aerial skiing as a demonstration sport at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville Winter Olympics]], and as a medal event at the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Lillehammer]] and [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano]] games, where she came sixth and fourteenth, respectively.\n\nIn December 2002, aged 33, Marshall was elected as a Member of Parliament in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] for the [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor Party]].\n\nOn 26 February 2003, she was ejected from the Lower House chamber for breastfeeding her 11-day-old baby, Charlotte Louise. A section of the Parliamentary rules, namely Standing Order 30, states: \"Unless by order of the House, no Member of this House shall presume to bring any stranger into any part of the House appropriated to the Members of this House while the House, or a Committee of the whole House, is sitting.\"  As there is no age limit to \u2018strangers in the House\u2019 (non-elected persons), only MPs and certain parliamentary staff are allowed in the House during sitting times.<ref name=\"PM1\">[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]: [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s793397.htm Victorian MP and baby ejected from House]</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the Speaker of the House set aside a room in which female MPs can feed their children without violating the Standing Orders.\n\n== Early life and sporting career ==\nMarshall was born in Melbourne on 21 April 1969 and grew up in the Melbourne suburb of [[Black Rock, Victoria|Black Rock]] with parents, Ron and Anne, older sister, Sascha and younger brother, Carey. She attended Black Rock Primary school (Prep - Yr 6), then Mentone Girls High School (now Mentone Secondary College) before transferring to [[Firbank Girls' Grammar School]] in Yr 9. She moved to Taylors College for year 12.\n\nMarshall, along with her siblings, started skiing from the age of 4 at the Mount Baw Baw ski resort in Victoria, Australia. In 1981 the family became regular skiers at the Mount Buller ski resort, one of the largest ski resorts in Victoria. In 1987 she joined Team Buller, a Freestyle ski team run by Geoff Lipshut, Peter Braun, Eyal Talmore, Tim Skate and David Freedman based on Mount Buller.\n\nThe creation of a skier-exchange program for Freestyle Aerialists saw three Japanese skiers spend the 1987 winter in Mount Buller one of whom, Takayo Yokoyama, was nearing the end of his career and was interested in becoming an International coach. With little prospects in his native country, the chance meeting in Australia saw Marshall being offered a four-month scholarship in Inawashiro, Listel Ski Fantasia, the center for Freestyle Skiing in Japan, with Takayo as her coach.\n\nFollowing the 1988 Australian Freestyle competition where she placed first, Marshall decided to follow the European winter and compete on the four-month [[FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup|World Cup]] Season. Sponsored by a Melbourne-based travel company, she headed overseas as the only Australian representative in either Aerials, Moguls or Ballet (Acrobatics).\n\nWhile not truly competitive with her single back layout and single front tuck, she completed her rookie season finishing in 10th position, at that time one of the highest placing by an Australian winter athlete, male or female, in any winter sport other than Lyn Gross (La Clusaz World Cup Aerials). Malcolm Milne (World Cup Downhill) Steve Lee (World Cup Downhill) [[Zali Steggall]] (World Cup Slalom). In 1990 Marshall won her first World Cup event. In 1992, she was crowned World Champion, with six World Cup victories, and competed in aerial skiing as a demonstration sport at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville Winter Olympics]], . She was Australia's flag bearer at the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics]], where she was placed sixth in the women's aerial skiing event \u2013 the nation's best Olympic result at the time. She also competed in the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano Winter Olympics]]. Marshall set several world records over the course of her skiing career, including becoming the first woman in history to score over 100 points on a single competition jump, with a score of 104.37. Her 17th career World Cup gold medal in 1998 tied her for the all-time record for career World Cup aerial victories with Canadian skier Marie Claude Asselin, who retired in 1984. She has been a board member of the [[Olympic Winter Institute of Australia]] since her retirement from skiing.<ref name=\"sahof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sahof.org.au/hall-of-fame/member-profile/?memberID=534&memberType=athlete|title=Kirstie Marshall OAM|publisher=Sport Australia Hall of Fame|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nMarshall discovered current Australian aerial skier, [[David Morris (Australian Aerial Skier)|David Morris]], while attending a gymnastics display at his local club, which is within her electorate of Forest Hill.\n\n== Political career ==\nOn 3 September 2002, Victorian State Premier [[Steve Bracks]] announced that Marshall had been nominated for preselection as a Labor candidate in the Victorian state seat of Forest Hill.

During her skiing career Marshall won over 40 [[FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup|World Cup]] medals, including 17 World Cup gold medals. Marshall competed in aerial skiing as a demonstration sport at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville Winter Olympics]], and as a medal event at the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Lillehammer]] and [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano]] games, where she came sixth and fourteenth, respectively.\n\nIn December 2002, aged 33, Marshall was elected as a Member of Parliament in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] for the [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor Party]].\n\nOn 26 February 2003, she was ejected from the Lower House chamber for breastfeeding her 11-day-old baby, Charlotte Louise. A section of the Parliamentary rules, namely Standing Order 30, states: \"Unless by order of the House, no Member of this House shall presume to bring any stranger into any part of the House appropriated to the Members of this House while the House, or a Committee of the whole House, is sitting.\"  As there is no age limit to \u2018strangers in the House\u2019 (non-elected persons), only MPs and certain parliamentary staff are allowed in the House during sitting times.<ref name=\"PM1\">[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]: [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s793397.htm Victorian MP and baby ejected from House]</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the Speaker of the House set aside a room in which female MPs can feed their children without violating the Standing Orders.\n\n== Early life and sporting career ==\nMarshall was born in Melbourne on 21 April 1969 and grew up in the Melbourne suburb of [[Black Rock, Victoria|Black Rock]] with parents, Ron and Anne, older sister, Sascha and younger brother, Carey. She attended Black Rock Primary school (Prep - Yr 6), then Mentone Girls High School (now Mentone Secondary College) before transferring to [[Firbank Girls' Grammar School]] in Yr 9. She moved to Taylors College for year 12.\n\nMarshall, along with her siblings, started skiing from the age of 4 at the Mount Baw Baw ski resort in Victoria, Australia. In 1981 the family became regular skiers at the Mount Buller ski resort, one of the largest ski resorts in Victoria. In 1987 she joined Team Buller, a Freestyle ski team run by Geoff Lipshut, Peter Braun, Eyal Talmore, Tim Skate and David Freedman based on Mount Buller.\n\nThe creation of a skier-exchange program for Freestyle Aerialists saw three Japanese skiers spend the 1987 winter in Mount Buller one of whom, Takayo Yokoyama, was nearing the end of his career and was interested in becoming an International coach.

He is best known for being a member of the [[contemporary Christian music|Christian pop]] group [[dc Talk]]. As a solo artist following the band going on hiatus, he has recorded 18 full-length studio albums, including a Christmas album. From 2012 until 2014, he was the lead singer of the band [[Audio Adrenaline]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn Kevin Max Smith, Max changed his name to \"Kevin Max\" in 1997 as a tribute to his adoptive father. Max was adopted by the Smith family and grew up in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. Max attended Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia; while there, he started a band called Connection.\n\n==Career==\n===dc Talk years (1989\u20132001)===\nWhile at [[Liberty University]], he met fellow [[dc Talk]] bandmates: [[tobyMac|Toby McKeehan]] (\"tobyMac\") and [[Michael Tait]]. They formed DC Talk and went on to achieve great success in both [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] and mainstream music. The band went on to win 4 [[Grammy Award]]s, 16 [[GMA Dove Awards]], and other recognition. The band went on hiatus in 2000.\n\n===Going solo (2001\u20132012)===\nMax's first solo album, ''[[Stereotype Be]]'', released on August 28, 2001, was praised by [[Allmusic]] for \"[combining] pop, rock, and world music to create a versatile and intriguing project.\".<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r546280|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Stereotype Be'' Review  |first=Ashleigh |last=Kittle |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref> Artists [[Adrian Belew]] and [[Tony Levin]] of [[King Crimson]], [[Larry Norman]] and drummer [[Matt Chamberlain]] contributed to the album along with Max's collaborator Erick Cole.  It became a turning point in Max's career, as the project was a foreshadowing of Max's own brand of alternative music.\n\nWhile ''Stereotype Be'' has developed a considerable cult following, it was not well received in the Christian music market. Soon after its release, Max was dropped from his Christian label, [[Forefront Records]]. Undeterred, Max began to slowly build his solo career through live shows and word-of-mouth. He released independent albums via his website, including ''[[Between the Fence & the Universe]]'' and a spoken-word collaboration with Adrian Belew, ''[[Raven Songs 101]]'', both in 2004.\n\nIn fall of 2004, Max's [[word-of-mouth]] strategy finally began to pay off. He played the title role in the [[Visalia Theatre Company]] / [[Hutson-Cavale Productions]] revival of the classic [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''. Later that year, he signed a new deal with [[Northern Records]] and released a second full-length album, ''[[The Imposter (album)|The Imposter]]'' on October 18, 2005. He released a [[Christmas music|Christmas]] album, ''[[Holy Night (Kevin Max album)|Holy Night]]'', in time for the 2005 Christmas season.\n\nIn April 2007, Infinity Music announced that Max had been signed to their label for his next project. ''[[The Blood (album)|The Blood]]'' was released on December 26, 2007.<ref name=\"ymz\" /> According to Max, \"The Blood is not a classic hymns cover project or a white/homogenized version of black gospel or soul music. It's a sensitive and stylized adaption of the music that was at the root of rock and roll, blues and popular culture.\"<ref name=\"ymz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.yourmusiczone.com/go/ymz/music_artist/max_kevin |title=Kevin Max |publisher=Yourmusiczone.com |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080401060520/http://www.yourmusiczone.com/go/ymz/music_artist/max_kevin <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = April 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMax has attempted to create a name for himself apart from [[DC Talk]].

He is best known for being a member of the [[contemporary Christian music|Christian pop]] group [[dc Talk]]. As a solo artist following the band going on hiatus, he has recorded 18 full-length studio albums, including a Christmas album. From 2012 until 2014, he was the lead singer of the band [[Audio Adrenaline]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn Kevin Max Smith, Max changed his name to \"Kevin Max\" in 1997 as a tribute to his adoptive father. Max was adopted by the Smith family and grew up in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. Max attended Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia; while there, he started a band called Connection.\n\n==Career==\n===dc Talk years (1989\u20132001)===\nWhile at [[Liberty University]], he met fellow [[dc Talk|DC Talk]] bandmates: [[tobyMac|Toby McKeehan]] (\"tobyMac\") and [[Michael Tait]]. They formed DC Talk and went on to achieve great success in both [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] and mainstream music. The band went on to win 4 [[Grammy Award]]s, 16 [[GMA Dove Awards]], and other recognition. The band went on hiatus in 2000.\n\n===Going solo (2001\u20132012)===\nMax's first solo album, ''[[Stereotype Be]]'', released on August 28, 2001, was praised by [[Allmusic]] for \"[combining] pop, rock, and world music to create a versatile and intriguing project.\".<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r546280|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Stereotype Be'' Review  |first=Ashleigh |last=Kittle |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref> Artists [[Adrian Belew]] and [[Tony Levin]] of [[King Crimson]], [[Larry Norman]] and drummer [[Matt Chamberlain]] contributed to the album along with Max's collaborator Erick Cole.  It became a turning point in Max's career, as the project was a foreshadowing of Max's own brand of alternative music.\n\nWhile ''Stereotype Be'' has developed a considerable cult following, it was not well received in the Christian music market. Soon after its release, Max was dropped from his Christian label, [[Forefront Records]]. Undeterred, Max began to slowly build his solo career through live shows and word-of-mouth. He released independent albums via his website, including ''[[Between the Fence & the Universe]]'' and a spoken-word collaboration with Adrian Belew, ''[[Raven Songs 101]]'', both in 2004.\n\nIn fall of 2004, Max's [[word-of-mouth]] strategy finally began to pay off. He played the title role in the [[Visalia Theatre Company]] / [[Hutson-Cavale Productions]] revival of the classic [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''. Later that year, he signed a new deal with [[Northern Records]] and released a second full-length album, ''[[The Imposter (album)|The Imposter]]'' on October 18, 2005. He released a [[Christmas music|Christmas]] album, ''[[Holy Night (Kevin Max album)|Holy Night]]'', in time for the 2005 Christmas season.\n\nIn April 2007, Infinity Music announced that Max had been signed to their label for his next project.

In 1905 it was replaced by a larger church, and the old church became the parish hall.

Old-style families were replaced by single-parent families, who were joined by previously unknown (or, at least, unrecognized) residents like gays and lesbians and unmarried couples living together.

Foremost of the changes was the ministry to members of the LGBT community, many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Crawley\u2019s successor, Neil Gray (1991\u20132003), set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  The result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion.\n\nIn 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's. \n\nSt Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  \n\nIn 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.  At the principal Sunday morning service, the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer which was used for the last time in 1995.\n\nA contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used for the first time in 1981 and the Book of Common Prayer rite was used for the last time in 2014.\n\nGray's successor, Markus D\u00fcnzkofer (2004\u20132012), made regular use of a nave altar for celebrating Eucharist.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 58.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the Eucharist was first celebrated in St Paul's by a woman priest, Barbara Blakely.

This cave is believed to be in present-day [[China]].\n\nFolktales and folk-songs describes places such as [[Shan State|Shan]], Raken (known as [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in Myanmar) etc. which are located in present-day [[Myanmar]].\n\nWashed up and over by myriads of interpretations and takes, the genesis of the Gangtes is almost like a well-kept secret bedimmed by theories of grandeur or otherwise. As is won't to any tribal history wanting in documentation, the Gangtes have their chronicle etched in folklores and traditional oral transmissions and legends.\n\nThere are two theories regarding the origin of Gangte.\n\nFirstly, the name Gangte derived from a place called \"Ganggam\" and all the inhabitants were called Gang-te, meaning \"from Gang\" or \"people of (from) Ganggam or Gangland\".\n\nSecondly, Gangte is believed to be the name of the ancestor of the Gangte.\n\nAccording to one folktale, Gangte progenitor wandered through the forest with his dog and finally build a village. He had three sons namely Mangte, Mate and Tukgek. Tukgek had a son named Thanglun, who in turn had 10 (ten) sons. These three sons of the progenitor viz Mangte, Mate and Tukgek along with their sons are the clans and sub-clans of present-day Gangte.\n\nAt present days, most of Mangte and Mate people do not speak Gangte as they are mingled with other tribes or communities while most of the descendants of Tukgek speak Gangte, preserve the custom and culture.\n\nThough the term Gangte is much wider used than thought, people mistakenly refer it to descendants of Tukgek such as Thanglun, Teklah, Neihsiel, Thangjom and their sub-clans.\n\n==Socio-political structure==\n\n===Late 19th century and earlier===\n\n====The village====\n\nThe village, as an institution, occupies primacy on par with other forms of institutions among the Gangtes. According to Rev. G.S. Gangte in his book Gangte Chronicle, the village constitute the bedrock of social, economic and administrative complex of the Gangtes. Owing to their nomadic tendency, the Gangtes are rarely famed for establishing a flourishing village. In effect, the location of their jhum sites solely determines the situation of their settlements. It is pertinent to note here that like the rest of the tribes, the Gangtes built their villages on hill-tops in consideration of defence against wild animals and enemies which as per history were not wanting. J. Gin Za Tuang (History of the Zomi Family, 1973) asserted that the tribes of CHIKIM, of which Gangte is a unit, after migrating from [[Tibet]] to [[Central China]], hid in caves for fear of enemies. Thus, the inference, the Tribes originated from Khul or Cave.\n\n====Khawmuol====\nKhawmuol is the prelude to any Gangte village, a gateway that leads to the village. Khawmuol is a special zone that one passes through just before entering any village proper. No doubt it occupies a pivot niche in the village affairs. The villagers erect a wooden post at Khawmuol upon which they hang the heads of enemies taken after tribal wars. Dignitaries from outside or other tribes are welcome and received here. Moreover, important dos like magical incantations to cast off wild spirit are presided at the Khawmuol.\n\n====Shelter (home)====\nThe primitive Gangtes maintained utmost sacredness with a cumbersome meticulousness in choosing location for assembling new houses. They, as a matter of tradition, effectuate a ritual which includes erecting three stone pillars, about knee high each, and facing each other in a triangular orientation. Then, an egg would be snapped in two halves and placed on top of a fire lit between the pillars. If the froth falls towards the to-be owner of the house, the site is deemed fit and auspicious. Otherwise, they search and test a new location for setting up a shelter.\n\nWhen built a typical Gangte house is mostly erected out of wood, hay and bamboo. The front wall usually doubles up as the mantelpiece where owners display heads of animals hunted.\n\n====Chieftainship====\nFor the Gangtes, chieftainship occupies the highest court of administration and arbitration. Chieftainship, an ascribed position, exacts unquestioning obedience and undying loyalty from the subjects. Dr. T.S.Gangte, in his magnum opus The Kukis of Manipur, elaborated the power of the chief. Dr Gangte wrote that disobedience of the Chief merits expulsion from the village, and neither could outsiders immigrate without his assent. The power of the Chief is nigh absolute in the sense that even in the distribution of and access to wealth of the land, nothing goes but the Chief's will. The Chief is not only the ruler over his villagers; he is also their protector in times of adversity like famines and tribal wars. If a villager migrate without proper consent of the chief, his property and belonging are detained by the Chief.\n\nThe Gangte Chief is entitled to certain tributes from his subjects viz, Changseu, Salieng and Khuotha.\n\n#'''Changseu''': This is a tribute paid to the chief out of reverence and loyalty. Practised till now, Changseu is a form of tribal taxation system, customarily paid in paddy produce. It varies from two, three or five tins of rice grain. The Chief can exempt certain class of villagers who are needy and poor from paying Changseu. This exempted lot are anticipated to offer either chicken or tribal brew to the Chief on the day of Changseu collection. Another set of exempted class is constituted by the members of the village council. Changseu is annually collected on a particular date, post-harvest; and the Chief is obliged to treat his subjects to a sumptuous buffet or binge session.\n#'''Salieng''': Literally reworded, Salieng means the shoulder blade of animals. This is gifted to the Chief by anyone who caught wild animals in gratitude to his permission to hunt within his Chiefdom. It is also obligatory and villagers who play truancy are punish, punishment entails slaying of a mithun or paying forty rupees to invite the Chief's exoneration.\n#'''Khuotha''': It refers to the collective labour force of all household in the village that a chief can call for if the need arise. Even the villagers are entitled to invite Khuotha but they must provide lunch for the village labour corps on the day of social work. Further, the Chief can make a trade for Khuotha in lieu of Changseu but is not obliged to furnish meal on the day he asks for the labour force.\n\n====Siehmang Upa====\nSiehmang Upa are selected members of the village council who aids the Chief in the Administration of the village. Elite capacities, Siehmang Upa are men of impeccable integrity and excellence in all walks of life. They are exempted from all kinds of tributes and taxes. The number of Siehmang Upa is relative of the size of the village. The combo of the Chief and Siehmang Upa constitute the village court wherein disagreeing parties sort out their differences or grievances. Anyone resolving to litigate against fellow-villager in the village court must pay the customary fee of a pot of country liquor. If any of the party is found guilty, then the same is compel by ethics to slay, as a penalty, either a mithun or a swine and cough up a swelling pot of tribal brew. The village court also employs the service of the Tangsam or town-crier, which invariably is a hereditary status.\n\n====Tangsam====\nOtherwise known as the village/town-crier, the tangsam is the official spokesmen of the village. Dr. T.S. Gangte elucidated that the Tangsam has a prestigious role and the range of his chores is expansive. He is conferred with the duty to inform all the Siehmang Upa when and where the village council is to meet, and also to apprise the villagers of the outcome of the council's deliberations. For all his contributions, the villagers repay him with a tin of paddy each annually. It is hard to limit or detail the exact status and role of the Tangsam as he, literally, is the errand boy of the village who delivers as demanded.\n\n====Thiempu (priest)====\nA conspicuous facet of the primitive Gangte polity is the role played by the village priest, who is also the doctor of the village. Natively known as Thiempu, his status and role is a standout for the fact that there are certain areas of jurisdiction where his decision is the law. Given a situation, priesthood is the only office that can challenge and curb the tyranny of the Chief. However, for all its might and main, priesthood is considered hereditary, certain factors engendering its ascribed-ness. The nuances of healing and enigma of medicine are well-kept secrets, finely hidden from the knowledge of the public. The passage of tricks of the trade is only between the priest and his sons or grandsons. Moreover, one has to spend considerable amount to learn the secrets of healing and this discourage most of the villagers. Rev. Gangte has suggested that under some situations, the priest is considered as the head of the village. His role is more pronounced than that of the chief vis-a-vis festivity and religion.\n\nAs the keeper of the health of the masses, the sickly are referred to the priest who is expected to identify the cause of the illness. The spirit of the age has it that all ailments are the handiwork of evil-spirit, and the priest is expected to cast it out. Patients are treated by the priest with indigenous herbs and magical invocations. So long as the incantation or spell is not revoke from the patients, they are not allowed to socialise with the rest of the society. The priest does not charge any consultation fee from the villagers. But the villagers pay for his service by doling out a tribute in the form of paddy or other items. The priest also conducts divine sessions with the spirit and prays for productivity of the land. Hunters returning from a successful safari are welcome by the priest at the Khawmuol with drums and chants for which the priest is entitled with a bulk of the meat of the hunted.\n\nOne captivating aspect of priesthood concerns the priest unquestionable power to restrict entry to the village. The priest, when circumstances demanded- that often are tribal wars and plague, would hang a branch of tree (Theubawk) at the Khawmuol to signal that sojourners and strangers are not permitted to enter the village. This ban applies even to the next of kin of the priest if they reside in another village. Anyone who trespass this ban is liable to harshest penalty.\n\n====Thiksek====\nThiksek is the blacksmith of the village. In fact, every village has its blacksmith who take care of knives, spades, saws and other instruments implemented for daily work in the fields. Even warfare contraptions like swords, sabres, guns, arrows and gunpowder are the produce of the blacksmith. As such no village can afford to persist without a blacksmith. In appreciation of his deeds, the villagers return the favour in the form of a tin of paddy per household annually. Should any villager be successful in their hunts, they are bonded by custom to gift a chunk of the catch to the blacksmith as Thiksek-sa.\n\n====Suok (slaves)====\nChroniclers like John Shakepeare were the first to highlight the existence of slavery in the CHIKIM society. In his work The Lushai Kuki Clans (1912), he put forth a detailed view on tribal slavery. On the whole, slavery among the tribals vastly differs from that of the West or New World. Tribal slavery is not under duress, it's almost voluntary. Close observation gives the impression that in most cases, slavery seemed the only option for survival. Among the Gangtes three variants of slavery were practiced:\n*'''Inpi Suok''': This refers to the first type of slaves under the chief who is the only one accredited to own slaves. Inpi Suok are mostly orphans, the incapacitated who cannot look after themselves and the poor in abject misery. The Inpi Suok are conventionally treated as members of the Chief's family but they must work and toil harder than genuine members. The chief, being their guardian, is fully responsible for the welfare and security of the Inpi Suok.\n*'''Chemsan Suok''': Rough translation would be \u2018slaves due to stained sword\u2019. Chemsan Suok, the second kind of slaves in the Chief's house, is murderers, accidental or premeditated, and criminals who commit grave lapses that merit revenge as per the contemporary psyche. For such offenders, slavery is the salvation. Once they give in to the chief, they are saved and it is against the law to harm them. Harming them would tantamount to making a mockery of the Chief's chair and the penalty would also be grave. Chemsan Suok also includes insolvents who cannot repay their debts. Chemsan Souk differs from Inpi Suok. The former do not share habitat with the chief, they are slaves by agreement with the condition that the chief is entitled to the dowry of any Chemsan Suok's daughter.\n\n:L.B. Thanga (the Mizos, 1979) says that till 1928, Chemsan Suok can buy freedom by compensating the Chief, his master, with a mithun or forty rupees in cash.\n*'''Tuklut Suok''': Tuklut Suok are slaves as a consequence of village wars and they usually belong to the losing side in the battle. For safety, the losing party give themselves to the victorious one and hence, the label Tuklut, meaning \u2018give in\u2019. Tuklut Suok can build shelter in the victorious village as and when they can handover a healthy mithun to the Chief and if the Tuklut Suok are of small family, even a mithun can buy their freedom.\n\n==Christianization and the new socio-political structure==\n#The Church:\nWith the advent of Christianity in the late 19th century among the Lushais of Mizoram and its subsequent infiltration to the southern parts of Manipur spreading among the Thadous, Hmars, Vaiphei, Gangtes in the early 20th century, the traditional mode of education was soon replaced by the Church. Presently, ESC (Evangelical Synod Church) under ECCI and GBA (Gangte Baptist Church) are the predominant churches.\n\n*Organizations:\n\n#Gangte Tribes Union (GTU) is the apex body of the Gangte people.\n\nBesides, there are numerous organisations among the Gangtes. Wherever there is a Gangte, a certain form of Organisation is established to interact, provide help, communicate and bond the Gangte people.\n\n2. Gangte  Youths Organisation (GYO) is a philanthropic organisation working for and helping the needy, destitute and distressed and also working for the welfare of the people.\n\n3. Gangte  Students Organisation (GSO) is an apex students body of the Gangte people. The GSO work for the welfare of the students and learners  either academic or any arts or displine or field of study.\n\n4. Gangte Literature Society (GLS) is a body working for the preservation, promotion and upholding the  Gangte language.\n\n5. Gangte Culture and Custom Society is work for the preserving and promoting the culture, tradition and custom of the Gangte.\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#Education:\nThe Gangtes are one of the most educated and brilliant among the Chin-Kuki-Mizo community. 99% of the population are literate, all persons are well educated and mannered and are mostly fully employed.\n\nThe Gangtes are very well developed. Among the history of the world, India, Burma and Bangladesh: the Chin-Kuki-Mizo in particular, they have set a number of records.\n\nOf those records, mention may be of Dr. Tongngul Gangte who among the tribal people of Manipur was the first person to pass HSLC EXAM (Class X) in 1924.\n\n==Present-day==\nAs in ancient Gangte, the Present day Gangtes are very honorable. They predominantly live in and around Churachandpur town (Manipur). They are also well known in History, Politics, Education, Arts and Science.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090722103302/http://ganggam.org/ Ganggam.Org]\n* [http://smsgupshup.com/groups/ganggamnews GanggamNews]\n* [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gnb Ethnologue]\n\n{{Kuki-Chin-Mizo tribes}}\n{{Hill tribes of Northeast India}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Manipur]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Manipur]]\n[[Category:Social groups of Assam]]\n[[Category:Kuki tribes]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Assam]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Meghalaya]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=November 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n| group            = Gangte\n| population       = 40,000 (approx) worldwide\n| total_ref        = <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/ST.html|title=A-11 Individual Scheduled Tribe Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix|publisher=Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India|website=www.censusindia.gov.in|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref>\n| regions          = [[Northeast India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]]\n| languages        = [[Gangte language]]\n| religions        = [[Christianity]]\n| related          = [[Chin people|Chin]] {{\u00b7}} [[Thadou people|Thadou]] {{\u00b7}}[[Hmar people|Hmar]] {{\u00b7}} [[Mizo people|Mizo]] {{\u00b7}} [[Simte people|Simte]] {{\u00b7}} [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]] {{\u00b7}} [[Zou people|Zou]] {{\u00b7}} [[Paite people|Paite]]\n| native_name      = \n| native_name_lang = \n}}\n\n'''Gangte''' is an indigenous and recognised tribe of [[Manipur]], [[India]].

This cave is believed to be in present-day [[China]].\n\nFolktales and folk-songs describes places such as [[Shan State|Shan]], Raken (known as [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in Myanmar) etc. which are located in present-day [[Myanmar]].\n\nWashed up and over by myriads of interpretations and takes, the genesis of the Gangtes is almost like a well-kept secret bedimmed by theories of grandeur or otherwise. As is won't to any tribal history wanting in documentation, the Gangtes have their chronicle etched in folklores and traditional oral transmissions and legends.\n\nThere are two theories regarding the origin of Gangte.\n\nFirstly, the name Gangte derived from a place called \"Ganggam\" and all the inhabitants were called Gang-te, meaning \"from Gang\" or \"people of (from) Ganggam or Gangland\".\n\nSecondly, Gangte is believed to be the name of the ancestor of the Gangte.\n\nAccording to one folktale, Gangte progenitor wandered through the forest with his dog and finally build a village. He had three sons namely Mangte, Mate and Tukgek. Tukgek had a son named Thanglun, who in turn had 10 (ten) sons. These three sons of the progenitor viz Mangte, Mate and Tukgek along with their sons are the clans and sub-clans of present-day Gangte.\n\nAt present days, most of Mangte and Mate people do not speak Gangte as they are mingled with other tribes or communities while most of the descendants of Tukgek speak Gangte, preserve the custom and culture.\n\nThough the term Gangte is much wider used than thought, people mistakenly refer it to descendants of Tukgek such as Thanglun, Teklah, Neihsiel, Thangjom and their sub-clans.\n\n==Socio-political structure==\n\n===Late 19th century and earlier===\n\n====The village====\n\nThe village, as an institution, occupies primacy on par with other forms of institutions among the Gangtes. According to Rev. G.S. Gangte in his book Gangte Chronicle, the village constitute the bedrock of social, economic and administrative complex of the Gangtes. Owing to their nomadic tendency, the Gangtes are rarely famed for establishing a flourishing village. In effect, the location of their jhum sites solely determines the situation of their settlements. It is pertinent to note here that like the rest of the tribes, the Gangtes built their villages on hill-tops in consideration of defence against wild animals and enemies which as per history were not wanting. J. Gin Za Tuang (History of the Zomi Family, 1973) asserted that the tribes of CHIKIM, of which Gangte is a unit, after migrating from Tibet to Central China, hid in caves for fear of enemies. Thus, the inference, the Tribes originated from Khul or Cave.\n\n====Khawmuol====\nKhawmuol is the prelude to any Gangte village, a gateway that leads to the village. Khawmuol is a special zone that one passes through just before entering any village proper. No doubt it occupies a pivot niche in the village affairs. The villagers erect a wooden post at Khawmuol upon which they hang the heads of enemies taken after tribal wars. Dignitaries from outside or other tribes are welcome and received here. Moreover, important dos like magical incantations to cast off wild spirit are presided at the Khawmuol.\n\n====Shelter (home)====\nThe primitive Gangtes maintained utmost sacredness with a cumbersome meticulousness in choosing location for assembling new houses. They, as a matter of tradition, effectuate a ritual which includes erecting three stone pillars, about knee high each, and facing each other in a triangular orientation. Then, an egg would be snapped in two halves and placed on top of a fire lit between the pillars. If the froth falls towards the to-be owner of the house, the site is deemed fit and auspicious. Otherwise, they search and test a new location for setting up a shelter.\n\nWhen built a typical Gangte house is mostly erected out of wood, hay and bamboo. The front wall usually doubles up as the mantelpiece where owners display heads of animals hunted.\n\n====Chieftainship====\nFor the Gangtes, chieftainship occupies the highest court of administration and arbitration. Chieftainship, an ascribed position, exacts unquestioning obedience and undying loyalty from the subjects. Dr. T.S.Gangte, in his magnum opus The Kukis of Manipur, elaborated the power of the chief. Dr Gangte wrote that disobedience of the Chief merits expulsion from the village, and neither could outsiders immigrate without his assent. The power of the Chief is nigh absolute in the sense that even in the distribution of and access to wealth of the land, nothing goes but the Chief's will. The Chief is not only the ruler over his villagers; he is also their protector in times of adversity like famines and tribal wars. If a villager migrate without proper consent of the chief, his property and belonging are detained by the Chief.\n\nThe Gangte Chief is entitled to certain tributes from his subjects viz, Changseu, Salieng and Khuotha.\n\n#'''Changseu''': This is a tribute paid to the chief out of reverence and loyalty. Practised till now, Changseu is a form of tribal taxation system, customarily paid in paddy produce. It varies from two, three or five tins of rice grain. The Chief can exempt certain class of villagers who are needy and poor from paying Changseu. This exempted lot are anticipated to offer either chicken or tribal brew to the Chief on the day of Changseu collection. Another set of exempted class is constituted by the members of the village council. Changseu is annually collected on a particular date, post-harvest; and the Chief is obliged to treat his subjects to a sumptuous buffet or binge session.\n#'''Salieng''': Literally reworded, Salieng means the shoulder blade of animals. This is gifted to the Chief by anyone who caught wild animals in gratitude to his permission to hunt within his Chiefdom. It is also obligatory and villagers who play truancy are punish, punishment entails slaying of a mithun or paying forty rupees to invite the Chief's exoneration.\n#'''Khuotha''': It refers to the collective labour force of all household in the village that a chief can call for if the need arise. Even the villagers are entitled to invite Khuotha but they must provide lunch for the village labour corps on the day of social work. Further, the Chief can make a trade for Khuotha in lieu of Changseu but is not obliged to furnish meal on the day he asks for the labour force.\n\n====Siehmang Upa====\nSiehmang Upa are selected members of the village council who aids the Chief in the Administration of the village. Elite capacities, Siehmang Upa are men of impeccable integrity and excellence in all walks of life. They are exempted from all kinds of tributes and taxes. The number of Siehmang Upa is relative of the size of the village. The combo of the Chief and Siehmang Upa constitute the village court wherein disagreeing parties sort out their differences or grievances. Anyone resolving to litigate against fellow-villager in the village court must pay the customary fee of a pot of country liquor. If any of the party is found guilty, then the same is compel by ethics to slay, as a penalty, either a mithun or a swine and cough up a swelling pot of tribal brew. The village court also employs the service of the Tangsam or town-crier, which invariably is a hereditary status.\n\n====Tangsam====\nOtherwise known as the village/town-crier, the tangsam is the official spokesmen of the village. Dr. T.S. Gangte elucidated that the Tangsam has a prestigious role and the range of his chores is expansive. He is conferred with the duty to inform all the Siehmang Upa when and where the village council is to meet, and also to apprise the villagers of the outcome of the council's deliberations. For all his contributions, the villagers repay him with a tin of paddy each annually. It is hard to limit or detail the exact status and role of the Tangsam as he, literally, is the errand boy of the village who delivers as demanded.\n\n====Thiempu (priest)====\nA conspicuous facet of the primitive Gangte polity is the role played by the village priest, who is also the doctor of the village. Natively known as Thiempu, his status and role is a standout for the fact that there are certain areas of jurisdiction where his decision is the law. Given a situation, priesthood is the only office that can challenge and curb the tyranny of the Chief. However, for all its might and main, priesthood is considered hereditary, certain factors engendering its ascribed-ness. The nuances of healing and enigma of medicine are well-kept secrets, finely hidden from the knowledge of the public. The passage of tricks of the trade is only between the priest and his sons or grandsons. Moreover, one has to spend considerable amount to learn the secrets of healing and this discourage most of the villagers. Rev. Gangte has suggested that under some situations, the priest is considered as the head of the village. His role is more pronounced than that of the chief vis-a-vis festivity and religion.\n\nAs the keeper of the health of the masses, the sickly are referred to the priest who is expected to identify the cause of the illness. The spirit of the age has it that all ailments are the handiwork of evil-spirit, and the priest is expected to cast it out. Patients are treated by the priest with indigenous herbs and magical invocations. So long as the incantation or spell is not revoke from the patients, they are not allowed to socialise with the rest of the society. The priest does not charge any consultation fee from the villagers. But the villagers pay for his service by doling out a tribute in the form of paddy or other items. The priest also conducts divine sessions with the spirit and prays for productivity of the land. Hunters returning from a successful safari are welcome by the priest at the Khawmuol with drums and chants for which the priest is entitled with a bulk of the meat of the hunted.\n\nOne captivating aspect of priesthood concerns the priest unquestionable power to restrict entry to the village. The priest, when circumstances demanded- that often are tribal wars and plague, would hang a branch of tree (Theubawk) at the Khawmuol to signal that sojourners and strangers are not permitted to enter the village. This ban applies even to the next of kin of the priest if they reside in another village. Anyone who trespass this ban is liable to harshest penalty.\n\n====Thiksek====\nThiksek is the blacksmith of the village. In fact, every village has its blacksmith who take care of knives, spades, saws and other instruments implemented for daily work in the fields. Even warfare contraptions like swords, sabres, guns, arrows and gunpowder are the produce of the blacksmith. As such no village can afford to persist without a blacksmith. In appreciation of his deeds, the villagers return the favour in the form of a tin of paddy per household annually. Should any villager be successful in their hunts, they are bonded by custom to gift a chunk of the catch to the blacksmith as Thiksek-sa.\n\n====Suok (slaves)====\nChroniclers like John Shakepeare were the first to highlight the existence of slavery in the CHIKIM society. In his work The Lushai Kuki Clans (1912), he put forth a detailed view on tribal slavery. On the whole, slavery among the tribals vastly differs from that of the West or New World.

Among the Gangtes three variants of slavery were practiced:\n*'''Inpi Suok''': This refers to the first type of slaves under the chief who is the only one accredited to own slaves.

The Inpi Suok are conventionally treated as members of the Chief's family but they must work and toil harder than genuine members. The chief, being their guardian, is fully responsible for the welfare and security of the Inpi Suok.\n*'''Chemsan Suok''': Rough translation would be \u2018slaves due to stained sword\u2019. Chemsan Suok, the second kind of slaves in the Chief's house, is murderers, accidental or premeditated, and criminals who commit grave lapses that merit revenge as per the contemporary psyche. For such offenders, slavery is the salvation. Once they give in to the chief, they are saved and it is against the law to harm them. Harming them would tantamount to making a mockery of the Chief's chair and the penalty would also be grave. Chemsan Suok also includes insolvents who cannot repay their debts. Chemsan Souk differs from Inpi Suok. The former do not share habitat with the chief, they are slaves by agreement with the condition that the chief is entitled to the dowry of any Chemsan Suok's daughter.\n\n:L.B.
