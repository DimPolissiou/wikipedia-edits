Post-1994 federal law also mandates most packaged consumer goods be labeled in both customary and metric units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1993/08/ftc-proposes-require-labels-include-metric-measurement|title=FTC Proposes to Require Labels to Include Metric Measurement|date=December 19, 2013|work=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===18th century===\n\nImmediately after independence, the United States used a variety of units of measure, including [[Dutch units of measurement|Dutch units]] and [[English units]].<ref name=\"pirates\">[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/28/574044232/how-pirates-of-the-caribbean-hijacked-americas-metric-system How Pirates Of The Caribbean Hijacked America's Metric System]</ref> The [[Constitution of the United States|1789 Constitution]] [[enumerated powers|grants]] Congress the authority to determine standards of measure, though it did not immediately use this authority to impose a uniform system. The United States was one of the first nations to adopt a [[Decimalisation|decimal currency]], under the [[Coinage Act of 1792]].\n\nIn 1793, [[Thomas Jefferson]] requested artifacts from France that could be used to adopt the metric system in the United States, and [[Joseph Dombey]] was sent from France with a standard kilogram. Before reaching the United States, Dombey's ship was blown off course by a storm and captured by pirates, and he died in captivity on [[Montserrat]].<ref name=\"pirates\" />\n\n===19th century===\n\nIn 1832, the customary system of units was formalized.<ref>{{cite book\n| first1      = Lewis V\n| last1       = Judson\n| title       = Weights and Measures Standards of the United States \u2013 a brief history \u2013 NBS publication 447\n| url         = https://books.google.com/?id=GXWfglKg11MC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=1838+gallon+231+congress#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| page        = 6\n| publisher   = [[United States Department of Commerce]]\n| date        = October 1963\n| accessdate  = November 10, 2012\n}}</ref> \nIn the early 19th century, the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]], the government's surveying and map-making agency, used a meter standard (\"Committee Meter\", French: ''M\u00e8tre des Archives'') brought from [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-r-hassler.ch/en/legacy/index.html|title=e-expo: Ferdinand Rudolf Hassler : Hassler's legacy A lasting live's work for surveying the world|last=|first=|date=|website=www.f-r-hassler.ch|access-date=November 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/nvl/HasslerSP1068.pdf|title=NIST Special Publication 1068 Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler (1770\u20131843) A Twenty Year Retrospective, 1987\u20132007|last=|first=|date=|website=NIST|pages=31\u201332|access-date=}}</ref> Shortly after the [[American Civil War]], the [[39th United States Congress]] protected the use of the metric system in commerce with the [[Metric Act of 1866]]<ref>{{cite web\n| author      = 39th United States Congress\n| url         = http://www.us-metric.org/metric-act-of-1866\n| title       = H.R. 596, An Act to authorize the use of the metric system of weights and measures\n| publisher   = [[U.S. Metric Association]]\n| date        = May 13, 1866\n| author-link = 39th United States Congress\n}}</ref> and supplied each state with a set of standard metric weights and measures.\nIn 1875 the United States solidified its commitment to the development of the internationally recognized metric system by becoming one of the original seventeen signatory nations to the [[Metre Convention]], also known as the Treaty of the Metre. The signing of this international agreement concluded five years of meetings in which the metric system was reformulated, refining the accuracy of its standards. The Metre Convention established the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (Bureau international des poids et mesures, BIPM) in [[S\u00e8vres]], France, to provide standards of measurement for worldwide use.\n\nUnder the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893, metric standards, developed through international cooperation under the auspices of BIPM, were officially adopted as the fundamental standards for length and mass in the United States, though some metric standards were used in practice before then.

The ANMC became a separately incorporated organization in 1976. The ANMC was intended to facilitate U.S. metrication by maintaining a voluntary and orderly process that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits, and to provide information, forums, individual assistance, and other services for its subscribers. The ANMC attempted to coordinate the metric planning of many industrial sectors, unlike the USMB, which only attempted to implement the policy set forth in the [[Metric Conversion Act]] of 1975. After the formation of the USMB, committees of the ANMC submitted conversion plans for the chemical sector and for the instruments sector. These sector conversion plans were later approved by the USMB. From 1975 through 1987, the ANMC held a series of well-attended annual conferences. Subsequently, a series of National Metric Conferences, jointly sponsored by the ANMC, the [[U.S. Metric Association]] (USMA), the Department of Commerce, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), were held from 1989 through 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.us-metric.org/american-national-metric-council|publisher=U.S. Metric Association, Inc|accessdate = September 3, 2015| title = American National Metric Council }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SpeedLimit-CoralRidge-MiKm-May1992 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1980s-vintage dual miles per hour and kilometers per hour sign, (formerly) located in Florida.

[[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s are 120&nbsp;mm in diameter, but their size is rarely mentioned; [[mini CD]]s are sometimes called 80mm CDs.\n\nComputer fan sizes are exclusively referred to by metric units (120&nbsp;mm or 80&nbsp;mm case fans, for example), while [[hard disk drive]] and CD drive bay widths are customary measurements, typically 3{{1/2}} inches and 5{{1/4}} inches, respectively.\n\nConsumer-size [[photographic film]] was commonly sold in a [[35mm format|35 mm standard]] (24\u00d736&nbsp;mm negative), although print sizes and [[Large format (photography)|large format]] films are defined in inches. [[Optical format|Digital camera sensor sizes]] are measured in an archaic manner indicating inverse fractions of an inch representing the diameter of an equivalent [[vidicon]] tube. For example, a {{frac|1|1.6&nbsp;in}} sensor is larger than a {{frac|1|2.5&nbsp;in}} sensor. However, lenses are marked in terms of focal length in millimeters (e.g., average natural human field of view is a lens with 50&nbsp;mm focal length for 35&nbsp;mm film).\n\n==== Clothing ====\nClothing is measured in inches, not [[centimeters]]. American [[Shoe size|shoes sizes]] are measured on different scales for children, men, and women but all sizes are derived from inches.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Your-Shoe-Size|title=How to Find Your Shoe Size|work=wikiHow|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Major multi-national apparel brands including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]], [[Hanesbrands|Hanes]], and [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] often sell the same inventory worldwide, with tags containing both SI and customary units in addition to [[Laundry symbol|laundry care symbols]] and instructions in many languages.\n\n==== Bedding ====\n[[Bed size|Mattress sizes]] use non-numeric labels, such as king, queen, full, or twin. These sizes are defined in inches, unlike most other countries, which use similar labels defined using metric units.

[[Dimensional lumber]] comes in standard nominal inch cross-section sizes and lengths are given in feet. Although [[model building code]]s\u2014such as the [[International Building Code]]\u2014provide information in both customary and metric units, locally developed building code amendments and [[zoning]] codes often provide customary units exclusively. Because of [[Canada]]'s proximity to the U.S., issues of common units still arise. This tendency in construction is similar to [[Japan]], an otherwise metricated country where traditional construction still uses [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]] predating metrication. However, blueprints commonly signify measurements using decimals (e.g., 9.2&nbsp;ft.); since feet are not divided into tenths on United States measuring tapes, builders commonly are forced to make conversions on-site that are often imprecise. In the previous example, 9.2&nbsp;ft equals 9&nbsp;ft 2.4 inches; slightly more than the 9&nbsp;ft {{frac|2|3|8}} mark on United States tape measures, though this degree of error is usually insignificant for these applications.\n\n===Aviation===\nAircraft altitudes for air traffic control and related purposes are measured in feet in the U.S. In fact, most of the world has used feet for aviation altitudes since the end of World War II (meters before 1945 in all European countries except the UK), with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, and many [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] (former Soviet) countries. For instance, an airliner on a long flight, even if neither its starting point nor destination are in the United States, might use a nominal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, using an internationally standardized system of [[flight level]]s (Flight Level 360 in this case). In 2011, Russia switched from metric to foot-denominated flight levels at high altitude to eliminate the need for adjustments when crossing in to or out of its airspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=119021# |title=\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0424 \u043e\u0442 05.09.2011 N 743 \"\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438\" \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441 |publisher=Base.consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=December 22, 2017 |trans-title=Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 743 of September 5, 2011 \"On Amendments to the Federal Rules for the Use of the Airspace of the Russian Federation\" \u2013 ConsultantPlus}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial aviation===\nFrequent-flyer programs from commercial airlines in the United States are commonly managed using miles. This is likely to continue; in fact, some international airlines that used kilometers are switching to miles or using both, to simplify the redemption of miles with United States airline partners (Aeromexico switched from kilometers to miles, and Varig from Brazil has used miles since the program was named \"Smiles\"). Aircraft speed is often measured in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s and elevation in feet ([[flight level]]) in many countries.\n\nFor both domestic and international routes, U.S. airlines set luggage size and weight restrictions in terms of customary units. Conversely, international airlines that fly to the U.S. often restrict baggage to metric sizes.\n\nThe temperatures in aviation-related weather reports are given in degrees Celsius in the United States.\n\nFor carry-on luggage, the [[Transportation Security Administration]] restricts liquids to 3.4 fluid ounces (100 mL).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule|title=Liquids Rule|date=December 16, 2014|work=Transportation Security Administration|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Originally, the agency planned to restrict to 3 ounces but switched it to 3.4 oz / 100 mL after pressure from the European Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2009/02/25/3-oz-or-34-oz-what-gives|title=3 oz or 3.4 oz?

Units of length, volume, and mass are typically introduced through comparison with ordinary objects. The metric system is not reinforced much outside the classroom due to lack of popular metric use. Consequently, while students may understand some of the concepts underlying the metric system, they do not necessarily have an intuitive sense of the value of the units.\n\nIn science education, students predominantly use metric measures in experiments and equations, allowing those interested in the sciences to become more familiar with the metric system. A few science [[Course credit|course credit]]s are requisites for an undergraduate degree in the U.S. which ensures most educated people have some exposure to the metric system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Within [[higher education]], the metric system is universal for classes in the sciences (see [[Metrication in the United States#Science and medicine|below]]), except for exercises designed to illustrate complex conversions. Engineering programs still widely use English Engineering Units, but this varies depending on the field. Electrical Engineering programs mostly use metric, while fields such as aerospace, materials, thermal, and manufacturing engineering use customary units extensively. Some non-science textbooks in the U.S. use only the metric system without giving conversions in order to promote metrication.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Electricity and energy===\nThere are no U.S. customary units for electric current, potential difference, or charge since these concepts were developed after the international adoption of metric in science. The metric units [[ampere]], [[volt]], [[ohm]] and [[coulomb]] are the only units used. The SI term [[hertz]] has replaced the term ''cycles per second'' for the same unit of frequency.\n\nEnergy is often measured in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (SI-based), [[calorie]]s (SI-based), [[British thermal unit|BTUs]] (customary) or [[therm]]s (customary) rather than the SI [[joule]]. Residential and commercial electrical energy use is metered and billed in kilowatt hours, [[Kilowatt hour|kW\u00b7h]], as in most metric countries. Force measurements regularly use the [[pound-force|pound]] instead of the SI [[newton (force)|newton]]; [[torque]] is measured in [[pound-foot|pound-feet]]. Fuel prices are mostly given in customary units, such as dollars per gallon, barrel, thousand cubic feet, or ton (short or long). Heating, cooling, and combustion are often measured in BTUs per hour or [[Ton of refrigeration|refrigeration tons]] and powerplant efficiency is often measured by its \"heat rate\", in BTU per kW\u00b7hour. The rated power of [[internal combustion engine|engines]], [[electric motor]]s, and [[Power station|power plant]] [[steam turbine]]s is frequently measured in [[horsepower]]. Power plant output is generally expressed in [[megawatt]]s.\n\n===Financial services===\nSome [[commodity market]] prices are quoted in customary units (such as [[Oil barrel|barrels]] of oil, [[troy ounce]]s of gold, pounds of frozen [[Pork belly|pork bellies]], etc.). The federal government reports international production figures in metric units (for instance, wheat in metric tons) but in [[bushel]]s for domestic production figures.\n\n===Firearms===\nThe U.S. uses both the inch and millimeter for [[caliber]] on civilian and law enforcement firearms.<ref name=\"m14\">{{cite web|title=M14 |work=Nazarian's Gun Recognition Guide |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013417/http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref>\nHistorically, ammunition rounds designed in the United States were denoted by their caliber in inches (e.g., [[.45 Colt]] and [[.270 Winchester]].) Two developments changed this tradition: the large preponderance of different cartridges using an identical caliber and the international arms trade bringing metric calibers to the United States. The former led to bullet diameter (rather than caliber) often being used to describe rounds to differentiate otherwise similar rounds. A good example is the [[.308 Winchester]], which fires the same .30-caliber projectile as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the [[.300 Savage]]. Occasionally, the caliber is just a number close to the diameter of the bullet, like the [[.220 Swift]], [[.223 Remington]] and [[.222 Remington Magnum]], all of which actually have .22 caliber or {{convert|.224|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} bullets.\n\nThe second development is actual metric calibers being introduced to the United States. 6&nbsp;mm and 7&nbsp;mm caliber rifles are particularly popular as are 9&nbsp;mm and 10&nbsp;mm caliber handguns. These metric caliber rounds are either described by their metric caliber, such as the very popular [[7mm Remington Magnum]] round or have their bullet diameter converted into inches, such as the also extremely popular [[.243 Winchester]]. Occasionally, U.S.-designed inch-caliber rounds are stated in metric as well.\n\nThe U.S. military, reflecting its need to ensure interoperability with its [[NATO]] allies, uses metric measurements for almost all weapons calibers, even for calibers that originated as or were derived from a different measurement (e.g. [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62&nbsp;mm]] rather than [[.308 Winchester|.308]], or [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56&nbsp;mm]] instead of [[.223 Remington|.223]]). However, civilian rifles chambered for .223 Remington may load military 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition but not fire it safely because 5.56&nbsp;mm NATO ammunition is loaded to create greater chamber pressure than .223 Remington. Controversy exists whether this is true for civilian rifles chambered for .308 Winchester firing 7.62\u00d751&nbsp;mm NATO military ammunition. Major [[handloading]] manuals in the U.S. use U.S. customary units for all pertinent measurements including bullet diameter, cartridge overall length, powder charge weight, velocity, and maximum pressure, even with European-designed fully metric rounds.\n\n===Gemstones===\nGemstones and pearls are sold in [[Carat (mass)|metric carats]].\n\n===Manufacturing===\nGlobalization of manufacturing has led to wide adoption of metric standards, although this is not yet universal{{where|date=June 2015}}. After a period where [[Car|automobiles]] were assembled with both customary and metric [[fastener]]s in each vehicle, cars are now universally built with metric parts. Automobile engines were once named after their displacement in cubic inches. For example, the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Chrysler \"426 Hemi\"]] engine would be described as 7 liters in modern terminology. Technical publications by industry publishers and American automakers often give engine displacements in cubic inches as well as cubic centimeters (which are equivalent to milliliters), or liters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0506_maserati_mc12/specs_price.html |title=Maserati MC12 \u2013 Engine, Chassis, Dimensions, Price, Warranty & Performance \u2013 Road Test Review |publisher=Motor Trend |date=December 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitdiesel.com/pdf/Engines/2006_S60_specs.pdf|title=Demand Detroit \u2013 Demand Detroit|website=www.detroitdiesel.com}}</ref> For example, the specifications for the Dodge SRT-8&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;L Hemi state the displacement as {{convert|370|cuin|cm3}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |title=The Official Chrysler HEMI engine Web site |publisher=HEMI |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807045824/http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nThe U.S. military uses metric measurements extensively to ensure interoperability with allied forces, particularly [[NATO]] [[Standardization Agreement]]s (STANAG).

The [[METAR]] reporting system in use in the United States differs from the one used by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in that [[wind]] speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and [[flight level|altimeter setting]] in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Furthermore, [[temperature]]s are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most synoptic observation charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted for the purposes of calculation. Upper-air temperature charts typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while [[potential temperature]] charts use the [[kelvin]]; both of these are in line with international usage.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Atmospheric [[vorticity]] is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough [[metric time|metrication of the day]]) but does not use the SI-recommended [[radian]].\n\n[[National Weather Service]] and TV/radio [[broadcasting|broadcast]] public forecasts are given almost exclusively in customary units: [[degrees Fahrenheit]] for temperature and [[dewpoint]], fractions of an inch of rain or ice and whole inches of [[snow]] (less than an inch often indicated by fractions or informal terms like \"dusting\" when very low), inches of mercury; and for wind speeds, miles per hour, except in marine forecasts, in which knots are used. [[wave height|Wave height]]s are measured in feet. Actual [[ice pellets|sleet]] and snowfall and their depths on the ground are measured in tenths of an inch, with actual rainfall in hundredths, and ice accretion in either fractions or decimals. [[Hail]]stone sizes are typically reported without a fixed unit of measure; they are instead compared to familiar round or spherical items (e.g. [[dime (United States coin)|dime]]-sized or [[golf ball]]-sized). [[Barometer]] readings for [[hurricane]]s are usually given in [[millibar]]s (mb), which are equal to hectopascals (hPa), or ten times the kilopascals (kPa) used in neighboring Canada; the use of inches of mercury in such applications is rapidly declining.\n\nIn early 2007, NASA announced that it would use metric units for all operations on the lunar surface upon its return to the Moon, then projected for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/08jan_metricmoon/ |title=NASA&nbsp;\u2013 Metric Moon |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref> NASA's lunar return program was then canceled in 2010.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/27/nation/la-na-nasa-budget27-2010jan27 White House won't fund NASA moon program], LA Times, January 27, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe medical field uses predominantly metric units.

However, many people colloquially refer to the small spoon in a utensil set as the teaspoon and the big spoon as the tablespoon. After a major analysis in 2015, it was found that the inclusion of tea/tablespoon dosages likely encourages some people to use non-calibrated kitchen utensils as measuring devices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jenco|first=Melissa|date=April 1, 2015|title=Ditch the spoon AAP: Metric dosing of medications a safer choice|url=http://www.aappublications.org/content/36/4/11.2|journal=AP News|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |volume=36|issue=4|page=11|issn=1073-0397}}</ref> Due to this and reported confusion with the abbreviations TSP and TBSP, the FDA now recommends doctors and pharmaceutical manufacturers use milliliter only dosing instructions.

Exercise is commonly discussed with patients in terms of miles walked. Intake of sugar, sodium, and other nutrients is usually discussed in terms of grams and milligrams.\n\nUse among [[veterinarian]]s varies, but because of the heavy emphasis on public interaction, animal weights (e.g., for [[Domestic cat|cats]] or [[dog]]s) are nearly always recorded and reported in pounds and ounces.

The final holdout was the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS) administering high school sports, which switched to metric in 1980.\n\nThat said, U.S. track-and-field competitions are commonly run in increments of 400 meters, which roughly correspond to traditional mile-based lengths. In the Olympics, athletes run 1500 meters, not 1600 meters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nRunning races in the U.S. are usually run in metric distances (e.g., the [[100 metres]] dash or the [[5K run]]), although the mile distance remains popular. But even 5 and 10 kilometer races most often have mile markers on the course, and no kilometer markers. Long-distance races are often measured in kilometers, although exceptions exist (generally 10&nbsp;mile races). The [[marathon]] is referred to as a 26.219-mile race (the official marathon standard distance originally being in English units&nbsp;\u2014 26 miles, 385 yards) rather than 42.195&nbsp;km. [[Ultramarathon]]s are measured in either miles or kilometers, with little standardization either way.\n\nAlthough the Olympics and U.S. track events have been metric for years, it is still common for sports commentators to provide conversions to help the American audience understand the measurements.\n\nMeasured distances as used in events such as [[shot put]], [[high jump]], and [[discus throw]] are, however, often in feet and inches, except at the national and international levels. In 2017, the Florida High School Athletic Association became the first to buck this trend and use metric measures for field events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/high-school/fla-hs-track-and-field-goes-metric.html|title=Florida High School Track and Field Goes Metric \u2013 Athletic Business|last=Cameron|first=Courtney|website=www.athleticbusiness.com|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The field and court sizes for most popular team sports such as [[Association football|soccer]] were originally set in non-metric units. This is reflected in [[American football]], in which the playing field is divided into yards, and many important statistics are measured in yards. Similarly, the dimensions for all [[baseball]] parks, [[basketball]] courts, [[tennis]] courts and [[ice hockey]] rinks are given in feet, [[golf]] courses in yards, [[auto racing]] tracks in miles (or fractions thereof), and [[horse racing]] in [[furlong]]s. The lengths of automobile races in the U.S. are generally set in miles.

These are located near both airports ([[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Bush Intercontinental]] and [[William P. Hobby Airport|Hobby]]) and in the [[Texas Medical Center]]. The U.S. territory of [[Puerto Rico]] generally uses American-style ([[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]]) signs with metric measurement on highways, displaying kilometer posts and distances in km, yet speed limit signs are in miles per hour. The [[Maine Turnpike]] has metric measurements on its highway signs in addition to customary measurements, partly to assist the large numbers of [[Canada|Canadian]] tourists who visit Maine's beaches.\n\nThe first signs in metric in the United States were posted on February 12, 1973, on [[Interstate 71]] in [[Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Goodman|title=Ohio Moments|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/02/12/loc_ohiodate0212.html|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=February 12, 2003|access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nGasoline and diesel fuel are sold by the U.S. gallon, and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is rated in miles per gallon (MPG).

On recently introduced [[Christmas lights]], however, millimeters are often used with small [[Sphere|globe]]-shaped bulbs (G30 and G40), and with miniature [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] sets, where the standard T1\u00be ({{frac|7|32}}-inch tube) ones are sometimes called M5 (5&nbsp;mm miniature; not to be confused with [[ISO metric screw thread|M5 thread]]).\n\nFor properties understood more recently, such as those related to electricity, there is no traditional unit; international units are always used, often in combination with U.S. customary units. One among many examples is in Table 8, chapter 9, of the ''National Electrical Code Handbook (8th ed.)'', where resistance of conductors per unit length is given in ohms per thousand feet.\n\nOther units are based on customary units, but use [[Power of 10|power-of-ten]] factors and [[metric prefix]]es.

Many authors have assumed that the United States and the human race in general will use metric units; however, others have assumed the continued use of U.S. customary units or have neglected to take metrication into account. Writers sometimes use customary units simply because American readers and watchers will understand the measurements; other times, they are simply used by accident. The 1966 show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', for instance, initially used U.S. customary units despite multiple Earth national origins and a setting in the 23rd century. Later, starting with \"[[The Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Changeling]]\", metric measures were used, albeit inconsistently. Later sequels of the show, such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (set in the 22nd century), used the metric system exclusively.\n\nBoth the metric system and attitudes in the U.S. toward the metric system are a target of humorous jabs in shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',<ref>In ''The Simpsons'', jokes about the situation are made in episodes \"[[A Star Is Burns]],\" \"[[Homer the Great]],\" \"[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]],\" and others. For instance, Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson once remarked: \"The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets forty [[Rod (unit)|rod]]s to the [[hogshead]] and that's the way I likes it.\"</ref> ''[[Futurama]]''<ref>An example is in \"[[The Series Has Landed]],\" when a farmer on the Moon states that at night, the temperature drops down to \u2212173. Fry asks, \"Is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?\" to which the farmer replies, \"First one, then the other.\" Another is in \"[[I, Roommate]],\" when Calculon attempts to put a ring on Monique's finger; when it fits, she replies, \"It fits! But then, you must know that I'm&nbsp;...\" \"Metric?

The ANMC became a separately incorporated organization in 1976. The ANMC was intended to facilitate U.S. metrication by maintaining a voluntary and orderly process that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits, and to provide information, forums, individual assistance, and other services for its subscribers. The ANMC attempted to coordinate the metric planning of many industrial sectors, unlike the USMB, which only attempted to implement the policy set forth in the [[Metric Conversion Act]] of 1975. After the formation of the USMB, committees of the ANMC submitted conversion plans for the chemical sector and for the instruments sector. These sector conversion plans were later approved by the USMB. From 1975 through 1987, the ANMC held a series of well-attended annual conferences. Subsequently, a series of National Metric Conferences, jointly sponsored by the ANMC, the [[U.S. Metric Association]] (USMA), the Department of Commerce, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), were held from 1989 through 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.us-metric.org/american-national-metric-council|publisher=U.S. Metric Association, Inc|accessdate = September 3, 2015| title = American National Metric Council }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SpeedLimit-CoralRidge-MiKm-May1992 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1980s-vintage dual miles per hour and kilometers per hour sign, (formerly) located in Florida.

While not mandating metric use in the private sector, the federal government has sought to serve as a catalyst in the metric conversion of the country's trade, industry, and commerce.

In some northern [[Canada\u2013United States border|border states]], temperatures are described in both Fahrenheit and Celsius for the benefit of the cross-border Canadian audiences.\n\n[[NOAA Weather Radio]] broadcasts from the [[National Weather Service]] in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] of Minnesota provide the local temperature reports in Fahrenheit and in Celsius, as does [[WXL57]] weather radio in [[Des Moines, Iowa]].\n\n===Consumer and retail===\n[[File:Shampoo Net Quantity.jpg|thumb|211x211px|A shampoo bottle labeled with mL first and fl oz second. Note the [[Estimated sign|\u212e]] estimated net quantity symbol indicates the product also conforms to European Union regulations.]]\nSome U.S. consumer products come in rounded metric sizes. This appears to be increasing because of the international nature of manufacturing, distribution, and sales. Many items are produced in rounded metric quantities and some manufacturers opt to display the metric quantity first or more prominently (e.g., [[Crest Glide]] [[dental floss]] is available in 35-, 40-, and 50-meter packages).\n\nPerhaps the most common metric item sold is the [[two-liter bottle]]. Some [[supermarket]] chains also make their [[store brand]] soft drinks available in 3-liter sizes. Soft drink containers of 1 and 0.5 liters (and more recently 1.25 liter bottles) are sometimes sold alongside 12 [[fluid ounce|fl&nbsp;oz]], 16 fl&nbsp;oz, 20 fl&nbsp;oz, and 24 fl&nbsp;oz (355, 473, 591 and 710&nbsp;mL) sizes.\n\nThe half-liter water bottle (16.9 fl oz) has nearly replaced the 16 ounce size. 700&nbsp;mL (23.6 fl oz) and one-liter sizes are also common, though 20 fl&nbsp;oz, and 24 fl&nbsp;oz sizes remain popular, particularly in vending machines.\n\nAttempts to sell 3- or 4-liter jugs of [[milk]], instead of [[gallon]]s (3.785 L), have been largely unsuccessful, and such bottles are rarely seen in the United States. Milk remains sold in binary divisions of the gallon, with half-pints, [[pint]]s, [[quart]]s and half-gallons being the primary sizes.\n\n[[Shampoo]], [[mouthwash]], and [[dental floss]] have begun to be sold in metric sizes. [[PowerBar]]s and similar products have always been sold (but not marketed) by the gram.\n\n[[Nutrition facts label|Nutritional food labels]] typically report serving sizes in both systems but only list metric values (g or mg) for the breakdown of individual nutrients.\n\n==== Alcohol ====\nWine is sold in standard bottles of 750&nbsp;mL, as in the rest of the world. A fifth of liquor, once one-fifth of a U.S. gallon, or 757&nbsp;mL, is now commonly 750&nbsp;mL, though it is still referred to as \"a fifth\". Beer is sold in fluid ounce denominations. Regulations are set by the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] which controls the permissible sizes of containers. Unlike non-alcoholic beverages, most alcohol products are not required to carry unit conversions on labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ttb.gov/pdf/brochures/p51902.pdf|title=Distilled Spirits Labeling Regulations-- 27 CFR 5.38/5.47a|last=Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221014416/https://www.ttb.gov/pdf/brochures/p51902.pdf|archive-date=February 21, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Tomatos Price Per Pound.jpg|thumb|163x163px|Tomatoes being sold by the pound.]]\n\n==== Non-packaged foods ====\nLoose fruits and vegetables are near universally priced per pound or per item.

[[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s are 120&nbsp;mm in diameter, but their size is rarely mentioned; [[mini CD]]s are sometimes called 80mm CDs.\n\nComputer fan sizes are exclusively referred to by metric units (120&nbsp;mm or 80&nbsp;mm case fans, for example), while [[hard disk drive]] and CD drive bay widths are customary measurements, typically 3{{1/2}} inches and 5{{1/4}} inches, respectively.\n\nConsumer-size [[photographic film]] was commonly sold in a [[35mm format|35 mm standard]] (24\u00d736&nbsp;mm negative), although print sizes and [[Large format (photography)|large format]] films are defined in inches. [[Optical format|Digital camera sensor sizes]] are measured in an archaic manner indicating inverse fractions of an inch representing the diameter of an equivalent [[vidicon]] tube. For example, a {{frac|1|1.6&nbsp;in}} sensor is larger than a {{frac|1|2.5&nbsp;in}} sensor. However, lenses are marked in terms of focal length in millimeters (e.g., average natural human field of view is a lens with 50&nbsp;mm focal length for 35&nbsp;mm film).\n\n==== Clothing ====\nClothing is measured in inches, not [[centimeters]]. American [[Shoe size|shoes sizes]] are measured on different scales for children, men, and women but all sizes are derived from inches.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Your-Shoe-Size|title=How to Find Your Shoe Size|work=wikiHow|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Major multi-national apparel brands including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]], [[Hanesbrands|Hanes]], and [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] often sell the same inventory worldwide, with tags containing both SI and customary units in addition to [[Laundry symbol|laundry care symbols]] and instructions in many languages.\n\n==== Bedding ====\n[[Bed size|Mattress sizes]] use non-numeric labels, such as king, queen, full, or twin. These sizes are defined in inches, unlike most other countries, which use similar labels defined using metric units. The FPLA mandates bed sheets state the type of bed they are intended for in addition to dimensions in centimeters and inches. The FPLA also mandates dual scales on many other woven goods such as towels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/05/09/section-IVa-12-h130-final.pdf|title=Handbook 130 \u2013 2012 Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation|last=|first=|date=May 9, 2017|website=US National Institute of Standards and Technology|page=81|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nOf all industries, construction has adopted metric units the least. [[Dimensional lumber]] comes in standard nominal inch cross-section sizes and lengths are given in feet. Although [[model building code]]s\u2014such as the [[International Building Code]]\u2014provide information in both customary and metric units, locally developed building code amendments and [[zoning]] codes often provide customary units exclusively. Because of [[Canada]]'s proximity to the U.S., issues of common units still arise. This tendency in construction is similar to [[Japan]], an otherwise metricated country where traditional construction still uses [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]] predating metrication. However, blueprints commonly signify measurements using decimals (e.g., 9.2&nbsp;ft.); since feet are not divided into tenths on United States measuring tapes, builders commonly are forced to make conversions on-site that are often imprecise. In the previous example, 9.2&nbsp;ft equals 9&nbsp;ft 2.4 inches; slightly more than the 9&nbsp;ft {{frac|2|3|8}} mark on United States tape measures, though this degree of error is usually insignificant for these applications.\n\n===Aviation===\nAircraft altitudes for air traffic control and related purposes are measured in feet in the U.S. In fact, most of the world has used feet for aviation altitudes since the end of World War II (meters before 1945 in all European countries except the UK), with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, and many [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] (former Soviet) countries. For instance, an airliner on a long flight, even if neither its starting point nor destination are in the United States, might use a nominal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, using an internationally standardized system of [[flight level]]s (Flight Level 360 in this case). In 2011, Russia switched from metric to foot-denominated flight levels at high altitude to eliminate the need for adjustments when crossing in to or out of its airspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=119021# |title=\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0424 \u043e\u0442 05.09.2011 N 743 \"\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438\" \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441 |publisher=Base.consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=December 22, 2017 |trans-title=Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 743 of September 5, 2011 \"On Amendments to the Federal Rules for the Use of the Airspace of the Russian Federation\" \u2013 ConsultantPlus}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial aviation===\nFrequent-flyer programs from commercial airlines in the United States are commonly managed using miles. This is likely to continue; in fact, some international airlines that used kilometers are switching to miles or using both, to simplify the redemption of miles with United States airline partners (Aeromexico switched from kilometers to miles, and Varig from Brazil has used miles since the program was named \"Smiles\"). Aircraft speed is often measured in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s and elevation in feet ([[flight level]]) in many countries.\n\nFor both domestic and international routes, U.S. airlines set luggage size and weight restrictions in terms of customary units. Conversely, international airlines that fly to the U.S. often restrict baggage to metric sizes.\n\nThe temperatures in aviation-related weather reports are given in degrees Celsius in the United States.\n\nFor carry-on luggage, the [[Transportation Security Administration]] restricts liquids to 3.4 fluid ounces (100 mL).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule|title=Liquids Rule|date=December 16, 2014|work=Transportation Security Administration|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Originally, the agency planned to restrict to 3 ounces but switched it to 3.4 oz / 100 mL after pressure from the European Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2009/02/25/3-oz-or-34-oz-what-gives|title=3 oz or 3.4 oz?

Units of length, volume, and mass are typically introduced through comparison with ordinary objects. The metric system is not reinforced much outside the classroom due to lack of popular metric use. Consequently, while students may understand some of the concepts underlying the metric system, they do not necessarily have an intuitive sense of the value of the units.\n\nIn science education, students predominantly use metric measures in experiments and equations, allowing those interested in the sciences to become more familiar with the metric system. A few science [[Course credit|course credit]]s are requisites for an undergraduate degree in the U.S. which ensures most educated people have some exposure to the metric system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Within [[higher education]], the metric system is universal for classes in the sciences (see [[Metrication in the United States#Science and medicine|below]]), except for exercises designed to illustrate complex conversions. Engineering programs still widely use English Engineering Units, but this varies depending on the field. Electrical Engineering programs mostly use metric, while fields such as aerospace, materials, thermal, and manufacturing engineering use customary units extensively. Some non-science textbooks in the U.S. use only the metric system without giving conversions in order to promote metrication.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Electricity and energy===\nThere are no U.S. customary units for electric current, potential difference, or charge since these concepts were developed after the international adoption of metric in science. The metric units [[ampere]], [[volt]], [[ohm]] and [[coulomb]] are the only units used. The SI term [[hertz]] has replaced the term ''cycles per second'' for the same unit of frequency.\n\nEnergy is often measured in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (SI-based), [[calorie]]s (SI-based), [[British thermal unit|BTUs]] (customary) or [[therm]]s (customary) rather than the SI [[joule]]. Residential and commercial electrical energy use is metered and billed in kilowatt hours, [[Kilowatt hour|kW\u00b7h]], as in most metric countries. Force measurements regularly use the [[pound-force|pound]] instead of the SI [[newton (force)|newton]]; [[torque]] is measured in [[pound-foot|pound-feet]]. Fuel prices are mostly given in customary units, such as dollars per gallon, barrel, thousand cubic feet, or ton (short or long). Heating, cooling, and combustion are often measured in BTUs per hour or [[Ton of refrigeration|refrigeration tons]] and powerplant efficiency is often measured by its \"heat rate\", in BTU per kW\u00b7hour. The rated power of [[internal combustion engine|engines]], [[electric motor]]s, and [[Power station|power plant]] [[steam turbine]]s is frequently measured in [[horsepower]]. Power plant output is generally expressed in [[megawatt]]s.\n\n===Financial services===\nSome [[commodity market]] prices are quoted in customary units (such as [[Oil barrel|barrels]] of oil, [[troy ounce]]s of gold, pounds of frozen [[Pork belly|pork bellies]], etc.). The federal government reports international production figures in metric units (for instance, wheat in metric tons) but in [[bushel]]s for domestic production figures.\n\n===Firearms===\nThe U.S. uses both the inch and millimeter for [[caliber]] on civilian and law enforcement firearms.<ref name=\"m14\">{{cite web|title=M14 |work=Nazarian's Gun Recognition Guide |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013417/http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref>\nHistorically, ammunition rounds designed in the United States were denoted by their caliber in inches (e.g., [[.45 Colt]] and [[.270 Winchester]].) Two developments changed this tradition: the large preponderance of different cartridges using an identical caliber and the international arms trade bringing metric calibers to the United States. The former led to bullet diameter (rather than caliber) often being used to describe rounds to differentiate otherwise similar rounds. A good example is the [[.308 Winchester]], which fires the same .30-caliber projectile as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the [[.300 Savage]]. Occasionally, the caliber is just a number close to the diameter of the bullet, like the [[.220 Swift]], [[.223 Remington]] and [[.222 Remington Magnum]], all of which actually have .22 caliber or {{convert|.224|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} bullets.\n\nThe second development is actual metric calibers being introduced to the United States. 6&nbsp;mm and 7&nbsp;mm caliber rifles are particularly popular as are 9&nbsp;mm and 10&nbsp;mm caliber handguns. These metric caliber rounds are either described by their metric caliber, such as the very popular [[7mm Remington Magnum]] round or have their bullet diameter converted into inches, such as the also extremely popular [[.243 Winchester]]. Occasionally, U.S.-designed inch-caliber rounds are stated in metric as well.\n\nThe U.S. military, reflecting its need to ensure interoperability with its [[NATO]] allies, uses metric measurements for almost all weapons calibers, even for calibers that originated as or were derived from a different measurement (e.g. [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62&nbsp;mm]] rather than [[.308 Winchester|.308]], or [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56&nbsp;mm]] instead of [[.223 Remington|.223]]). However, civilian rifles chambered for .223 Remington may load military 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition but not fire it safely because 5.56&nbsp;mm NATO ammunition is loaded to create greater chamber pressure than .223 Remington. Controversy exists whether this is true for civilian rifles chambered for .308 Winchester firing 7.62\u00d751&nbsp;mm NATO military ammunition. Major [[handloading]] manuals in the U.S. use U.S. customary units for all pertinent measurements including bullet diameter, cartridge overall length, powder charge weight, velocity, and maximum pressure, even with European-designed fully metric rounds.\n\n===Gemstones===\nGemstones and pearls are sold in [[Carat (mass)|metric carats]].\n\n===Manufacturing===\nGlobalization of manufacturing has led to wide adoption of metric standards, although this is not yet universal{{where|date=June 2015}}. After a period where [[Car|automobiles]] were assembled with both customary and metric [[fastener]]s in each vehicle, cars are now universally built with metric parts. Automobile engines were once named after their displacement in cubic inches. For example, the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Chrysler \"426 Hemi\"]] engine would be described as 7 liters in modern terminology. Technical publications by industry publishers and American automakers often give engine displacements in cubic inches as well as cubic centimeters (which are equivalent to milliliters), or liters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0506_maserati_mc12/specs_price.html |title=Maserati MC12 \u2013 Engine, Chassis, Dimensions, Price, Warranty & Performance \u2013 Road Test Review |publisher=Motor Trend |date=December 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitdiesel.com/pdf/Engines/2006_S60_specs.pdf|title=Demand Detroit \u2013 Demand Detroit|website=www.detroitdiesel.com}}</ref> For example, the specifications for the Dodge SRT-8&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;L Hemi state the displacement as {{convert|370|cuin|cm3}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |title=The Official Chrysler HEMI engine Web site |publisher=HEMI |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807045824/http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nThe U.S. military uses metric measurements extensively to ensure interoperability with allied forces, particularly [[NATO]] [[Standardization Agreement]]s (STANAG).

The [[METAR]] reporting system in use in the United States differs from the one used by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in that [[wind]] speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and [[flight level|altimeter setting]] in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Furthermore, [[temperature]]s are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most synoptic observation charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted for the purposes of calculation. Upper-air temperature charts typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while [[potential temperature]] charts use the [[kelvin]]; both of these are in line with international usage.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Atmospheric [[vorticity]] is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough [[metric time|metrication of the day]]) but does not use the SI-recommended [[radian]].\n\n[[National Weather Service]] and TV/radio [[broadcasting|broadcast]] public forecasts are given almost exclusively in customary units: [[degrees Fahrenheit]] for temperature and [[dewpoint]], fractions of an inch of rain or ice and whole inches of [[snow]] (less than an inch often indicated by fractions or informal terms like \"dusting\" when very low), inches of mercury; and for wind speeds, miles per hour, except in marine forecasts, in which knots are used. [[wave height|Wave height]]s are measured in feet. Actual [[ice pellets|sleet]] and snowfall and their depths on the ground are measured in tenths of an inch, with actual rainfall in hundredths, and ice accretion in either fractions or decimals. [[Hail]]stone sizes are typically reported without a fixed unit of measure; they are instead compared to familiar round or spherical items (e.g. [[dime (United States coin)|dime]]-sized or [[golf ball]]-sized). [[Barometer]] readings for [[hurricane]]s are usually given in [[millibar]]s (mb), which are equal to hectopascals (hPa), or ten times the kilopascals (kPa) used in neighboring Canada; the use of inches of mercury in such applications is rapidly declining.\n\nIn early 2007, NASA announced that it would use metric units for all operations on the lunar surface upon its return to the Moon, then projected for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/08jan_metricmoon/ |title=NASA&nbsp;\u2013 Metric Moon |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref> NASA's lunar return program was then canceled in 2010.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/27/nation/la-na-nasa-budget27-2010jan27 White House won't fund NASA moon program], LA Times, January 27, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe medical field uses predominantly metric units.

In the Olympics, athletes run 1500 meters, not 1600 meters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nRunning races in the U.S. are usually run in metric distances (e.g., the [[100 metres]] dash or the [[5K run]]), although the mile distance remains popular. But even 5 and 10 kilometer races most often have mile markers on the course, and no kilometer markers. Long-distance races are often measured in kilometers, although exceptions exist (generally 10&nbsp;mile races). The [[marathon]] is referred to as a 26.219-mile race (the official marathon standard distance originally being in English units&nbsp;\u2014 26 miles, 385 yards) rather than 42.195&nbsp;km. [[Ultramarathon]]s are measured in either miles or kilometers, with little standardization either way.\n\nAlthough the Olympics and U.S. track events have been metric for years, it is still common for sports commentators to provide conversions to help the American audience understand the measurements.\n\nMeasured distances as used in events such as [[shot put]], [[high jump]], and [[discus throw]] are, however, often in feet and inches, except at the national and international levels.

Railroads use the [[standard gauge]] of 4 feet {{frac|8|1|2}} inches, as does most of Europe (where it is expressed instead as 1,435&nbsp;mm). \n[[File:Dodge Dart Speedometer.jpg|thumb|MPH and smaller km/h values on speedometer]]\nU.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101, which governs vehicle controls and displays, permits speedometers to display miles per hour (MPH) or both MPH and km/h.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/05/15/00-11493/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-fmvss-101-technical-correction-speedometer-display|title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; FMVSS 101-Technical Correction-Speedometer Display|date=May 15, 2000|work=Federal Register|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> In practice, most U.S.-market vehicles have mile odometers and dual-labeled speedometers with miles-per-hour as the primary calibration. Some 2000s era [[Buick]]s have a single speed gauge with a button on the instrument panel to switch the scale between MPH and km/h. Other vehicles have digital speedometers which can be set to read out speeds in either MPH or km/h.\n\nAnother common unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), used especially for lifts and cable cars. Odometers are permitted to record miles or kilometers, but must be clearly labeled as to which unit they record.\n[[File:Tire and Loading Information.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Vehicle capacity sticker]]\nTire inflation for passenger cars is typically about 30 pounds per square inch [[Pounds per square inch|(psi)]] or 207 kilopascals ([[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]).

On recently introduced [[Christmas lights]], however, millimeters are often used with small [[Sphere|globe]]-shaped bulbs (G30 and G40), and with miniature [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] sets, where the standard T1\u00be ({{frac|7|32}}-inch tube) ones are sometimes called M5 (5&nbsp;mm miniature; not to be confused with [[ISO metric screw thread|M5 thread]]).\n\nFor properties understood more recently, such as those related to electricity, there is no traditional unit; international units are always used, often in combination with U.S. customary units. One among many examples is in Table 8, chapter 9, of the ''National Electrical Code Handbook (8th ed.)'', where resistance of conductors per unit length is given in ohms per thousand feet.\n\nOther units are based on customary units, but use [[Power of 10|power-of-ten]] factors and [[metric prefix]]es. For example, distance to target for a U.S. submarine is expressed in kiloyards (kyd) rather than some combination of miles, yards, and feet. Telephone transmission line length and loop distances are measured in kilofeet.<ref>AT&T, ''Telecommunication Transmission Engineering'', Volume 2 \u2013 ''Facilities'', Bell Center for Technical Education (1977)</ref> In some fields of [[civil engineering]] (especially [[structural engineering]]), and [[architecture]], large loads and forces (such as the weight of a building or the amount of load applied to a column) are measured in [[kip (unit)|kips]] (kilopounds or 1000 [[pounds-force]]) instead of [[Short ton-force|short tons-force]] (2000 pounds-force), which are used in virtually all other non-metric industries in the United States, as well as in common usage among the public, when dealing with large values of force.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe continuing use of U.S. customary units has caused writers to speculate in fiction set in the future about the adoption of the metric system. Many authors have assumed that the United States and the human race in general will use metric units; however, others have assumed the continued use of U.S. customary units or have neglected to take metrication into account. Writers sometimes use customary units simply because American readers and watchers will understand the measurements; other times, they are simply used by accident. The 1966 show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', for instance, initially used U.S. customary units despite multiple Earth national origins and a setting in the 23rd century. Later, starting with \"[[The Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Changeling]]\", metric measures were used, albeit inconsistently. Later sequels of the show, such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (set in the 22nd century), used the metric system exclusively.\n\nBoth the metric system and attitudes in the U.S. toward the metric system are a target of humorous jabs in shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',<ref>In ''The Simpsons'', jokes about the situation are made in episodes \"[[A Star Is Burns]],\" \"[[Homer the Great]],\" \"[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]],\" and others. For instance, Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson once remarked: \"The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets forty [[Rod (unit)|rod]]s to the [[hogshead]] and that's the way I likes it.\"</ref> ''[[Futurama]]''<ref>An example is in \"[[The Series Has Landed]],\" when a farmer on the Moon states that at night, the temperature drops down to \u2212173. Fry asks, \"Is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?\" to which the farmer replies, \"First one, then the other.\" Another is in \"[[I, Roommate]],\" when Calculon attempts to put a ring on Monique's finger; when it fits, she replies, \"It fits! But then, you must know that I'm&nbsp;...\" \"Metric? I've always known, but for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.\"</ref> and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.<ref>Season 4 Episode 07 \"[[Apology Insufficiency]]\"; Sheldon: \"Ethyl alcohol. 40 milliliters.\" Penny: \"I'm sorry, honey, I don't know milliliters.\" Sheldon: \"Ah.

He wonders why he was a one-term president.\"</ref> A ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch titled \"Decabet\", released at the height of the metrication movement, lampooned the different metric measurements by introducing a new alphabet consisting of only ten letters.\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', Vincent Vega ([[John Travolta]]) tells Jules Winnfield ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) that \"Europe is a little different\", because for example in [[Paris]], they don't call it a \"[[Quarter Pounder]] with Cheese\" but a \"Royale with Cheese\" as \"they've got the metric system, they don't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is\". Later, Jules compliments the intelligence of one of their victims, after he correctly surmises that [[France|French]] use of the metric system is what precludes the term \"Quarter Pounder.\"\n\nIn the [[The Martian]] (Ridley Scott film) the dialogue for the approach between Hermes and Ares ship to rescue astronaut Mark Watney is held entirely in metric units. \n\n''[[Popular Science]]''<nowiki/>'s September 2003 edition listed NIST's \"Metric System Advocate\" on its list of the \"Worst Jobs in Science\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Speed |first=William |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2003-09/worst-jobs-science-2003 |title=The Worst Jobs in Science 2003 &#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[U.S. Metric Association]]\n* [[Frank Mankiewicz#Anti-metrication|Frank Mankiewicz]]\n* [[History of the metric system]]\n* [[Lyn Nofziger#Anti-metrication|Lyn Nofziger]]\n* [[Metrication in Australia]]\n* [[Metrication in Canada]]\n* [[Metrication in New Zealand]]\n* [[Metrication in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Metrication opposition]]\n* [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the USA]], 1790 report including proposal for decimal system based on the foot\n* [[The Metric Marvels]]\n* [[United States customary units]]\n* [[Public Land Survey System|United States Public Land Survey System]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111209113714/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/lc1136a.cfm The United States and the Metric System (LC 1136) nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/usmetric.html The Metric System in the United States]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111113000612/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/4858.cfm A Metric America: A Decision Whose Time Has Come on nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105080437/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/pub814.cfm#act Metric Conversion Act of 1975 on nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [http://www.us-metric.org www.us-metric.org]&nbsp;\u2014 U.S. Metric Association ([http://www.metric.org/ mirror link])\n* [http://internetoracle.org/bestof.cgi?N=351-375#365-10 Mean Mr Metric] satire about the (non)conversion to metric units.

Cr\u00eapes are usually of two types: ''sweet cr\u00eapes'' (''cr\u00eapes sucr\u00e9es'') and ''savoury [[galette]]s'' (''cr\u00eapes sal\u00e9es''). Cr\u00eapes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to [[flamb\u00e9]]ed [[Cr\u00eape Suzette|cr\u00eapes Suzette]] or elaborate savoury [[galette]]s. While cr\u00eapes are often associated with [[Brittany]], a region in the northwest of France, the consumption is widespread in [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Canada]], and many parts of Europe, North Africa, [[Lebanon]], Brazil and Argentina.\n\n==Etymology==\nCr\u00eapes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"frying pan\", which, in English, is literally translated to Pancakes.<ref>[Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, XIV, 645c; Galen, On the Properties of Foods, I, 3]</ref>  The French term \"cr\u00eape\" derives from the Latin ''crispa'', meaning with \"creases\".  The name \"galette\" came from the French word ''galet'' (\"pebble\") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire.\n\n==Traditions==\nIn France and Belgium, cr\u00eapes are traditionally served on [[Candlemas]] (''La Chandeleur''), 2 February. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing Day but became known in France as \"Le Jour des Cr\u00eapes\" (literally translated \"The Day of the Cr\u00eapes\", and sometimes called colloquially as \"Avec Cr\u00eape Day\", \"National Cr\u00eape Day\", or \"day of the Cr\u00eape\"), referring to the tradition of offering cr\u00eapes. The belief was that catching the cr\u00eape with a [[frying pan]] after tossing it in the air with your right hand while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich that year.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Clay\n | first = Xanthe\n | title = With a flame in your art\n | work = The Daily Telegraph\n | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2007/02/17/nosplit/edxanthe117.xml\n | date = 17 February 2007\n | access-date = 25 April 2008\n| location=London}}\n</ref><ref name=\"redmond\">Redmond, Barbara (30 January 2012).

Academic Search Complete.</ref>\n\n== Types of cr\u00eape ==\nSweet cr\u00eapes are generally made with [[wheat flour]] (''farine de froment''). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of [[breakfast]] or as a [[dessert]]. Common fillings include [[Nutella]] spread, [[preserves]], sugar (granulated or powdered), [[maple syrup]], [[golden syrup]], [[lemon juice]], [[whipped cream]], [[fruit spread]]s, [[custard]], and sliced soft fruits or [[confiture]].\n\nSavory cr\u00eapes are made with non-wheat flours such as [[buckwheat]]. A normal savoury cr\u00eape recipe includes using wheat flour but omitting the sugar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alfaro |first1=Danilo |title=Sweet or Savory Basic Crepe Recipe |url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-crepe-recipe-sweet-or-savory-995317 |website=The Spruce Eats |publisher=Dotdash |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Batter made from buckwheat flour is [[gluten]]-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or [[Food intolerance|intolerance]] to eat this type of cr\u00eape. Common savoury fillings for cr\u00eapes served for [[lunch]] or [[dinner]] are cheese, ham, and eggs, [[ratatouille]], mushrooms, [[artichoke]] (in certain regions), and various meat products. \n\n[[Batter (cooking)|Batter]]s can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar.<ref>\"Wrap it up in a cr\u00eape; Thin pancakes work in savoury or sweet dishes.\" Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia).

It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called  [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n==Making batter==\nIn order to make an evenly thin cr\u00eape, it is crucial to have batter without lumps. After whisking the batter, it is best to let it rest for half an hour, or even overnight, to let the bubbles from whisking disappear from the batter. Some even mix the batter to a fine consistency by using a blender or mixer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comsol.nl/blogs/finding-the-best-way-to-make-crepes-with-fluid-dynamics-research/|title=Finding the Best Way to Make Cr\u00eapes with Fluid Dynamics Research|date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Cr\u00eaperies==\n[[File:Picswiss BS-55-89.jpg|thumb|A small cr\u00eaperie]]\n[[File:Creperie du Ciel \u00e0 M\u00fcnster.JPG|thumb|Cr\u00eaperie in Germany]]\n\nA '''cr\u00eaperie''' may be a [[Take-out|takeaway]] restaurant or stall, serving cr\u00eapes as a form of fast food or [[street food]], or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or caf\u00e9.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Creperie Cafe|url=http://www.lacreperiecafe.net/|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCr\u00eaperies are typical in France, especially in [[Brittany]] ; however, cr\u00eaperies can be found throughout France and in many other countries.\n\nBecause a cr\u00eape may be served as either a main meal or a dessert, cr\u00eaperies may be quite diverse in their selection and may offer other baked goods such as [[baguette]]s.

[[Swedish pancake]]s, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to French cr\u00eapes. In some of the Nordic countries, cr\u00eapes are served with jam or fruit, especially [[Vaccinium_vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and r\u00e4isk\u00e4le in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which resemble the French cr\u00eapes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup. The Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has pl\u00e4ttar/lettu, which resemble tiny English pancakes, are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but are baked in the oven and include fried pork in the batter (fl\u00e4skpannkaka). Potato pancakes called \"raggmunk\" contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing r\u00e5rakor). \n\nA special Swedish pancake is the saffron pancake from [[Gotland]] which is made with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron|saffron]] and rice and baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special Swedish pancake is the ''[[\u00e4ggakaka]]'' (eggcake), also called ''[[\u00c4ggakaka|sk\u00e5nsk \u00e4ggakaka]]'' (Scanian eggcake)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sk\u00e5nsk egg cake |url=http://www.swedishfood.com/swedish-food-recipes-main-courses/447-egg-cake |website=Swedish Food.com |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. It is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is much thicker and more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1\u00bd to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically [[bilberry]] jam) or sugar.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:49ers flapjack OHP.jpg|thumb|right|A plate of 49er flapjacks]]\nThe '''49er flapjack''' is a [[sourdough]] cr\u00eape which is popular in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-16/news/ol-43368_1_original-pancake-house |title=Why They Sell Like Hot Cakes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 March 1995 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the [[California Gold Rush]].

In the Spanish regions of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]], they are traditionally served at carnivals. In Galicia, they're called ''filloas'', and may also be made with pork blood instead of milk. In Asturias, they are called ''fayueles'' or ''frixuelos'', and in [[Turkey]], ''ak\u0131tma.''\n\nIn areas of [[central Europe]], formerly belonging to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], there is a thin pancake comparable to a cr\u00eape that in [[Austro-Bavarian]] is called ''[[Palatschinken]]''; in {{lang-hu|palacsinta}}; and in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and {{lang-sl|pala\u010dinka}}; in {{lang-sk|palacinka}}. In the Balkan countries, ''pala\u010dinka'' or ''palla\u00e7inka'' may be eaten with fruit jam, [[quark cheese]], sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream [[Nutella]], while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants which are specialised in pala\u010dinci are called \"Pala\u010dinkara\" in the region. In [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the [[Blini|blintz]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians ''[[palacsinta]]'', which it derives from the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'', which comes in turn from classical Latin ''placenta'' (\"small flat cake\"), even though the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'' is more similar to a pie, and the cr\u00eapes are actually called ''cl\u0103tit\u0103''.\n\nCr\u00eapes have also long been popular in [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]], with sweet and savoury varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called cr\u00eaperies. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], they are called ''panqueques'' and are often eaten with [[dulce de leche]]. Various other French foods such as cr\u00eapes, [[Souffl\u00e9|souffl\u00e9s]], and [[quiche]] have slowly made their way into North American cooking establishments.<ref>Benenson, R. (1984). Dining in America. Editorial research reports 1984 (Vol. I). Washington, DC: CQ Press.</ref> Typically, these franchises stick to the traditional French method of making cr\u00eapes but they have also put their own spin on the cr\u00eape with new types such as the hamburger and pizza cr\u00eape.

Since they are made from butter, eggs and milk, cr\u00eapes are allowed to be consumed during the celebration by the [[Orthodox church]]. There are endless combinations to the recipes and the execution of cr\u00eapes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for [[kefir]]. Furthermore, different oils can be added or substituted.  Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with [[caviar]], cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam, or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun, since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring. \n<ref>{{cite web|last=Nesterova |first=Maria |url=http://eurokulture.missouri.edu/buttery-crepes-of-deliciousness-and-other-stuff/ |title=Maslenitsa, another Russian festival you\u2019ve probably never heard of |work=Eurokulture.missouri.edu |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cr\u00eaperies and cr\u00eape franchises, some cr\u00eape manufacturers use modern equipment to produce cr\u00eapes in bulk.\n\n[[File:Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape served in cr\u00eaperie near the Pantheon in Paris, France]]\nDishes with similar appearance, taste and preparation methods exist in other parts of the world as well. In South India, a cr\u00eape made of fermented [[rice]] [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] is called a [[dosa]], which often has savoury fillings. In Western India, a cr\u00eape made of [[gram flour]] is called \"Pudlaa\" or \"Poodla\", with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called \"patibola\" and is sweet in taste due to milk, [[jaggery]], or sugar. The [[injera]] of [[Ethiopia]]n/[[Eritrea]]n/[[Somali people|Somali]]/[[Yemen]]i cuisine is often described as a thick cr\u00eape. In Somalia, Malawa\u1e25 ([[Somali language|Somali]]: Malawax) is very similar to a cr\u00eape. It is mostly eaten at breakfast.\n\nThe names for thin cr\u00eapes in other parts of Europe are:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* {{lang-sq|palla\u00e7inka}}\n* {{lang-ast|frixuelo}}\n* {{lang-br|krampouezh}}\n* {{lang-bg|\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430}}\n* {{lang-kw|krampoeth}}\n* {{lang-cz|pala\u010dinka}}\n* {{lang-nl|pannenkoek}}\n* {{lang-et|pannkook, \u00fclepannikook}}\n* {{lang-fo|pannukaka}}\n* {{lang-fi|ohukainen, l\u00e4tty, lettu or r\u00e4isk\u00e4le}}\n* {{lang-gl|filloas}}\n* {{lang-de|Pfannkuchen, Austria: Palatschinke}}\n* {{lang-gr|\u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1}} (''kr\u00e9pa'')\n* {{lang-hu|palacsinta}}\n* {{lang-is|p\u00f6nnukaka}}\n*{{lang-ir|panc\u00f3g}}\n* {{lang-it|crespella}}\n* {{lang-kz|\u049b\u04b1\u0439\u043c\u0430\u049b}} (''quymaq'')\n* {{lang-lv|pank\u016bka}}\n* {{lang-lt|lietiniai blynai}}\n* {{lang-mk|\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430}}\n* {{lang-pl|nale\u015bniki}}\n* {{lang-pt|crepe}}\n* {{lang-ro|cl\u0103tit\u0103}}\n* {{lang-ru|\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b}} (''bliny'')\n* {{lang-sh|pala\u010dinka}}, \u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430\n* {{lang-sk|palacinka}}\n* {{lang-sl|pala\u010dinka}}\n* {{lang-es|crepes}}\n* {{lang-tr|krep, ak\u0131tma}}\n* {{lang-uk|\u043c\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0456, \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438}} (''mlyntsi'', ''nalysnyky'')\n* {{lang-cy|cramwyth}}\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[B\u00e1nh x\u00e8o]]\n* [[Blintz]]\n* [[Brik]]\n* [[Cr\u00eape bretonne]]\n* [[Crepe maker]], crepe cooking device\n* [[Dosa]]\n* [[Galette]], another kind of Breton pancake, also from Brittany, France\n* [[Injera]]\n* [[Jianbing]], a traditional Chinese street food similar to crepe\n* [[Kouign amann]], another Breton delicacy\n* [[Krampouz]], crepe maker manufacturer, also from Brittany, France\n* [[List of brunch foods]]\n* [[List of pancakes]]\n* [[Maslenitsa]]\n* [[Memiljeon]]\n* [[Palatschinken]]\n* [[Pancake Day]]\n* [[Pek Nga]], Malaysian crepe-like snack\n* [[Popiah]], Chinese roll wrapped in a thin crepe made by \"wiping\" dough on a hot plate\n* [[Ploye]], a buckwheat pancake originating from [[Acadian]] cuisine of Canada\n* [[Poffertjes]], small ball-shaped pancake that is popular in the Netherlands\n* [[Roti prata]]\n* [[Sope]]\n* [[Swedish pancake]]\n* [[Tava]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n: 19.

Cr\u00eapes are usually of two types: ''sweet cr\u00eapes'' (''cr\u00eapes sucr\u00e9es'') and ''savoury [[galette]]s'' (''cr\u00eapes sal\u00e9es''). Cr\u00eapes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to [[flamb\u00e9]]ed [[Cr\u00eape Suzette|cr\u00eapes Suzette]] or elaborate savoury [[galette]]s. While cr\u00eapes are often associated with [[Brittany]], a region in the northwest of France, the consumption is widespread in [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Canada]], and many parts of Europe, North Africa, [[Lebanon]], Brazil and Argentina.\n\n==Etymology==\nCr\u00eapes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"frying pan\", which in English is literally translated to Pancakes.<ref>[Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, XIV, 645c; Galen, On the Properties of Foods, I, 3]</ref>  The French term, cr\u00eape, derives from the Latin ''crispa'', meaning with \"creases\".  The name \"galette\" came from the French word ''galet'' (\"pebble\") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire.\n\n==Traditions==\nIn France and Belgium, cr\u00eapes are traditionally served on [[Candlemas]] (''La Chandeleur''), 2 February. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing Day but became known in France as \"Le Jour des Cr\u00eapes\" (literally translated \"The Day of the Cr\u00eapes\", and sometimes called colloquially as \"Avec Cr\u00eape Day\", \"National Cr\u00eape Day\", or \"day of the Cr\u00eape\"), referring to the tradition of offering cr\u00eapes. The belief was that catching the cr\u00eape with a [[frying pan]] after tossing it in the air with your right hand while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich that year.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Clay\n | first = Xanthe\n | title = With a flame in your art\n | work = The Daily Telegraph\n | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2007/02/17/nosplit/edxanthe117.xml\n | date = 17 February 2007\n | access-date = 25 April 2008\n| location=London}}\n</ref><ref name=\"redmond\">Redmond, Barbara (30 January 2012).

This symbolism also applies to the coin held in the person's hand.<ref>Sokolov, Raymond. \"Sun food.\" ''Natural History'' May 1993: 82. Academic Search Complete.</ref>\n\n== Types of cr\u00eape ==\nSweet cr\u00eapes are generally made with [[wheat flour]] (''farine de froment''). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of [[breakfast]] or as a [[dessert]]. Common fillings include [[Nutella]] spread, [[preserves]], sugar (granulated or powdered), [[maple syrup]], [[golden syrup]], [[lemon juice]], [[whipped cream]], [[fruit spread]]s, [[custard]], and sliced soft fruits or [[confiture]].\n\nSavory cr\u00eapes are made with non-wheat flours such as [[buckwheat]]. Savoury cr\u00eapes are also made with the normal cr\u00eape recipe using wheat flour, omitting the sugar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Batter made from buckwheat flour is [[gluten]]-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or [[Food intolerance|intolerance]] to eat this type of cr\u00eape. Common savoury fillings for cr\u00eapes served for [[lunch]] or [[dinner]] are cheese, ham, and eggs, [[ratatouille]], mushrooms, [[artichoke]] (in certain regions), and various meat products. \n\n[[Batter (cooking)|Batter]]s can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar.<ref>\"Wrap it up in a cr\u00eape; Thin pancakes work in savoury or sweet dishes.\" Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia). (24 April 2013 Wednesday) LexisNexis Academic.</ref>  Fillings are commonly added to the centre of the cr\u00eape and served with the edges partially folded over the centre.\nA variety of crepe is also made in India which uses multi-grain flour, eggs, curd and an assortment of spices as its ingredients. It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called  [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n==Making batter==\nIn order to make an evenly thin cr\u00eape, it is crucial to have a good batter without lumps. After whisking the batter best stays to rest for half an hour or even overnight, to let the bubbles from whisking disappear from the batter. Some even mix the batter to a fine consistency by using a blender or mixer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comsol.nl/blogs/finding-the-best-way-to-make-crepes-with-fluid-dynamics-research/|title=Finding the Best Way to Make Cr\u00eapes with Fluid Dynamics Research|date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Cr\u00eaperies==\n[[File:Picswiss BS-55-89.jpg|thumb|A small cr\u00eaperie]]\n[[File:Creperie du Ciel \u00e0 M\u00fcnster.JPG|thumb|Cr\u00eaperie in Germany]]\n\nA '''cr\u00eaperie''' may be a takeaway restaurant or stall, serving cr\u00eapes as a form of fast food or [[street food]], or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or caf\u00e9.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Creperie Cafe|url=http://www.lacreperiecafe.net/|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCr\u00eaperies are typical of [[Brittany]] in France; however, cr\u00eaperies can be found throughout France and in many other countries.\n\nBecause a cr\u00eape may be served as either a main meal or a dessert, cr\u00eaperies may be quite diverse in their selection and may offer other baked goods such as [[baguette]]s.

[[Swedish pancake]]s, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to the French cr\u00eapes. In some of the Nordic countries, they are served with jam or fruit, especially lingonberries (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and r\u00e4isk\u00e4le in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which resemble the French cr\u00eapes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup, the Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has pl\u00e4ttar/lettu which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but include fried pork in the batter (fl\u00e4skpannkaka); these are baked in the oven. Potato pancakes called raggmunk contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing r\u00e5rakor). \n\nA special Swedish pancake is saffron pancake from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special \"Swedish pancake\" is the ''[[\u00e4ggakaka]]'' (eggcake), also called ''[[\u00c4ggakaka|sk\u00e5nsk \u00e4ggakaka]]'' (scanian eggcake). It is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is a lot thicker and also a lot more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1\u00bd to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry jam) or sugar.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:49ers flapjack OHP.jpg|thumb|right|A plate of 49er flapjacks]]\nThe '''49er flapjack''' is a [[sourdough]] crepe which is popular in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-16/news/ol-43368_1_original-pancake-house |title=Why They Sell Like Hot Cakes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 March 1995 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the [[California Gold Rush]].

In [[swedish language|Swedish]], a cr\u00eape is called ''pannkaka'' in southern regions while being called ''pl\u00e4ttar'' in the north, in [[danish language|Danish]], ''pandekager'' (\"pancakes\"), in Icelandic it is called ''p\u00f6nnukaka'', in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] a cr\u00eape is called either ''ohukainen'' or ''lettu'' or ''r\u00e4isk\u00e4le'', in [[Greek language|Greek]] it is krepa (\u039a\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1), in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is a ''[[pannenkoek]]'' or ''flensje'', and in [[Afrikaans]] a ''pannekoek'', which is usually served with [[cinnamon]] sugar. In the Spanish regions of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]], they are traditionally served at carnivals. In Galicia, they're called ''filloas'', and may also be made with pork blood instead of milk. In Asturias, they are called ''fayueles'' or ''frixuelos'', and in [[Turkey]], ''ak\u0131tma.''\n\nIn areas of [[central Europe]], formerly belonging to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], there is a thin pancake comparable to a cr\u00eape that in [[Austro-Bavarian]] is called ''[[Palatschinken]]''; in {{lang-hu|palacsinta}}; and in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and {{lang-sl|pala\u010dinka}}; in {{lang-sk|palacinka}}. In the Balkan countries, ''pala\u010dinka'' or ''palla\u00e7inka'' may be eaten with fruit jam, [[quark cheese]], sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream [[Nutella]], while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants which are specialised in pala\u010dinci are called \"Pala\u010dinkara\" in the region. In [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the [[Blini|blintz]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians ''[[palacsinta]]'', which it derives from the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'', which comes in turn from classical Latin ''placenta'' (\"small flat cake\"), even though the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'' is more similar to a pie, and the cr\u00eapes are actually called ''cl\u0103tit\u0103''.\n\nCr\u00eapes have also long been popular in [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]], with sweet and savoury varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called cr\u00eaperies. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], they are called ''panqueques'' and are often eaten with [[dulce de leche]]. Various other French foods, such as cr\u00eapes, souffles, and quiche, have slowly made their way into North American cooking establishments.<ref>Benenson, R. (1984). Dining in America. Editorial research reports 1984 (Vol. I). Washington, DC: CQ Press.</ref> Typically, these franchises stick to the traditional French method of making cr\u00eapes but they have also put their own spin on the cr\u00eape with new types such as the hamburger and pizza cr\u00eape.  In Mexico, cr\u00eapes are known as ''crepas'', and were introduced during the 19th century by the French <ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-del-Villar, Miguel Angel and Ruiz-Naufal,  V\u00edctor M., ''Mesa Mexicana'' (1993), Fundaci\u00f3n Cultural Bancomer, {{ISBN|9789686084948}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hursh |first=Karen |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2139-the-french-influence-on-mexican-cooking-la-comida-afrancescada |title=The French Influence On Mexican Cooking |work=Mexconnect.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> and are typically served either as a sweet dessert when filled with ''[[cajeta]]'' (similar to [[dulce de leche]]), or as a savoury dish when filled with ''Huitlacoche'' ([[corn smut]]), which is considered a delicacy.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], a unique native cr\u00eape recipe is the ''[[Daral (food)|daral]]'' which is made from ground [[glutinous rice]] and [[coconut milk]] batter (''[[galapong]]''). It is rolled into a cylinder and filled with sweetened coconut meat strips (''[[bukayo|hinti]]'').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Polistico |first1=Edgie |title=daral |url=https://pinoyfoodillustrated.blogspot.com/2012/12/daral.html |website=Philippine Food Illustrated |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cr\u00eapes in European culture==\nDuring the  Russian celebration of [[Maslenitsa]] (Russian Butter Week), one of the most popular foods is [[blini]], or cr\u00eapes. Since they are made from butter, eggs and milk, cr\u00eapes are allowed to be consumed during the celebration by the [[Orthodox church]]. There are endless combinations to the recipes and the execution of cr\u00eapes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for [[kefir]]. Also different oils can be added or substituted.  Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with caviar, cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun, since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring. \n<ref>{{cite web|last=Nesterova |first=Maria |url=http://eurokulture.missouri.edu/buttery-crepes-of-deliciousness-and-other-stuff/ |title=Maslenitsa, another Russian festival you\u2019ve probably never heard of |work=Eurokulture.missouri.edu |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cr\u00eaperies and cr\u00eape franchises, there are cr\u00eape manufacturers that use modern equipment to produce cr\u00eapes in bulk.\n\n[[File:Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape served in cr\u00eaperie near the Pantheon in Paris, France]]\nDishes with similar appearance, taste and preparation methods exist in other parts of the world as well. In South India, a cr\u00eape made of fermented [[rice]] [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] is called a [[dosa]], which often has savoury fillings. In Western India, a crepe made of [[gram flour]] is called Pudlaa/Poodla, with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called patibola and is sweet in taste due to milk, [[jaggery]] or sugar. The [[injera]] of [[Ethiopia]]n/[[Eritrea]]n/[[Somali people|Somali]]/[[Yemen]]i cuisine is often described as a thick cr\u00eape. Also in Somalia, Malawa\u1e25 ([[Somali language|Somali]]: Malawax) is very similar to a cr\u00eape. It is mostly eaten at breakfast.\n\nThe names for thin cr\u00eapes in other parts of Europe are:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* {{lang-sq|palla\u00e7inka}}\n* {{lang-ast|frixuelo}}\n* {{lang-br|krampouezh}}\n* {{lang-bg|\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430}}\n* {{lang-kw|krampoeth}}\n* {{lang-cz|pala\u010dinka}}\n* {{lang-nl|pannenkoek}}\n* {{lang-et|pannkook, \u00fclepannikook}}\n* {{lang-fo|pannukaka}}\n* {{lang-fi|ohukainen, l\u00e4tty, lettu or r\u00e4isk\u00e4le}}\n* {{lang-gl|filloas}}\n* {{lang-de|Pfannkuchen, Austria: Palatschinke}}\n* {{lang-gr|\u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1}} (''kr\u00e9pa'')\n* {{lang-hu|palacsinta}}\n* {{lang-is|p\u00f6nnukaka}}\n*{{lang-ir|panc\u00f3g}}\n* {{lang-it|crespella}}\n* {{lang-kz|\u049b\u04b1\u0439\u043c\u0430\u049b}} (''quymaq'')\n* {{lang-lv|pank\u016bka}}\n* {{lang-lt|lietiniai blynai}}\n* {{lang-mk|\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430}}\n* {{lang-pl|nale\u015bniki}}\n* {{lang-pt|crepe}}\n* {{lang-ro|cl\u0103tit\u0103}}\n* {{lang-ru|\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b}} (''bliny'')\n* {{lang-sh|pala\u010dinka}}, \u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430\n* {{lang-sk|palacinka}}\n* {{lang-sl|pala\u010dinka}}\n* {{lang-es|crepes}}\n* {{lang-tr|krep, ak\u0131tma}}\n* {{lang-uk|\u043c\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0456, \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438}} (''mlyntsi'', ''nalysnyky'')\n* {{lang-cy|cramwyth}}\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[B\u00e1nh x\u00e8o]]\n* [[Blintz]]\n* [[Brik]]\n* [[Cr\u00eape bretonne]]\n* [[Crepe maker]], crepe cooking device\n* [[Dosa]]\n* [[Galette]], another kind of Breton pancake, also from Brittany, France\n* [[Injera]]\n* [[Jianbing]], a traditional Chinese street food similar to crepe\n* [[Kouign amann]], another Breton delicacy\n* [[Krampouz]], crepe maker manufacturer, also from Brittany, France\n* [[List of brunch foods]]\n* [[List of pancakes]]\n* [[Maslenitsa]]\n* [[Memiljeon]]\n* [[Palatschinken]]\n* [[Pancake Day]]\n* [[Pek Nga]], Malaysian crepe-like snack\n* [[Popiah]], Chinese roll wrapped in a thin crepe made by \"wiping\" dough on a hot plate\n* [[Ploye]], a buckwheat pancake originating from [[Acadian]] cuisine of Canada\n* [[Poffertjes]], small ball-shaped pancake that is popular in the Netherlands\n* [[Roti prata]]\n* [[Sope]]\n* [[Swedish pancake]]\n* [[Tava]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n: 19.

Owing to their assistance young Hamerling was able to attend the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Vienna]] and afterwards the [[University of Vienna]].\n\nIn 1848 he joined the [[Academic Legion (Vienna)|students' legion]], which played a large part in the [[1848 revolutions|revolutions]] of the capital, and in 1849 shared in the defence of Vienna against the imperialist troops of [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]]. After the collapse of the revolutionary movement he was obliged to hide for a couple of weeks to escape arrest.\n\nFor the next few years he pursued his studies in natural science and philosophy, and in 1855 became master at the Gymnasium at [[Trieste]]. For many years he was ill, and in 1866 retired on a pension, which in acknowledgment of his literary works was increased by the government to a sum sufficient to enable him to live carefree until he died at his villa in [[Stiftingstal]] near [[Graz]], Austria.\n\nA popular edition of Hamerlings works in four volumes was published by M. M. Rabenlechner (Hamburg, 1900).\n\n==Evaluations==\n\n===1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica===\nThe [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] characterizes\nHamerling as one of the most remarkable poets of the modern Austrian school, describing his imagination as rich and his poems as full of life and colour. What it terms his most popular poem, ''Ahasver in Rom'' (1866), of which the emperor [[Nero]] is the central figure, is said to show at its best what is alleged to be the author's brilliant talent for description. Among his other works, 1911 Britannica mentions ''Venus im Exil'' (1858); ''Der K\u00f6nig von Sion'' (1869), characterized as a generally recognized masterpiece; ''Die sieben Tods\u00fcnden'' (1872) ''Bl\u00e4tter im Winde'' (1887); ''Homunculus'' (1888); ''Amor und Psyche'' (1882).\n\nThe 1911 Britannica goes on to describe his novel, ''Aspasia'' (1876), as giving a finely-drawn description of [[Pericles|the Periclean age]], but like his tragedy ''Danton und Robespierre'' (1870), somewhat stilted, showing that Hamerling's genius, though rich in imagination, was ill-suited for the realistic presentation of character.\n\n==Notes==\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Hamerling, Robert}} This work in turn cites:\n** Robert Hamerling, ''Stationen meiner Lebenspilgerschaft'' (Stations of my life pilgrimage, autobiography, 1889)\n** Robert Hamerling, ''Lehrjahre der Liebe'' (Years of learning from love, autobiography, 1890)\n** M.

Owing to their assistance young Hamerling was able to attend the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Vienna]] and afterwards the [[University of Vienna]].\n\nIn 1848 he joined the [[Academic Legion (Vienna)|students' legion]], which played a large part in the [[1848 revolutions|revolutions]] of the capital, and in 1849 shared in the defence of Vienna against the imperialist troops of [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]]. After the collapse of the revolutionary movement he was obliged to hide for a couple of weeks to escape arrest.\n\nFor the next few years he pursued his studies in natural science and philosophy, and in 1855 became master at the Gymnasium at [[Trieste]]. For many years he was ill, and in 1866 retired on a pension, which in acknowledgment of his literary works was increased by the government to a sum sufficient to enable him to live carefree until he died at his villa in [[Stiftingstal]] near [[Graz]], Austria.\n\nA popular edition of Hamerlings works in four volumes was published by M. M. Rabenlechner (Hamburg, 1900).\n\n==Evaluations==\n\n===1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica===\nThe [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] characterizes\nHamerling as one of the most remarkable poets of the modern Austrian school, describing his imagination as rich and his poems as full of life and colour. What it terms his most popular poem, ''Ahasver in Rom'' (1866), of which the emperor [[Nero]] is the central figure, is said to show at its best what is alleged to be the author's brilliant talent for description. Among his other works, 1911 Britannica mentions ''Venus im Exil'' (1858); ''Der K\u00f6nig von Sion'' (1869), characterized as a generally recognized masterpiece; ''Die sieben Tods\u00fcnden'' (1872) ''Bl\u00e4tter im Winde'' (1887); ''Homunculus'' (1888); ''Amor und Psyche'' (1882).\n\nThe 1911 Britannica goes on to describe his novel, ''Aspasia'' (1876), as giving a finely-drawn description of [[Pericles|the Periclean age]], but like his tragedy ''Danton und Robespierre'' (1870), somewhat stilted, showing that Hamerling's genius, though rich in imagination, was ill-suited for the realistic presentation of character.\n\n==Notes==\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Hamerling, Robert}} This work in turn cites:\n** Robert Hamerling, ''Stationen meiner Lebenspilgerschaft'' (Stations of my life pilgrimage, autobiography, 1889)\n** Robert Hamerling, ''Lehrjahre der Liebe'' (Years of learning from love, autobiography, 1890)\n** M.

{"title_page": "Friedrich Halm", "text_new": "[[Image:Friedrich Halm (cropped).jpg|thumb|Eligius Franz Joseph von M\u00fcnch-Bellinghausen (Friedrich Halm); lithograph by [[Joseph Kriehuber]]]]\n\n'''Baron Eligius Franz Joseph von M\u00fcnch-Bellinghausen''' ({{lang-de|Eligius Franz Joseph Freiherr<ref>{{German title|Freiherr}}</ref> von M\u00fcnch-Bellinghausen}}) (2 April 1806{{snd}}22 May 1871) was an Austrian dramatist, poet and novella writer of the Austrian [[Biedermeier]] period and beyond, and is more generally known under his pseudonym '''Friedrich Halm'''.\n\n== Life and career ==\nHe was the son of a district judge at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in Poland, at this time part of the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=M\u00fcnch-Bellinghausen, Eligius Franz Joseph |volume=19|page=2}}</ref> Early in his literary career he adopted the ''nom de plume'' of '''Friedrich Halm''' (\"Halm\" means a blade of grass or a blade of straw), and became one of the most popular dramatists in Vienna around the middle of the 19th century. His novellas are now regarded as more significant from a literary point of view than his dramatic writings.\n\nM\u00fcnch-Bellinghausen was educated at the seminary of [[Melk Abbey]] and later at [[Vienna]], where he studied philosophy and [[jurisprudence]], and where he began his career in 1826.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAs a boy he took a keen interest in the theater, and from 1833 enjoyed the friendship of his former teacher, the [[Benedictine]] [[Michael Leopold Enk von der Burg]], who encouraged the poet to offer his drama ''Griseldis'' to the [[Burgtheater|Hofburg theatre]].  {{sfn|Remy|1912}}\nIts successful production in 1835 established Halm's reputation as a playwright and henceforth he continued to write for the stage with varying success.\n\nM\u00fcnch-Bellinghausen became Regierungsrat (government councillor) in 1840 and {{lang|de|Kustos}} (chief keeper) of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek|Court Library]] in 1844, a position that [[Franz Grillparzer]] had sought in vain. He was elected member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1852, and life member of the Austrian [[Imperial Council (Austria)#House of Lords|Herrenhaus]] in 1861. In 1867, he was appointed superintendent of the two court-theatres, but three years later resigned this position which disputes had made distasteful to him. His health also had been failing.\n\n== Literary work ==\n{{Update|section|reason=significant amount of criticism from a very outdated source|date=September 2019}}\nFriedrich Halm's earliest full-length drama, ''Schwert, Hammer, Buch'', completed in 1833 but never published, explores three various routes in quest of happiness: that of the warrior, that of the artisan, and that of the artist. \nThis massive drama of several hundred pages, although still a piece of '[[juvenilia]]', has numerous effective passages and anticipates the literary talent that was to burst upon the Viennese literary scene just three or four years later with the publication of Halm's tragedy, ''Griseldis''. \nOf his many dramatic works the best known are, indeed, ''Griseldis'' (1837); ''Der Adept'' (1836; publ. 1838), ''Camoens'' (1838), ''Der Sohn der Wildnis'' (1842), and ''Der Fechter von Ravenna'' (1857). \n''Griseldis'' is based on the well-known story of the faithful wife whose loyalty and devotion are put to the severest tests but who triumphs in the end. ''Der Sohn der Wildnis'' (\"The Son of the Wilderness\") is a romantic drama depicting the power of womanly love and virtue over rude barbarian strength. \nIt was presented on the English stage under the title of ''[[Ingomar the Barbarian]]''. ''Der Fechter von Ravenna'' (\"The Gladiator of Ravenna\"), regarded as one of Halm's best dramas, is a [[tragedy]] having for its hero Thumelicus the son of Arminius, the liberator of Germany from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule. According to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], \"[his plays] are distinguished by elegance of language, melodious versification and clever construction, and were for a time exceedingly popular.\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nTheatrically these plays are very effective, but the characters are improbable and the situations are often strained. Their popularity, which they owe largely to their smooth, polished and beautiful diction and skillfully interspersed lyrics, has not been lasting. Of Halm's numerous other dramas we may mention the vivid and powerful ''Sampiero'' (1856, depicting the tragic loss of humanity attendant upon political fanaticism); ''Iphigenie in Delphi'' (1856); ''[[Begum Somru]]'' (1863); ''Wildfeuer'' (1864); a German version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Cymbeline]]'' that appeared on the stage in 1842, and an extremely effective and humorous comedy entitled ''Verbot und Befehl'' (\"Prohibition and Decree\", 1856).\n\nHe is also the author of lyrics, short stories, and of a narrative poem ''Charfreitag'' (\"Good Friday\") (1864). His poems, ''Gedichte'', were published in [[Stuttgart]], 1850 (new ed. Vienna. 1877). His pessimistic {{lang|de|weltanschauung}} seems to have been formed very early on in life and never to have deserted him, as evidenced by early poems such as ''Eine Makame'' and later poems, ''Schwere Jahre''. These describe how life is seen as essentially a vale of tears and filled with suffering, and only made bearable by the hope of a blissful and tranquil life of the spirit. These will supervene after physical death.\n\nHalm's high reputation during his lifetime is indicated by the stone bust which was carved of him and which still sits on top of the famous Burgtheater in Vienna, alongside those of Schiller, Goethe and Grillparzer.\n\nFrom an early age, Halm showed an aptitude for fictional narrative, perhaps first exemplified in the charming tale, ''Die Abendgenossen'', written when Halm was in his early twenties. Another early novella from this period, ''Ein Abend zu L'', contains insights on sex and homosexuality which anticipate Freudian psycho-analytical notions. Dr. Tony Page writes on this:\n\n\"In view of its daring delineations of human sexuality and repressed sexual urges, its potentially progressive view of same-sex love and general exploration of the human psyche in the grip of passion, ''Ein Abend zu L.'' constitutes a remarkable early 19th-century literary document, providing pre-echoes of psycho-analytical ideas that would take the Western world by storm less than a century later.\"<ref>Dr. Tony Page, 'Friedrich Halm and the Demon of Sex: An Examination of Halm's Early Novelle, '''Ein Abend zu L'''', ''Manusya Journal of Humanities'', Chulalongkorn University, 2014, Thailand, p.66, www.manusya.journals.chula.ac.th/ files/ essay/ FRIEDRICH%20HALM_51-67</ref>\n \nHalm's other short stories, or novellas, which tend to focus on spiritual issues and self-destructive monomaniacal characters, are far superior to most of his dramas and are striking and impressive in content, full of psychological insights\u2014especially his earliest major story, ''Das Auge Gottes'' (\"The Eye of God\"), a lengthy novella written in 1826, about the supernatural reverberations of the blasphemous act of the desecration of a holy icon, and his final narrative masterpiece, ''Das Haus an der Veronabr\u00fccke''  (\"The House on Verona Bridge\"), centring on the inner collapse of a man given over to a morally repellent but overriding {{lang|fr|id\u00e9e fixe}} (the enforced sexual coupling of his wife with another man).  His novella, ''Die Marzipan-Lise'' (\"Marzipan Lise\"), is credited with being one of the first \"criminal fiction tales\" of German literature and is now available as an audio book on CD. Furthermore, the composer, Brahms, used some of Halm's verse as the basis for a number of his Lieder.\n\nOverall it can be said that it is as a short-story or \"novella\" writer that Halm has secured a place in the history of German/Austrian literature. His novellas mark Halm out as a writer of talent, psychological penetration and substance. His novella, ''The House at Verona Bridge'' (''Das Haus an der Veronabruecke'') alone stands as a milestone in 19th-century Austrian literature for its probing and insightful treatment of an obsessive mentality that inevitably leads its possessor into tragedy and death.\n\nHis collected works, ''Samtliche Werke'', were published arranged in chronological order in eight volumes (1856\u20131864), to which four posthumous volumes were added in 1872. Also published were ''Ausgew\u00e4hlte Werke'', ed. by Anton Schlossar in 4 vols. (1904). Published in the 21st century in Amazon Kindle format were a collection of poems entitled ''Unpublished Poems of Friedrich Halm'' (2011), the full text of Halm's novella, ''Das Auge Gottes'' (2011), as well as Halm's novella, ''Ein Abend zu L.''

His novellas are now regarded as more significant from a literary point of view than his dramatic writings.\n\nM\u00fcnch-Bellinghausen was educated at the seminary of [[Melk Abbey]] and later at [[Vienna]], where he studied philosophy and [[jurisprudence]], and where he began his career in 1826.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAs a boy he took a keen interest in the theater, and from 1833 enjoyed the friendship of his former teacher, the [[Benedictine]] [[Michael Leopold Enk von der Burg]], who encouraged the poet to offer his drama ''Griseldis'' to the [[Burgtheater|Hofburg theatre]].  {{sfn|Remy|1912}}\nIts successful production in 1835 established Halm's reputation as a playwright and henceforth he continued to write for the stage with varying success.\n\nM\u00fcnch-Bellinghausen became Regierungsrat (government councillor) in 1840 and {{lang|de|Kustos}} (chief keeper) of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek|Court Library]] in 1844, a position that [[Franz Grillparzer]] had sought in vain. He was elected member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1852, and life member of the Austrian [[Imperial Council (Austria)#House of Lords|Herrenhaus]] in 1861. In 1867, he was appointed superintendent of the two court-theatres, but three years later resigned this position which disputes had made distasteful to him. His health also had been failing.\n\n== Literary work ==\n{{Update|section|reason=significant amount of criticism from a very outdated source|date=September 2019}}\nFriedrich Halm's earliest full-length drama, ''Schwert, Hammer, Buch'', completed in 1833 but never published, explores three various routes in quest of happiness: that of the warrior, that of the artisan, and that of the artist. \nThis massive drama of several hundred pages, although still a piece of '[[juvenilia]]', has numerous effective passages and anticipates the literary talent that was to burst upon the Viennese literary scene just three or four years later with the publication of Halm's tragedy, ''Griseldis''. \nOf his many dramatic works the best known are, indeed, ''Griseldis'' (1837); ''Der Adept'' (1836; publ. 1838), ''Camoens'' (1838), ''Der Sohn der Wildnis'' (1842), and ''Der Fechter von Ravenna'' (1857). \n''Griseldis'' is based on the well-known story of the faithful wife whose loyalty and devotion are put to the severest tests but who triumphs in the end. ''Der Sohn der Wildnis'' (\"The Son of the Wilderness\") is a romantic drama depicting the power of womanly love and virtue over rude barbarian strength. \nIt was presented on the English stage under the title of ''[[Ingomar the Barbarian]]''. ''Der Fechter von Ravenna'' (\"The Gladiator of Ravenna\"), regarded as one of Halm's best dramas, is a [[tragedy]] having for its hero Thumelicus the son of Arminius, the liberator of Germany from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule. According to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], \"[his plays] are distinguished by elegance of language, melodious versification and clever construction, and were for a time exceedingly popular.\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nTheatrically these plays are very effective, but the characters are improbable and the situations are often strained. Their popularity, which they owe largely to their smooth, polished and beautiful diction and skillfully interspersed lyrics, has not been lasting. Of Halm's numerous other dramas we may mention the vivid and powerful ''Sampiero'' (1856, depicting the tragic loss of humanity attendant upon political fanaticism); ''Iphigenie in Delphi'' (1856); ''[[Begum Somru]]'' (1863); ''Wildfeuer'' (1864); a German version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Cymbeline]]'' that appeared on the stage in 1842, and an extremely effective and humorous comedy entitled ''Verbot und Befehl'' (\"Prohibition and Decree\", 1856).\n\nHe is also the author of lyrics, short stories, and of a narrative poem ''Charfreitag'' (\"Good Friday\") (1864). His poems, ''Gedichte'', were published in [[Stuttgart]], 1850 (new ed. Vienna. 1877). His pessimistic {{lang|de|weltanschauung}} seems to have been formed very early on in life and never to have deserted him, as evidenced by early poems such as ''Eine Makame'' and later poems, ''Schwere Jahre''. These describe how life is seen as essentially a vale of tears and filled with suffering, and only made bearable by the hope of a blissful and tranquil life of the spirit. These will supervene after physical death.\n\nHalm's high reputation during his lifetime is indicated by the stone bust which was carved of him and which still sits on top of the famous Burgtheater in Vienna, alongside those of Schiller, Goethe and Grillparzer.\n\nFrom an early age, Halm showed an aptitude for fictional narrative, perhaps first exemplified in the charming tale, ''Die Abendgenossen'', written when Halm was in his early twenties. Another early novella from this period, ''Ein Abend zu L'', contains insights on sex and homosexuality which anticipate Freudian psycho-analytical notions. Dr. Tony Page writes on this:\n\n\"In view of its daring delineations of human sexuality and repressed sexual urges, its potentially progressive view of same-sex love and general exploration of the human psyche in the grip of passion, ''Ein Abend zu L.'' constitutes a remarkable early 19th-century literary document, providing pre-echoes of psycho-analytical ideas that would take the Western world by storm less than a century later.\"<ref>Dr. Tony Page, 'Friedrich Halm and the Demon of Sex: An Examination of Halm's Early Novelle, '''Ein Abend zu L'''', ''Manusya Journal of Humanities'', Chulalongkorn University, 2014, Thailand, p.66, www.manusya.journals.chula.ac.th/ files/ essay/ FRIEDRICH%20HALM_51-67</ref>\n \nHalm's other short stories, or novellas, which tend to focus on spiritual issues and self-destructive monomaniacal characters, are far superior to most of his dramas and are striking and impressive in content, full of psychological insights\u2014especially his earliest major story, ''Das Auge Gottes'' (\"The Eye of God\"), a lengthy novella written in 1826, about the supernatural reverberations of the blasphemous act of the desecration of a holy icon, and his final narrative masterpiece, ''Das Haus an der Veronabr\u00fccke''  (\"The House on Verona Bridge\"), centring on the inner collapse of a man given over to a morally repellent but overriding {{lang|fr|id\u00e9e fixe}} (the enforced sexual coupling of his wife with another man).  His novella, ''Die Marzipan-Lise'' (\"Marzipan Lise\"), is credited with being one of the first \"criminal fiction tales\" of German literature and is now available as an audio book on CD. Furthermore, the composer, Brahms, used some of Halm's verse as the basis for a number of his Lieder.\n\nOverall it can be said that it is as a short-story or \"novella\" writer that Halm has secured a place in the history of German/Austrian literature. His novellas mark Halm out as a writer of talent, psychological penetration and substance. His novella, ''The House at Verona Bridge'' (''Das Haus an der Veronabruecke'') alone stands as a milestone in 19th-century Austrian literature for its probing and insightful treatment of an obsessive mentality that inevitably leads its possessor into tragedy and death.\n\nHis collected works, ''Samtliche Werke'', were published arranged in chronological order in eight volumes (1856\u20131864), to which four posthumous volumes were added in 1872. Also published were ''Ausgew\u00e4hlte Werke'', ed. by Anton Schlossar in 4 vols. (1904). Published in the 21st century in Amazon Kindle format were a collection of poems entitled ''Unpublished Poems of Friedrich Halm'' (2011), the full text of Halm's novella, ''Das Auge Gottes'' (2011), as well as Halm's novella, ''Ein Abend zu L.''
