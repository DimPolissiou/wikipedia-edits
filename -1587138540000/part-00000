The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, respectively, searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

Although the country known as Italy [[Italian unification|did not unite until the 19th century]], the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook ([[Apicius]]) which dates back to first century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Italian Food|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/history-of-italian-food-cuisine.html|website=yourguidetoitaly.com}}</ref> Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the [[New World]] have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Roman Empire]], when different cities [[Italian city-states|began to separate]] and form their own traditions. Many different types of [[bread]] and [[pasta]] were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, [[Milan]] (north of Italy) is known for its [[risotto]]s, [[Bologna]] (the central/middle of the country) is known for its [[tortellini]] and [[Naples]] (the south) is famous for its [[pizza]]s<ref>[http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 First pizzeria was settled in Naples]</ref> and [[spaghetti]]s.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{See also|Ancient Roman cuisine|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe first known Italian [[food writer]] was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] named [[Archestratus]] from [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s or other [[seasonings]]. He placed importance on simple preparation of [[fish]].<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\">Del Conte, 11.</ref>\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and [[Food and dining in the Roman Empire|replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed]]. By the time ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published in the 1st century AD, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce [[bread]]s and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best [[cheesemaker]]s. The Romans reared [[goat]]s for [[butcher]]ing, and grew [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\" />\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine}}\n[[File:Fortezza Verrucole Archeopark interno.jpg|thumb|left|A restored medieval kitchen inside [[Verrucole Castle]], Tuscany.]]\nWith culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], a cuisine developed in [[Sicily]] that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Arab]]s invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing [[spinach]], [[almond]]s, and [[rice]].<ref name=\"Harmon\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/garden/arab-sicilian-food-tale-of-1001-years.html|title=Arab-Sicilian Food: Tale of 1,001 Years|last=Jenkins|first=Nancy Harmon|date=18 October 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=3 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 12th century, a [[Normans|Norman]] king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from [[flour]] and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'', a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/sicily-food-wine/arab-culinary-influence-in-sicilian-food|title=Arab Culinary Influence in Sicilian Food|last=Team|first=Delicious Italy|access-date=3 May 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref> [[Normans]] also introduced the [[casserole]], [[salt cod]] (baccal\u00e0), and [[stockfish]], all of which remain popular.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\">Del Conte, 12.</ref>\n\n[[Food preservation]] was either chemical or physical, as [[refrigeration]] did not exist. Meats and fish were [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]], dried, or kept on ice. [[Brine]] and [[salt]] were used to [[pickling|pickle]] items such as [[herring]], and to cure [[pork]]. [[Root vegetable]]s were preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]]. Other means of preservation included [[oil]], [[vinegar]], or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, [[liquor]], honey, and sugar were used.<ref>Capatti, 253\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of [[Germany|Germanic]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] while the south reflects Arab<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> influence, as much [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]] was spread by Arab trade.<ref>Capatti, 2\u20134.</ref> The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]]. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman ''pastello'', Lasagna pie, and call for the use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]].<ref>Capatti, 6.</ref>\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saffron]] has been used in Italy for centuries]]\n\nIn the 15th century, [[Maestro Martino]] was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. His ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'', made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], displaying [[Iran|Persian]] influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\" /> The Roman recipes include ''coppiette'' (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His [[Florence|Florentine]] dishes include eggs with ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'' (sweets), macaroni, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.<ref>Capatti, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] printed in [[Venice]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[Grayling (genus)|grayling]] from [[Adda (river)|Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and [[Picenum|Piceno]], [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from the [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[ficus|figs]] from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|eels]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. [[Wine]] from the Ligurian coast, [[Greco (grape)|Greco]] from Tuscany and [[Centola|San Severino]], and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and [[Picenum|Piceno]] are also mentioned in the book.<ref>Capatti, 10.</ref>\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nThe courts of [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], and [[Ferrara]] were central to the cuisine. [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]], published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scappi.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.6|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]\nIn 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], wrote his ''Opera'' in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in [[Lent]]. These fish recipes are simple, including [[poaching (cooking)|poaching]], [[broil]]ing, [[grilling]], and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan [[pizza]] (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as [[maize|corn]] (maize) and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] are included.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\">Del Conte, 14, 15.</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote ''Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs, and Fruit''), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to England because he was a [[Protestant]]. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" /> Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[lemon]] juice, [[verjus]], or [[orange juice]]. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and [[truffles]] in the winter, detailing the use of [[pigs]] in the search for truffles.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" />[[File:Arte di ben cucinare.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.6|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]\n\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the [[Duchy of Mantua]], published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the first to offer a section on ''vitto ordinario'' (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke [[Charles III, Duke of Mantua|Charles]] for Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used), and a napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\">Del Conte, 15.</ref>\n\nOther books from this time, such as ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]], tell how ''scalci'' (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\" />\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Apicius 1709.JPG|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|''[[Apicius]]'', ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' (\"On the Subject of Cooking\"), 1709 edition.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than [[French cuisine]]. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref> Periodicals in booklet form such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (''The Cook of Cremona'') in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity, and frequency.<ref>Capatti, 158\u2013159.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, medical texts warned peasants against eating refined foods as it was believed that these were poor for their digestion and their bodies required heavy meals. It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.<ref>Capatti, 282\u2013284.</ref>\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from [[Macerata]] in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (''The Cook of Macerata''). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and [[pasta]], rice, and [[gnocchi]]. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (''The Courteous Cook'') gave particular emphasis to v''itto pitagorico'' (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n[[File:Tomato2 002.jpg|thumb|Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Gentilcore2010\">{{cite book |last=Gentilcore |first=David |title=Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZgEvOPTQLsC |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=15 June 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-15206-8|page=x}}</ref>]]\n\n''Zuppa alli pomidoro'' in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan [[pappa al pomodoro]]. Corrado's 1798 edition introduced a \"Treatise on the Potato\" after the French [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]]'s successful promotion of the tuber.<ref>De Conte, 17</ref> In 1790, [[Francesco Leonardi (Chef)|Francesco Leonardi]] in his book ''L'Apicio moderno'' (\"Modern [[Apicius]]\") sketches a history of the Italian Cuisine from the Roman Age and gives as first a recipe of a tomato-based sauce.<ref>Faccioli, 753</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, Giovanni Vialardi, chef to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel]], wrote ''A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie'' with recipes \"suitable for a modest household\". Many of his recipes are for regional dishes from Turin including twelve for potatoes such as ''Genoese Cappon Magro''. In 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured [[Milan]]ese dishes such as kidney with [[anchovies]] and lemon and [[gnocchi]] alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 addressed the cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]]. ''La Cucina Teorico-Pratica'' written by Ippolito Cavalcanti described the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.<ref>De Conte, 18\u201319</ref>\n\n''La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene'' (''The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well''), by [[Pellegrino Artusi]], first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print. Its recipes predominantly originate from [[Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]], where he lived.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:BasilkumPesto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pesto]], a Ligurian sauce made out of basil, olive oil and pine nuts, and which can be eaten with pasta or other dishes such as soup.]]\n\nItalian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or [[baccal\u00e0]]), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients.

Basil (found in [[pesto]]), nuts, and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham ([[prosciutto]]), sausage ([[cotechino Modena|cotechino]]), different sorts of [[salami]], truffles, [[Grana (cheese)|grana]], [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]], and [[tomato]]es ([[Bolognese sauce]] or [[rag\u00f9]]).\n[[File:Italian olive oil 2007.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.35|[[Olive oil]] is the most commonly used vegetable fat in Italian cooking, and as the basis for sauces, often replaces animal fats of butter or lard.<ref name=\"May2005\">{{cite book|last=May|first=Tony|title=Italian Cuisine: The New Essential Reference to the Riches of the Italian Table|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tAafwz2YcQC&pg=PA7|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-30280-1|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>]]\n\nTraditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In [[Tuscany]], pasta (especially [[pappardelle]]) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In [[Southern Italy]], tomatoes&nbsp;(fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), [[Capsicum|peppers]], olives and [[olive oil]], garlic, [[artichoke]]s, oranges, [[ricotta cheese]], [[eggplants]], [[zucchini]], certain types of [[fish]] (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named\u2014[[penne]], [[maccheroni]], [[spaghetti]], [[linguine]], [[fusilli]], [[lasagne]], and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]].\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include [[spaghetti]] (thin rods), [[rigatoni]] (tubes or cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets). Dumplings, like [[gnocchi]] (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like [[sp\u00e4tzle]], are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from [[durum wheat]] flour or durum wheat [[semolina]], and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: ''firm to the bite'', meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as [[pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (''pasta all'uovo'' \"egg pasta\"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\n== Regional variation ==\nEach area [[List of Italian dishes|has its own specialties]], primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.<ref name=HazanIntroduction>{{cite book |last1=Hazan |first1=Marcella|authorlink1=Marcella Hazan|date=27 October 1992|title=Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394584041 |edition=1st |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/77517/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking/ |accessdate=2 November 2015|format=Kindle and printed. |chapter=Introduction|quote=...Italian cooking?

The dish is sometimes served with ''[[ossobuco]]'' (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lacucinaitaliana.it/ricetta/piatti-unici/ossobuco-e-risotto-piatto-unico-di-milano/#step-1|title=Ricetta Ossobuco e risotto, piatto unico di Milano|website=Le ricette de La Cucina Italiana|language=Italian|trans-title=Recipe for ossobuco and risotto, one-course meal dish of Milano|date=|author=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther regional specialities include ''[[cotoletta alla milanese]]'' (a fried [[breaded cutlet]] of veal similar to [[Wiener schnitzel]], but cooked \"bone-in\"), ''[[cassoeula]]'' (a typically winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), ''[[Mostarda]]'' (rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup), [[Valtellina]]'s [[bresaola|''bresaola'']] (air-dried salted beef), [[pizzoccheri|''pizzoccheri'']] (a flat ribbon pasta made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes, and layered with pieces of [[Valtellina Casera]] cheese), and ''tortelli di zucca'' (a type of ''[[ravioli]]'' with pumpkin filling, usually garnished with melted butter and sage).<ref name=\"Piras, 87\">Piras, 87.</ref>\n\nRegional cheeses include [[Grana Padano]], [[Gorgonzola cheese|Gorgonzola]], [[Crescenza]], [[Robiola]], and [[Taleggio (cheese)|Taleggio]] (the [[Po Valley|plains of central and southern Lombardy]] allow intensive cattle farming). ''[[Polenta]]'' is common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous ''[[panettone]]'' (soft sweet bread with [[Raisin|raisins]] and [[Candied fruit|candied citron and orange chunks]]).\n\n=== Marche ===\nOn the coast of [[Marche]], fish and seafood are produced. Inland, wild and domestic pigs are used for sausages and [[ham]]s. These hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks. [[Suckling pig]], [[chicken]], and [[fish]] are often stuffed with [[rosemary]] or [[fennel]] fronds and [[garlic]] before being roasted or placed on the spit.<ref>Piras, 273</ref>\n\nAscoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for ''olive all'ascolana'', (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg, and Parmesan, then fried).<ref name=\"GURI\">[http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/10061dl.htm] Provvedimento 15 febbraio 2006: Iscrizione della denominazione \u00abOliva Ascolana del Piceno\u00bb nel registro delle denominazioni di origine protette e delle indicazioni geografiche protette, ''GURI n. 46''</ref> Another well-known Marche product are the ''[[:it:Maccheroncini di Campofilone|Maccheroncini di Campofilone]]'', from little town of [[Campofilone]], a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in one's mouth.\n\n=== Piedmont ===\n[[File:Agnolotti.JPG|thumb|left|Traditional Piedmontese ''[[agnolotti]]'']]\n\nBetween the Alps and the [[Po valley]], featuring a large number of different ecosystems, the Piedmont region offers the most refined and varied cuisine of the Italian peninsula. As a point of union between traditional Italian and French cuisine, [[Piedmont]] is the Italian region with the largest number of cheeses with [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected geographical status]] and wines under [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]]. It is also the region where both the [[Slow Food]] association and the most prestigious school of Italian cooking, the [[University of Gastronomic Sciences]], were founded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Davide paolini,''Prodotti Tipici D'Italia'', Garzanti.</ref>\n\n[[Piedmont]] is a region where gathering nuts, [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[cardoon]]s, as well as [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] are common place.

Wines from the [[Nebbiolo]] grape such as [[Barolo]] and [[Barbaresco]] are produced as well as wines from the [[Barbera]] grape, fine [[sparkling wine]]s, and the sweet, lightly sparkling, [[Moscato d'Asti]]. The region is also famous for its [[Vermouth]] and [[Ratafia]] production.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Castelmagno (cheese)|Castelmagno]] is a prized cheese of the region. Piedmont is also famous for the quality of its [[Carr\u00f9]] beef (particularly ''bue grasso'', \"fat ox\"), hence the tradition of eating raw meat seasoned with garlic oil, lemon, and salt; [[carpaccio]]; Brasato al vino, wine stew made from marinated beef; and boiled beef served with various sauces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe food most typical of the Piedmont tradition are the traditional ''[[agnolotti]]'' (pasta folded over with roast beef and vegetable stuffing), ''paniscia'' (a typical dish of [[Novara]], a kind of [[risotto]] with [[Arborio rice]] or [[Maratelli]] rice, the typical kind of [[Saluggia]] beans, onion, [[Barbera]] wine, lard, salami, season vegetables, salt and pepper), ''[[taglierini]]'' (thinner version of tagliatelle), ''[[bagna cauda]]'' (sauce of garlic, anchovies, olive oil, and butter), and ''[[bicerin]]'' (hot drink made of coffee, chocolate, and whole milk).

The [[S\u00fcdtirol]] cuisine has strong [[Alps|alpine]] regional and [[Austria]]n influence]]\nBefore the [[Council of Trent]] in the middle of the 16th century, the region was known for the simplicity of its peasant cuisine. When the prelates of the Catholic Church established there, they brought the art of fine cooking with them. Later, also influences from Venice and the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] came in.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\">Piras, 67.</ref>\n\nThe [[Trentino]] subregion produces various types of sausages, polenta, yogurt, cheese, potato cake, funnel cake, and freshwater fish. In the [[S\u00fcdtirol]] (Alto Adige) subregion, due to the German-speaking majority population, strong Austrian and Slavic influences prevail. The most renowned local product is traditional ''[[speck]]'' juniper-flavored ham which, as [[Speck Alto Adige PGI|Speck Alto Adige]], is regulated by the [[European Union]] under the [[protected geographical indication]] (PGI) status. [[Goulash]], ''[[kn\u00f6del]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[kaiserschmarrn]]'', ''[[krapfen]]'', ''[[r\u00f6sti]]'', ''[[sp\u00e4tzle]]'', and [[rye bread]] are regular dishes, along with potatoes, dumpling, homemade [[sauerkraut]], and lard.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\" /> The territory of [[Bolzano]] is also reputed for its [[M\u00fcller-Thurgau]] white wines.\n\n=== Tuscany ===\n[[File:Finocchiona from Tuscany.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Finocchiona]]'', a classic southern Tuscan Salami]]\n\nSimplicity is central to the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] cuisine. Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh [[fruit]] are used. A good example of typical Tuscan food is ''[[ribollita]]'', a notable soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. ''Ribollita'' was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover ''[[minestrone]]'' or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, [[Chard|silverbeet]], ''[[cavolo nero]]'' (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as ''[[pici]]'' resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional [[Florentine steak]], come from the [[Chianina]] cattle breed of the [[Chiana Valley]] and the [[Maremmana]] from [[Maremma]].\n\nPork is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221\u2013239.</ref> The region is well-known also for its rich [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[wild boar]], [[European hare|hare]], [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[pheasant]] that often are used to prepare ''[[pappardelle]]'' dishes. Regional desserts include ''[[panforte]]'' (prepared with honey, fruits, and nuts), ''[[ricciarelli]]'' (biscuits made using an almond base with sugar, honey, and egg white), and ''[[cavallucci]]'' (cookies made with almonds, candied fruits, coriander, flour, and honey). Well-known regional wines include [[Brunello di Montalcino]], [[Carmignano DOCG|Carmignano]], [[Chianti]], [[Morellino di Scansano]], [[Parrina]], [[Sassicaia]], and [[Vernaccia di San Gimignano]].\n\n=== Umbria ===\n[[File:Montefalco z09.jpg|thumb|A varietal [[Sagrantino]] indigenous to the region of Umbria]]\n\nMany [[Umbria]]n dishes are prepared by boiling or roasting with local olive oil and herbs.

Fish and seafood are added in regions closer to the coast while [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]], and [[frog legs]] appear farther away from the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nMade from finely ground maize meal, [[polenta]] is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of [[Northern Italy]]. It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include [[Boletus edulis|porcini]], [[rapini]], or other vegetables or meats, such as small [[song-bird]]s in the case of the [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] dish ''polenta e osei'', or [[sausage]]s. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named ''biancoperla'', so that the color of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called ''polenta bianca'').\n[[File:Polenta con sopressa e funghi.jpg|thumb|''[[Polenta]]'' served with ''[[sopressa]]'' and mushrooms, a traditional [[peasant food]] of Veneto]]\n\n[[Bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' (beans and pasta) and ''risi e bisi'' ([[rice and peas]]). Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as [[Sopressa|Soppressa Vicentina]], garlic salami, [[Piave cheese]], and [[Asiago cheese]]. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] and white asparagus from [[Bassano del Grappa]]. Perhaps the most popular dish of [[Venice]] is ''[[liver and onions|fegato alla veneziana]]'', thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\n[[Squid]] and [[cuttlefish]] are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called ''nero di seppia''.<ref>Piras, 33.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |title=Venice Cuisine \u2013 by food author Howard Hillman |publisher=Hillmanwonders.com |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611081454/http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |archivedate = 11 June 2008}}</ref> Regional desserts include ''[[tiramisu]]'' (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of [[egg yolks]] and ''[[mascarpone]]'', and flavored with liquor and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = history of tiramisu\n |url         = http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |accessdate  = 16 August 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20120604101928/http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |archivedate = 4 June 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>), ''[[baicoli]]'' (biscuits made with butter and vanilla), and [[nougat]].\n\nThe most celebrated Venetian wines include [[Bardolino]], [[Prosecco]], [[Soave (wine)|Soave]], [[Amarone]], and [[Valpolicella]] [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines.\n\n== Meal structure ==\n{{Main|Meal structure in Italy}}\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|A typical Italian breakfast, consisting of ''[[cappuccino]]'' and brioche / croissant / cornetto.]]\nTraditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://toscanaslc.com/blog/guide-to-the-traditional-italian-meal-structure/|title=Guide to the Traditional Italian Meal Structure|date=22 September 2015|work=Cucina Toscana|access-date=15 May 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures.

The ''primo'' (first course) is usually a filling dish such as risotto or pasta, with sauces made from meat, vegetables, or seafood. Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (''piatto unico'') combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving.\n[[File:Prosecco-gold-arrangement-1.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of sparkling [[Prosecco]], which one would have as an ''aperitivo'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Meal stage\n!Composition\n|-\n|Aperitivo\n|[[ap\u00e9ritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal, may be: [[Campari]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Cinzano]], [[Amaro Lucano|Lucano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz (alcoholic beverage)|Spritz]], [[Vermouth]], [[Negroni]].\n|-\n|Antipasto\n|literally \"before (the) meal\", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread [[appetizer]]s.\n|-\n|Primo\n|\"first course\", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|sugo]] or [[rag\u00f9]] as a sauce\n|-\n|Secondo\n|\"second course\", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes.

Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern [[espresso machine]], invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to {{convert|90|to|95|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25\u201330 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 [[Fluid ounce|fl oz]], two tablespoons) of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. [[Neapolitan flip coffee pot|''La Napoletana'']] is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The [[Moka pot|''Moka per il caff\u00e8'']] is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>\n\nEspresso is usually served in a [[demitasse]] cup. [[Caff\u00e8 macchiato]] is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; [[caffelatte]] is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf\u00e9 au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and [[caff\u00e8 corretto]] is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as [[grappa]] or [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[bicerin]] is also an Italian coffee, from [[Turin]]. It is a mixture of [[cappuccino]] and traditional [[hot chocolate]], as it consists of a mix of coffee and [[drinking chocolate]], and with a small addition of milk.

Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref> There are twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]]. To promote this, the Italian government passed the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]] e garantita'' (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.<ref>Koplan, 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise.\n\n==== Beer ====\n{{Main|Beer in Italy}}\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually [[pale lager]]. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] and [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]]. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and [[South Tyrol]] (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\n==== Other ====\n[[File:Homemade limoncello.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.3|A bottle of homemade [[Limoncello]]]]\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. [[Limoncello]], a traditional lemon liqueur from Sicily and Southern Italy ([[Sorrento]], [[Amalfi]] and the [[Gulf of Naples]]) is the second most popular liqueur in Italy after Campari.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.luxuryretreats.com/everything-need-know-drinking-limoncello-italy/|title=Drinking Limoncello in Italy|date=8 December 2017|website=Luxury Retreats Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref> Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, served chilled in small glasses or cups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Amaro Averna|Amaro Sicilianos]] are common Sicilian digestifs, made with herbs, which are usually drunk after heavy meals. [[Mirto (liqueur)|Mirto]], an herbal distillate made from the berries (red mirto) and leaves (white mirto) of the myrtle bush, is popular in [[Sardinia]] and other regions. Another well-known digestif is [[Amaro Lucano]] from [[Basilicata]].<ref>Piras, 383.</ref>\n\n[[Grappa]] is the typical alcoholic drink of northern Italy, generally associated with the culture of the [[Alps]] and of the [[Po Valley]]. The most famous grappas are distilled in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Veneto]], [[Piedmont]], and [[Trentino]]. The three most notable and recognizable Italian aperitifs are [[Martini & Rossi|Martini]], [[Vermouth]], and [[Campari]]. A sparkling drink which is becoming internationally popular as a less expensive substitute for [[Champagne (wine)|French champagne]] is [[prosecco]], from the Veneto region.<ref name=\"Atkin\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/11/foodanddrink1|title=The fizz that's the bizz|last=Atkin|first=Tim, ''The Observer'' |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2008|location=London|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name=\"Dane\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/print/story/10272259.html|title=Pop the Cork on Prosecco|last=Dane|first=Ana, ''TheStreet.com'' |date=3 July 2006 |accessdate=29 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Desserts ==\n{{Main|List of Italian desserts}}\n{{See also|List of Italian dishes#Desserts and pastry|l1=List of Italian dishes\u2014Desserts and pastry}}\n{{See also|Sicilian cuisine#Desserts and sweets|l1=Sicilian cuisine\u2014Desserts and sweets}}\nFrom the Italian perspective, cookies and [[candy]] belong to the same category of sweets.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Tim H. |title=Sweets: A History of Candy |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |year=2002 |isbn=1-58234-229-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 364\u2013365] |url=https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 }}</ref> Traditional candies include [[candied fruit]]s, [[torrone]], and [[nut brittle]]s, all of which are still popular in the modern era.

A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, [[boiled egg]]s, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the [[Colomba Pasquale]] (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with [[almond]]s and [[pearl sugar]].\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed with the ''cena di magro'' (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]].\n\n== Abroad ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nDue to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], and [[Somalia]] (except the [[British Somaliland|northern part]], which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\n==== Libya ====\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of [[pasta]] on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\n==== South Africa ====\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of [[Italian South Africans|Italians]]. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in [[South Africa]], especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== France ====\n\nIn France, the [[cuisine of Corsica]] has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the [[Early Middle Ages]] until 1768 first of a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] and then a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the ''[[charcuterie]]''.\n\n==== Great Britain ====\n\n[[Pizza]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[spaghetti bolognese]] and [[lasagne]] with bolognese ''[[rag\u00f9]]'' and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] are the most popular forms of Italian food in [[British cuisine|British]], notably, [[English cuisine|English]], cuisine.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on [[Slovenian cuisine]]. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and part of [[Inner Carniola]]) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous [[Istrian Italians|Italian minority]] live in [[Slovenian Istria]].\n\nDishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] include the ''gubana'' [[nut roll]] of [[Friuli]] (known as ''guban'ca'' or ''potica'' in Slovenia) and the ''[[Istrian Stew|jota]]'' stew.\n\nDishes that come directly from Italian cuisine include [[gnocchi]] and some types of pasta; [[minestrone]] (''mine\u0161tra'' in Slovene); [[frittata]] (''[[fritaja|frtalja]]''); [[Prosciutto]] (''pr\u0161ut''); and [[polenta]].\n\n=== North and Central America ===\n\n==== Canada and the USA ====\n{{Main|Italian-American cuisine}}\n[[File:Supreme pizza.jpg|thumb|An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers]]\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily [[American cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most [[pizza]] eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a [[breaded cutlet|breaded, pan-fried cutlet]] of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Milanesa napolitana con papas fritas rodajas de tomate y or\u00e9gano.jpg|thumb|\"[[Milanesa]] a la napolitana\" with [[French fries]], an Italian-inspired dish based on the original ''cotoletta'' dish from Milan, common in [[South America]]. This dish is called \"parmegiana steak\" in [[Brazil]], though it is not typical from [[Parma]] region in [[Italy]] but was actually invented in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\n==== Argentina ====\nDue to large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration to Argentina]], Italian food and drink is heavily featured in [[Argentine cuisine]]. An example could be ''[[milanesa]]s'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta]] alla milanese from [[Milan]], Italy) or [[breaded cutlet]]s. [[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as ''[[Sorrentino]]s'' and Argentine gnocchi.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the [[Italian Brazilians|huge Italian community]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including [[milanesa]] steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of [[pizza]], different from both [[Neapolitan cuisine|Neapolitan]] and [[Italian-American cuisine|American]] varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical [[botequim]] counter snack.\n\n==== Venezuela ====\nThere is considerable Italian influence in [[Venezuelan cuisine]]. ''Pan chabata'', or Venezuelan ciabatta, ''Pan Siciliano'', Sicilian bread, ''Cannoli siciliani'', Sicilian cannoli, and the drink [[chinotto (Venezuelan soft drink)|chinotto]] are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Italy|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'', an Italian cookbook\n* ''[[Il talismano della felicit\u00e0]]'' by Ada Boni, an Italian cookbook\n* [[Italian food products]]\n* [[List of Italian cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian DOP cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian dishes]]\n** [[List of Italian soups]]\n* [[List of Italian restaurants]]\n* [[Sammarinese cuisine]]\n* [[Italian meal structure]]\n* [[Italian wine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Capatti, Alberto and Montanari, Massimo.

Although the country known as Italy [[Italian unification|did not unite until the 19th century]], the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook ([[Apicius]]) which dates back to first century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Italian Food|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/history-of-italian-food-cuisine.html|website=yourguidetoitaly.com}}</ref> Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the [[New World]] have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Roman Empire]], when different cities [[Italian city-states|began to separate]] and form their own traditions. Many different types of [[bread]] and [[pasta]] were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, [[Milan]] (north of Italy) is known for its [[risotto]]s, [[Bologna]] (the central/middle of the country) is known for its [[tortellini]] and [[Naples]] (the south) is famous for its [[pizza]]s<ref>[http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 First pizzeria was settled in Naples]</ref> and [[spaghetti]]s.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{See also|Ancient Roman cuisine|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe first known Italian [[food writer]] was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] named [[Archestratus]] from [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s or other [[seasonings]]. He placed importance on simple preparation of [[fish]].<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\">Del Conte, 11.</ref>\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and [[Food and dining in the Roman Empire|replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed]]. By the time ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published in the 1st century AD, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce [[bread]]s and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best [[cheesemaker]]s. The Romans reared [[goat]]s for [[butcher]]ing, and grew [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\" />\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine}}\n[[File:Fortezza Verrucole Archeopark interno.jpg|thumb|left|A restored medieval kitchen inside [[Verrucole Castle]], Tuscany.]]\nWith culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], a cuisine developed in [[Sicily]] that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Arab]]s invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing [[spinach]], [[almond]]s, and [[rice]].<ref name=\"Harmon\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/garden/arab-sicilian-food-tale-of-1001-years.html|title=Arab-Sicilian Food: Tale of 1,001 Years|last=Jenkins|first=Nancy Harmon|date=18 October 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=3 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 12th century, a [[Normans|Norman]] king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from [[flour]] and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'', a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/sicily-food-wine/arab-culinary-influence-in-sicilian-food|title=Arab Culinary Influence in Sicilian Food|last=Team|first=Delicious Italy|access-date=3 May 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref> [[Normans]] also introduced the [[casserole]], [[salt cod]] (baccal\u00e0), and [[stockfish]], all of which remain popular.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\">Del Conte, 12.</ref>\n\n[[Food preservation]] was either chemical or physical, as [[refrigeration]] did not exist.

His ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'', made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun.

[[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]], published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scappi.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.6|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]\nIn 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], wrote his ''Opera'' in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in [[Lent]]. These fish recipes are simple, including [[poaching (cooking)|poaching]], [[broil]]ing, [[grilling]], and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan [[pizza]] (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as [[maize|corn]] (maize) and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] are included.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\">Del Conte, 14, 15.</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote ''Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs, and Fruit''), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to England because he was a [[Protestant]]. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" /> Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[lemon]] juice, [[verjus]], or [[orange juice]]. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and [[truffles]] in the winter, detailing the use of [[pigs]] in the search for truffles.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" />[[File:Arte di ben cucinare.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.6|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]\n\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the [[Duchy of Mantua]], published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the first to offer a section on ''vitto ordinario'' (\"ordinary food\").

Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\" />\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Apicius 1709.JPG|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|''[[Apicius]]'', ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' (\"On the Subject of Cooking\"), 1709 edition.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than [[French cuisine]]. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref> Periodicals in booklet form such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (''The Cook of Cremona'') in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables.

It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.<ref>Capatti, 282\u2013284.</ref>\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from [[Macerata]] in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (''The Cook of Macerata''). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and [[pasta]], rice, and [[gnocchi]]. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (''The Courteous Cook'') gave particular emphasis to v''itto pitagorico'' (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n[[File:Tomato2 002.jpg|thumb|Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Gentilcore2010\">{{cite book |last=Gentilcore |first=David |title=Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZgEvOPTQLsC |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=15 June 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-15206-8|page=x}}</ref>]]\n\n''Zuppa alli pomidoro'' in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan [[pappa al pomodoro]].

In 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured [[Milan]]ese dishes such as kidney with [[anchovies]] and lemon and [[gnocchi]] alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 addressed the cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]]. ''La Cucina Teorico-Pratica'' written by Ippolito Cavalcanti described the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.<ref>De Conte, 18\u201319</ref>\n\n''La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene'' (''The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well''), by [[Pellegrino Artusi]], first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print.

In [[Tuscany]], pasta (especially [[pappardelle]]) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In [[Southern Italy]], tomatoes&nbsp;(fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), [[Capsicum|peppers]], olives and [[olive oil]], garlic, [[artichoke]]s, oranges, [[ricotta cheese]], [[eggplants]], [[zucchini]], certain types of [[fish]] (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named\u2014[[penne]], [[maccheroni]], [[spaghetti]], [[linguine]], [[fusilli]], [[lasagne]], and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]].\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include [[spaghetti]] (thin rods), [[rigatoni]] (tubes or cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets). Dumplings, like [[gnocchi]] (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like [[sp\u00e4tzle]], are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from [[durum wheat]] flour or durum wheat [[semolina]], and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: ''firm to the bite'', meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as [[pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (''pasta all'uovo'' \"egg pasta\"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\n== Regional variation ==\nEach area [[List of Italian dishes|has its own specialties]], primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.<ref name=HazanIntroduction>{{cite book |last1=Hazan |first1=Marcella|authorlink1=Marcella Hazan|date=27 October 1992|title=Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394584041 |edition=1st |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/77517/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking/ |accessdate=2 November 2015|format=Kindle and printed. |chapter=Introduction|quote=...Italian cooking?

Since the original pizza, several other types of pizzas have evolved.\n\nSince Naples was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]], its cuisine took much from the culinary traditions of all the Campania region, reaching a balance between dishes based on rural ingredients (pasta, vegetables, cheese) and seafood dishes (fish, crustaceans, mollusks). A vast variety of recipes is influenced by the local aristocratic cuisine, like ''[[timballo]]'' and the ''[[:it:sart\u00f9 di riso|sart\u00f9 di riso]]'', pasta or rice dishes with very elaborate preparation, while the dishes coming from the popular traditions contain inexpensive but nutritionally healthy ingredients, like pasta with beans and other pasta dishes with vegetables.\n\nFamous regional wines are [[Aglianico]] ([[Taurasi DOCG|Taurasi]]), [[Fiano (grape)|Fiano]], [[Falanghina]], and [[Greco (grape)|Greco di Tufo]].\n\n=== Emilia-Romagna ===\n[[File:Parmigiano Reggiano DOP Billa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parmesan cheese|''Parmigiano-Reggiano'']] is a well-known Italian hard cheese ]]\n\n[[Emilia-Romagna]] is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. The [[Romagna]] subregion is renowned for pasta dishes like ''[[cappelletti]]'', ''[[garganelli]]'', ''[[strozzapreti]]'', ''sfoglia lorda,'' and ''tortelli alla lastra'' as well as cheeses such as [[:it:squacquerone|squacquerone]], [[Piadina]] snacks are also a specialty of the subregion.\n\nIn the [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]] subregion, except [[Piacenza]] which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of [[Lombardy]], rice is eaten to a lesser extent. ''[[Polenta]]'', a maize-based dish, is common in both Emilia and Romagna.\n\n[[File:Tagliatelle al ragu Bolognese.jpg|thumb|''Tagliatelle'' with [[bolognese sauce|rag\u00f9]]]]\n[[Bologna]] and [[Modena]] are notable for pasta dishes like ''[[tortellini]]'', ''[[lasagne verdi|lasagne]]'', gramigna, and ''[[tagliatelle]]'' which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The celebrated [[balsamic vinegar]] is made only in the Emilian cities of [[Modena]] and [[Reggio Emilia]], following legally binding traditional procedures.<ref>Piras, 187.</ref> [[Parmigiano Reggiano]] cheese is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena, and Bologna and is often used in cooking. [[Grana Padano]] cheese is produced in Piacenza.\n\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include Parma's ''[[prosciutto]]'', ''[[culatello]],'' and ''[[Felino]] salami''; Piacenza's ''[[pancetta]]'', ''[[capicola|coppa]],'' and salami; Bologna's ''[[mortadella]]'' and ''salame rosa''; Modena's ''[[zampone]]'', ''[[cotechino]],'' and ''[[:it:cappello del prete|cappello del prete]]''; and [[Ferrara]]'s ''[[:it:salama da sugo|salama da sugo]]''. Piacenza is also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include ''[[zuppa inglese]]'' (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and [[Alchermes]] liqueur) and ''[[panpepato]]'' (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds).\n\n=== Friuli-Venezia Giulia ===\n[[File:Jota 02.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Istrian stew|Jota]]'' is a traditional stew in the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Venezia Giulia]] region]]\n\n[[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] conserved, in its cuisine, the historical links with [[Austria-Hungary]]. [[Province of Udine|Udine]] and [[Province of Pordenone|Pordenone]], in the western part of Friuli, are known for their traditional [[San Daniele del Friuli]] [[ham]], [[Montasio]] cheese, and [[Frico]] cheese. Other typical dishes are ''[[pitina]]'' (meatballs made of smoked meats), game, and various types of ''[[gnocchi]]'' and ''[[polenta]]''.\n\nThe majority of the eastern regional dishes are heavily influenced by Austrian, Hungarian, Slovene and Croatian cuisines: typical dishes include [[Istrian Stew]] (soup of beans, sauerkraut, potatoes, bacon, and spare ribs), [[Vienna sausages]], ''[[goulash]]'', ''[[\u0107evapi]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[gugelhupf]]''. Pork can be spicy and is often prepared over an open hearth called a ''fogolar''. [[Collio Goriziano]], [[Friuli Isonzo]], [[Colli Orientali del Friuli]], and [[Ramandolo]] are well-known [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] regional wines.\n\n=== Liguria ===\n[[File:Rosemary Focaccia.jpg|thumb|''[[Focaccia]]'' with rosemary. Focaccia is widely associated with Ligurian cuisine]]\n\n[[Liguria]] is known for herbs and vegetables (as well as seafood) in its cuisine. [[Umami|Savory]] pies are popular, mixing greens and [[artichoke]]s along with cheeses, milk curds, and eggs. [[Onion]]s and [[olive oil]] are used. Because of a lack of land suitable for wheat, the Ligurians use [[chickpea]]s in ''[[farinata]]'' and polenta-like ''[[panissa]]''. The former is served plain or topped with onions, [[artichoke]]s, sausage, cheese or young anchovies.<ref name=\"Piras, 167, 177\">Piras, 167, 177.</ref>\n\nHilly districts use [[chestnut]]s as a source of carbohydrates.

Rice dishes are very popular in this region, often found in soups as well as ''[[risotto]]''. The best-known version is ''risotto alla milanese'', flavoured with saffron. Due to the characteristic yellow colour that it is produced, it is often called ''risotto giallo''. The dish is sometimes served with ''[[ossobuco]]'' (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lacucinaitaliana.it/ricetta/piatti-unici/ossobuco-e-risotto-piatto-unico-di-milano/#step-1|title=Ricetta Ossobuco e risotto, piatto unico di Milano|website=Le ricette de La Cucina Italiana|language=Italian|trans-title=Recipe for ossobuco and risotto, one-course meal dish of Milano|date=|author=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther regional specialities include ''[[cotoletta alla milanese]]'' (a fried [[breaded cutlet]] of veal similar to [[Wiener schnitzel]], but cooked \"bone-in\"), ''[[cassoeula]]'' (a typically winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), ''[[Mostarda]]'' (rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup), [[Valtellina]]'s [[bresaola|''bresaola'']] (air-dried salted beef), [[pizzoccheri|''pizzoccheri'']] (a flat ribbon pasta made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes, and layered with pieces of [[Valtellina Casera]] cheese), and ''tortelli di zucca'' (''[[ravioli]]'' with pumpkin filling, usually garnished with melted butter and sage).<ref name=\"Piras, 87\">Piras, 87.</ref>\n\nRegional cheeses include [[Grana Padano]], [[Gorgonzola cheese|Gorgonzola]], [[Crescenza]], [[Robiola]], and [[Taleggio (cheese)|Taleggio]] (the [[Po Valley|plains of central and southern Lombardy]] allow intensive cattle farming). ''[[Polenta]]'' is common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous ''[[panettone]]'' (soft sweet bread with [[Raisin|raisins]] and [[Candied fruit|candied citron and orange chunks]]).\n\n=== Marche ===\nOn the coast of [[Marche]], fish and seafood are produced. Inland, wild and domestic pigs are used for sausages and [[ham]]s. These hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks. [[Suckling pig]], [[chicken]], and [[fish]] are often stuffed with [[rosemary]] or [[fennel]] fronds and [[garlic]] before being roasted or placed on the spit.<ref>Piras, 273</ref>\n\nAscoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for ''olive all'ascolana'', (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg, and Parmesan, then fried).<ref name=\"GURI\">[http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/10061dl.htm] Provvedimento 15 febbraio 2006: Iscrizione della denominazione \u00abOliva Ascolana del Piceno\u00bb nel registro delle denominazioni di origine protette e delle indicazioni geografiche protette, ''GURI n. 46''</ref> Another well-known Marche product are the ''[[:it:Maccheroncini di Campofilone|Maccheroncini di Campofilone]]'', from little town of [[Campofilone]], a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in one's mouth.\n\n=== Piedmont ===\n[[File:Agnolotti.JPG|thumb|left|Traditional Piedmontese ''[[agnolotti]]'']]\n\nBetween the Alps and the [[Po valley]], featuring a large number of different ecosystems, the Piedmont region offers the most refined and varied cuisine of the Italian peninsula. As a point of union between traditional Italian and French cuisine, [[Piedmont]] is the Italian region with the largest number of cheeses with [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected geographical status]] and wines under [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]].

Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. ''Ribollita'' was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover ''[[minestrone]]'' or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, [[Chard|silverbeet]], ''[[cavolo nero]]'' (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as ''[[pici]]'' resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional [[Florentine steak]], come from the [[Chianina]] cattle breed of the [[Chiana Valley]] and the [[Maremmana]] from [[Maremma]].\n\nPork is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221\u2013239.</ref> The region is well-known also for its rich [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[wild boar]], [[European hare|hare]], [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[pheasant]] that often are used to prepare ''[[pappardelle]]'' dishes.

It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include [[Boletus edulis|porcini]], [[rapini]], or other vegetables or meats, such as small [[song-bird]]s in the case of the [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] dish ''polenta e osei'', or [[sausage]]s.

Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast.

The ''primo'' (first course) is usually a filling dish such as risotto or pasta, with sauces made from meat, vegetables, or seafood. Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (''piatto unico'') combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving.\n[[File:Prosecco-gold-arrangement-1.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of sparkling [[Prosecco]], which one would have as an ''aperitivo'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Meal stage\n!Composition\n|-\n|Aperitivo\n|[[ap\u00e9ritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal, may be: [[Campari]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Cinzano]], [[Amaro Lucano|Lucano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz (alcoholic beverage)|Spritz]], [[Vermouth]], [[Negroni]].\n|-\n|Antipasto\n|literally \"before (the) meal\", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread [[appetizer]]s.\n|-\n|Primo\n|\"first course\", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|sugo]] or [[rag\u00f9]] as a sauce\n|-\n|Secondo\n|\"second course\", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes.

Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern [[espresso machine]], invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to {{convert|90|to|95|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25\u201330 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 [[Fluid ounce|fl oz]], two tablespoons) of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. [[Neapolitan flip coffee pot|''La Napoletana'']] is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The [[Moka pot|''Moka per il caff\u00e8'']] is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>\n\nEspresso is usually served in a [[demitasse]] cup. [[Caff\u00e8 macchiato]] is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; [[caffelatte]] is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf\u00e9 au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and [[caff\u00e8 corretto]] is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as [[grappa]] or [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[bicerin]] is also an Italian coffee, from [[Turin]]. It is a mixture of [[cappuccino]] and traditional [[hot chocolate]], as it consists of a mix of coffee and [[drinking chocolate]], and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n\n==== Wine ====\n{{Main|Italian wine}}\n[[File:\"15 - ITALY - DOCG and DOC wine mark.jpg|thumb|[[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG and DOC]] labels on two wine bottles]]\n[[File:Fiasco di vino rosso da tavola Monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|Tuscan Chianti in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'']]\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref> There are twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]]. To promote this, the Italian government passed the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]] e garantita'' (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.<ref>Koplan, 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise.\n\n==== Beer ====\n{{Main|Beer in Italy}}\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually [[pale lager]]. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] and [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]]. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and [[South Tyrol]] (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\n==== Other ====\n[[File:Homemade limoncello.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.3|A bottle of homemade [[Limoncello]]]]\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. [[Limoncello]], a traditional lemon liqueur from Sicily and Southern Italy ([[Sorrento]], [[Amalfi]] and the [[Gulf of Naples]]) is the second most popular liqueur in Italy after Campari.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.luxuryretreats.com/everything-need-know-drinking-limoncello-italy/|title=Drinking Limoncello in Italy|date=8 December 2017|website=Luxury Retreats Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref> Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, served chilled in small glasses or cups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Amaro Averna|Amaro Sicilianos]] are common Sicilian digestifs, made with herbs, which are usually drunk after heavy meals. [[Mirto (liqueur)|Mirto]], an herbal distillate made from the berries (red mirto) and leaves (white mirto) of the myrtle bush, is popular in [[Sardinia]] and other regions. Another well-known digestif is [[Amaro Lucano]] from [[Basilicata]].<ref>Piras, 383.</ref>\n\n[[Grappa]] is the typical alcoholic drink of northern Italy, generally associated with the culture of the [[Alps]] and of the [[Po Valley]]. The most famous grappas are distilled in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Veneto]], [[Piedmont]], and [[Trentino]]. The three most notable and recognizable Italian aperitifs are [[Martini & Rossi|Martini]], [[Vermouth]], and [[Campari]]. A sparkling drink which is becoming internationally popular as a less expensive substitute for [[Champagne (wine)|French champagne]] is [[prosecco]], from the Veneto region.<ref name=\"Atkin\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/11/foodanddrink1|title=The fizz that's the bizz|last=Atkin|first=Tim, ''The Observer'' |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2008|location=London|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name=\"Dane\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/print/story/10272259.html|title=Pop the Cork on Prosecco|last=Dane|first=Ana, ''TheStreet.com'' |date=3 July 2006 |accessdate=29 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Desserts ==\n{{Main|List of Italian desserts}}\n{{See also|List of Italian dishes#Desserts and pastry|l1=List of Italian dishes\u2014Desserts and pastry}}\n{{See also|Sicilian cuisine#Desserts and sweets|l1=Sicilian cuisine\u2014Desserts and sweets}}\nFrom the Italian perspective, cookies and [[candy]] belong to the same category of sweets.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Tim H. |title=Sweets: A History of Candy |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |year=2002 |isbn=1-58234-229-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 364\u2013365] |url=https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 }}</ref> Traditional candies include [[candied fruit]]s, [[torrone]], and [[nut brittle]]s, all of which are still popular in the modern era.

A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, [[boiled egg]]s, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the [[Colomba Pasquale]] (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with [[almond]]s and [[pearl sugar]].\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed with the ''cena di magro'' (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]].\n\n== Abroad ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nDue to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], and [[Somalia]] (except the [[British Somaliland|northern part]], which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\n==== Libya ====\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of [[pasta]] on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\n==== South Africa ====\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of [[Italian South Africans|Italians]]. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in [[South Africa]], especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== France ====\n\nIn France, the [[cuisine of Corsica]] has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the [[Early Middle Ages]] until 1768 first of a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] and then a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the ''[[charcuterie]]''.\n\n==== Great Britain ====\n\n[[Pizza]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[spaghetti bolognese]] and [[lasagne]] with bolognese ''[[rag\u00f9]]'' and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] are the most popular forms of Italian food in [[British cuisine|British]], notably, [[English cuisine|English]], cuisine.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on [[Slovenian cuisine]]. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and part of [[Inner Carniola]]) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous [[Istrian Italians|Italian minority]] live in [[Slovenian Istria]].\n\nDishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] include the ''gubana'' [[nut roll]] of [[Friuli]] (known as ''guban'ca'' or ''potica'' in Slovenia) and the ''[[Istrian Stew|jota]]'' stew.\n\nDishes that come directly from Italian cuisine include [[gnocchi]] and some types of pasta; [[minestrone]] (''mine\u0161tra'' in Slovene); [[frittata]] (''[[fritaja|frtalja]]''); [[Prosciutto]] (''pr\u0161ut''); and [[polenta]].\n\n=== North and Central America ===\n\n==== Canada and the USA ====\n{{Main|Italian-American cuisine}}\n[[File:Supreme pizza.jpg|thumb|An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers]]\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily [[American cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most [[pizza]] eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a [[breaded cutlet|breaded, pan-fried cutlet]] of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Milanesa napolitana con papas fritas rodajas de tomate y or\u00e9gano.jpg|thumb|\"[[Milanesa]] a la napolitana\" with [[French fries]], an Italian-inspired dish based on the original ''cotoletta'' dish from Milan, common in [[South America]]. This dish is called \"parmegiana steak\" in [[Brazil]], though it is not typical from [[Parma]] region in [[Italy]] but was actually invented in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\n==== Argentina ====\nDue to large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration to Argentina]], Italian food and drink is heavily featured in [[Argentine cuisine]]. An example could be ''[[milanesa]]s'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta]] alla milanese from [[Milan]], Italy) or [[breaded cutlet]]s. [[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as ''[[Sorrentino]]s'' and Argentine gnocchi.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the [[Italian Brazilians|huge Italian community]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including [[milanesa]] steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of [[pizza]], different from both [[Neapolitan cuisine|Neapolitan]] and [[Italian-American cuisine|American]] varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical [[botequim]] counter snack.\n\n==== Venezuela ====\nThere is considerable Italian influence in [[Venezuelan cuisine]]. ''Pan chabata'', or Venezuelan ciabatta, ''Pan Siciliano'', Sicilian bread, ''Cannoli siciliani'', Sicilian cannoli, and the drink [[chinotto (Venezuelan soft drink)|chinotto]] are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Italy|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'', an Italian cookbook\n* ''[[Il talismano della felicit\u00e0]]'' by Ada Boni, an Italian cookbook\n* [[Italian food products]]\n* [[List of Italian cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian DOP cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian dishes]]\n** [[List of Italian soups]]\n* [[List of Italian restaurants]]\n* [[Sammarinese cuisine]]\n* [[Italian meal structure]]\n* [[Italian wine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Capatti, Alberto and Montanari, Massimo.

As a fact, it suffices to say that Basque remained on the margin of the school, where even its use became forbidden.\n\nAmong the initiatives that emerged in the 20th century to deal with the risk of the disappearance of Basque are the creation of the [[Society of Basque Studies]] and the [[Euskaltzaindia|Royal Academy of the Basque Language]] (Euskaltzaindia) in 1919 and the creation of [[Ikastola]]s (schools in Basque), initially in the 1930s and later in the 1960s.\n\n==== Background: creation of the unified Basque language in 1968 ====\nBasque, which has 7 main dialects, did not have a standard model of writing until 1968, when Euskaltzaindia laid the foundations of the unified Basque (in Basque ''batua''). Historically, apart from specific and brief exceptions, until then there had never been any training in Basque at university level and in 1972 it was still impossible to study any university degree or even any subject in Basque.\n\n==== Creation of the UEU in 1973 ====\nIn this context, the history of the UEU began in the Basque Weeks organised in [[Bayonne]] during the years 1970\u20131972. Seeing the success of these days and the discourse given by the mathematician Carlos Santamar\u00eda Ansa on the need to create a Basque University, the Euskaldunen Biltzarra, Ikas and Fededunak associations decided to organise summer courses in 1973 with the support of Euskaltzaindia. Similar initiatives that already existed for [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] served as antecedents and references; for example, the Universitat Catalana d'Estiu had been in operation since 1968. [[Joxe Azurmendi]] was one of the founders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50058090.html|title=LC Linked Data Service: Authorities and Vocabularies (Library of Congress)|last=Congress|first=The Library of|website=id.loc.gov|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first two editions of the UEU (1973 and 1974) were held in [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz|St. Jean de Luz]] and the next two (1975 and 1976) in [[Ustaritz]].\n\n==== Summer courses in Pamplona (1977\u20131999) ====\nIn 1977 the summer courses of the UEU moved to [[Pamplona]], becoming year after year the meeting point that allowed the training of teachers and the creation of materials that were incorporated in the offer of new subjects of the official universities. Over the years, it offered between 40 and 50 summer courses each year. For example, in 1995 it offered 45 courses distributed in 26 departments; in total there were 750 teaching hours, in classes, practices, seminars and outings, with more than 650 participants. Annually, UEU published an average of 10 books. The number of teachers and students who worked in Basque at university level in that year would not exceed 4,000 people, and of all of them more than 650 participated in the UEU, this being proof of the success and contribution of these courses, in spite of the limited economic resources it had.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bertan.gipuzkoakultura.net/24/ing/16.php|title=Bertan 24 \u2013 The basque language Chapter 15: Consolidation of the basque language|website=bertan.gipuzkoakultura.net|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Present situation ====\nSince 1999 these university level courses began to develop not only in summer and in Pamplona, but also throughout the year and in multiple locations. After almost 50 years, thanks to this social process promoted and led by the UEU, it has been possible to take some significant steps in the inclusion of Basque in the university. For example, in 2019 almost all university degrees can also be studied in Basque at one of the universities in the Basque Country; more than 400 books have been published in Basque on 27 university disciplines; congresses are regularly organised in Basque for professionals and academics... The UEU collaborates and offers university courses with the other universities in the Basque Country: the University of the Basque Country, the University of Mondrag\u00f3n, the University of Deusto, the Public University of Navarra, and the University of Pau and Pays de l'Adur.\n\nThe UEU is currently headquartered in the Markeskua Palace (Eibar) and has 1,200 members. It organises training in Basque at university level in different formats: postgraduate courses, specialised courses, seminars, professional congresses (e.g. Computer Science congresses, Informatikari Euskaldunen Bilkurak), training aimed at teachers and professionals, summer courses and research projects related to the above (master...); it also offers postgraduate studies.a m\n\nThe UEU offers studies in the Basque Autonomous Community, in Navarre and in the French Basque Country, with the UEU's objective being to promote a quality Basque-speaking university throughout the territory where Basque language is used.  According to this approach, achieving a university that works in Basque would be a fundamental element so that the forecast made by Humboldt is not fulfilled and Basque continues for many years in the list of living languages. Furthermore, the experience gained with Basque could be a reference for the preservation of other minority languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unibertsitatea.net/basque-speaking-university-community|title=Basque-speaking university community \u2013 Unibertsitatea.Net|website=unibertsitatea.net|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Rectors of the UEU have been the following: Manex Goihenetxe (1973\u20131976), Martin Orbe (1976\u20131983), Baleren Bakaikoa (1983\u20131987), Inaki Irazabalbeitia (1987\u20131991), Kepa Altonaga (1991\u20131996), Mikel Aizpuru (1996\u20132000), Xabier Isasi (2000\u20132004), Aitzpea Leizaola (2004\u20132005), Lore Erriondo (2005\u20132010), Karmele Artetxe (2010\u20132014), I\u00f1aki Alegr\u00eda (2014\u20132018) eta Kepa Sarasola (2018\u2013).\n\n== Publications ==\nThe UEU published its first book in 1977, since then until 2018 it has published 419, more or less 10 books per year. In the field of book publishing, since its inception the UEU has pursued two objectives: on the one hand, to create a bibliographic infrastructure at university level, and on the other, to refine the [[terminology]] and [[syntax]] in [[Basque language|Basque]]. The electronic version of most of the more than 400 books published by the UEU are publicly accessible in its digital library ''Buruxkak''.\n\nIn addition to books, since 2003 it also publishes academic journals. In 2018 there were four journals: ''Uztaro'', about social sciences and created in 1990; ''Aldiri, Arkitektura eta abar'', about architecture and created in 2009; ''Osagaiz'', about health sciences and created in 2017; and finally ''Kondaira'', about history created in 2003.\n\n== Postgraduate degrees and own degrees ==\nBeginning in 2001 and in collaboration with the University of the Basque Country, the UEU has taught 14 own degrees or postgraduates, of which more than 240 students have graduated.  For example in 2018, two courses were given; one on \"Translation and technology\" and the other on \"the use of new technologies in education\".\n\n== Training courses ==\nSince its creation in 1973, the UEU has delivered more than 1,900 training courses at university level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inguma.eus/bilatu/bilaketa-aurreratua?egilea=&izenburua=&produktu_mota=&shu=&urtea=&erakundea=UEU&fakultatea=&ueu_saila=&Bilatu=Bilatu&mota=course&page=1&hizkuntza=en|title=Courses given by the Basque Summer University.

Historically, apart from specific and brief exceptions, until then there had never been any training in Basque at university level and in 1972 it was still impossible to study any university degree or even any subject in Basque.\n\n==== Creation of the UEU in 1973 ====\nIn this context, the history of the UEU began in the Basque Weeks organised in [[Bayonne]] during the years 1970\u20131972. Seeing the success of these days and the discourse given by the mathematician Carlos Santamar\u00eda Ansa on the need to create a Basque University, the Euskaldunen Biltzarra, Ikas and Fededunak associations decided to organise summer courses in 1973 with the support of Euskaltzaindia. Similar initiatives that already existed for [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] served as antecedents and references; for example, the Universitat Catalana d'Estiu had been in operation since 1968. [[Joxe Azurmendi]] was one of the founders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50058090.html|title=LC Linked Data Service: Authorities and Vocabularies (Library of Congress)|last=Congress|first=The Library of|website=id.loc.gov|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first two editions of the UEU (1973 and 1974) were held in [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz|St. Jean de Luz]] and the next two (1975 and 1976) in [[Ustaritz]].\n\n==== Summer courses in Pamplona (1977\u20131999) ====\nIn 1977 the summer courses of the UEU moved to [[Pamplona]], becoming year after year the meeting point that allowed the training of teachers and the creation of materials that were incorporated in the offer of new subjects of the official universities. Over the years, it offered between 40 and 50 summer courses each year. For example, in 1995 it offered 45 courses distributed in 26 departments; in total there were 750 teaching hours, in classes, practices, seminars and outings, with more than 650 participants. Annually, UEU published an average of 10 books. The number of teachers and students who worked in Basque at university level in that year would not exceed 4,000 people, and of all of them more than 650 participated in the UEU, this being proof of the success and contribution of these courses, in spite of the limited economic resources it had.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bertan.gipuzkoakultura.net/24/ing/16.php|title=Bertan 24 \u2013 The basque language Chapter 15: Consolidation of the basque language|website=bertan.gipuzkoakultura.net|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Present situation ====\nSince 1999 these university level courses began to develop not only in summer and in Pamplona, but also throughout the year and in multiple locations. After almost 50 years, thanks to this social process promoted and led by the UEU, it has been possible to take some significant steps in the inclusion of Basque in the university. For example, in 2019 almost all university degrees can also be studied in Basque at one of the universities in the Basque Country; more than 400 books have been published in Basque on 27 university disciplines; congresses are regularly organised in Basque for professionals and academics... The UEU collaborates and offers university courses with the other universities in the Basque Country: the University of the Basque Country, the University of Mondrag\u00f3n, the University of Deusto, the Public University of Navarra, and the University of Pau and Pays de l'Adur.\n\nThe UEU is currently headquartered in the Markeskua Palace (Eibar) and has 1,200 members. It organises training in Basque at university level in different formats: postgraduate courses, specialised courses, seminars, professional congresses (e.g. Computer Science congresses, Informatikari Euskaldunen Bilkurak), training aimed at teachers and professionals, summer courses and research projects related to the above (master...); it also offers postgraduate studies.a m\n\nThe UEU offers studies in the Basque Autonomous Community, in Navarre and in the French Basque Country, with the UEU's objective being to promote a quality Basque-speaking university throughout the territory where Basque language is used.  According to this approach, achieving a university that works in Basque would be a fundamental element so that the forecast made by Humboldt is not fulfilled and Basque continues for many years in the list of living languages. Furthermore, the experience gained with Basque could be a reference for the preservation of other minority languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unibertsitatea.net/basque-speaking-university-community|title=Basque-speaking university community \u2013 Unibertsitatea.Net|website=unibertsitatea.net|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Rectors of the UEU have been the following: Manex Goihenetxe (1973\u20131976), Martin Orbe (1976\u20131983), Baleren Bakaikoa (1983\u20131987), Inaki Irazabalbeitia (1987\u20131991), Kepa Altonaga (1991\u20131996), Mikel Aizpuru (1996\u20132000), Xabier Isasi (2000\u20132004), Aitzpea Leizaola (2004\u20132005), Lore Erriondo (2005\u20132010), Karmele Artetxe (2010\u20132014), I\u00f1aki Alegr\u00eda (2014\u20132018) eta Kepa Sarasola (2018\u2013).\n\n== Publications ==\nThe UEU published its first book in 1977, since then until 2018 it has published 419, more or less 10 books per year. In the field of book publishing, since its inception the UEU has pursued two objectives: on the one hand, to create a bibliographic infrastructure at university level, and on the other, to refine the [[terminology]] and [[syntax]] in [[Basque language|Basque]]. The electronic version of most of the more than 400 books published by the UEU are publicly accessible in its digital library ''Buruxkak''.\n\nIn addition to books, since 2003 it also publishes academic journals. In 2018 there were four journals: ''Uztaro'', about social sciences and created in 1990; ''Aldiri, Arkitektura eta abar'', about architecture and created in 2009; ''Osagaiz'', about health sciences and created in 2017; and finally ''Kondaira'', about history created in 2003.\n== Postgraduate degrees and own degrees ==\nBeginning in 2001 and in collaboration with the University of the Basque Country, the UEU has taught 14 own degrees or postgraduates, of which more than 240 students have graduated.  For example in 2018, two courses were given; one on \"Translation and technology\" and the other on \"the use of new technologies in education\".\n\n== Training courses ==\nSince its creation in 1973, the UEU has delivered more than 1,900 training courses at university level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inguma.eus/bilatu/bilaketa-aurreratua?egilea=&izenburua=&produktu_mota=&shu=&urtea=&erakundea=UEU&fakultatea=&ueu_saila=&Bilatu=Bilatu&mota=course&page=1&hizkuntza=en|title=Courses given by the Basque Summer University.

The institution's campus was inaugurated in October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.elpais.com/gastronotas-de-capel/2011/09/-basque-culinary-center.html |title=Basque Culinary Center |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=July 2015 |publisher=El Pa\u00eds}}</ref>\n\n==Organization and structure==\n\n=== The Board ===\nThe Board of the Basque Culinary Center foundation is made up of the chefs who played an active role in launching the initiative and continue to be closely linked to the project (among them [[Juan Mari Arzak]], [[Martin Berasategui]], Pedro Subijana, [[Karlos Argui\u00f1ano]], Andoni Luis Aduriz, Hilario Arbelaitz and Eneko Atxa); institutions in the knowledge sector, [[Mondragon University]] and the AZTI-Tecnalia technology centre; public bodies including the [[Basque Government]], the Provincial Council of [[Gipuzkoa]] and the City Council of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]]; and leading companies in the food and drinks industry: [[Fagor]], [[Eroski]], Martiko, [[Heineken]], Covap, [[Pernod Ricard]]-Domecq Bodegas and [[Rioja (wine)|D.O. La Rioja]].\n\n=== The International Advisory Committee ===\nThe Basque Culinary Center foundation also has an International Advisory Committee, chaired by [[Ferran Adri\u00e0]] and made up of some prominent international chefs. Among them are Yukio Hattori (Japan), [[Massimo Bottura]] (Italy), [[Michel Bras]] (France), [[Dan Barber]] (United States), [[Gast\u00f3n Acurio]] (Peru), [[Alex Atala]] (Brazil), [[Heston Blumenthal]] (United Kingdom) and [[Ren\u00e9 Redzepi]] (Denmark). The purpose of this body is to advise the board of the Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences and the Research and Innovation Centre on strategic matters, and to raise the international profile of the Basque Culinary Center.\n\nThis group of top chefs met in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in July 2010, to set up the International Advisory Committee. There they held their first work day to discuss key issues for the international gastronomic sector and culinary training for the professionals of the 21st century. In September 2011 the Committee held its second meeting in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. This produced a body of work and reflections set down in the document \u201cOpen Letter to the Chefs of the Future\u201d. A year later, the chefs held their third meeting in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], where they assessed the progress of modern cooking, the interdisciplinary nature of the chef\u2019s profession and the use of information technology. The committee has held further annual meetings in [[New York City]], [[United States]] (2013), [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]] (2014), San Sebasti\u00e1n (2015 and 2016), and [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] (2017).\n\n== Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences ==\nThe Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences of the Basque Culinary Center is a part of [[Mondragon University]], which in itself represented a milestone: the inclusion of culinary training in a university setting. Prior to the launch of this project, there was no official university-level training in the gastronomy sector on offer in [[Spain]], and the only precedent in Europe was the [[University of Gastronomic Sciences]] in [[Italy]]. After the establishment of the Basque Culinary Center, other universities in Spain, namely the [[University of Barcelona]] and the [[University of Valencia]], included official degrees on gastronomy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epoca1.valenciaplaza.com/ver/124924/mondragon-y-cett-las-referencias-vasca-y-catalana-para-el-grado-en-gastronomia-de-valencia.html |title=Mondrag\u00f3n y CETT: las referencias vasca y catalana para el grado en Gastronom\u00eda de Valencia |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=8 October 2015 |publisher=CulturPlaza.com}}</ref>\n\nThe faculty offers a Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts, postgraduate programmes, and different programmes for professionals and gastronomy enthusiasts.\n\nAs of 2015, 50% of the faculty's students are international, 25% in the case of the university degree.<ref name=\"Expansi\u00f3n\">{{cite web|url=http://fueradeserie.expansion.com/2015/04/08/gastroteca/1428500121.html |title=Licenciados para cocinar |date=10 April 2015 |accessdate=July 2015 |publisher=Expansi\u00f3n}}</ref>\n\n=== Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts ===\nThe Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts is an official four-year university degree, adapted to the [[European Higher Education Area]].\n\nThe degree is based on five broad areas of knowledge, with the aim of guaranteeing an up-to-date training for professionals in the sector: Cooking, Service, Management, Science and Culture. The Basque Culinary Center\u2019s Gastronomy and Culinary Arts degree programme aims to assure a comprehensive training for professionals in the gastronomic sector so that, in the future, they are able to work in areas like the kitchen and the dining room, but also in industry, research or business management. Right from the first year, students combine theory and practice in the kitchen, dining room and management areas.\n\nThe first promotion of 59 students graduated in July 2015.<ref name=\"Expansi\u00f3n\"/>\n\n=== Postgraduate programmes ===\nIn addition to the Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts, the Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences at the Basque Culinary Center also offers postgraduate programmes which differentiate between kitchen specialists and those from other sectors who aim to specialise in the field of gastronomy. These include:\n\n*''Master's Degree in Gastronomic Sciences''\n*''Master's Degree in Food Tourism''\n*''Master's Degree in Sommelier Studies and Enomarketing''\n*''Master's Degree in Advanced Cookery''\n*''Master's Degree in Restaurant Innovation and Management''\n*''Master's Degree in Restaurant Pastry and Sweet Cuisine''\n*''Master's Degree in Cooking: Technique, Product and Creativity''\n*''Specialisation Course in Bartender Expertise and Modern Cocktail Preparation''\n*''Specialisation Course in Creation of Avant-Garde Desserts, Snacks and Sweet Tapas''\n*''Specialisation Course in Perfecting Culinary Techniques''\n*''Specialisation Course in Avant-Garde Culinary Techniques''\n\nOther courses for continuous training are offered to professionals.\n\n=== Programmes for gastronomy enthusiasts ===\nIn addition to the training programmes for professionals, the Basque Culinary Center offers a range of courses for gastronomy enthusiasts.\n\nThe centre carries on these activities through the BCulinary Club, set up as a space for gastronomy enthusiasts, featuring talks, courses, cookery classes and recipes.\n\nFurthermore, the Basque Culinary Center organises BCulinary Udan, a summer gastronomy camp for teenagers aged from 14 to 17.\n\n== Food and Gastronomy Research and Innovation Centre ==\nAlongside the Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences, the Basque Culinary Center has the Food and Gastronomy Research and Innovation Centre.\n\nIts purpose is to generate new scientific knowledge and innovative products in the culinary sphere, including food, hotels and gastronomy. This means that the areas of knowledge involved in the sector can be expanded with new knowledge which can generate new products, new services and new businesses. Experimentation and research goes on at this centre using a multidisciplinary approach with the aim of achieving advances in the following areas, among others:\n\n*''Research, Development and Innovation (RDI)'': The research work done at this Centre aims to give greater added value to current products and services, in order to foster their differentiation on the market and encourage the creation of new businesses, products and services in the areas of food, HORECA, healthcare, healthy nutrition, social innovation in ageing and tourism, among others.\n*''Quality'': Regaining the concept of gastronomy, a sense of pleasure and the importance of quality labels are declared priorities for this Centre, as is the need to raise awareness in the culinary sector and in society in general of the importance of quality and authenticity. These ideas aim to improve performance in the sector and encourage more sophisticated, demanding customers. This line of work in raising awareness among the population also aims to improve results in terms of preventing health risks.\n*''Synergies and cooperation'': The existence of a specific centre linked to gastronomy intends to generate synergies and new areas of cooperation with other technology centres, especially Azti-Tecnalia and CSIC, the [[Spanish National Research Council]], and European centres and universities, as well as with companies in the sector. In practice, new areas of research and work emerge, so that technology transfer can enrich projects.\n\n==Cafeteria==\n\nThe centre has a cafeteria, which in practice functions as the training workshop for students on the Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts, where they can put what they learn in class into practice with real customers, in both the kitchen and the dining room. This cafeteria is open to the public and serves two meals per day.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://bculinary.com/en/home Official site]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/bculinary Facebook]\n* [http://www.diariovasco.com/v/20101119/al-dia-local/bendecida-estrellas-20101119.html Bendecida por las estrellas]\n\n{{coord missing|Spain}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Gastronomical societies|Basque Culinary Centre]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2009]]\n[[Category:Education in the Basque Country]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Spain]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:San Sebastian 06 2012 Basque Culinary Center 2573.JPG|thumb|320px|Basque Culinary Center campus in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]].]]\nThe '''Basque Culinary Center''', based in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]], in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] region of [[Spain]], is a culinary foundation created in 2009 by [[Mondragon University]] and a group of prominent [[Basque cuisine|Basque chefs]] as a training, research and innovation project, aimed at developing the culinary sector, with the idea of relating cooking with management, science and other disciplines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariovasco.com/20090324/al-dia-local/universidad-cocina-funcionara-partir-20090324.html |title=La 'universidad de la cocina' funcionar\u00e1 a partir de 2011 y tendr\u00e1 su sede en Miram\u00f3n |date=24 March 2015 |accessdate=July 2015 |publisher=El Diario Vasco}}</ref>\n\nThe Basque Culinary Center consists of two lines of work: the Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences within [[Mondragon University]], the first to offer official university-level training in the gastronomy sector in [[Spain]], and a Research and Innovation Centre in the field of Food and Gastronomy. The institution's campus was inaugurated in October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.elpais.com/gastronotas-de-capel/2011/09/-basque-culinary-center.html |title=Basque Culinary Center |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=July 2015 |publisher=El Pa\u00eds}}</ref>\n\n==Organization and structure==\n\n=== The Board ===\nThe Board of the Basque Culinary Center foundation is made up of the chefs who played an active role in launching the initiative and continue to be closely linked to the project (among them [[Juan Mari Arzak]], [[Martin Berasategui]], Pedro Subijana, [[Karlos Argui\u00f1ano]], Andoni Luis Aduriz, Hilario Arbelaitz and Eneko Atxa); institutions in the knowledge sector, [[Mondragon University]] and the AZTI-Tecnalia technology centre; public bodies including the [[Basque Government]], the Provincial Council of [[Gipuzkoa]] and the City Council of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]]; and leading companies in the food and drinks industry: [[Fagor]], [[Eroski]], Martiko, [[Heineken]], Covap, [[Pernod Ricard]]-Domecq Bodegas and [[Rioja (wine)|D.O. La Rioja]].\n\n=== The International Advisory Committee ===\nThe Basque Culinary Center foundation also has an International Advisory Committee, chaired by [[Ferran Adri\u00e0]] and made up of some prominent international chefs. Among them are Yukio Hattori (Japan), [[Massimo Bottura]] (Italy), [[Michel Bras]] (France), [[Dan Barber]] (United States), [[Gast\u00f3n Acurio]] (Peru), [[Alex Atala]] (Brazil), [[Heston Blumenthal]] (United Kingdom) and [[Ren\u00e9 Redzepi]] (Denmark). The purpose of this body is to advise the board of the Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences and the Research and Innovation Centre on strategic matters, and to raise the international profile of the Basque Culinary Center.\n\nThis group of top chefs met in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in July 2010, to set up the International Advisory Committee. There they held their first work day to discuss key issues for the international gastronomic sector and culinary training for the professionals of the 21st century. In September 2011 the Committee held its second meeting in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. This produced a body of work and reflections set down in the document \u201cOpen Letter to the Chefs of the Future\u201d. A year later, the chefs held their third meeting in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], where they assessed the progress of modern cooking, the interdisciplinary nature of the chef\u2019s profession and the use of information technology. The committee has held further annual meetings in [[New York City]], [[United States]] (2013), [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]] (2014), San Sebasti\u00e1n (2015 and 2016), and [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] (2017).\n\n== Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences ==\nThe Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences of the Basque Culinary Center is a part of [[Mondragon University]], which in itself represented a milestone: the inclusion of culinary training in a university setting. Prior to the launch of this project, there was no official university-level training in the gastronomy sector on offer in [[Spain]], and the only precedent in Europe was the [[University of Gastronomic Sciences]] in [[Italy]]. After the establishment of the Basque Culinary Center, other universities in Spain, namely the [[University of Barcelona]] and the [[University of Valencia]], included official degrees on gastronomy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epoca1.valenciaplaza.com/ver/124924/mondragon-y-cett-las-referencias-vasca-y-catalana-para-el-grado-en-gastronomia-de-valencia.html |title=Mondrag\u00f3n y CETT: las referencias vasca y catalana para el grado en Gastronom\u00eda de Valencia |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=8 October 2015 |publisher=CulturPlaza.com}}</ref>\n\nThe faculty offers a Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts, postgraduate programmes, and different programmes for professionals and gastronomy enthusiasts.\n\nAs of 2015, 50% of the faculty's students are international, 25% in the case of the university degree.<ref name=\"Expansi\u00f3n\">{{cite web|url=http://fueradeserie.expansion.com/2015/04/08/gastroteca/1428500121.html |title=Licenciados para cocinar |date=10 April 2015 |accessdate=July 2015 |publisher=Expansi\u00f3n}}</ref>\n\n=== Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts ===\nThe Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts is an official four-year university degree, adapted to the [[European Higher Education Area]].\n\nThe degree is based on five broad areas of knowledge, with the aim of guaranteeing an up-to-date training for professionals in the sector: Cooking, Service, Management, Science and Culture. The Basque Culinary Center\u2019s Gastronomy and Culinary Arts degree programme aims to assure a comprehensive training for professionals in the gastronomic sector so that, in the future, they are able to work in areas like the kitchen and the dining room, but also in industry, research or business management. Right from the first year, students combine theory and practice in the kitchen, dining room and management areas.\n\nThe first promotion of 59 students graduated in July 2015.<ref name=\"Expansi\u00f3n\"/>\n\n=== Postgraduate programmes ===\nIn addition to the Degree in Gastronomy and Culinary Arts, the Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences at the Basque Culinary Center also offers postgraduate programmes which differentiate between kitchen specialists and those from other sectors who aim to specialise in the field of gastronomy. These include:\n\n*''Master's Degree in Gastronomic Sciences''\n*''Master's Degree in Food Tourism''\n*''Master's Degree in Sommelier Studies and Enomarketing''\n*''Master's Degree in Advanced Cookery''\n*''Master's Degree in Restaurant Innovation and Management''\n*''Master's Degree in Restaurant Pastry and Sweet Cuisine''\n*''Master's Degree in Cooking: Technique, Product and Creativity''\n*''Specialisation Course in Bartender Expertise and Modern Cocktail Preparation''\n*''Specialisation Course in Creation of Avant-Garde Desserts, Snacks and Sweet Tapas''\n*''Specialisation Course in Perfecting Culinary Techniques''\n*''Specialisation Course in Avant-Garde Culinary Techniques''\n\nOther courses for continuous training are offered to professionals.\n\n=== Programmes for gastronomy enthusiasts ===\nIn addition to the training programmes for professionals, the Basque Culinary Center offers a range of courses for gastronomy enthusiasts.\n\nThe centre carries on these activities through the BCulinary Club, set up as a space for gastronomy enthusiasts, featuring talks, courses, cookery classes and recipes.\n\nFurthermore, the Basque Culinary Center organises BCulinary Udan, a summer gastronomy camp for teenagers aged from 14 to 17.\n\n== Food and Gastronomy Research and Innovation Centre ==\nAlongside the Faculty of Gastronomic Sciences, the Basque Culinary Center has the Food and Gastronomy Research and Innovation Centre.\n\nIts purpose is to generate new scientific knowledge and innovative products in the culinary sphere, including food, hotels and gastronomy. This means that the areas of knowledge involved in the sector can be expanded with new knowledge which can generate new products, new services and new businesses. Experimentation and research goes on at this centre using a multidisciplinary approach with the aim of achieving advances in the following areas, among others:\n\n*''Research, Development and Innovation (RDI)'': The research work done at this Centre aims to give greater added value to current products and services, in order to foster their differentiation on the market and encourage the creation of new businesses, products and services in the areas of food, HORECA, healthcare, healthy nutrition, social innovation in ageing and tourism, among others.\n*''Quality'': Regaining the concept of gastronomy, a sense of pleasure and the importance of quality labels are declared priorities for this Centre, as is the need to raise awareness in the culinary sector and in society in general of the importance of quality and authenticity.
