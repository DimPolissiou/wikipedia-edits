The club wasn't re-elected and spent one season outside the Football League before being elected back again at the end of 1904\u201305. Stockport then competed in it continuously for 106 years from 1905 to 2011. The team spent most of their history in the lower reaches of the Football League, having to seek re-election on many further occasions. Stockport won their first league championship in 1922 coming top of the newly created [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]]. A further two league championships followed in 1937 (Third Division North) and 1967 ([[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]). The 1990s were the most successful, with the club competing in the [[EFL Championship|First Division]] for five seasons, reaching the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] semi-finals in 1996\u201397, where they lost to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesborough]] 2\u20131 over two legs.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.
