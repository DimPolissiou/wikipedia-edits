Napoli|Napoli]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Inter Milan]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], often operating in the [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|sweeper position]]. He is also a former [[France national football team|French international]], earning 97 caps and scoring 16 international goals. He represented the country in several international tournaments, including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]], both of which [[France national football team|France]] won. On 28 June 1998, Blanc scored the first [[golden goal]] in [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] history against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]].\n\nHe began his managerial career at [[Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in 2007, winning domestic honours including the [[2008\u201309 Ligue 1]] title. After leaving Bordeaux in 2010 he became the manager of the French national team until 2012, replacing [[Raymond Domenech]] in the wake of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Laurent Blanc appointed new manager of France |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8685345.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}</ref> and leading the country to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2012]]. In 2013, he was hired by Paris Saint-Germain, winning further honours. After three successful years with Paris Saint-Germain he left the club in June 2016.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early years===\nBlanc was born in [[Al\u00e8s]], France.<ref name=Hugman/> His career started at [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]], where he signed his first professional contract in 1983. A very technical, yet slow player, he played as an [[Midfielder|attacking midfielder]] and helped the club get promoted to [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] in [[French football Division 2 1986-87|1987]]. Only a few years later did he settle as a defender following the advice from [[Michel M\u00e9zy]], a position in which his physical stature (1.92&nbsp;m, 86&nbsp;kg) and his temperament would prove invaluable. His game being perfectly fitted for the French league, he managed to score at least 12 Division 1 goals per season in his last three seasons at Montpellier, for the most part penalties and headers. He also won the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1989\u201390 Coupe de France|1990]], scoring a goal in the [[1990 Coupe de France Final|final match]]. Blanc remains Montpellier's all-time leading goal scorer, with 83 in all competitions (76 altogether in Division 1 and [[Ligue 2|Division 2]]). On 5 August 2017, [[Souleymane Camara]] scored the only goal (in the 59th minute) in Montpellier's [[2017-18 Ligue 1|Matchday 1 Ligue 1]] 1\u20130 win against [[SM Caen]] to register his 48th Ligue 1 goal for Montpellier, breaking Blanc's longstanding Montpellier record of 47 Division 1 goals scored in four seasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/montpellier-win-it-for-nicollin.htm|title=Montpellier win it for Nicollin|publisher=www.ligue1.com|date=5 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Blanc tried his luck abroad when he left Montpellier for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the Italian [[Serie A]]. Despite a decent season during which he managed to score six goals, he felt like he could not fully express his potential and returned to France after just one year, to [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]] and then [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint \u00c9tienne]], where again he imposed himself as one of the best defenders in the league. Although Blanc scored 13 goals in his last season at Saint-\u00c9tienne, les Verts were almost relegated, only staying up because [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] were not allowed to return to the first division because of the club's financial difficulties. [[Guy Roux]], impressed by Blanc and looking for a replacement for [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] international [[Frank Verlaat]], convinced him to join [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] in 1995. Despite injuring himself early in the season, Blanc came back strongly and played a great part in the team's [[Double (association football)|double]] that year.\n\n===Barcelona===\nBlanc's success at Auxerre drew the attention of several big European clubs. Blanc agreed to join [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in Spain largely because manager [[Johan Cruyff]] wanted him and persuaded him to sign. But on the very day that Blanc said yes to ''Bar\u00e7a'', Cruyff was sacked, and Blanc's spell with the club was a less than happy one. Blanc was in the side when Barcelona won the [[Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a]] against [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], but was injured soon afterwards. He played regularly upon his return from injury, but was sent off during the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1996\u201397#Quarter-finals|quarter-final]] against [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]]. He then injured himself again against [[CF Extremadura|Extremadura]], which forced him to miss the ''[[El Cl\u00e1sico|Cl\u00e1sico]]'' and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final 1997|Cup Winners' Cup final]] against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. After this disappointing season and only one year away from the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], he decided to leave.\n\n===''\"Le Pr\u00e9sident\"''===\n[[Rolland Courbis]] managed to convince Blanc to join Marseille, which proved beneficial for both the club and Blanc. Blanc quickly became a leader in a team that was desperately lacking confidence, and helped Marseille finish in fourth place in his first season, during which he scored 11 goals and earned the nickname \"''Le Pr\u00e9sident''\" (\"The President\"). The season following the World Cup was both successful and frustrating for Blanc and Marseille, as they finished runners-up in the [[1998\u201399 French Division 1|championship]], only one point shy of [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], and reached the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] [[1999 UEFA Cup Final|final]], only to lose 3\u20130 to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], with [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]] intercepting Blanc's back pass to [[St\u00e9phane Porato]] to score the opener. Afterwards, Blanc left Marseille for [[Inter Milan]], where he enjoyed some success, winning the ''Pirata d'Oro'' (Inter Player of the Year) in 2000.\n\n===Manchester United===\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Alex Ferguson]] had attempted to lure Blanc several times since 1996 and finally succeeded in August 2001 when, at the age of 35, Blanc was brought in to replace the departing [[Jaap Stam]]. He was criticised for poor performances in the early months of his stay at [[Old Trafford]], when United suffered five defeats in the league by 1 December 2001 \u2013 with some critics even being keen to point out that the five teams who had beaten them in the league began with the letters which spelt out Blanc's surname \u2013 ''[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|'''B'''olton Wanderers]], [[Liverpool F.C.|'''L'''iverpool]], [[Arsenal F.C.|'''A'''rsenal]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|'''N'''ewcastle United]], and [[Chelsea F.C.|'''C'''helsea]].'' He initially arrived at [[Old Trafford]] on a one-year contract, and as his form and his team's form improved throughout the season (although it wasn't enough for United to catch Arsenal in the title race), he was eventually awarded a fresh one-year contract to give him a second season in Manchester.\n\nAfter helping United win the [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|2002\u201303 Premier League]] title, Blanc finally retired from playing in the summer of 2003.\n\nHe scored four goals during his time at Manchester United. One of these came in the league against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Man Utd's amazing comeback|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1567733.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 September 2001 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> and the other three all came in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in games against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/2344237.stm|title=Man Utd go through |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 October 2002 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> and [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] (both home<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd stroll past Boavista |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1691444.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 December 2001 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> and away).<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd top group |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1878830.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 March 2002 |accessdate=4 November 2009 }}</ref> Blanc retired from football at the end of his time with the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/in-black-and-white-blanc-is-on-the-brink-2279670.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=John |last=Lichfield |date=6 May 2011 |title=In black and white: Blanc is on the brink}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nBlanc won the [[1988 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1988]] [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|European Under-21 Championship]], his team beating [[Greece national under-21 football team|Greece]] in the final. He was named the tournament's Golden Player by [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=1988/index.html|title=1988: France sweep to final glory|accessdate=11 August 2013|work=UEFA}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 February 1989, Blanc made his debut for the [[France national football team|senior national team]] against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. France, then in reconstruction after the retirement of numerous key players, did not manage to qualify for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. Shortly after that, they started an impressive 19-game unbeaten streak, including eight wins out of eight in [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 1|Euro 1992 qualifying]], making them one of the favorites to win the [[UEFA Euro 1992|competition]]. They would, however, get knocked out in the group stage by eventual winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].\n\nAfter France [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA \u2013 Group 6)|failed to qualify]] for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], Blanc was heavily criticised, as well the rest of the team, and he subsequently decided to retire from international football. [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]], after taking over the managerial position of the national team, made it one of his priorities to convince Blanc to change his mind. Blanc returned to the team for the [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying Group 1|Euro 1996 qualification campaign]] and scored in a 4\u20130 win over [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]]. At the [[UEFA Euro 1996|tournament finals]], he formed a central defensive partnership with [[Marcel Desailly]]. Blanc scored France's opening goal in the final [[UEFA Euro 1996 Group B|group match]] against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in a 3\u20131 win to put the team into the [[UEFA Euro 1996 knockout stage#France vs Netherlands|quarter-finals]], where they faced the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at [[Anfield]]. Blanc scored France's winning [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in the [[Penalty shootout|shootout]] after the match had ended 0\u20130. France then lost on penalty kicks at the [[UEFA Euro 1996 knockout stage#France vs Czech Republic|semi-final]] stage after drawing 0\u20130 with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. However, Blanc again successfully converted his kick.\n\nFrance then entered the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], which was held on home soil. Blanc was exemplary during the competition and, on 28 June 1998, scored the first-ever [[golden goal]] in World Cup history against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#France vs Paraguay|round of 16]]. In the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Italy vs France|quarter-final]], Blanc helped France to a clean sheet over [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and scored the winning penalty as ''Les Bleus'' prevailed in the shootout. He missed the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] after being [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#France vs Croatia|semi-final]] against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] for slapping [[Slaven Bili\u0107]]. The sending off was the first (and only) [[Penalty card|red card]] of Blanc's international professional career. Despite Blanc's absence, France lifted the World Cup for the first time after defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3\u20130 at the [[Stade de France]]. The two goals conceded during the tournament by France was a new [[FIFA World Cup records|record]] for a World Cup winner. This record was matched by Italy in [[FIFA World Cup 2006|2006]] and Spain in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]].\n\nBlanc was also part of the team that won [[UEFA Euro 2000]] during which, despite having been criticised for his age and lack of speed during the qualifications, he proved reliable in defence and even scored France's first goal of the tournament against Denmark in the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Group D|group stage]]. He announced his retirement from international football after the competition, following the example of his captain [[Didier Deschamps]]. On 2 September 2000, Blanc, along with Deschamps and [[Bernard Lama]], played his final match for ''Les Bleus'' in a friendly against [[England national football team|England]] at the Stade de France.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/sep/03/newsstory.sport16?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=England give France a fright|date=3 September 2000|accessdate=11 August 2013|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nBlanc was well known for kissing good friend and goalkeeper [[Fabien Barthez]]'s head before the start of every match, supposedly for good luck (the two did repeat this ritual when they played together for Manchester United, but only for Champions League matches). The French national team was unbeaten in all matches when it fielded the World Cup and European Championship winning defence of Blanc, Desailly, [[Lilian Thuram]] and [[Bixente Lizarazu]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/4753303/Four-of-a-kind-for-France.html|title=Four of a kind for France|date=26 June 2000|accessdate=11 August 2013|work=The Telegraph|location=London|first=Alan|last=Smith}}</ref> Overall, Blanc recorded 97 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 16 goals. In 1999, the readers of ''[[France Football]]'' magazine voted him the fourth-best [[France national football team|French]] player of all time, behind [[Michel Platini]], [[Zinedine Zidane]] and [[Raymond Kopa]].\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Bordeaux===\n[[File:Laurent Blanc 23.jpg|thumb|Blanc during his time with Bordeaux]]\n\nOn 8 June 2007, Blanc was named the new manager of Bordeaux, replacing Brazilian [[Ricardo Gomes]]. For his [[2007\u201308 Ligue 1|first season]] on the bench, he led the club to second place in [[Ligue 1]] and won the [[Troph\u00e9es UNFP du football#Manager of the Year|Manager of the Year award]]. His [[2008\u201309 Ligue 1|second Ligue 1 season]] was extremely successful.

Napoli|Napoli]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Inter Milan]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], often operating in the [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|sweeper position]]. He is also a former [[France national football team|French international]], earning 97 caps and scoring 16 international goals. He represented the country in several international tournaments, including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]], both of which [[France national football team|France]] won. On 28 June 1998, Blanc scored the first [[golden goal]] in [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] history against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]].\n\nHe began his managerial career at [[Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in 2007, winning domestic honours including the [[2008\u201309 Ligue 1]] title. After leaving Bordeaux in 2010 he became the manager of the French national team until 2012, replacing [[Raymond Domenech]] in the wake of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Laurent Blanc appointed new manager of France |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8685345.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}</ref> and leading the country to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2012]]. In 2013, he was hired by Paris Saint-Germain, winning further honours. After three successful years with Paris Saint-Germain he left the club in June 2016.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early years===\nBlanc was born in [[Al\u00e8s]], France.<ref name=Hugman/> His career started at [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]], where he signed his first professional contract in 1983. A very technical, yet slow player, he played as an [[Midfielder|attacking midfielder]] and helped the club get promoted to [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] in [[French football Division 2 1986-87|1987]]. Only a few years later did he settle as a defender following the advice from [[Michel M\u00e9zy]], a position in which his physical stature (1.92&nbsp;m, 86&nbsp;kg) and his temperament would prove invaluable. His game being perfectly fitted for the French league, he managed to score at least 12 Division 1 goals per season in his last three seasons at Montpellier, for the most part penalties and headers. He also won the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1989\u201390 Coupe de France|1990]], scoring a goal in the [[1990 Coupe de France Final|final match]]. Blanc remains Montpellier's all-time leading goal scorer, with 83 in all competitions (76 altogether in Division 1 and [[Ligue 2|Division 2]]). On 5 August 2017, [[Souleymane Camara]] scored the only goal (in the 59th minute) in Montpellier's [[2017-18 Ligue 1|Matchday 1 Ligue 1]] 1\u20130 win against [[SM Caen]] to register his 48th Ligue 1 goal for Montpellier, breaking Blanc's longstanding Montpellier record of 47 Division 1 goals scored in four seasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/montpellier-win-it-for-nicollin.htm|title=Montpellier win it for Nicollin|publisher=www.ligue1.com|date=5 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Blanc tried his luck abroad when he left Montpellier for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the Italian [[Serie A]]. Despite a decent season during which he managed to score six goals, he felt like he could not fully express his potential and returned to France after just one year, to [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]] and then [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint \u00c9tienne]], where again he imposed himself as one of the best defenders in the league. Although Blanc scored 13 goals in his last season at Saint-\u00c9tienne, les Verts were almost relegated, only staying up because [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] were not allowed to return to the first division because of the club's financial difficulties. [[Guy Roux]], impressed by Blanc and looking for a replacement for [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] international [[Frank Verlaat]], convinced him to join [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] in 1995. Despite injuring himself early in the season, Blanc came back strongly and played a great part in the team's [[Double (association football)|double]] that year.\n\n===Barcelona===\nBlanc's success at Auxerre drew the attention of several big European clubs. Blanc agreed to join [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in Spain largely because manager [[Johan Cruyff]] wanted him and persuaded him to sign. But on the very day that Blanc said yes to ''Bar\u00e7a'', Cruyff was sacked, and Blanc's spell with the club was a less than happy one. Blanc was in the side when Barcelona won the [[Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a]] against [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], but was injured soon afterwards. He played regularly upon his return from injury, but was sent off during the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1996\u201397#Quarter-finals|quarter-final]] against [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]]. He then injured himself again against [[CF Extremadura|Extremadura]], which forced him to miss the ''[[El Cl\u00e1sico|Cl\u00e1sico]]'' and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final 1997|Cup Winners' Cup final]] against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. After this disappointing season and only one year away from the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], he decided to leave.\n\n===''\"Le Pr\u00e9sident\"''===\n[[Rolland Courbis]] managed to convince Blanc to join Marseille, which proved beneficial for both the club and Blanc. Blanc quickly became a leader in a team that was desperately lacking confidence, and helped Marseille finish in fourth place in his first season, during which he scored 11 goals and earned the nickname \"''Le Pr\u00e9sident''\" (\"The President\"). The season following the World Cup was both successful and frustrating for Blanc and Marseille, as they finished runners-up in the [[1998\u201399 French Division 1|championship]], only one point shy of [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], and reached the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] [[1999 UEFA Cup Final|final]], only to lose 3\u20130 to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], with [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]] intercepting Blanc's back pass to [[St\u00e9phane Porato]] to score the opener. Afterwards, Blanc left Marseille for [[Inter Milan]], where he enjoyed some success, winning the ''Pirata d'Oro'' (Inter Player of the Year) in 2000.\n\n===Manchester United===\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Alex Ferguson]] had attempted to lure Blanc several times since 1996 and finally succeeded in August 2001 when, at the age of 35, Blanc was brought in to replace the departing [[Jaap Stam]]. He was criticised for poor performances in the early months of his stay at [[Old Trafford]], when United suffered five defeats in the league by 1 December 2001 \u2013 with some critics even being keen to point out that the five teams who had beaten them in the league began with the letters which spelt out Blanc's surname \u2013 ''[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|'''B'''olton Wanderers]], [[Liverpool F.C.|'''L'''iverpool]], [[Arsenal F.C.|'''A'''rsenal]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|'''N'''ewcastle United]], and [[Chelsea F.C.|'''C'''helsea]].'' He initially arrived at [[Old Trafford]] on a one-year contract, and as his form and his team's form improved throughout the season (although it wasn't enough for United to catch Arsenal in the title race), he was eventually awarded a fresh one-year contract to give him a second season in Manchester.\n\nAfter helping United win the [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|2002\u201303 Premier League]] title, Blanc finally retired from playing in the summer of 2003.\n\nHe scored four goals during his time at Manchester United. One of these came in the league against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Man Utd's amazing comeback|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1567733.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 September 2001 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> and the other three all came in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in games against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/2344237.stm|title=Man Utd go through |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 October 2002 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> and [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] (both home<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd stroll past Boavista |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1691444.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 December 2001 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> and away).<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd top group |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1878830.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 March 2002 |accessdate=4 November 2009 }}</ref> Blanc retired from football at the end of his time with the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/in-black-and-white-blanc-is-on-the-brink-2279670.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=John |last=Lichfield |date=6 May 2011 |title=In black and white: Blanc is on the brink}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nBlanc won the [[1988 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1988]] [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|European Under-21 Championship]], his team beating [[Greece national under-21 football team|Greece]] in the final. He was named the tournament's Golden Player by [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=1988/index.html|title=1988: France sweep to final glory|accessdate=11 August 2013|work=UEFA}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 February 1989, Blanc made his debut for the [[France national football team|senior national team]] against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. France, then in reconstruction after the retirement of numerous key players, did not manage to qualify for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. Shortly after that, they started an impressive 19-game unbeaten streak, including eight wins out of eight in [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 1|Euro 1992 qualifying]], making them one of the favorites to win the [[UEFA Euro 1992|competition]]. They would, however, get knocked out in the group stage by eventual winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].\n\nAfter France [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA \u2013 Group 6)|failed to qualify]] for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], Blanc was heavily criticised, as well the rest of the team, and he subsequently decided to retire from international football. [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]], after taking over the managerial position of the national team, made it one of his priorities to convince Blanc to change his mind. Blanc returned to the team for the [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying Group 1|Euro 1996 qualification campaign]] and scored in a 4\u20130 win over [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]]. At the [[UEFA Euro 1996|tournament finals]], he formed a central defensive partnership with [[Marcel Desailly]]. Blanc scored France's opening goal in the final [[UEFA Euro 1996 Group B|group match]] against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in a 3\u20131 win to put the team into the [[UEFA Euro 1996 knockout stage#France vs Netherlands|quarter-finals]], where they faced the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at [[Anfield]]. Blanc scored France's winning [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in the [[Penalty shootout|shootout]] after the match had ended 0\u20130. France then lost on penalty kicks at the [[UEFA Euro 1996 knockout stage#France vs Czech Republic|semi-final]] stage after drawing 0\u20130 with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. However, Blanc again successfully converted his kick.\n\nFrance then entered the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], which was held on home soil. Blanc was exemplary during the competition and, on 28 June 1998, scored the first-ever [[golden goal]] in World Cup history against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#France vs Paraguay|round of 16]]. In the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Italy vs France|quarter-final]], Blanc helped France to a clean sheet over [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and scored the winning penalty as ''Les Bleus'' prevailed in the shootout. He missed the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] after being [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#France vs Croatia|semi-final]] against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] for slapping [[Slaven Bili\u0107]]. The sending off was the first (and only) [[Penalty card|red card]] of Blanc's international professional career. Despite Blanc's absence, France lifted the World Cup for the first time after defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3\u20130 at the [[Stade de France]]. The two goals conceded during the tournament by France was a new [[FIFA World Cup records|record]] for a World Cup winner. This record was matched by Italy in [[FIFA World Cup 2006|2006]] and Spain in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]].\n\nBlanc was also part of the team that won [[UEFA Euro 2000]] during which, despite having been criticised for his age and lack of speed during the qualifications, he proved reliable in defence and even scored France's first goal of the tournament against Denmark in the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Group D|group stage]]. He announced his retirement from international football after the competition, following the example of his captain [[Didier Deschamps]]. On 2 September 2000, Blanc, along with Deschamps and [[Bernard Lama]], played his final match for ''Les Bleus'' in a friendly against [[England national football team|England]] at the Stade de France.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/sep/03/newsstory.sport16?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=England give France a fright|date=3 September 2000|accessdate=11 August 2013|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nBlanc was well known for kissing good friend and goalkeeper [[Fabien Barthez]]'s head before the start of every match, supposedly for good luck (the two did repeat this ritual when they played together for Manchester United, but only for Champions League matches). The French national team was unbeaten in all matches when it fielded the World Cup and European Championship winning defence of Blanc, Desailly, [[Lilian Thuram]] and [[Bixente Lizarazu]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/4753303/Four-of-a-kind-for-France.html|title=Four of a kind for France|date=26 June 2000|accessdate=11 August 2013|work=The Telegraph|location=London|first=Alan|last=Smith}}</ref> Overall, Blanc recorded 97 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 16 goals. In 1999, the readers of ''[[France Football]]'' magazine voted him the fourth-best [[France national football team|French]] player of all time, behind [[Michel Platini]], [[Zinedine Zidane]] and [[Raymond Kopa]].\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Bordeaux===\n[[File:Laurent Blanc 23.jpg|thumb|Blanc during his time with Bordeaux]]\n\nOn 8 June 2007, Blanc was named the new manager of Bordeaux, replacing Brazilian [[Ricardo Gomes]]. For his [[2007\u201308 Ligue 1|first season]] on the bench, he led the club to second place in [[Ligue 1]] and won the [[Troph\u00e9es UNFP du football#Manager of the Year|Manager of the Year award]]. His [[2008\u201309 Ligue 1|second Ligue 1 season]] was extremely successful. Bordeaux won the final 11 league matches of the [[2008\u201309 Ligue 1]] season, setting a new [[Football in France|French record]] for consecutive wins,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/breaking-news-world/joy-as-bordeaux-end-10year-french-title-wait-20090531-br8q.html|title=Joy as Bordeaux end 10-year French title wait|accessdate=31 May 2009|work=Brisbane Times}}</ref> to clinch the Ligue 1 title three points clear of [[Olympique de Marseille]]. Bordeaux also won the [[2008\u201309 Coupe de la Ligue]].

After resigning from his position, Blanc contacted the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF) to inquire about the French national team job, which was eventually vacated by [[Raymond Domenech]] following the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. Later that day, FFF President [[Jean-Pierre Escalettes]] confirmed that Blanc was a candidate for the position. On 18 May 2010, with Blanc's appointment to the position becoming more probable, Bordeaux chairman [[Jean-Louis Triaud]] demanded compensation from the Federation.

Scholars have suggested that these structures could have been built by the [[Etruscans]] as a defense against the invasion of the [[Senones]]. Presence of the latter is confirmed by local toponyms, such as the name of the village Brenna, close to Stigliano, which could stem from the name of their leader [[Brennus]]. The name of the local Merse river, which flows behind Stigliano, is potentially directly related to [[Merseburg]], a town in eastern Germany. Orgia and Rosia are both non-roman names, and possibly related to the Lambards times.\n\nAlthough very little is known of Stigliano during the Roman times, the name of ''Sextilianum'' which appears in later records, may show the existence of a private property later on giving the name to the village.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nStigliano is the site for one of the many castles that were part of the ''Ardenghesca ''consortium, feudal Lords of [[Lombards|Lombard]] ancestry.\n\nIn middle age Stigliano was the hub of a network of roads crossing the region, one to [[Massa Marittima]] and another following the Rosia river to the [[Maremma]]. All routes passed through the village of Torri and Stigliano; traces of the old roads can be seen in the woods near Stigliano.\n\nThe presence of a monastery at Torri triggered economic growth in the area. The monks carried out an agricultural and industrial revolution, draining the marshes and introducing water mills along the Merse. The river accommodated every sort of hydraulic machinery, but mainly the ones, as forges, related to siderurgy.\n\nThe abundance of water and woods, so acutely missed by the Siena merchants, influenced the development of Stigliano and the neighbouring villages during the 13th century. These natural resources were of crucial importance for [[Siena]], the  major city in the area, who decided finally to take the Ardenghesche lands for its own purposes. The first established industry was that of the Wool Masters, \u201cThe Follatura\u201d, who signed a contract with the monks at Torri to develop hydraulic machinery along the [[Merse (river)|Merse]] river. Later on, the river was diverted, to power a serie of huge flour mills, built by the Sienese Common, of which three are still standing: Molino del Pero, near Brenna, Molino Serravalle and Molino del Palazzo. The straight dirt track which goes to San Rocco a Pilli was also built at this time. Some other mills, \u201cSassa\u201d and \u201cVolta\u201d, are just ruins. These mills were indispensable for the production of flour to supply Siena. This intricate medieval hydraulic system stretched for kilometers and was one of the most important technical achievements of the Middle Ages in Tuscany.\n\nA careful inventory of land properties in 1320, carried out by Siena authorities for taxing purposes, reveals the main source of incomes from this area in middle age: the iron industry. Although still primitive, siderurgy was greatly improved by hydraulic machinery, and reached high levels of sophistication. During this era, Stigliano was an independent commune, owning large areas of woodland and granting permits for allotments to its inhabitants, not only to farmers but also commercial entrepreneurs and merchants. There are documents recording deals of land exchanges with the Sienese as far back at the 13th century. However, after the outbreak of the [[Black Death]] in 1348 and the subsequent decline of the  population, these achievements were neglected and even the revival of agriculture in the 18th century could not compare with the thriving centre in medieval times.

Scholars have suggested that these structures could have been built by the [[Etruscans]] as a defense against the invasion of the [[Senones]]. Presence of the latter is confirmed by local toponyms, such as the name of the village Brenna, close to Stigliano, which could stem from the name of their leader [[Brennus]]. The name of the local Merse river, which flows behind Stigliano, is potentially directly related to [[Merseburg]], a town in eastern Germany. Orgia and Rosia are both non-roman names, and possibly related to the Lambards times.\n\nAlthough very little is known of Stigliano during the Roman times, the name of ''Sextilianum'' which appears in later records, may show the existence of a private property later on giving the name to the village.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nStigliano is the site for one of the many castles that were part of the ''Ardenghesca ''consortium, feudal Lords of Lambard ancestry.\n\nIn middle age Stigliano was the hub of a network of roads crossing the region, one to [[Massa Marittima]] and another following the Rosia river to the [[Maremma]]. All routes passed through the village of Torri and Stigliano; traces of the old roads can be seen in the woods near Stigliano.\n\nThe presence of a monastery at Torri triggered economic growth in the area. The monks carried out an agricultural and industrial revolution, draining the marshes and introducing water mills along the Merse. The river accomodated every sort of hydraulic machinery, but mainly the ones, as forges, related to siderurgy.\n\nThe abundance of water and woods, so acutely missed by the Siena merchants, influenced the development of Stigliano and the neighbouring villages during the 13th century. These natural resources were of crucial importance for [[Siena]], the  major city in the area, who decided finally to take the Ardenghesche lands for its own purposes. The first established industry was that of the Wool Masters, \u201cThe Follatura\u201d, who signed a contract with the monks at Torri to develop hydraulic machinery along the Merse river. Later on, the river was diverted, to power a serie of huge flour mills, built by the Sienese Common, of which three are still standing: Molino del Pero, near Brenna, Molino Serravalle and Molino del Palazzo. The straight dirt track which goes to San Rocco a Pilli was also built at this time. Some other mills, \u201cSassa\u201d and \u201cVolta\u201d, are just ruins. These mills were indispensable for the production of flour to supply Siena. This intricate mediaeval hydraulic system stretched for kilometers and was one of the most important technical achievements of the Middle Ages in Tuscany.\n\nA careful inventory of land properties in 1320, carried out by Siena authorities for taxing purposes, reveals the main source of incomes from this area in middle age: the iron industry. Althought still primitive, siderurgy was greatly improved by hydraulic machinery, and reached high levels of sophistication. During this era, Stigliano was an independent commune, owning large areas of woodland and granting permits for allotments to its inhabitants, not only to farmers but also commercial entrepreneurs and merchants. There are documents recording deals of land exchanges with the Sienese as far back at the 13th century. However, after the outbreak of the [[Black Death]] in 1348 and the subsequent decline of the  population, these achievements were neglected and even the revival of agriculture in the 18th century could not compare with the thriving centre in mediaeval times. The plague and the subsequent appearance of the ruthless [[condottieri]] armies which plundered of the countryside, ruined the synergy between the commune and its lands. \nStigliano underwent a stage of refeudalization, and large properties of land were assembled by former merchants and bankers: the Borghesi family, who established their master manor in the shape of a stronghold, at Palazzo, and the Pecci, who in Poggiarello edificated their own one, the [https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=124956216041074405#editor/target=post;postID=5358079192133601118;onPublishedMenu=allposts;onClosedMenu=allposts;postNum=0;src=postname castello del Poggiarello di Stigliano].

The team ended Stage 1 with a perfect 7\u20130 record and went on to win the Stage 1 Finals against the [[San Francisco Shock]]. The Titans posted another perfect 7\u20130 record in Stage 2; however, they lost in the Stage 2 Finals against the Shock, which ended their Overwatch League record 19-game win streak (including playoffs). The team continued their regular season dominance by winning an Overwatch League record 19 consecutive games that was not snapped until in June 23, when the [[Los Angeles Valiant]] defeated the Titans. While they qualified for the Stage 3 playoffs, Vancouver was defeated by the [[Shanghai Dragons]] in the semifinals round. The Titans lost two more times in the regular season, against the [[Washington Justice]] and Shock, to end the regular season with a league-best 25\u20133 record and the top seed in the [[2019 Overwatch League playoffs|season playoffs]].\n\nVancouver started their playoff run by defeating [[Seoul Dynasty]] 4\u20132 in the first round to advance to the first round of the winners bracket. In that round, the Titans defeated the [[Los Angeles Gladiators]] 4\u20132. The win sent the team to the winners bracket final, where they took down the [[New York Excelsior]] 4\u20133 to advance to the  [[2019 Overwatch League Grand Finals|Grand Finals]], where they faced the San Francisco Shock.

The match opened on Nepal. The Shock were able to punish Vancouver main tank Park \"Bumper\" Sang-beom's aggressive play style throughout the map; tide-turning Earthshatters from Shock's Matthew \"super\" DeLisi on [[Reinhardt (Overwatch)|Reinhardt]] pushed the Shock to claim the first map of the series. For the second map, the match went to [[Nepal (Overwatch)|Nepal]]. Contrasted to the first map, it was Vancouver's Bumper on Reinhardt executing well-timed Earthshatters, leading to the Shock being full-held and losing the map. The Shock chose Temple of Anubis for map three; the map went to overtime rounds after both teams completed the map, but the Shock once again completed the map and prevented the Titans from doing the same. For the fourth map, Vancouver selected Dorado. While the Shock put on a solid attack, they were prevented from completing the map; the Titans easily pushed the payload further than the Shock to tie up the series. Map six went to Ilios. The Shock won the first round, the Titans evened up the map by winning the second, and the Shock took the third round. The Titans selected King's Row for map seven, and they were able to complete the map on their attack led by stellar play from SeoMinSoo on [[Zarya (Overwatch)|Zarya]]. Despite clutch plays from Grant \"Moth\" Espe on [[L\u00facio (Overwatch)|L\u00facio]], the Shock could not capture all three points on their attack. The loss tied the series up 3\u20133 as the match went to a finals seventh map. For the final map, the Shock selected [[Rialto (Overwatch)|Rialto]]. San Francisco completed the map with a solid time-bank remaining, but Vancouver responded by completing the map with the fastest time recorded ever in the Overwatch League. With both teams completing the map, the match went to overtime rounds. The Shock attacked first, but they were held just before they could cap the first checkpoint. With over four minutes remaining in their time bank, the Titans were able to push the payload further to claim the title of Stage 1 Champions.<ref name=\"S1 Finals\">{{cite news |last=Richardson |first=Liz |title=Vancouver Titans are the Overwatch League stage one champions |work=Dot Esports |date=March 24, 2019 |url=https://dotesports.com/overwatch/news/vancouver-titans-overwatch-league-stage-one-champions |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Stage 2 ===\n[[File:Vancouver Titans in match.jpg|thumb|Vancouver Titans playing on April 18.

[[Overwatch League]] as one of eight expansion franchises added for the 2019 season.\n\nVancouver started the season with a 4\u20130 sweep over the [[Shanghai Dragons]]. The team ended Stage 1 with a perfect 7\u20130 record and went on to win the Stage 1 Finals against the [[San Francisco Shock]]. The Titans posted another perfect 7\u20130 record in Stage 2; however, they lost in the Stage 2 Finals against the Shock, which ended their Overwatch League record 19-game win streak (including playoffs). The team continued their regular season dominance by winning an Overwatch League record 19 consecutive games that was not snapped until in June 23, when the [[Los Angeles Valiant]] defeated the Titans. While they qualified for the Stage 3 playoffs, Vancouver was defeated by the [[Shanghai Dragons]] in the semifinals round. The Titans lost two more times in the regular season, against the [[Washington Justice]] and Shock, to end the regular season with a league-best 25\u20133 record and the top seed in the [[2019 Overwatch League playoffs|season playoffs]]. \n\nVancouver started their playoff run by defeating [[Seoul Dynasty]] 4\u20132 in the first round to advance to the first round of the winners bracket. In that round, the Titans defeated the [[Los Angeles Gladiators]] 4\u20132. The win sent the team to the winners bracket final, where they took down the [[New York Excelsior]] 4\u20133 to advance to the  [[2019 Overwatch League Grand Finals|Grand Finals]], where they faced the San Francisco Shock. The Titans were swept 0\u20134 by the Shock.\n\n== Preceding offseason ==\nOn December 1, Titans also announced that it had signed nine players to the team, including all eight members of the Korean Contenders Champions [[RunAway]], and Hwang \"paJion\" Ji-Sub as the team's head coach.<ref name=brandreveal>{{cite news |agency=Reuters |title=Overwatch: Vancouver Titans reveal branding, roster |date=December 1, 2018 |work=ESPN |url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/page/overwatchvancouvertitans/overwatch-league-vancouver-titans-reveal-branding-roster |access-date=March 21, 2019}}</ref> The signed players were:\n*[[Kim \"Haksal\" Hyo-jong]],\n*Lee \"Hooreg\" Dong-eun,\n*Seo \"SeoMinSoo\" Min-soo,\n*Lee \"Stitch\" Chung-lee,\n*Park \"Bumper\" Sang-beom,\n*Choi \"JJANU\" Hyun-woo,\n*Lee \"Twilight\" Ju-seok,\n*Kim \"RAPEL\" Jun-keun, and\n*Kim \"SLIME\" Seong-jun.\n\n== Regular season ==\n=== Stage 1 ===\nVancouver began their 2019 season on February 16 with a 4\u20130 sweep over [[Shanghai Dragons]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Fossett |first=Wyatt |title=Vancouver Titans win their Overwatch League debut |date=February 17, 2019 |work=Daily Hive |url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/vancouver-titans-overwatch-league-debut |access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref> In their second week of play, Titans won both of their matches \u2013 a 3\u20132 overtime match against [[Guangzhou Charge]] and a 3\u20131 win over [[San Francisco Shock]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Zucker |first=Joseph |title=Overwatch League 2019 Stage 1 Week 2: Excelsior's Top Plays, Prize Money |work=Bleacher Report |date=February 24, 2019 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2822253-overwatch-league-2019-stage-1-week-2-excelsiors-top-plays-prize-money |access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref> Vancouver found their fourth straight victory in week three, as the team beat [[Los Angeles Valiant]] 3\u20131.<ref>{{cite news |last=D'Orazio |first=Nick |title=After a year of practice, Valiant KariV gives a full English interview: \"Don't give up, my friends\" |work=Inven Global |date=March 2, 2019 |url=https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/7714/after-a-year-of-practice-valiant-kariv-gives-a-full-english-interview-dont-give-up-my-friends |access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref> Week four saw Vancouver find two more wins against [[Paris Eternal]] and [[Chengdu Hunters]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Erzberger |first1=Tyler |last2=Rand |first2=Emily |title=Overwatch League power rankings through Week 4 |work=ESPN |date=March 13, 2019 |url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/26254254/overwatch-league-power-rankings-week-4 |access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref> Titans finished off the stage with a sweep over [[Guangzhou Charge]] to end with a perfect 7\u20130 record and claim the top seed in the Stage 1 Playoffs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Polacek |first=Scott |title=Overwatch League 2019 Stage 1 Week 5: Titans' Top Plays, Prize Money |work=Bleacher Report |date=March 17, 2019 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2826300-overwatch-league-2019-stage-1-week-5-titans-top-plays-prize-money |access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nVancouver faced the [[Boston Uprising]] in the Stage 1 Quarterfinals on March 21; Titans make quick work of Uprising, sweeping them 3\u20130, and moved on to the semifinals against [[Seoul Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Rand |first=Emily |title=Seoul Dynasty put it all together against NYXL |work=ESPN |date=March 22, 2019 |url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/26327984/seoul-dynasty-put-all-together-nyxl |access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref> Titans showed a dominant performance in the semifinals, sweeping Dynasty 4\u20130 to move on to the Finals against [[San Francisco Shock]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Richardson |first=Liz |title=Vancouver Titans and San Francisco Shock advance to Overwatch League stage one finals |work=Dot Esports |date=March 23, 2019 |url=https://dotesports.com/overwatch/news/overwatch-league-stage-one-semifinals-results |access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Stage 1 Finals took place on March 24 with the Titans taking on the sixth-seeded San Francisco Shock. The match opened on Nepal. The Shock were able to punish Vancouver main tank Park \"Bumper\" Sang-beom's aggressive play style throughout the map; tide-turning Earthshatters from Shock's Matthew \"super\" DeLisi on [[Reinhardt (Overwatch)|Reinhardt]] pushed the Shock to claim the first map of the series. For the second map, the match went to [[Nepal (Overwatch)|Nepal]]. Contrasted to the first map, it was Vancouver's Bumper on Reinhardt executing well-timed Earthshatters, leading to the Shock being full-held and losing the map. The Shock chose Temple of Anubis for map three; the map went to overtime rounds after both teams completed the map, but the Shock once again completed the map and prevented the Titans from doing the same. For the fourth map, Vancouver selected Dorado. While the Shock put on a solid attack, they were prevented from completing the map; the Titans easily pushed the payload further than the Shock to tie up the series. Map six went to Ilios. The Shock won the first round, the Titans evened up the map by winning the second, and the Shock took the third round. The Titans selected King's Row for map seven, and they were able to complete the map on their attack led by stellar play from SeoMinSoo on [[Zarya (Overwatch)|Zarya]]. Despite clutch plays from Grant \"Moth\" Espe on [[L\u00facio (Overwatch)|L\u00facio]], the Shock could not capture all three points on their attack. The loss tied the series up 3\u20133 as the match went to a finals seventh map. For the final map, the Shock selected [[Rialto (Overwatch)|Rialto]]. San Francisco completed the map with a solid time-bank remaining, but Vancouver responded by completing the map with the fastest time recorded ever in the Overwatch League. With both teams completing the map, the match went to overtime rounds. The Shock attacked first, but they were held just before they could cap the first checkpoint. With over four minutes remaining in their time bank, the Titans were able to push the payload further to claim the title of Stage 1 Champions.<ref name=\"S1 Finals\">{{cite news |last=Richardson |first=Liz |title=Vancouver Titans are the Overwatch League stage one champions |work=Dot Esports |date=March 24, 2019 |url=https://dotesports.com/overwatch/news/vancouver-titans-overwatch-league-stage-one-champions |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Stage 2 ===\n[[File:Vancouver Titans in match.jpg|thumb|Vancouver Titans playing on April 18.
