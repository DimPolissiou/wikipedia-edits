It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"].

This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, U_0, t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

A 2007\"/> which states: the development of irreversible damage processes is possible and is realized with a certain probability ''\u0420''>0, when a finite region ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub> with a nonzero level of effective energy ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>>0 (internal entropy ''S''<sub>''i''</sub>>0) arises in the object \u2013 a dangerous volume\n\n<math>V_{P\\gamma} \\in V_{P\\gamma} \\left(Q_i, U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}, S_i\\right) \\ge 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2013 are internal force factors.\n\nIf ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>=0, then \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>=0 and, therefore, the evolution of an object by damage is impossi-ble (reversible system). In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/>). The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD).

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]]. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.\n\n===Entropy in DNA sequences===\n\nEntropy has been proven useful in the analysis of DNA sequences.

It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] in which all the [[energy]] ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.\n\nIf the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then \u2013 as [[Roger Penrose]] has pointed out \u2013 [[gravity]] plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into [[black hole]]s.

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in [[statistical thermodynamics]] has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy ''E'' over ''N'' identical systems.\n[[Carath\u00e9odory]] linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn 1865, Clausius named the concept of {{mvar|S}}, \"the differential of a quantity which depends on the configuration of the system,\" ''[[wikt:entropy|entropy]]'' ({{lang|de|Entropie}}) after the Greek word for 'transformation'.<ref name=Gil399>{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |authorlink1=Charles Coulston Gillispie |title=The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill |url-access=registration |year=1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02350-6 |p=[https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill/page/399 399]}}</ref>  He gives \"transformational content\" ({{lang|de|Verwandlungsinhalt}}) as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" ({{lang|de|W\u00e4rme- und Werkinhalt}}) as the name of [[Internal energy|{{mvar|U}}]], but preferring the term ''entropy'' as a close parallel of the word ''energy'', as he found the concepts nearly \"analogous in their physical significance.\"<ref name=Gil399/> This term was formed by replacing the root of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}} ('work') by that of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae|\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae]]}} ('transformation').<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clausius |first1=Rudolf |date=1865 |title=Ueber verschiedene f\u00fcr die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie (Vorgetragen in der naturforsch.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

According to Carnot's principle, [[work (physics)|work]] can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed ({{math|''Q''<sub>H</sub>}}).

This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"].

In a different basis set, the more general expression is\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\widehat{\\rho} \\log(\\widehat{\\rho})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{\\rho}</math> is the [[density matrix]], <math>\\operatorname{Tr}</math> is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and <math>\\log</math> is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

(Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant.

For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.<ref name=\"Perplexed\" />\n\nThe question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, U_0, t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S.

The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD).

This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction between the components of entropy.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].

In recent times prison reform ideas include greater access to [[legal counsel]] and [[family]], [[conjugal visits]], proactive security against violence, and implementing [[house arrest]] with assistive technology.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prison populations.png|thumb|right|Prison populations of various countries in 2008]]\nPrisons have only been used as the primary punishment for criminal acts in the last few centuries. Far more common earlier were various types of [[corporal punishment]], [[public humiliation]], [[Unfree labour|penal bondage]], and [[banishment]] for more severe offenses, as well as [[capital punishment]].\n\nThe concept of incarceration was presented circa 1750 as a more humane form of punishment than the aforementioned corporal and capital punishment. They originally was designed as a way for criminals to participate in religious self-reflection and self-reform as a form of penance, hence the term penitentiary.<ref>Davis, Angela Y. \"Imprisonment and Reform\" ''Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice'', edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnson, Cognella, 2019, pp. 95-102.</ref>\n\nPrisons contained both felons and debtors \u2013 the latter of which were allowed to bring in wives and children. The jailer made his money by charging the inmates for food and drink and legal services and the whole system was rife with corruption.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} One reform of the sixteenth century had been the establishment of the ''London [[Bridewell]]'' as a [[house of correction]] for women and children. This was the only place any medical services were provided.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====18th century====\nDuring the eighteenth century, British justice used a wide variety of measures to punish crime, including fines, the pillory and whipping. Transportation to The United States of America was often offered, until 1776, as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses including pilfering. When they ran out of prisons in 1776 they used old sailing vessels which came to be called ''hulks'' as places of temporary confinement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe most notable reformer was [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] who, having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, beginning when he was high sheriff of Bedfordshire, published ''The State of the Prisons'' in 1777.<ref>\n{{citation |title=The State of the Prisons in England and Wales with an account of some foreign prisons|author=John Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhNAAAAYAAJ|year=1777}}\n</ref> He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity, the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]], takes its name from John Howard.\n\nThe [[Penitentiary Act]] which passed in 1779 following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.\n\nQuakers such as [[Elizabeth Fry]] continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did [[Charles Dickens]] in his novels ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' and ''[[Little Dorrit (novel)|Little Dorrit]]'' about the [[Marshalsea]]. [[Samuel Romilly]] managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the [[Panopticon]] for the design of prisons and the use of the [[treadwheel]] as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=97}}</ref> Robert Peel's [[Gaols Act 1823|Gaols Act]] of 1823 attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the Prison Act of 1877.\n\n====19th century====\nThe American [[separate system]] attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of [[Millbank Prison]] in 1816 and [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville prison]] in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and [[Joshua Jebb]] set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year. The main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel [[Edmund Frederick du Cane]], was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1952|p=46}}</ref> In 1877 he encouraged [[Disraeli]]'s government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=153}}</ref> By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000.\n\n====1877-1914 ====\nThe British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877-1914 era a series of major  legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act of 1898 enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The Probation of Offenders Act of 1907 introduced a new  probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced  solely  for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir [[Evelyn Ruggles-Brise]]. the chair of the Prison Commission.<ref>R.C.K. Ensor. \u2018\u2019 England 1870-1914\u2019\u2019 (1937) pp 520-21.</ref><ref>J.W.

Biographer [[Paul Addison]] says. \"More than any other Home Secretary of the 20th century, Churchill was the prisoner's friend. He arrived at the Home Office with the firm conviction that the penal system was excessively harsh.\u201d He worked to reduce the number sent to prison in the first place, shorten their terms, and make life in prison more tolerable, and rehabilitation more likely.<ref>Addison, p. 51.</ref> His reforms were not politically popular, but they had a major long-term impact on the British penal system.<ref>Edward Moritz, Jr., \"Winston Churchill - Prison Reformer,\" ''The Historian'' 20#4 (1958), pp. 428-440 [https://www.jstor.org/24437567 online]</ref><ref>Victor Bailey,  \"Churchill As Home-Secretary--Prison Reform.\" ''History Today'' vol 35 (March 1985): 10-13.</ref>\n\n=====Borstal system=====\nIn 1894-5 [[Herbert Gladstone]]'s Committee on Prisons showed that criminal propensity peaked from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called ''[[Borstal]]'' after the village in [[Kent]] which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when [[Alexander Paterson (penologist)|Alexander Paterson]] became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the [[Public school (UK)|English Public school]]: cellblocks were designated as 'houses' by name and had a ''[[housemaster]]''. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the second world war when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=157\u2013161}}</ref>  Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including [[open prison]]s and housemasters, renamed ''assistant governors'' and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results. so ye\n\n===United States===\nIn colonial America, punishments were severe. The Massachusetts assembly in 1736 ordered that a thief, on first conviction, be fined or whipped. The second time he was to pay [[treble damages]], sit for an hour upon the gallows platform with a noose around his neck and then be carted to the whipping post for thirty stripes. For the third offense he was to be hanged.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=113}}</ref> But the implementation was haphazard as there was no effective police system and judges wouldn't convict if they believed the punishment was excessive. The local jails mainly held men awaiting trial or punishment and those in debt.\n\nIn the aftermath of independence most states amended their criminal punishment statutes. Pennsylvania eliminated the death penalty for robbery and burglary in 1786, and in 1794 retained it only for first degree murder. Other states followed and in all cases the answer to what alternative penalties should be imposed was incarceration. Pennsylvania turned its old jail at Walnut Street into a state prison. New York built Newgate state prison in Greenwich Village and other states followed. But by 1820 faith in the efficacy of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect on the level of crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes.\n\nIn response, New York developed the [[Auburn system]] in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at [[Auburn State Prison]] and [[Sing Sing]] at [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]]. The aim of this was [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]]: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving as a model for the family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included [[de Tocqueville]] who wrote [[Democracy in America]] as a result of his visit.\n\nHowever, by the 1860s, overcrowding became the rule of the day, partly because of the long sentences given for violent crimes, despite increasing severity inside the prison and often cruel methods of gagging and restraining prisoners. An increasing proportion of prisoners were new immigrants. As a result of a tour of prisons in 18 states, [[Enoch Wines]] and [[Theodore William Dwight|Theodore Dwight]] produced a monumental report describing the flaws in the existing system and proposing remedies.<ref>\n{{citation |title=Report on the Prisons and Reformatories of the United States and Canada|author1=Enoch Wines|author2=Theodore Dwight|year=1867|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-mgzeGoepoC}}\n</ref> Their critical finding was that not one of the state prisons in the United States was seeking the reformation of its inmates as a primary goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=172}}</ref> They set out an agenda for reform which was endorsed by a ''National Congress'' in [[Cincinnati]] in 1870. These ideas were put into practice in the [[Elmira Reformatory]] in New York in 1876 run by [[Zebulon Brockway]]. At the core of the design was an educational program which included general subjects and vocational training for the less capable. Instead of fixed sentences, prisoners who did well could be released early.\n\nBut by the 1890s, Elmira had twice as many inmates as it was designed for and they were not only the first offenders between 16 and 31 for which the program was intended. Although it had a number of imitators in different states, it did little to halt the deterioration of the country's prisons which carried on a dreary life of their own. In the southern states, in which blacks made up more than 75% of the inmates, there was ruthless exploitation in which the states leased prisoners as chain gangs to entrepreneurs who treated them worse than slaves. By the 1920s drug use in prisons was also becoming a problem.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, psychiatric interpretations of social deviance were gaining a central role in criminology and policy making. By 1926, 67 prisons employed psychiatrists and 45 had psychologists. The language of medicine was applied in an attempt to \"cure\" offenders of their criminality. In fact, little was known about the causes of their behaviour and prescriptions were not much different from the earlier reform methods.<ref name=\"morris178\">{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=178}}</ref> A system of probation was introduced, but often used simply as an alternative to suspended sentences, and the probation officers appointed had little training, and their caseloads numbered several hundred making assistance or surveillance practically impossible. At the same time they could revoke the probation status without going through another trial or other proper process.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=182}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, [[Thomas Mott Osborne]] became chairman of a commission for the reform of the New York prison system and introduced a ''[[Mutual Welfare League]]'' at Auburn with a committee of 49 prisoners appointed by secret ballot from the 1400 inmates. He also removed the striped dress uniform at Sing Sing and introduced recreation and movies. Progressive reform resulted in the \"Big House\" by the late twenties \u2013 prisons averaging 2,500 men with professional management designed to eliminate the abusive forms of corporal punishment and prison labor prevailing at the time.\n\nThe American prison system was shaken by a series of riots in the early 1950s triggered by deficiencies of prison facilities, lack of hygiene or medical care, poor food quality, and guard brutality. In the next decade all these demands were recognized as rights by the courts.<ref name=\"morris178\"/> In 1954, the ''American Prison Association'' changed its name to the ''[[American Correctional Association]]'' and the rehabilitative emphasis was formalized in the 1955 [[United Nations]] [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]].\n\nSince the 1960s the prison population in the US has risen steadily, even during periods where the crime rate has fallen. This is partly due to profound changes in sentencing practices due to a denunciation of lenient policies in the late sixties and early seventies and assertions that rehabilitative purposes do not work. As a consequence sentencing commissions started to establish minimum as well as maximum [[sentencing guidelines]], which have reduced the discretion of parole authorities and also reduced parole supervision of released prisoners.  Another factor that contributed to the increase of incarcerations was the Reagan administration's \"War On Drugs\" in the 1980s. This War increased money spent on lowering the number of illegal drugs in the United States. As a result, drug arrests increased and prisons became increasingly more crowded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/war-on-drugs-prisons-infographic_n_4914884.html|title=Just How Much The War On Drugs Impacts Our Overcrowded Prisons, In One Chart|first=Kathleen|last=Miles|date=10 March 2014|via=Huff Post}}</ref> The rising rising prison population was made up disproportionately of African American with 90% of those sentenced to prison for drug offense in Illinois in 2002.<ref>Alexander, Michelle. \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness.\" ''Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice, Edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnston, Cognella, 2019, pp. 89-94.''</ref> By 2010, the United States had more prisoners than any other country and a greater percentage of its population was in prison than in any other country in the world. \"Mass incarceration\" became a serious social and economic problem, as each of the 2.3 million American prisoners costs an average of about $25,000 per year. Recidivism remained high, and useful programs were often cut during the recession of 2009\u20132010. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' upheld the release of thousands of California prisoners due to California's inability to provide constitutionally mandated levels of healthcare.\n\nIn 2015 a bipartisan effort was launched by [[Koch family foundations]], the [[ACLU]], the [[Center for American Progress]], [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], the [[Coalition for Public Safety]], and the [[John D. and Catherine T.

The more modern use grew from the prison [[workhouse]] (known as the [[Rasphuis]]) from 1600 in Holland. The house was normally managed by a married couple, the 'father' and 'mother', usually with a work master and discipline master. The inmates, or [[journeymen]], often spent their time on spinning, weaving and fabricating cloths and their output was measured and those who exceeded the minimum received a small sum of money with which they could buy extras from the indoor father.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=68\u201372}}</ref>\n\nAn exception to the rule of forced labor were those inmates whose families could not look after them and paid for them to be in the workhouse. From the later 17th century private institutions for the insane, called the ''beterhuis'', developed to meet this need.\n\nIn Hamburg a different pattern occurred with the ''spinhaus'' in 1669, to which only infamous criminals were admitted. This was paid by the public treasury and the pattern spread in eighteenth-century Germany. In France the use of [[galley slave|galley servitude]] was most common until galleys were abolished in 1748. After this the condemned were put to work in naval [[arsenal]]s doing heavy work. Confinement originated from the ''h\u00f4pitaux g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'' which were mostly asylums, though in Paris they included many convicts, and persisted up till the [[French revolution|revolution]].\n\nThe use of capital punishment and [[judicial torture]] declined during the eighteenth century and imprisonment came to dominate the system, although reform movements started almost immediately. Many countries were committed to the goal as a financially self-sustaining institution and the organization was often subcontracted to entrepreneurs, though this created its own tensions and abuse. By the mid nineteenth century several countries initiated experiments in allowing the prisoners to choose the trades in which they were to be apprenticed. The growing amount of [[recidivism]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century led a number of [[criminologist]]s to argue that \"imprisonment did not, and could not fulfill its original ideal of treatment aimed at reintegrating the offender into the community\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=210}}</ref> Belgium led the way in introducing the [[suspended sentence]] for first-time offenders in 1888, followed by France in 1891 and most other countries in the next few years. [[Parole]] had been introduced on an experimental basis in France in the 1830s, with laws for juveniles introduced in 1850, and Portugal began to use it for adult criminals from 1861. The parole system introduced in France in 1885 made use of a strong private patronage network. Parole was approved throughout Europe at the [[International Prison Congress]] of 1910. As a result of these reforms the prison populations of many European countries halved in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nExceptions to this trend included France and Italy between the world wars, when there was a huge increase in the use of imprisonment. The National Socialist state in Germany used it as an important tool to rid itself of its enemies as crime rates rocketed as a consequence of new categories of criminal behavior. Russia, which had only started to reform its penal and judicial system in 1860 by abolishing corporal punishment, continued the use of exile with hard labor as a punishment and this was increased to a new level of brutality under [[Joseph Stalin]], despite early reforms by the [[Bolsheviks]].\n\nPostwar reforms stressed the need for the state to tailor punishment to the individual convicted criminal. In 1965, Sweden enacted a new criminal code emphasizing non-institutional alternatives to punishment including conditional sentences, [[probation]] for first-time offenders and the more extensive use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]. The use of probation caused a dramatic decline in the number women serving long-term sentences: in France the number fell from 5,231 in 1946 to 1,121 in 1980. Probation spread to most European countries though the level of surveillance varies. In the Netherlands, religious and philanthropic groups are responsible for much of the probationary care. The Dutch government invests heavily in correctional personnel, having 3,100 for 4,500 prisoners in 1959.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=218\u2013222}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite these reforms, numbers in prison started to grow again after the 1960s even in countries committed to non-custodial policies.\n\n==Theories of Incarceration and Reform==\n\n===Retribution, vengeance and retaliation===\nThis is founded on the \"[[eye for an eye]], tooth for a tooth\" incarceration philosophy, which essentially states that if one person harms another, then equivalent harm should be done to them. One goal here is to prevent [[vigilantism]], gang or clan warfare, and other actions by those who have an unsatisfied need to \"get even\" for a crime against them, their family, or their group. It is, however, difficult to determine how to equate different types of \"harm\". A literal case is where a murderer is punished with the death penalty, the argument being \"justice demands a life for a life\". One criticism of long term prison sentences and other methods for achieving justice is that such \"warehousing\" of criminals is rather expensive, this argument notwithstanding the fact that the multiple incarceration appeals of a death penalty case often exceed the price of the \"warehousing\" of the criminal in question.\nYet another facet of this debate disregards the financial cost for the most part. The argument regarding warehousing rests, in this case, upon the theory that any punishment considered respectful of human rights should not include imprisoning humans for life without a chance of release\u2014that even death is morally and ethically a higher road than no-parole prison sentences.\n\n===Deterrence===\nThe criminal is used as a \"threat to themselves and others\". By subjecting prisoners to harsh conditions, authorities hope to convince them to avoid future criminal behavior and to exemplify for others the rewards for avoiding such behavior; that is, the fear of punishment will win over whatever benefit or pleasure the illegal activity might bring. The deterrence model frequently goes far beyond \"an eye for an eye\", exacting a more severe punishment than would seem to be indicated by the crime. [[Torture]] has been used in the past as a deterrent, as has the public embarrassment and discomfort of [[stocks]], and, in religious communities, [[ex-communication]]. [[Execution (legal)|Executions]], particularly gruesome ones (such as hanging or beheading), often for petty offenses, are further examples of attempts at deterrence. One criticism of the deterrence model is that criminals typically have a rather short-term orientation, and the possibility of long-term consequences is of little importance to them. Also, their quality of life may be so horrific that any treatment within the criminal justice system (which is compatible with human rights law) will only be seen as an improvement over their previous situation. There used to be many European Monks who disagreed with the containment of the mentally ill, and their ethics had a strong influence on Dorothea Dix's mission to find a proper way to care for the challenged people.\n\n===Rehabilitation, reform and correction===\n(\"Reform\" here refers to reform of the individual, not the reform of the penal system.) The goal is to \"repair\" the deficiencies in the individual and return them as productive members of society. Education, work skills, [[deferred gratification]], treating others with respect, and self-discipline are stressed. Younger criminals who have committed fewer and less severe crimes are most likely to be successfully reformed. \"Reform schools\" and \"boot camps\" are set up according to this model. One criticism of this model is that criminals are rewarded with training and other items which would not have been available to them had they not committed a crime. <!--(this statement could be worded better-->\n\nPrior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary, then known as State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia, had established a far reaching program of voluntary group therapy with the goal of having all inmates in the prison involved. From 1967 when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been successful as many inmates did volunteer for group therapy. An interesting aspect was that the groups were to be led by two therapists, one from the psychology or social work department and a second from one of the officers among the prison guard staff.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bernard| first = Mazie| title = Prison Manifesto: Recollections of a Queer Psychologist Working in a Maximum Security Prison | publisher = Bernard Mazie | year = 2005| isbn =978-0-9769715-0-4}}</ref>\n\n===Removal from society===\nThe goal here is simply to keep criminals away from potential victims, thus reducing the number of crimes they can commit. The criticism{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} of this model is that others increase the number and severity of crimes they commit to make up for the \"vacuum\" left by the removed criminal. For example, incarcerating a [[drug dealer]] will result in an unmet demand for drugs at that locale, and an existing or new drug dealer will then appear, to fill the void. This new drug dealer may have been innocent of any crimes before this opportunity, or may have been guilty of less serious crimes, such as being a look-out for the previous drug dealer.\n\n===Restitution or repayment===\nPrisoners are forced to repay their \"debt\" to society. Unpaid or low pay work is common in many prisons, often to the benefit of the community. In some countries prisons operate as labour camps. Critics say that the repayment model gives government an economic incentive to send more people to prison. In corrupt or authoritarian regimes, such as the former Soviet Union under the control of Joseph Stalin, many citizens are sentenced to forced labour for minor breaches of the law, simply because the government requires the labour camps as a source of income. [[Community service]] is increasingly being used as an alternative to prison for petty criminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/a/anderson-justice.html |title=New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref>\n\n===Reduction in immediate costs===\nGovernment and prison officials also have the goal of minimizing short-term costs.\n\n:'''In wealthy societies:'''\n:This calls for keeping prisoners placated by providing them with things like television and conjugal visits. Inexpensive measures like these prevent prison assaults and riots which in turn allow the number of guards to be minimized. Providing the quickest possible parole and/or release also reduces immediate costs to the prison system (although these may very well increase long term costs to the prison system and society due to [[recidivism]]). The ultimate way to reduce immediate costs is to eliminate prisons entirely and use fines, community service, and other sanctions (like the loss of a driver's license or the right to vote) instead. Executions at first would appear to limit costs, but, in most wealthy societies, the long appeals process for death sentences (and associated legal costs) make them quite expensive. Note that this goal may conflict with a number of goals for criminal justice systems.\n\n:'''In poor societies:'''\n\n:Poor societies, which lack the resources to imprison criminals for years, frequently use execution in place of imprisonment, for severe crimes. Less severe crimes, such as theft, might be dealt with by less severe physical means, such as amputation of the hands. When long term imprisonment is used in such societies, it may be a virtual death sentence, as the lack of food, sanitation, and medical care causes widespread disease and death, in such prisons.\n\nSome of the goals of criminal justice are compatible with one another, while others are in conflict. In the history of prison reform, the harsh treatment, torture, and executions used for deterrence first came under fire as a violation of [[human rights]]. The salvation goal, and methods, were later attacked as violations of the individual's [[freedom of religion]]. This led to further reforms aimed principally at reform/correction of the individual, removal from society, and reduction of immediate costs. The perception that such reforms sometimes denied victims justice then led to further changes.\n\n==Advocacy Work==\n[[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] is now widely regarded as the founding father of prison reform, having travelled extensively visiting prisons across [[Europe]] in the 1770s and 1780s. Also, the great social reformer [[Jonas Hanway]] promoted \"''solitude in imprisonment'', with proper no one asked profitable labor and a spare diet\".<ref>Hanway, Jonas (1776) [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC38681714&id=8VNtvyCNiRYC&pg=PA4&dq=%22jonas+Hanway%22 Solitude in Imprisonment: With Proper Profitable Labour and a Spare Diet, the Most Humane and...] J.

Elizabeth Fry visited prisons and suggested basic human rights for prisoners, such as [[privacy]] and teaching prisoners a trade. Fry was particularly concerned with [[women's rights]]. Parliament, coming to realize that a significant portion of prisoners had come to commit crimes as a result of mental illness, passed the [[County Asylums Act 1808|County Asylums Act (1808)]]. This made it possible for [[Justice of the Peace]] in each county to build and run their own pauper asylums.\n\n''\"Whereas the practice of confining such lunatics and other insane persons as are chargeable to their respective parishes in Gaols, Houses of Correction, Poor Houses and Houses of Industry, is highly dangerous and inconvenient\"''<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Roberts, Andrew \n |title=''Table of Statutes'' \n |work=The asylums index \n |publisher=Middlesex University, London, England \n |year=1981 \n |url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm#48Geo3c96 \n |accessdate=2006-09-26 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904062428/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm \n |archivedate=2006-09-04 \n |url-status=dead \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThere is contemporary research on the use of volunteers by governments to help ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A.|date=2017-01-01|title=Accountability and Oversight of State Functions: Use of Volunteers to Monitor Equality and Diversity in Prisons in England and Wales|journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2158244017690792|doi=10.1177/2158244017690792|issn=2158-2440|doi-access=free}}</ref> Research suggests that volunteers can be effective to ensure oversight of state functions and ensure accountability, however, they must be given tasks appropriately and well trained.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===United States===\n{{see also|History of United States prison systems}}\n[[File:Johnny Cash-Nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Johnny Cash]] advocated prison reform at his July 1972 meeting with United States President [[Richard Nixon]].]]\nIn the 1800s, [[Dorothea Dix]] toured prisons in the U.S. and all over Europe looking at the conditions of the mentally handicapped. Her ideas led to a mushroom effect of asylums all over the United States in the mid-19th-century. [[Linda Gilbert]] established 22 prison libraries of from 1,500 to 2,000 volumes each, in six states.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn the early 1900s [[Samuel June Barrows]] was a leader in prison reform. President Cleveland appointed him International Prison Commissioner for the U.S. in 1895, and in 1900 Barrows became Secretary of the Prison Association of New York and held that position until his death on April 21, 1909. A Unitarian pastor, Barrows used his influence as editor of the Unitarian ''[[Christian Register]]'' to speak at meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, the National International Prison Congresses, and the Society for International Law. As the International Prison Commissioner for the U.S., he wrote several of today's most valuable documents of American penological literature, including \"Children's Courts in the United States\" and \"The Criminal Insane in the United States and in Foreign Countries\". As a House representative, Barrows was pivotal in the creation of the International Prison Congress and became its president in 1905. In his final role, as Secretary of the Prison Association of New York, he dissolved the association's debt, began issuing annual reports, drafted and ensured passage of New York's first probation law, assisted in the implementation of a federal Parole Law, and promoted civil service for prison employees. Moreover, Barrows advocated improved prison structures and methods, traveling in 1907 around the world to bring back detailed plans of 36 of the best prisons in 14 different countries. In 1910 the National League of Volunteer Workers, nicknamed the \"Barrows League\" in his memory, formed in New York as a group dedicated to helping released prisoners and petitioning for better prison conditions.\n\n[[Zebulon Brockway]] in ''Fifty Years of Prison Service'' outlined an ideal prison system: Prisoners should support themselves in prison though industry, in anticipation of supporting themselves outside prison; outside businesses and labor must not interfere; indeterminate sentences were required, making prisoners earn their release with constructive behavior, not just the passage of time; and education and a Christian culture should be imparted. Nevertheless, opposition to prison industries, the [[Prison\u2013industrial complex|prison-industrial complex]], and labor increased. Finally, U.S. law prohibited the transport of prison-made goods across state lines. Most prison-made goods today are only for government use\u2014but the state and federal governments are not required to meet their needs from prison industries. Although nearly every prison reformer in history believed prisoners should work usefully, and several prisons in the 1800s were profitable and self-supporting, most American prisoners today do not have productive jobs in prison.<ref>''[http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2008/one20in20100pdf.pdf One in 100: Behind Bars in America]'', 2008, [[Pew Center]]'s Public Safety Performance Project @ pewcenteronthestates; Stephen Garvey, \"Freeing Prisoners' Labor,\" 50 ''[[Stanford Law Review]]'' 339, 343 (1\u20131998); John Dewar Gleissner, ''Prison & Slavery \u2013 A Surprising Comparison'', Outskirts Press, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Kim Kardashian|Kim Kardashian-West]] has fought for prison reform, notably visiting the White House to visit President Donald Trump in on May 30, 2018.

In recent times prison reform ideas include greater access to [[legal counsel]] and [[family]], [[conjugal visits]], proactive security against violence, and implementing [[house arrest]] with assistive technology.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prison populations.png|thumb|right|Prison populations of various countries in 2008]]\nPrisons have only been used as the primary punishment for criminal acts in the last few centuries. Far more common earlier were various types of [[corporal punishment]], [[public humiliation]], [[Unfree labour|penal bondage]], and [[banishment]] for more severe offenses, as well as [[capital punishment]].\n\nThe concept of incarceration was presented circa 1750 as a more humane form of punishment than the aforementioned corporal and capital punishment. They originally was designed as a way for criminals to participate in religious self-reflection and self-reform as a form of penance, hence the term penitentiary.<ref>Davis, Angela Y. \"Imprisonment and Reform\" ''Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice'', edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnson, Cognella, 2019, pp. 95-102.</ref>\n\nPrisons contained both felons and debtors \u2013 the latter of which were allowed to bring in wives and children. The jailer made his money by charging the inmates for food and drink and legal services and the whole system was rife with corruption.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} One reform of the sixteenth century had been the establishment of the ''London [[Bridewell]]'' as a [[house of correction]] for women and children. This was the only place any medical services were provided.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====18th century====\nDuring the eighteenth century, British justice used a wide variety of measures to punish crime, including fines, the pillory and whipping. Transportation to The United States of America was often offered, until 1776, as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses including pilfering. When they ran out of prisons in 1776 they used old sailing vessels which came to be called ''hulks'' as places of temporary confinement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe most notable reformer was [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] who, having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, beginning when he was high sheriff of Bedfordshire, published ''The State of the Prisons'' in 1777.<ref>\n{{citation |title=The State of the Prisons in England and Wales with an account of some foreign prisons|author=John Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhNAAAAYAAJ|year=1777}}\n</ref> He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity, the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]], takes its name from John Howard.\n\nThe [[Penitentiary Act]] which passed in 1779 following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.\n\nQuakers such as [[Elizabeth Fry]] continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did [[Charles Dickens]] in his novels ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' and ''[[Little Dorrit (novel)|Little Dorrit]]'' about the [[Marshalsea]]. [[Samuel Romilly]] managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the [[Panopticon]] for the design of prisons and the use of the [[treadwheel]] as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=97}}</ref> Robert Peel's [[Gaols Act 1823|Gaols Act]] of 1823 attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the Prison Act of 1877.\n\n====19th century====\nThe American [[separate system]] attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of [[Millbank Prison]] in 1816 and [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville prison]] in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and [[Joshua Jebb]] set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year. The main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel [[Edmund Frederick du Cane]], was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1952|p=46}}</ref> In 1877 he encouraged [[Disraeli]]'s government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=153}}</ref> By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000.\n\n====1877-1914 ====\nThe British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877-1914 era a series of major  legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act of 1898 enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The Probation of Offenders Act of 1907 introduced a new  probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced  solely  for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir [[Evelyn Ruggles-Brise]]. the chair of the Prison Commission.<ref>R.C.K. Ensor. \u2018\u2019 England 1870-1914\u2019\u2019 (1937) pp 520-21.</ref><ref>J.W.

He arrived at the Home Office with the firm conviction that the penal system was excessively harsh.\u201d He worked to reduce the number sent to prison in the first place, shorten their terms, and make life in prison more tolerable, and rehabilitation more likely.<ref>Addison, p. 51.</ref> His reforms were not politically popular, but they had a major long-term impact on the British penal system.<ref>Edward Moritz, Jr., \"Winston Churchill - Prison Reformer,\" ''The Historian'' 20#4 (1958), pp. 428-440 [https://www.jstor.org/24437567 online]</ref><ref>Victor Bailey,  \"Churchill As Home-Secretary--Prison Reform.\" ''History Today'' vol 35 (March 1985): 10-13.</ref>\n\n=====Borstal system=====\nIn 1894-5 [[Herbert Gladstone]]'s Committee on Prisons showed that criminal propensity peaked from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called ''[[Borstal]]'' after the village in [[Kent]] which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when [[Alexander Paterson (penologist)|Alexander Paterson]] became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the [[Public school (UK)|English Public school]]: cellblocks were designated as 'houses' by name and had a ''[[housemaster]]''. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the second world war when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=157\u2013161}}</ref>  Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including [[open prison]]s and housemasters, renamed ''assistant governors'' and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results.\n\n===United States===\nIn colonial America, punishments were severe. The Massachusetts assembly in 1736 ordered that a thief, on first conviction, be fined or whipped. The second time he was to pay [[treble damages]], sit for an hour upon the gallows platform with a noose around his neck and then be carted to the whipping post for thirty stripes. For the third offense he was to be hanged.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=113}}</ref> But the implementation was haphazard as there was no effective police system and judges wouldn't convict if they believed the punishment was excessive. The local jails mainly held men awaiting trial or punishment and those in debt.\n\nIn the aftermath of independence most states amended their criminal punishment statutes. Pennsylvania eliminated the death penalty for robbery and burglary in 1786, and in 1794 retained it only for first degree murder. Other states followed and in all cases the answer to what alternative penalties should be imposed was incarceration. Pennsylvania turned its old jail at Walnut Street into a state prison. New York built Newgate state prison in Greenwich Village and other states followed. But by 1820 faith in the efficacy of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect on the level of crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes.\n\nIn response, New York developed the [[Auburn system]] in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at [[Auburn State Prison]] and [[Sing Sing]] at [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]]. The aim of this was [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]]: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving as a model for the family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included [[de Tocqueville]] who wrote [[Democracy in America]] as a result of his visit.\n\nHowever, by the 1860s, overcrowding became the rule of the day, partly because of the long sentences given for violent crimes, despite increasing severity inside the prison and often cruel methods of gagging and restraining prisoners. An increasing proportion of prisoners were new immigrants. As a result of a tour of prisons in 18 states, [[Enoch Wines]] and [[Theodore William Dwight|Theodore Dwight]] produced a monumental report describing the flaws in the existing system and proposing remedies.<ref>\n{{citation |title=Report on the Prisons and Reformatories of the United States and Canada|author1=Enoch Wines|author2=Theodore Dwight|year=1867|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-mgzeGoepoC}}\n</ref> Their critical finding was that not one of the state prisons in the United States was seeking the reformation of its inmates as a primary goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=172}}</ref> They set out an agenda for reform which was endorsed by a ''National Congress'' in [[Cincinnati]] in 1870. These ideas were put into practice in the [[Elmira Reformatory]] in New York in 1876 run by [[Zebulon Brockway]]. At the core of the design was an educational program which included general subjects and vocational training for the less capable. Instead of fixed sentences, prisoners who did well could be released early.\n\nBut by the 1890s, Elmira had twice as many inmates as it was designed for and they were not only the first offenders between 16 and 31 for which the program was intended. Although it had a number of imitators in different states, it did little to halt the deterioration of the country's prisons which carried on a dreary life of their own. In the southern states, in which blacks made up more than 75% of the inmates, there was ruthless exploitation in which the states leased prisoners as chain gangs to entrepreneurs who treated them worse than slaves. By the 1920s drug use in prisons was also becoming a problem.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, psychiatric interpretations of social deviance were gaining a central role in criminology and policy making. By 1926, 67 prisons employed psychiatrists and 45 had psychologists. The language of medicine was applied in an attempt to \"cure\" offenders of their criminality. In fact, little was known about the causes of their behaviour and prescriptions were not much different from the earlier reform methods.<ref name=\"morris178\">{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=178}}</ref> A system of probation was introduced, but often used simply as an alternative to suspended sentences, and the probation officers appointed had little training, and their caseloads numbered several hundred making assistance or surveillance practically impossible. At the same time they could revoke the probation status without going through another trial or other proper process.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=182}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, [[Thomas Mott Osborne]] became chairman of a commission for the reform of the New York prison system and introduced a ''[[Mutual Welfare League]]'' at Auburn with a committee of 49 prisoners appointed by secret ballot from the 1400 inmates. He also removed the striped dress uniform at Sing Sing and introduced recreation and movies. Progressive reform resulted in the \"Big House\" by the late twenties \u2013 prisons averaging 2,500 men with professional management designed to eliminate the abusive forms of corporal punishment and prison labor prevailing at the time.\n\nThe American prison system was shaken by a series of riots in the early 1950s triggered by deficiencies of prison facilities, lack of hygiene or medical care, poor food quality, and guard brutality. In the next decade all these demands were recognized as rights by the courts.<ref name=\"morris178\"/> In 1954, the ''American Prison Association'' changed its name to the ''[[American Correctional Association]]'' and the rehabilitative emphasis was formalized in the 1955 [[United Nations]] [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]].\n\nSince the 1960s the prison population in the US has risen steadily, even during periods where the crime rate has fallen. This is partly due to profound changes in sentencing practices due to a denunciation of lenient policies in the late sixties and early seventies and assertions that rehabilitative purposes do not work. As a consequence sentencing commissions started to establish minimum as well as maximum [[sentencing guidelines]], which have reduced the discretion of parole authorities and also reduced parole supervision of released prisoners.  Another factor that contributed to the increase of incarcerations was the Reagan administration's \"War On Drugs\" in the 1980s. This War increased money spent on lowering the number of illegal drugs in the United States. As a result, drug arrests increased and prisons became increasingly more crowded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/war-on-drugs-prisons-infographic_n_4914884.html|title=Just How Much The War On Drugs Impacts Our Overcrowded Prisons, In One Chart|first=Kathleen|last=Miles|date=10 March 2014|via=Huff Post}}</ref> The rising rising prison population was made up disproportionately of African American with 90% of those sentenced to prison for drug offense in Illinois in 2002.<ref>Alexander, Michelle. \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness.\" ''Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice, Edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnston, Cognella, 2019, pp. 89-94.''</ref> By 2010, the United States had more prisoners than any other country and a greater percentage of its population was in prison than in any other country in the world. \"Mass incarceration\" became a serious social and economic problem, as each of the 2.3 million American prisoners costs an average of about $25,000 per year. Recidivism remained high, and useful programs were often cut during the recession of 2009\u20132010. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' upheld the release of thousands of California prisoners due to California's inability to provide constitutionally mandated levels of healthcare.\n\nIn 2015 a bipartisan effort was launched by [[Koch family foundations]], the [[ACLU]], the [[Center for American Progress]], [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], the [[Coalition for Public Safety]], and the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]] to more seriously address criminal justice reform in the United States.<ref name=rtody>{{cite web| title =Koch brothers join Obama in advocating US prison reform| work =Russian Today| date =Jul 17, 2015| url =https://www.rt.com/usa/310128-koch-brothers-obama-prisons/}}</ref><ref name=tAtl>{{cite web| last =Ball| first =Molly| title =Do the Koch Brothers Really Care About Criminal-Justice Reform?| work =The Atlantic| date =Mar 3, 2015| url =https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/do-the-koch-brothers-really-care-about-criminal-justice-reform/386615/}}</ref><ref name=dbeast>{{cite web| last =Mak| first =Tim| title =Koch Bros to Bankroll Prison Reform| work =The Daily Beast| date =Jan 13, 2015| url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform.html}}</ref> The Kochs and their partners, are combatting the systemic overcriminalization and overincarceration of citizens from primarily low-income and minority communities.<ref name=wapos>{{cite web| last =Horwitz| first =Sari| title =Unlikely Allies| work =Washington Post| date =Aug 15, 2015| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/08/15/clemency-the-issue-that-obama-and-the-koch-brothers-actually-agree-on/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2015/1020/Congress-s-big-bipartisan-success-that-might-be-just-beginning |title=Congress's big, bipartisan success that might be just beginning | work=Christian Science Monitor | date=Oct 20, 2015 | author=Gass Henry}}</ref> The group of reformers is working to reduce recidivism rates and diminish barriers faced by rehabilitated persons seeking new employment in the work force.

The more modern use grew from the prison [[workhouse]] (known as the [[Rasphuis]]) from 1600 in Holland. The house was normally managed by a married couple, the 'father' and 'mother', usually with a work master and discipline master. The inmates, or [[journeymen]], often spent their time on spinning, weaving and fabricating cloths and their output was measured and those who exceeded the minimum received a small sum of money with which they could buy extras from the indoor father.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=68\u201372}}</ref>\n\nAn exception to the rule of forced labor were those inmates whose families could not look after them and paid for them to be in the workhouse. From the later 17th century private institutions for the insane, called the ''beterhuis'', developed to meet this need.\n\nIn Hamburg a different pattern occurred with the ''spinhaus'' in 1669, to which only infamous criminals were admitted. This was paid by the public treasury and the pattern spread in eighteenth-century Germany. In France the use of [[galley slave|galley servitude]] was most common until galleys were abolished in 1748. After this the condemned were put to work in naval [[arsenal]]s doing heavy work. Confinement originated from the ''h\u00f4pitaux g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'' which were mostly asylums, though in Paris they included many convicts, and persisted up till the [[French revolution|revolution]].\n\nThe use of capital punishment and [[judicial torture]] declined during the eighteenth century and imprisonment came to dominate the system, although reform movements started almost immediately. Many countries were committed to the goal as a financially self-sustaining institution and the organization was often subcontracted to entrepreneurs, though this created its own tensions and abuse. By the mid nineteenth century several countries initiated experiments in allowing the prisoners to choose the trades in which they were to be apprenticed. The growing amount of [[recidivism]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century led a number of [[criminologist]]s to argue that \"imprisonment did not, and could not fulfill its original ideal of treatment aimed at reintegrating the offender into the community\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=210}}</ref> Belgium led the way in introducing the [[suspended sentence]] for first-time offenders in 1888, followed by France in 1891 and most other countries in the next few years. [[Parole]] had been introduced on an experimental basis in France in the 1830s, with laws for juveniles introduced in 1850, and Portugal began to use it for adult criminals from 1861. The parole system introduced in France in 1885 made use of a strong private patronage network. Parole was approved throughout Europe at the [[International Prison Congress]] of 1910. As a result of these reforms the prison populations of many European countries halved in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nExceptions to this trend included France and Italy between the world wars, when there was a huge increase in the use of imprisonment. The National Socialist state in Germany used it as an important tool to rid itself of its enemies as crime rates rocketed as a consequence of new categories of criminal behavior. Russia, which had only started to reform its penal and judicial system in 1860 by abolishing corporal punishment, continued the use of exile with hard labor as a punishment and this was increased to a new level of brutality under [[Joseph Stalin]], despite early reforms by the [[Bolsheviks]].\n\nPostwar reforms stressed the need for the state to tailor punishment to the individual convicted criminal. In 1965, Sweden enacted a new criminal code emphasizing non-institutional alternatives to punishment including conditional sentences, [[probation]] for first-time offenders and the more extensive use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]. The use of probation caused a dramatic decline in the number women serving long-term sentences: in France the number fell from 5,231 in 1946 to 1,121 in 1980. Probation spread to most European countries though the level of surveillance varies. In the Netherlands, religious and philanthropic groups are responsible for much of the probationary care. The Dutch government invests heavily in correctional personnel, having 3,100 for 4,500 prisoners in 1959.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=218\u2013222}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite these reforms, numbers in prison started to grow again after the 1960s even in countries committed to non-custodial policies.\n\n==Theories of Incarceration and Reform==\n\n===Retribution, vengeance and retaliation===\nThis is founded on the \"[[eye for an eye]], tooth for a tooth\" incarceration philosophy, which essentially states that if one person harms another, then equivalent harm should be done to them. One goal here is to prevent [[vigilantism]], gang or clan warfare, and other actions by those who have an unsatisfied need to \"get even\" for a crime against them, their family, or their group. It is, however, difficult to determine how to equate different types of \"harm\". A literal case is where a murderer is punished with the death penalty, the argument being \"justice demands a life for a life\". One criticism of long term prison sentences and other methods for achieving justice is that such \"warehousing\" of criminals is rather expensive, this argument notwithstanding the fact that the multiple incarceration appeals of a death penalty case often exceed the price of the \"warehousing\" of the criminal in question.\nYet another facet of this debate disregards the financial cost for the most part. The argument regarding warehousing rests, in this case, upon the theory that any punishment considered respectful of human rights should not include imprisoning humans for life without a chance of release\u2014that even death is morally and ethically a higher road than no-parole prison sentences.\n\n===Deterrence===\nThe criminal is used as a \"threat to themselves and others\". By subjecting prisoners to harsh conditions, authorities hope to convince them to avoid future criminal behavior and to exemplify for others the rewards for avoiding such behavior; that is, the fear of punishment will win over whatever benefit or pleasure the illegal activity might bring. The deterrence model frequently goes far beyond \"an eye for an eye\", exacting a more severe punishment than would seem to be indicated by the crime. [[Torture]] has been used in the past as a deterrent, as has the public embarrassment and discomfort of [[stocks]], and, in religious communities, [[ex-communication]]. [[Execution (legal)|Executions]], particularly gruesome ones (such as hanging or beheading), often for petty offenses, are further examples of attempts at deterrence. One criticism of the deterrence model is that criminals typically have a rather short-term orientation, and the possibility of long-term consequences is of little importance to them. Also, their quality of life may be so horrific that any treatment within the criminal justice system (which is compatible with human rights law) will only be seen as an improvement over their previous situation. There used to be many European Monks who disagreed with the containment of the mentally ill, and their ethics had a strong influence on Dorothea Dix's mission to find a proper way to care for the challenged people.\n\n===Rehabilitation, reform and correction===\n(\"Reform\" here refers to reform of the individual, not the reform of the penal system.) The goal is to \"repair\" the deficiencies in the individual and return them as productive members of society. Education, work skills, [[deferred gratification]], treating others with respect, and self-discipline are stressed. Younger criminals who have committed fewer and less severe crimes are most likely to be successfully reformed. \"Reform schools\" and \"boot camps\" are set up according to this model. One criticism of this model is that criminals are rewarded with training and other items which would not have been available to them had they not committed a crime. <!--(this statement could be worded better-->\n\nPrior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary, then known as State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia, had established a far reaching program of voluntary group therapy with the goal of having all inmates in the prison involved. From 1967 when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been successful as many inmates did volunteer for group therapy. An interesting aspect was that the groups were to be led by two therapists, one from the psychology or social work department and a second from one of the officers among the prison guard staff.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bernard| first = Mazie| title = Prison Manifesto: Recollections of a Queer Psychologist Working in a Maximum Security Prison | publisher = Bernard Mazie | year = 2005| isbn =978-0-9769715-0-4}}</ref>\n\n===Removal from society===\nThe goal here is simply to keep criminals away from potential victims, thus reducing the number of crimes they can commit. The criticism{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} of this model is that others increase the number and severity of crimes they commit to make up for the \"vacuum\" left by the removed criminal. For example, incarcerating a [[drug dealer]] will result in an unmet demand for drugs at that locale, and an existing or new drug dealer will then appear, to fill the void. This new drug dealer may have been innocent of any crimes before this opportunity, or may have been guilty of less serious crimes, such as being a look-out for the previous drug dealer.\n\n===Restitution or repayment===\nPrisoners are forced to repay their \"debt\" to society. Unpaid or low pay work is common in many prisons, often to the benefit of the community. In some countries prisons operate as labour camps. Critics say that the repayment model gives government an economic incentive to send more people to prison. In corrupt or authoritarian regimes, such as the former Soviet Union under the control of Joseph Stalin, many citizens are sentenced to forced labour for minor breaches of the law, simply because the government requires the labour camps as a source of income. [[Community service]] is increasingly being used as an alternative to prison for petty criminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/a/anderson-justice.html |title=New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref>\n\n===Reduction in immediate costs===\nGovernment and prison officials also have the goal of minimizing short-term costs.\n\n:'''In wealthy societies:'''\n:This calls for keeping prisoners placated by providing them with things like television and conjugal visits. Inexpensive measures like these prevent prison assaults and riots which in turn allow the number of guards to be minimized. Providing the quickest possible parole and/or release also reduces immediate costs to the prison system (although these may very well increase long term costs to the prison system and society due to [[recidivism]]). The ultimate way to reduce immediate costs is to eliminate prisons entirely and use fines, community service, and other sanctions (like the loss of a driver's license or the right to vote) instead. Executions at first would appear to limit costs, but, in most wealthy societies, the long appeals process for death sentences (and associated legal costs) make them quite expensive. Note that this goal may conflict with a number of goals for criminal justice systems.\n\n:'''In poor societies:'''\n\n:Poor societies, which lack the resources to imprison criminals for years, frequently use execution in place of imprisonment, for severe crimes. Less severe crimes, such as theft, might be dealt with by less severe physical means, such as amputation of the hands. When long term imprisonment is used in such societies, it may be a virtual death sentence, as the lack of food, sanitation, and medical care causes widespread disease and death, in such prisons.\n\nSome of the goals of criminal justice are compatible with one another, while others are in conflict. In the history of prison reform, the harsh treatment, torture, and executions used for deterrence first came under fire as a violation of [[human rights]]. The salvation goal, and methods, were later attacked as violations of the individual's [[freedom of religion]]. This led to further reforms aimed principally at reform/correction of the individual, removal from society, and reduction of immediate costs. The perception that such reforms sometimes denied victims justice then led to further changes.\n\n==Advocacy Work==\n[[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] is now widely regarded as the founding father of prison reform, having travelled extensively visiting prisons across [[Europe]] in the 1770s and 1780s. Also, the great social reformer [[Jonas Hanway]] promoted \"''solitude in imprisonment'', with proper no one asked profitable labor and a spare diet\".<ref>Hanway, Jonas (1776) [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC38681714&id=8VNtvyCNiRYC&pg=PA4&dq=%22jonas+Hanway%22 Solitude in Imprisonment: With Proper Profitable Labour and a Spare Diet, the Most Humane and...] J.

Retrieved 2006-10-30</ref> Indeed, this became the popular model in England for many decades.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nWithin [[United Kingdom|Britain]], prison reform was spearheaded by the [[Quakers]], and in particular, [[Elizabeth Fry]] during the [[Victorian era|Victorian Age]]. Elizabeth Fry visited prisons and suggested basic human rights for prisoners, such as [[privacy]] and teaching prisoners a trade. Fry was particularly concerned with [[women's rights]]. Parliament, coming to realize that a significant portion of prisoners had come to commit crimes as a result of mental illness, passed the [[County Asylums Act 1808|County Asylums Act (1808)]]. This made it possible for [[Justice of the Peace]] in each county to build and run their own pauper asylums.\n\n''\"Whereas the practice of confining such lunatics and other insane persons as are chargeable to their respective parishes in Gaols, Houses of Correction, Poor Houses and Houses of Industry, is highly dangerous and inconvenient\"''<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Roberts, Andrew \n |title=''Table of Statutes'' \n |work=The asylums index \n |publisher=Middlesex University, London, England \n |year=1981 \n |url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm#48Geo3c96 \n |accessdate=2006-09-26 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904062428/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm \n |archivedate=2006-09-04 \n |url-status=dead \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThere is contemporary research on the use of volunteers by governments to help ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A.|date=2017-01-01|title=Accountability and Oversight of State Functions: Use of Volunteers to Monitor Equality and Diversity in Prisons in England and Wales|journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2158244017690792|doi=10.1177/2158244017690792|issn=2158-2440|doi-access=free}}</ref> Research suggests that volunteers can be effective to ensure oversight of state functions and ensure accountability, however, they must be given tasks appropriately and well trained.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===United States===\n{{see also|History of United States prison systems}}\n[[File:Johnny Cash-Nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Johnny Cash]] advocated prison reform at his July 1972 meeting with United States President [[Richard Nixon]].]]\nIn the 1800s, [[Dorothea Dix]] toured prisons in the U.S. and all over Europe looking at the conditions of the mentally handicapped. Her ideas led to a mushroom effect of asylums all over the United States in the mid-19th-century. [[Linda Gilbert]] established 22 prison libraries of from 1,500 to 2,000 volumes each, in six states.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn the early 1900s [[Samuel June Barrows]] was a leader in prison reform. President Cleveland appointed him International Prison Commissioner for the U.S. in 1895, and in 1900 Barrows became Secretary of the Prison Association of New York and held that position until his death on April 21, 1909. A Unitarian pastor, Barrows used his influence as editor of the Unitarian ''[[Christian Register]]'' to speak at meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, the National International Prison Congresses, and the Society for International Law. As the International Prison Commissioner for the U.S., he wrote several of today's most valuable documents of American penological literature, including \"Children's Courts in the United States\" and \"The Criminal Insane in the United States and in Foreign Countries\". As a House representative, Barrows was pivotal in the creation of the International Prison Congress and became its president in 1905. In his final role, as Secretary of the Prison Association of New York, he dissolved the association's debt, began issuing annual reports, drafted and ensured passage of New York's first probation law, assisted in the implementation of a federal Parole Law, and promoted civil service for prison employees. Moreover, Barrows advocated improved prison structures and methods, traveling in 1907 around the world to bring back detailed plans of 36 of the best prisons in 14 different countries. In 1910 the National League of Volunteer Workers, nicknamed the \"Barrows League\" in his memory, formed in New York as a group dedicated to helping released prisoners and petitioning for better prison conditions.\n\n[[Zebulon Brockway]] in ''Fifty Years of Prison Service'' outlined an ideal prison system: Prisoners should support themselves in prison though industry, in anticipation of supporting themselves outside prison; outside businesses and labor must not interfere; indeterminate sentences were required, making prisoners earn their release with constructive behavior, not just the passage of time; and education and a Christian culture should be imparted. Nevertheless, opposition to prison industries, the [[Prison\u2013industrial complex|prison-industrial complex]], and labor increased. Finally, U.S. law prohibited the transport of prison-made goods across state lines. Most prison-made goods today are only for government use\u2014but the state and federal governments are not required to meet their needs from prison industries. Although nearly every prison reformer in history believed prisoners should work usefully, and several prisons in the 1800s were profitable and self-supporting, most American prisoners today do not have productive jobs in prison.<ref>''[http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2008/one20in20100pdf.pdf One in 100: Behind Bars in America]'', 2008, [[Pew Center]]'s Public Safety Performance Project @ pewcenteronthestates; Stephen Garvey, \"Freeing Prisoners' Labor,\" 50 ''[[Stanford Law Review]]'' 339, 343 (1\u20131998); John Dewar Gleissner, ''Prison & Slavery \u2013 A Surprising Comparison'', Outskirts Press, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Kim Kardashian|Kim Kardashian-West]] has fought for prison reform, notably visiting the White House to visit President Donald Trump in on May 30, 2018.

The railway's prime purpose was to  carry [[iron ore]] from [[Mining on the Brendon Hills|mines]] to [[Watchet harbour]] in [[Somerset]], England. It was \"general practice to pick up or set down passengers .. at Torre.\"{{sfn|Sellick|1970|p=96}}\n\nThe line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the [[West Somerset Railway]] south of the village of Watchet.\n\nThe stopping place was next to a level crossing.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=230}}{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=54}}\n\n==Services==\nThe line opened for goods traffic in 1857. A passenger service began in September 1865, connecting [[Watchet (WSMR) railway station|Watchet]] with the village of [[Washford]] and the hamlets of [[Roadwater]] and Comberow.{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=44}} Passengers were carried from Comberow up a [[Cable railway|rope-hauled incline]] to {{rws|Brendon Hill}} and on to {{rws|Gupworthy}} on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=6}}\n\nThe initial passenger service consisted of four trains a day out and back.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=104-5}}\n\nLike other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in [[Cumbria]], the WSMR's fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two mixed trains a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=399}}\n\nIn 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line, reopening [[Mining on the Brendon Hills#Colton mine|Colton mine]] and starting a new bore at [[Mining on the Brendon Hills#Timwood tunnel|Timwood]].

formal station, on the [[West Somerset Mineral Railway]] (WSMR). The railway's prime purpose was to  carry [[iron ore]] from [[Mining on the Brendon Hills|mines]] to [[Watchet harbour]] in [[Somerset]], England. It was \"general practice to pick up or set down passengers .. at Torre.\"{{sfn|Sellick|1970|p=96}}\n\nThe line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the [[West Somerset Railway]] south of the village of Watchet.\n\nThe stopping place was next to a level crossing.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=230}}{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=54}}\n\n==Services==\nThe line opened for goods traffic in 1857. A passenger service began in September 1865, connecting [[Watchet (WSMR) railway station|Watchet]] with the village of [[Washford]] and the hamlets of [[Roadwater]] and Comberow.{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=44}} Passengers were carried from Comberow up a [[Cable railway|rope-hauled incline]] to {{rws|Brendon Hill}} and on to {{rws|Gupworthy}} on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=6}}\n\nThe initial passenger service consisted of four trains a day out and back.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=104-5}}\n\nLike other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in [[Cumbria]], the WSMR's fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two mixed trains a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=399}}\n\nIn 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line, reopening [[Mining on the Brendon Hills#Colton mine|Colton mine]] and starting a new bore at [[Mining on the Brendon Hills#Timwood tunnel|Timwood]]. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907{{sfn|Scott-Morgan|1980|p=10}} no passenger service was provided. The venture collapsed in March 1910.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=327}}\n\nAfter closure in 1910 the line through Torre was subject to minimal maintenance.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=35}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=349 & 360}}\n\nThe line's tracks were lifted in 1917 as a contribution to the war effort.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=35}}\n\n==Abandonment==\nWith neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=352}}\n\nEvocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp.66-67 & 76-77}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nBy 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images.

The series stars [[James Woods]]. On May 10, 2008, CBS cancelled the series after two seasons.<ref>[https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/shark-cbs-gives-james-woods-series-the-hook-no-season-three/ ''Shark: CBS Gives James Woods Series the Hook \u2014 No Season Three'']; by Trevor Kimball, TV Series Finale online; May 14, 2008</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe show revolves around Sebastian Stark (Woods), a notorious [[Los Angeles]] defense attorney who becomes disillusioned with his career after his successful defense of a wife-abuser results in the wife's death; after more than a month trying to come to grips with his situation, he is invited by the Los Angeles district attorney to become a public prosecutor so he can apply his unorthodox-but-effective talents to putting guilty people away instead of putting them back on the street. Stark's relationship with the Los Angeles [[District Attorney]]'s office, his staff, and his daughter, forms the central plot for the series.\n\n==Cast members==\n===Main cast===\n* [[James Woods]] as Sebastian Stark <small>Deputy DA</small>, is the protagonist of the series and head of the mayor's special unit. At the beginning he is not satisfied with his new job and does not get along well with his team; but he gets used to the new circumstances relatively quickly and is also almost unbeatable as a public prosecutor.\n* [[Jeri Ryan]] as Jessica Devlin <small>District Attorney (DA) first season, Assistant DA second season</small>, District Attorney and Starks supervisors. At first she is against Stark as a prosecutor; but over time she can come to terms with him and work reasonably well with him. Still, she does not always agree with Stark's methods. After her failed reelection, she is a member of Stark's team in Season 2.\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Julie Stark, Sebastian Stark's daughter. Because her parents divorced, she moves to her father in the first episode as she decided to stay with him after her custody hearing, because \"he needs her more than he'll ever know.\" Her mother went to New York City with her new partner.\n* [[Sarah Carter]] as Madeleine Poe <small>Assistant DA</small>, is a prosecutor and in the first episode she joins Stark's special unit voluntarily to learn from him. She had the highest conviction rate of the entire DA's office in the last two years prior to the show's start, and arguably the best lawyer of Stark's original team. She and Casey sleep together regularly, which does not burden or complicate the work.\n* [[Sophina Brown]] as Raina Troy <small>Assistant DA</small>, is a prosecutor. Troy is passionate, smart and tough, and described by Stark as \"brilliant\" but \"a contempt citation waiting to happen.\" Midway through the first season she begins a relationship with Stark's investigator Isaac Wright.\n* [[Samuel Page]] as Casey Woodland <small>Assistant DA (Season 1 only)</small>, is a prosecutor after his father and senator gave him this post. Only Jessica Devlin knows about it and blackmails him in the third episode so he has to provide her with information about Stark's contacts. A young, handsome lawyer from an influential family, Casey finds himself having to prove his worth to those who think he bought his way into the job. He begins a sexual relationship with Madeline Poe in spite of their disdain for each other. He left the team at the end of the first season to devote himself to his father's election campaign.\n* [[Henry Simmons]] as Isaac Wright <small>DA Investigator (Main cast (Season 1, Episode 8 \u2013 Season 2), Guest (Season 1, Episode 2))</small>, is a former police officer who was dismissed for false testimony. Stark's offer to work for him as an investigator, he takes only after much hesitation. Over time, he establishes a relationship with Raina.\n* [[Kevin Alejandro]] as Danny Reyes <small>Assistant DA (Season 2)</small>, is a prosecutor. He joined the team in the first episode of the second season. Previously, he worked in the Department of Organized Crime in L.A., where he worked primarily with Eastern European gangs. He has had the highest conviction rate among his peers in his six-year career. At first he dislikes Stark, but he quickly learns to appreciate him because he can work well with him over the law.\n*[[Alexis Cruz]] as Martin Allende <small>Assistant DA (Main cast (Season 1, Episodes 1\u201311))</small>, is a prosecutor. In episode 11, he rescues a girl in a shootout and gets shot. He dies in the hospital.\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* [[Carlos G\u00f3mez (actor)|Carlos G\u00f3mez]] as Manuel \"Manny\" Delgado <small>Mayor (recurring Season 1 \u2013 Season 2)</small>, is the acting mayor. In the first episode, he persuades Stark to change to the prosecutor. Nevertheless, he sometimes opposes him to enforce his own interests.\n* [[Shaun Sipos]] as Trevor Boyd, Julie's boyfriend (season 2)\n* [[Billy Campbell]] as Wayne Robert Callison <small>Guest star (Season 1, Episodes 12 & 22; Season 2, Episode 16)</small>, a ruthless serial killer, creative writing teacher and Stark's personal nemesis throughout season 1. He targeted emotionally damaged women in their 20s and tortured them to death by cutting them. After he is acquitted, Stark becomes obsessed with putting him behind bars.\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Leo Cutler (season 2), is district attorney and thus Stark\u2019s superior from season 2. He won the elections against Jessica Devlin and has since held her post. Stark and he dislike each other from the beginning - Stark considers him an \"incompetent ass crawler\" in his own words\n* [[Paula Marshall]] as Jordan Westlake (season 2) a young and driven state prosecutor who helps Stark when Jessica has to leave town to help her ill father (Jeri Ryan had been pregnant filming the last episodes of season 2).\n\n==Shark's rules==\n*Trial is War. Second place is death.\n*Truth is relative. Pick one that works.\n*In a jury trial, there are only 12 opinions that matter and yours (speaking to his team) is not one of them.\n\n==Broadcast history==\nThe show first aired in the 10:00&nbsp;p.m., Eastern Thursday night slot. On October 20, 2006, it was announced that CBS had picked up the show for a full 22-episode season.<ref>[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cbssharkfullseason,0,6569957.story?coll=zap-news-headlines CBS Gets Chummy With Full 'Shark' Season]</ref>\nCBS announced on May 16, 2007 that ''Shark'' would return for a second season to consist of 18 episodes, but to the [[2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike|writer's strike]], it was shortened to 16 episodes.<ref>[http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=15924&pe=1 CBS ANNOUNCES 2007-2008 PRIMETIME SCHEDULE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925063846/http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=15924&pe=1 |date=2007-09-25 }}</ref>\n\nIn Shark's second season, it moved to Sunday night at 10:00&nbsp;p.m., switching time slots with ''[[Without a Trace]]'' and thereby competing against another highly rated series, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.

The series stars [[James Woods]]. On May 10, 2008, CBS cancelled the series after two seasons.<ref>[https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/shark-cbs-gives-james-woods-series-the-hook-no-season-three/ ''Shark: CBS Gives James Woods Series the Hook \u2014 No Season Three'']; by Trevor Kimball, TV Series Finale online; May 14, 2008</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe show revolves around Sebastian Stark (Woods), a notorious [[Los Angeles]] defense attorney who becomes disillusioned with his career after his successful defense of a wife-abuser results in the wife's death; after more than a month trying to come to grips with his situation, he is invited by the Los Angeles district attorney to become a public prosecutor so he can apply his unorthodox-but-effective talents to putting guilty people away instead of putting them back on the street. Stark's relationship with the Los Angeles [[District Attorney]]'s office, his staff, and his daughter, forms the central plot for the series.\n\n==Cast members==\n===Main cast===\n* [[James Woods]] as Sebastian Stark <small>Deputy DA</small>, is the protagonist of the series and head of the mayor's special unit. At the beginning he is not satisfied with his new job and does not get along well with his team; but he gets used to the new circumstances relatively quickly and is also almost unbeatable as a public prosecutor.\n* [[Jeri Ryan]] as Jessica Devlin <small>District Attorney (DA) first season, Assistant DA second season</small>, District Attorney and Starks supervisors. At first she is against Stark as a prosecutor; but over time she can come to terms with him and work reasonably well with him. Still, she does not always agree with Stark's methods. After her failed reelection, she is a member of Stark's team in Season 2.\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Julie Stark, Sebastian Stark's daughter. Because her parents divorced, she moves to her father in the first episode as she decided to stay with him after her custody hearing, because \"he needs her more than he'll ever know.\" Her mother went to New York City with her new partner.\n* [[Sarah Carter]] as Madeleine Poe <small>Assistant DA</small>, is a prosecutor and in the first episode she joins Stark's special unit voluntarily to learn from him. She had the highest conviction rate of the entire DA's office in the last two years prior to the show's start, and arguably the best lawyer of Stark's original team. She and Casey sleep together regularly, which does not burden or complicate the work.\n* [[Sophina Brown]] as Raina Troy <small>Assistant DA</small>, is a prosecutor. Troy is passionate, smart and tough, and described by Stark as \"brilliant\" but \"a contempt citation waiting to happen.\" Midway through the first season she begins a relationship with Stark's investigator Isaac Wright.\n* [[Samuel Page]] as Casey Woodland <small>Assistant DA (Season 1 only)</small>, is a prosecutor after his father and senator gave him this post. Only Jessica Devlin knows about it and blackmails him in the third episode so he has to provide her with information about Stark's contacts. A young, handsome lawyer from an influential family, Casey finds himself having to prove his worth to those who think he bought his way into the job. He begins a sexual relationship with Madeline Poe in spite of their disdain for each other. He left the team at the end of the first season to devote himself to his father's election campaign.\n* [[Henry Simmons]] as Isaac Wright <small>DA Investigator (Main cast (Season 1, Episode 8 \u2013 Season 2), Guest (Season 1, Episode 2))</small>, is a former police officer who was dismissed for false testimony. Stark's offer to work for him as an investigator, he takes only after much hesitation. Over time, he establishes a relationship with Raina.\n* [[Kevin Alejandro]] as Danny Reyes <small>Assistant DA (Season 2)</small>, is a prosecutor. He joined the team in the first episode of the second season. Previously, he worked in the Department of Organized Crime in L.A., where he worked primarily with Eastern European gangs. He has had the highest conviction rate among his peers in his six-year career. At first he dislikes Stark, but he quickly learns to appreciate him because he can work well with him over the law.\n*[[Alexis Cruz]] as Martin Allende <small>Assistant DA (Main cast (Season 1, Episodes 1\u201311))</small>, is a prosecutor. In episode 11, he rescues a girl in a shootout and gets shot. He dies in the hospital.\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* [[Carlos G\u00f3mez (actor)|Carlos G\u00f3mez]] as Manuel \"Manny\" Delgado <small>Mayor (recurring Season 1 \u2013 Season 2)</small>, is the acting mayor. In the first episode, he persuades Stark to change to the prosecutor. Nevertheless, he sometimes opposes him to enforce his own interests.\n* [[Shaun Sipos]] as Trevor Boyd, Julie's boyfriend (season 2)\n* [[Billy Campbell]] as Wayne Robert Callison <small>Guest star (Season 1, Episodes 12 & 22; Season 2, Episode 16)</small>, a ruthless serial killer, creative writing teacher and Stark's personal nemesis throughout season 1. He targeted emotionally damaged women in their 20s and tortured them to death by cutting them. After he is acquitted, Stark becomes obsessed with putting him behind bars.\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Leo Cutler (season 2), is district attorney and thus Starks superior from season 2. He won the elections against Jessica Devlin and has since held her post. Stark and he dislike each other from the beginning - Stark considers him as an \"incompetent ass crawler\" in his own words\n* [[Paula Marshall]] as Jordan Westlake (season 2) a young and driven state prosecutor who helps Stark when Jessica has to leave town to help her ill father (Jeri Ryan had been pregnant filming the last episodes of season 2).\n\n==Shark's rules==\n*Trial is War. Second place is death.\n*Truth is relative. Pick one that works.\n*In a jury trial, there are only 12 opinions that matter and yours (speaking to his team) is not one of them.\n\n==Broadcast history==\nThe show first aired in the 10:00&nbsp;p.m., Eastern Thursday night slot.

From 879 until 1486, it was a semi-independent state ruled by the [[Counts of Provence]]. In 1481, the title passed to [[Louis XI of France]]. and in 1486 Provence was legally incorporated into France. Provence has been a part of France for over 400 years, but the people of Provence, particularly in the interior, have kept a cultural identity that persists to this day.<ref>Eduouard Baratier (editor), Histoire de la Provence, Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990, Introduction.</ref>\n\n== Prehistoric Provence==\n[[File:Calanque de Morgiou 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the [[Cosquer Cave]], decorated with paintings of penguins, bison, seals and outlines of hands dating to 27,000 to 19,000 BC, is 37 meters under the surface of the [[Calanque de Morgiou]] near [[Cassis]].]] \n[[File:Celtic Stone in Draguignan - Provence - France.JPG|thumb|250px|A bronze-age dolmen (2500 to 900 B.C.) near Draguignan]]\nThe coast of Provence has some of the earliest sites of human habitation known in Europe.

Evidence found at the Grotte du Vallonnet shows they were more scavengers than hunters, using tools to scrape meat from the carcasses of bison, deer, rhinoceros, horses and other game killed by [[saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed tigers]], tigers, panthers and other predators.<ref>Lumley, ''La Grande Histoire des premiers europeens'', pg. 125.</ref> They endured two ice ages, which caused dramatic changes in climate, vegetation and even sea level. At the beginning of the paleolithic period, the sea level in western Provence was 150 meters higher than it is today. By the end of the paleolithic, it had dropped 100 to 150 meters lower than today's sea level. The cave dwellings of the early inhabitants of Provence were inundated by the rising sea or left far from the sea and swept away by erosion.<ref>(see Escalon de Fonton, ''L'Homme avant l'histoire'', pg. 16-17)</ref>\n\nIn 1985, a diver named Henri Cosquer discovered the mouth of a submarine cave 37 meters below the surface of the [[Calanque de Morgiou]] near Marseille. Inside, the walls of the [[Cosquer Cave]] are decorated with drawings of bisons, seals, penguins, horses and outlines of human hands, dating to between 27,000 and 19,000 BC.<ref>Aldo Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Ouest-France, 2001</ref>\n\nBeginning in about 8,500 BC, at the end of the Neolithic period, the climate of Provence began to warm again.<ref name=\"Mus\u00e9e d pg. 13\">Mus\u00e9e d'histoire de Marseille, ''L'Antiquite'' (Catalog of the Museum of History of Marseille, pg. 13</ref> The sea rose gradually to its present level, and the forests began to retreat.

Inspired by imported pottery from the eastern Mediterranean, in about 6000 BC they created the first pottery made in France.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Escalon de Fonton, ''L'Homme avant l'histoire'', pg). 16-17</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, another wave of new settlers from the east, the [[Chass\u00e9en culture|Chass\u00e9ens]], arrived in Provence. They were farmers and warriors, and gradually displaced the pastoral people from their lands. They were followed in about 2500 BC by another wave of settlers, also farmers, known as the Courronniens, who arrived by sea and settled along the coast of what is now the French department of [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Ligures and Celts in Provence==\n[[File:Salyens villes map-fr.svg|thumb|right|250px|The peoples of Provence before the Roman conquest]]\nIn the 4th century BC a people known by the Greeks and Romans as the [[Ligures]] inhabited Provence from the Alps to the [[Rh\u00f4ne]].

Palanque, ''Ligures, Celts et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34.</ref> They were also warlike; they invaded Italy and went as far as Rome in the 4th century BC, and they later aided the passage of [[Hannibal]] on his way to attack Rome (218 BC).\n\nSome time between the 8th and 5th centuries BC, tribes of [[Celts]], probably coming from Central Europe, also began moving into Provence. They had weapons made of iron, which allowed them to defeat the Ligures, who were still armed with bronze weapons. One tribe, called the Segobriga, settled near modern-day Marseille. The [[Caturiges]], [[Tricastin]]s, and [[Cavares]] settled to the west of the [[Durance]] River.<ref>J. R. Palanque, \"Ligures, Celts et Grecs\", in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34</ref>\n\nThe Ligures were more numerous than the Celtic peoples, and the Celto-Ligures eventually shared the territory of Provence, each tribe in its own alpine valley or settlement along a river, each with its own king and dynasty. They built hilltop forts and settlements, later given the Latin name ''[[oppidum|oppida]]''. Today the traces of 165 ''oppida'' have been found in the [[Var (department)|Var]] and as many as 285 in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]].<ref name=\"R. Palanque, Pg. 34\">J. R. Palanque, ''Ligures, Celts et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34.</ref> They worshiped aspects of nature, establishing sacred woods at [[Sainte-Baume]] and [[G\u00e9menos]], and healing springs at [[Glanum]] and Vern\u0117\u00e8gues. Later, in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the tribes formed confederations; the [[Vocontii]] from the [[Is\u00e8re]] to the [[Vaucluse]]; the [[Cavares]] in the [[Comtat Venaissin|Comtat]]; and the [[Salyens]], from the [[Rh\u00f4ne River]] to the Var.\n\nThe Celto-Ligures used the Rh\u00f4ne River to trade iron, silver, alabaster, marble, gold, resin, wax, honey and cheese with other tribes in Gaul. [[Etruscan society|Etruscan]] traders from Italy began to visit the coast. Etruscan [[amphorae]] from the 7th and 6th centuries BC have been found in Marseille, [[Cassis]], and in hilltop ''oppida'' in the region.<ref name=\"R. Palanque, Pg. 34\"/>\n\nTraces of the Celts and Ligures remain today in the ruins of their hilltop fortresses, in [[dolmens]] and other [[megalith]]s found in eastern Provence, in the stone shelters called 'Bories' found in the [[Luberon]] and [[Comtat]], and in the rock carvings in the [[Vall\u00e9e des Merveilles|Valley of Marvels]] near [[Mont B\u00e9go]] in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]], at an altitude of 2,000 meters.<ref name=\"R.

Rhodes pottery from that century has been found in [[Marseille]], near [[Martigues]] and [[Istres]], and at mont Garou and [[\u00c9venos]] near [[Toulon]]. The traders from Rhodes gave their names to the ancient town of Rhodanousia (now [[Trinquetaille]], across the Rh\u00f4ne River from [[Arles]]) and to the main river of Provence, the Rhodanos, today known as the Rh\u00f4ne River.<ref>J.R. Palanque, ''Ligures, Celtes et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 39.</ref>\n\nThe first permanent Greek settlement was [[Marseille|Massalia]], established at modern-day [[Marseille]] in about 600 BC by colonists coming from [[Phocaea]] (now [[Fo\u00e7a]], in modern Turkey) on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast of [[Asia Minor]]. A second wave of colonists arrived in about 540, when Phocaea was destroyed by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]].<ref name=\"R. Palanque, pg. 41\">R. Palanque, ''Ligures, Celtes et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 41.</ref>\n\nMassalia became one of the major trading ports of the ancient world. At its height, in the 4th century BC, it had a population of about 6,000 inhabitants, on about fifty hectares surrounded by a wall. It was governed as an aristocratic [[republic]], by an assembly of the 600 wealthiest citizens. It had a large temple of the cult of [[Apollo]] of [[Delphi]] on a hilltop overlooking the port and a temple of the cult of [[Artemis]] of Ephesus at the other end of the city. [[Drachma]] coins minted in Massalia were found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Traders from Massalia ventured into France on the [[Durance]] and Rh\u00f4ne rivers, established overland trade routes to Switzerland and Burgundy, and travelled as far north as the [[Baltic Sea]]. They exported their own products: local wine, salted pork and fish, aromatic and medicinal plants, coral and cork.<ref name=\"R.

They founded Citharista ([[La Ciotat]]), Tauroeis ({{ILL|Le Brusc|fr}}), Olbia (near [[Hy\u00e8res]]), Pergantion ([[Fort de Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on|Breganson]]), Caccabaria ([[Cavalaire]]), Athenopolis ([[Saint-Tropez]]), Antipolis ([[Antibes]]), Nikaia ([[Nice]]), and Monoicos ([[Monaco]]). They had a strong cultural influence on the interior of Provence &mdash; the Salyen ''oppidum'' of [[Glanum]] had villas and an outdoor public meeting area built in the classical Greek style.<ref>Anne Roth Cong\u00e8s, ''Glanum - De l'oppidum salyen \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 latine'', Editions du Patrimoine, Centre des Monuments Nationaux, 2010</ref>\n\nThe most famous citizen of Massalia was the mathematician, astronomer and navigator [[Pytheas]]. Pytheas made mathematical instruments which allowed him to establish almost exactly the [[latitude]] of Marseille. He was the first scientist to observe that the tides were connected with the phases of the moon. Between 330 and 320 BC he organized an expedition by ship into the Atlantic and as far north as England; he visited [[Iceland]], [[Shetland]], and Norway, where he was the first scientist to describe drift ice and the midnight sun. Though he hoped to establish a sea trading route for tin from [[Cornwall]], his trip was not a commercial success, and it was not repeated. The Massalians found it cheaper and simpler to trade with Northern Europe over land routes.<ref>R.

The Romans sent sixty ships with two legions led by [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] to Massalia in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept Hannibal.<ref>J.R. Palanque, \"Le Rattachement a l'Empire Romaine\", section in Edouard Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 53.</ref> In 207 BC, when [[Hasdrubal Barca]] led another Carthaginian army to attack Rome, Rome and Massalia became allies again. The Roman orator [[Cicero]] referred to Massalians as \"The most faithful allies of the Romans.\"<ref>''Pro Fonteio'', addresses by Cicero.</ref>\n\nThe Massalians had good trade relations with peoples throughout Gaul. They were not a great military power and often had difficult relations with their neighbors, the Ligurian and Celtic Gauls. In the 2nd century BC the Massalians appealed to Rome for help against the Gauls. They did not understand that Rome wanted subjects, not allies.\n\nIn 181 BC at the request of Massalia, the Romans suppressed Ligurian [[pirate]]s based along the coast between [[Genoa]] and [[Albenga]]. Then, in 154 BC, when a Roman ambassador was abused and attacked at [[Cagnes]], the Roman [[consul]] {{ILL|Quintus Opimius|fr}} led an army into Provence and defeated the [[Oxybii]] and the [[Deciates]]. Rome re-established the authority of Massalia along the coast from the rock of [[Monaco]] to the mouth of the [[Argens River]]\n\nIn 125 BC, an alliance of Celtic peoples, the [[Salyes]], threatened Massalia itself. In 125 a Roman army led by the consul [[Marcus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 125 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Flaccus]] crossed the Alps by either the [[Col de Montgen\u00e8vre]] or [[Maddalena Pass|Col de Larche]], marched along the valley of the Durance, and subdued the Ligures of [[Barcelonette]], the [[Vocontii]] and the Salyes. The following year another Roman army, led by [[Gaius Sextius Calvinus]], marched into Provence and captured the capital of the Salyes, the hilltop fortress of [[Oppidum d'Entremont]], as well as the sanctuary of [[Roquepertuse]] and the ''oppida'' of [[Saint-Blaise, Alpes-Maritimes|Saint-Blaise]] and Baou Roux.<ref>J.R. Palanque, ''Le Rattachement a l'Empire Romaine'', section in Edouard Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 53. Palanque notes that excavations of these hilltop forts found traces of the Roman siege, including stone balls weighing six kilograms that had been thrown by Roman catapults. See also Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 9</ref>\n\nAfter the battle Sextus Calvinus destroyed the hilltop fortress of Entremont. At the foot of the hill, where [[thermal spring]]s were located, he founded a new town, called ''Aquae Sextiae'' (\"The Waters of Sextius\"). Later it became known simply as Aix, then as [[Aix-en-Provence]].<ref>The historian [[Strabo]], telling the story of [[Sextius Calvinus]], called Aix \"the city which took his name.\" Cited by J.R. Palanque in \"La Rattachement a l'Empire Romain\" in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 54</ref>\n\nIn 122 BC the Romans faced a new uprising of the Gauls, led by another Salye chief, Teutonmotulus, who was joined in his uprising by the [[Arverni]] and the [[Allobroges]]. A new Roman consul, [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 122 BC)|Dimitius Ahenobargus]], met the Gauls with a new and terrifying weapon, elephants, and was able to defeat the much larger Gallic army at the battle of [[B\u00e9darrides|Vindalium]] on the [[Sorgue]] River.\n\nIn 121 BC a new Roman army led by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus]] came to Provence to reinforce Domitius. Domitius defeated a Gallic army of Allobroges and Arverni on the plains of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley. One hundred thousand Gauls were killed in the battle. After the battle Domitius claimed the entire territory between Italy and Spain as a Roman province. In 118 BC, at the mouth of the [[Aude River]], his soldiers founded the first Roman colony outside of Italy, called ''Narbo Martius'' (later [[Narbonne]]). Within this territory, only the Greek port colony of Massalia remained independent.<ref>J.R. Palanque in \"La Rattachement a l'Empire Romain in Baratier\", ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 54</ref>\n\nIn 109 BC Provence faced a new invasion from the north. An enormous migration of Celto-Germanic tribes, the [[Teutons]] and [[Cimbri]], left the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast and moved south into Gaul, looking for a new homeland. They moved into the Rh\u00f4ne Valley and in 105 BC defeated the Roman legions of [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]] and Servilus Caepio at [[Battle of Arausio|Arausio]] (the modern town of [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]]).\n\nThe Romans sent one of their best generals, [[Gaius Marius]], to Provence with six legions to block the path of the Teutons and Cimbri toward Italy. Gaius Marius waited patiently for two years, while the Teutons and Cimbri ventured into Spain and northern Gaul. The Roman general kept his soldiers busy digging a canal next to the Rh\u00f4ne River between Arles and [[Fos-sur-Mer|Fos]], allowing his soldiers to be supplied from the sea and also making navigation much easier through the Rh\u00f4ne delta. In 102 BC the Cimbres went east while the Teutons and their new allies, the [[Ambrones]] marched south through Provence, heading toward northern Italy. Gaius Marius met them near Aix in the autumn of 102 BC and defeated them, killing, according to [[Plutarch]], one hundred thousand Teutons and Ambrones. Italy and Provence were safe from invasion for a century afterward.<ref>J.R. Palanque in \"La Rattachement a l'Empire Romain\" in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 56-57</ref>\n\nThe most famous of the proconsuls of the new province called [[Narbonensis]] was [[Julius Caesar]], who governed it from 58 to 49 BC. He was rarely there, using Narbonensis as a supply base for his famous wars against the Gauls further north.(See [[Gallic Wars]].)\n\nUntil this time the city of Massalia had guarded its independence and profited from its alliance with Rome. However, in 49 BC, when the struggle for the leadership of Rome began between [[Pompey the Great]] and Julius Caesar, the leaders of Massalia made the fatal decision to back Pompey. (See [[Caesar's Civil War]]). Caesar immediately sent an army to Massalia and besieged the city. He built long trenches around the town, as he had done against the Gauls at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]]; and cut down the sacred forests of the Ligures to build [[siege tower]]s. He also had a dozen warships built at [[Arles]] and his new fleet, led by his [[legatus|legate]] [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], defeated the Massalian fleet off the isles of the [[Frioul archipelago]], and blockaded the city from the sea. Disease ravaged the population. In September 49 BC, the soldiers of Caesar's legate [[Trebonius]] breached the walls of Massalia and captured it. The Massalians paid a heavy price for backing Pompey; the city lost its independence, had to surrender its warships and treasury, and was forced to give up all of its territories on the coast and interior, except for the [[:wikt:Stoechades|Stoechades]] islands and [[Nice]].<ref>J.R. Palanque in \"La Rattachement a l'Empire Romain in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 58</ref>\n\nThe final phase of the Roman conquest of Provence took place between 24 BC and 14 BC, when the Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]] sent an army to conquer the last Ligurian tribes, around modern [[Sisteron]], [[Digne]], [[Castellane]] and other mountainous valleys, who still resisted Roman domination. In 8 BC the Emperor [[Augustus]] built a triumphal monument at [[La Turbie]] to commemorate the final pacification of the region.<ref>J.R.

During this period, all of Provence, from the Alps to the [[Pyren\u00e9es]], for the first time had the same language, administration, currency and culture. Residents of Provence felt secure enough to give up their fortified hilltop towns and move down into the plains. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote \"it was more than a province, it was another Italy.\"<ref>Cited by Jean-Remy Palanque, ''Le rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'' pg. 66</ref>\n\nIn addition to the vast province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]], which reached all the way to Spain, with its capital at [[Narbonne]], in 7 BC the Emperor [[Augustus]] created [[Alpes Maritimae]], where the Alps met the Mediterranean, with its capital at {{ILL|Cemenelum|fr}} (now [[Cimiez]]), in the hills above present-day [[Nice]]; and also created a small client kingdom called [[Alpes Cottiae]], in the Alps along the Italian border further north, with its capital at ''Segusium'', the modern-day [[Susa]] in [[Piedmont]]. The Emperor [[Nero]] officially made Alpes Cottiae a Roman province in 67 AD.<ref name=\"Jean-Remy Palanque pg. 63\">Jean-Remy Palanque, ''Le rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'' (pg. 63</ref> The purpose of these new provinces was to secure the passes of the Alps for the passage of Roman armies and traders.\n\nThe Romans established twenty-five towns and a common system of administration throughout Provence. Julius Caesar created three [[coloniae]], or colonies, for the veterans of his legions at Forum Julii (now [[Fr\u00e9jus]]), [[Arles]] and Arausio (now [[Orange, Vaucluse]]. Citizens of these towns had the full rights of Roman citizens, including the right to vote. The Emperor August founded seven more colonies of Roman army veterans at [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]], [[Avignon]], [[Carpentras]], [[Cavaillon]] [[Die, Dr\u00f4me|Die]], [[Digne]], and [[Riez]].\n\nOther types of towns, classified as either [[municipia]] or [[civitates]], were founded throughout the rest of Provence. Some of the capital towns or villages of Gallic tribes were transformed into Roman ''municipia''; The capital of the [[Brigantes]] tribe became the Roman ''muncipium'' of [[Brian\u00e7on]]. The residents of these ''muncipia'' and ''civitates'' had most of the rights and obligations of Roman citizens, but no vote.<ref>Jean-Remy Palanque, ''Le rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'' (pg. 60)</ref>\n\nTo connect these towns and allow easy movement of Roman armies between Italy and Spain or up the Rhone Valley, Roman engineers constructed a series of new roads, solidly built and regularly maintained. The oldest was the [[Via Domitia]], built in 118 BC, which went all the way from the [[Col de Montgen\u00e8vre]], the easiest crossing point of the Alps, through [[Sisteron]], [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]] and [[Cavaillon]] to [[Tarascon]] on the Rhone River, and then along the coast to [[Narbonne]] and to Spain. The [[Via Aurelia]] ran from Italy to the Rhone Valley, passing through Cimiez, [[Fr\u00e9jus]], and Aix. The [[Via Agrippa]] ran up the Rhone Valley from Arles to Lyon, through Avignon, Orange, and Valence. It was completely rebuilt six times during the height of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"Jean-Remy Palanque pg. 63\"/>\n\nAfter Massalia lost its independence and its territories, the town of Arles became the most important economic center of Provence. It had inherited the territories taken from Massalia, it had the most important bridge across the Rhone, and it was the meeting point of the [[trade route]]s along the coast and up and down the Rhone River. The major products of Provence were wheat, oil, pork, mutton, the sausages and other preserved meats of Avignon and Arles, and fish from Antibes and Fr\u00e9jus. The Emperor [[Domitian]] banned the planting of [[vineyard]]s in Provence, but the region around Marseille still produced famous wines and all the cities of Provence imported wines from Italy.<ref>Jean-Remy Palanque, \"Le rattachement a l'Empire Romain\", in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'' (pg. 64)</ref> \n \nArles and the other towns of Provence were the showcases of Roman wealth, culture and power. The Roman [[amphitheater]] at Arles could seat twenty thousand spectators. Roman engineers and architects built monuments, theaters, baths, villas, fora, arenas and [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s throughout Provence, many of which still exist. (See [[Architecture of Provence]].)\n\nThe [[Pax Romana]] in Provence lasted until the middle of the third century. [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes invaded Provence in 257 and 275.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} At the beginning the 4th century, the court of Roman Emperor [[Constantine]] (280-337) was forced to take refuge in Arles. By the end of the 5th century, Roman power in Provence had vanished, and an age of invasions, wars, and chaos began.\n\n==The end of the Roman Empire and the arrival of Christianity (3rd-6th centuries AD) ==\nIn 297, the Emperor [[Diocletian]] redrew the provincial borders within the Roman Empire, dividing Gallia Narbonensis into two provinces. The new province east of the Rhone was called [[Septem Provinciae|Viennensis]], after its capital, [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]]. In 397, this new province was split in two; The Province of Vienne kept the Rhone Valley, Arles and Vienne, while a new province, called Narbonensis the Second, was created, with its capital at Aix. The Romans also added new layers of administration, called ''dioceses'' and ''prefectures'', and new officials to govern the provinces.\n\nDuring the late 3rd century, invasions of the [[Franks]] and [[Alemanni]] ravaged other parts of Roman Gaul, but Provence was largely spared. The high walls of Arles and Marseille successfully resisted barbarian invaders. The ports of Provence prospered, thanks to their trade with the Roman Mediterranean world. [[Toulon]] produced the special purple dye used for the robes of the Emperors. Marseille developed a profitable commerce, first importing and then making elaborate carved sacrophogi for the wealthy residents of all of Gaul. Communities of Syrians, Phoenicians and Jews settled in Marseille and Arles. Arles built a new port on the right bank of the Rhone, and in 418 the Roman Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] wrote of Arles that \"All the riches of the orient, perfumes of Arabia, delicacies of [[Assyria]], are found in such abundance there that one would believe they were the products of the countryside.\"<ref>Jean Remy Palanque, ''La Desagregation du monde antique'', in Histoire de Provence, Privat, Toulon, 1990. pg. 76.</ref> The circus and amphitheater of Arles were still being used for Roman games in the 4th century. The [[Emperor Constantine]] himself visited Arles in 314 and 316. The Emperors [[Avitus]] and [[Majorian|Majorien]], among the last of the Roman emperors, resided there respectively in 455 and 459.<ref name=\"Jean Remy Palanque, pg. 78\">Jean Remy Palanque, pg. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Frejus Cathedral Baptistery.jpg|thumb|upright|The baptistery of Fr\u00e9jus Cathedral (5th century) is still in use]]\n\nDuring Roman times the people of Provence worshiped a wide variety of gods and religions; they worshiped goddesses of fecundity (called ''[[Matres and Matronae|matres]]''), gods living in springs of fresh water (such as the ''Vediantiae'' at Cimiez); gods of nature (the mistral wind, worshipped as ''Circius''); and [[Mont Sainte-Victoire]], worshipped under its Ligure name, ''Vintur''. They worshiped deities which combined Roman and Ligure-Celtic gods, such as ''[[Toutatis|Mars-Teutates]]'', worshiped at Aix and Orange. In the large cities, they worshiped the traditional Roman gods and goddesses: [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]] were worshiped in Arles and Aix. In Marseille, they worshiped the Greek goddesses of the sea.\n\nSince the time of Julius Caesar, they also worshiped the official cult of the Roman emperors and later the empresses. From the time of Emperor [[Vespasian]], an official of this cult, called the ''[[Flamen Divi Julii|flamen Augusti]]'', was designated each year to oversee worship of the emperors, placing their busts and shrines throughout Provence.<ref name=\"Rattachement a l pg. 68\">''Le Rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', pg. 68.</ref>\n\nLater in the Empire, Eastern cults began to take hold in Provence: traces of the cult of [[Mithra]] have been found in Arles, [[Vaison]] and Glanum; of the Syrian god [[Baal]] in Marseille; and the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]] at Marseille and Arles; and most popular of all, [[Cybele]], the \"mother of deities\", worshiped at Marseille, Arles, Vence, Vaison, Riez, and Die.<ref name=\"Rattachement a l pg. 68\"/>\n\nThere were many legends about the earliest Christians in Provence. One claimed that the bishop of Arles, Lazarus, buried at Marseille, was the same [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] healed by Jesus; another claimed that his sister Martha came to Provence to convert [[Tarascon]]; another popular legend claimed that Saints [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary Salome]] and [[Mary Jacobe]] came to [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]] in the [[Camargue]] by boat and settled in the mountains at [[Sainte-Baume]]. A skull which is described as that of Mary Magdalene is displayed in the basilica of [[Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume]]. These legends first appeared during the [[Carolingian]] period. Relics claiming to be those of the Three Marys were discovered in the 15th century and put on display. However, there is no other historical evidence to support these legends.<ref>''Le Rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', pg. 71.</ref>\n\nIn the second quarter of the 3rd century the Christian Church in Rome began to send missionaries to evangelize Provence. By Catholic tradition, the first bishops in Provence were [[Trophimus of Arles]] and [[Paul of Narbonne]]. There were active churches and bishops in Arles in 254, in [[Marseille]] in 314, in [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]], in [[Vaison]] and [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]] in 314, in [[Cavaillon]], [[Digne]], [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], and [[Fr\u00e9jus]] at the end of the 4th century, [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 408, [[Carpentras]], Avignon, [[Riez]], Cimiez and [[Vence]] in 439, [[Antibes]] in 442, [[Toulon]] in 451, [[Senez]] in 406, [[Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch\u00e2teaux]] in 517; and [[Gland\u00e8ves]] in 541.<ref>Aldo Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', (pg. 13.)</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 4th century, with the conversion and baptism of Constantine, Christianity became the official religion of the Empire. Later, under the Emperors [[Gratian]] and [[Theodosius]], Christianity was not only permitted, it was required. Churches were built in all the large cities of Provence, usually near the city walls, and often using the sites and even the pillars and other architectural elements of old Roman temples. A [[baptistry]] was usually constructed next to the church. The oldest still-existing Christian structure in Provence is the baptistery of the cathedral in Fr\u00e9jus, dating from the 5th century. By the 5th century there were twenty-one [[bishop]]s in Provence, and chapels on the large estates and churches in almost every town.\n\nAt about the same time, in the 5th century, the first two monasteries in Provence were founded: [[L\u00e9rins Abbey|L\u00e9rins]], on an island near [[Cannes]] and [[St. Victor's Abbey, Marseille|Saint-Victor]] in Marseille. The monasteries became the centers of learning and religious doctrine for Provence and for much of Gaul. Monks from Lerins Abbey became bishops in Arles, Cimiez, Vence, Riez, and other cities in Provence; they actively promoted the cult of saints, local [[martyr]]s, and of the [[Virgin Mary]].<ref name=\"Jean Remy Palanque, pg. 78\"/>\n\n== Barbarians and Merovingians in Provence (5th\u20136th centuries)==\n[[File:Visigothic buckle MNMA Cl8871.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Visigothic buckle, found in the Visigothic necropolis at [[Tressan]]]]\n\nIn 412, the [[Visigoths]] of [[Alaric I|Alaric]], after capturing Rome itself and the death of their leader, passed through Provence on their way to [[Aquitaine]] and Spain, and occupied the entire region between the Atlantic and the Rh\u00f4ne. They unsuccessfully attacked Arles in 425, 452, and 458. But Roman power could no longer defend Provence. An army of [[Burgundians]] swept down the Rh\u00f4ne Valley as far as Valence and the valley of the Durance River. In 471 an army of [[Visigoths]] led by [[Euric]] defeated the army of the Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]]. The valley of the lower Rhone was ravaged by the [[Visigoths]], and Arles was threatened with famine. In 476 the last emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]] was deposed in [[Ravenna]], and Euric entered Arles and Marseille without a battle.<ref>Jean-R\u00e9my Palanque, ''La Desagregation du monde antique'', in ''Histoire de la Provence'', edited by Edouard Baratier. Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990.</ref>\n\nWith the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Visigoths and Burgundians divided Provence. The Visigoths ruled the lands south of the Durance River, while the Burgundians ruled the lands to the north. The Visigoths took two thirds of the lands and slaves for themselves; the Burgundians took half.{{clarify|date=February 2018}} The barbarians installed their own system of government: Each city was ruled by a count (''comes''), and a group of cities was ruled by a duke (''dux''). The arrival of the barbarians brought a decline to the fortunes of Arles and a resurgence of Marseille, which imported spices and other goods from around the Mediterranean.\n\nThe rule of the Visigoths in Provence was short-lived; their king, [[Alaric II]], was defeated by [[Clovis I]], King of the [[Franks]], in 507. The Burgundians, allied with the Franks, tried to take all of Provence for themselves. They were stopped by another barbarian power, the [[Ostrogoths]], led by [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], who entered Provence, lifted the Burgundian siege of Arles, and took Marseille and Avignon in 508. Theodoric was both a barbarian king and an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; under his rule Provence was officially, though loosely, attached to the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nThe rule of the Ostrogoths lasted little more than thirty years. After the death of Theodoric the [[Merovingian]] kings of the Franks gradually claimed the [[Goths|Gothic]] territories; in 532 they annexed Burgundy and laid siege to Arles. In 536, the Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian]] ceded all of Provence to the [[Merovingian]] kings.\n\nThe Merovingians were the first northern European rulers to govern Provence. They had their capitals in [[Soissons]], [[Metz]], [[Paris]], [[Orl\u00e9ans]], and [[Reims]], and rarely visited the south. After 561, Provence was split between two distant Merovingian kings; [[Sigebert I]], the king of [[Austrasia]], ruled Marseille, Aix and Avignon, while [[Guntram]], the King of [[Burgundy]], ruled the eastern part of Provence.\n\nThe second half of the 6th century was a terrible time for Provence; the region suffered continual conflicts between the two kings, attacks by [[Lombards]] and [[Saxon]] raiders, and epidemics of [[plague (disease)|plague]] and other diseases. [[Irrigation]] works built by the Romans fell into ruins and the fields which the Romans had drained in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley turned back into marshes. Roman buildings and [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] were not maintained. The amphitheater at Arles and the theater at Orange were abandoned and filled with residences. Populations left the cities and moved to fortified villages on the hilltops. The only city to thrive was the port of Marseille, supported by its commerce with the east.\n\nOne enduring legacy of the Merovingian rule is the current northern boundary of Provence; beginning at this time, the name \"Provincia\" was given to the Ostrogoth and Visigoth territories south of a line midway between the [[Is\u00e8re (river)|Is\u00e8re]] and the Durance rivers.<ref>[[Jean-R\u00e9my Palanque]], \"La Desagregation du monde antique\", in ''Histoire de la Provence'', edited by Edouard Baratier.

The Frankish [[Mayor of the Palace]], [[Charles Martel]], defeated the Arabs at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732 and kept them from advancing further north, but the Arabs remained a formidable power on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nIn 736 Arles and Marseille and other towns of western Provence rebelled against Charles Martel, and installed their own leader. Charles Martel invaded Provence and recaptured and punished the rebel towns. In 737 the cities of Provence rebelled again, this time calling for help from the Arabs. Once again Charles Martel sent an army to Provence, capturing [[Avignon]] and massacring a large part of the population. The rebellion broke out again in 739, and Charles Martel was forced to bring in [[Lombards|Lombard]] warriors from Italy as allies to fight the Arabs and bring Provence under control.<ref>Edouard Baratier, \"Entre Francs et Arabes\", in ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990</ref>\n\nThe reign of [[Charlemagne]] over the Frankish kingdom (768-814) brought a period of relative calm and order to Provence, but the region was desperately poor; the coastal and river trade that had made Provence such a prosperous part of the Roman Empire had halted, and the region was reduced to living from the cultivation of its poor and rocky soil.\n\nWhen the successors of Charlemagne began to quarrel and divide the empire, the troubles of Provence began again. Invaders came by sea to raid the coast and the Rhone Valley. In 838 Marseille was captured and devastated by Arab [[pirate]]s, who destroyed the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|Abbey of Saint Victor]]. In 849 the city was attacked again, this time by [[Byzantine]] pirates. Arles was pillaged in 842 but resisted an Arab attack in 850. During the same period, a band of [[Normans]] arrived by sea from the Atlantic and settled in the [[Camargue]], using it as a base to raid the towns on the coast and in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley.<ref>Edouard Baratier, \"Entre Francs et Arabes\", in ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990, pg. 102-103</ref>\n\nIn 855, following the death of the Carolinian Emperor [[Lothair I]], a kingdom of Provence was briefly created for his third son Charles. It was composed of the lands between the Rh\u00f4ne, the Alps and the Mediterranean, and reached north as far as [[Uz\u00e8s]], [[Viviers, Ard\u00e8che|Viviers]] and [[Lyon]]. When Charles died eight years later, this first kingdom of Provence became the southern part of the new [[Kingdom of Burgundy]].\n\nThe Carolingian Empire continued to disintegrate as the successors quarreled. When the Emperor [[Charles the Bald]] died in 879, his brother-in-law, [[Boso of Provence]] (also known as Boson) brought together the high clergy and the principal counts of southeast France at Mantaille, near [[Vienne]], and had himself declared King of Provence. He was immediately challenged by the other Carolingian rulers because he was not of Carolingian blood, and had to flee into the mountains of [[Diois]], but refused to renounce the throne. The situation was confused until he died in 887, and his widow, Ermengarde, who was of Carolingian blood, had their son Louis adopted by the Emperor [[Charles the Fat]]. This solved the problem of legitimacy and succession; Louis was crowned King of an independent kingdom of Provence in 890.<ref>Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990, pg. 104-105</ref>\n\n== First Counts of Provence==\nFor four centuries Provence was ruled by a series of Counts or Marquises of Provence. They were nominally [[vassal]]s of the crumbling [[Carolingian Empire]], of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Catalonia]], or the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but in practice they were independent rulers. \n\t\nThe [[Bosonids]] were the descendants of [[Boso the Elder]], whose grandson [[Boso of Provence]] became king. [[Louis the Blind]], the son of the younger Boso, was not satisfied with Provence, and aspired to become King of Italy and Emperor, basing his claim on the fact that he was grandson of the Carolingian Emperor [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis II]]. He had some success at first, and was crowned Emperor by [[Pope Benedict V]] in Rome in 901, but then was defeated and captured by his rival, [[Berengar I of Italy]]. He promised to leave Italy forever, and Berengar released him, but the following year he attacked Italy again. He was again captured by Berengar at a battle at [[Verona]] and blinded for breaking his promise. He was sent back to Provence, where he ruled until his death in 928.\n\nDuring the last part of the reign of Louis the Blind, Provence was effectively governed by his cousin, [[Hugh of Italy]], also known as Hugh of Arles. Hugh moved the capital of Provence from Vienne to Arles, and when Louis died took the title Duke of Provence. Hugh, like Louis, aspired to become King of Italy, but with more success. When Berengar died, Hugh claimed the title and was crowned in [[Pavia]] in 926. He ruled both Italy and Provence for twenty years. He made Provence a [[fief]] of [[Rudolph I of Burgundy]] in exchange for preserving his power in Italy. But finally he was chased out of Italy and forced to return to Arles, where he became a monk and died in 948.\n\nWith the death of Hugh, the title of Count of Provence passed to [[Conrad of Burgundy]], the King of Burgundy, also known as Conrad the Peaceful, who named the counts of Arles, Avignon and Apt, and viscounts of Cavaillon and Marseille, all of whom were of Burgundian origin.<ref>Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in the collection ''Histoire de Provence''. pg. 106.</ref> Of these, Count [[Rotbold I, Count of Provence|Rotbald]] of Arles would give rise to a new dynasty who would became the Counts of Provence, beginning with his son Boson, who last appears in 965/7. They would control the county for the next century and a half.\n\n==Expulsion of the Saracens==\n[[File:Abbaye Saint-Victor (Marseille).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille]] was destroyed by Saracen pirates in either 731 or 838 then rebuilt in the 11th century]]\nWhile Louis the Blind and Hugh had been occupied in Italy, the Muslim [[Saracens]] in Provence had established a base on the coast called [[Fraxinetum]], near modern-day [[Saint-Tropez]], from which they controlled the mountains of the [[Massif des Maures]] and the coast between modern Fr\u00e9jus and Hy\u00e8res.<ref>Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in the collection ''Histoire de Provence''. pg. 108.</ref> Between 900 and 910, and 925 and 940, the Saracens raided throughout Provence. They usually avoided walled towns but attacked isolated villas and monasteries. They raided from the Rh\u00f4ne as far east as the Italian Riviera, to [[Albenga]] and [[Sanremo]], and north to the alpine valleys of [[Piedmont]], where they pillaged the monasteries of San Dalmazzo near [[Cuneo]] and [[Novalaise]] near Suse.<ref name=\"autogenerated109\">Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in the collection ''Histoire de Provence''. pg. 109.</ref>\n\nLouis the Blind attempted to expel the Saracens from Provence without success. [[Hugh of Italy]] enlisted the Byzantine fleet to blockade Fraxinetum, and was preparing an attack, when an uprising in Italy forced him to cancel his plans.\n\nIn 973, the Saracens captured Mayeul, the [[abbot]] of the monastery at [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluny]], and held him for ransom. The ransom was paid and the abbot was released. [[William I of Provence|Count William I]], the Count of Arles, organized an army with the help of allied soldiers from Piedmont, and defeated the Saracens near [[La Garde-Freinet]] at the [[Battle of Tourtour]]. The Saracens who were not killed at the battle were forcibly baptized and made into slaves, and the remaining Saracens in Provence fled the region.\n\nThe expulsion of the Saracens in 973 became an epic event in the history and legends of Provence. William became known as \"William the Liberator.\" He distributed the lands taken from the Saracens between Toulon and Nice to his entourage. His descendants became the recognized leaders of Provence, above the other counts of the region.<ref name=\"autogenerated109\"/>\n\nDuring this long period of wars and banditry in Provence, the population retreated to walled cities, maritime trade was rare, and little new art or architecture, other than fortification, was created. The [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al language]] was formed, based on Latin and closer to Latin than the French spoken in northern France. In the 11th century Proven\u00e7al terms began to appear, mixed with Latin, in documents.<ref>Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in the collection ''Histoire de Provence''. pg. 119.</ref>\n\n==Catalan dynasty (12th-13th century)==\n[[File:Ramon Berenguer III.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Catalan [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer I]], Count of Provence, in the Castle in Fos, painted by [[Mari\u00e0 Fortuny]] ([[Reial Acad\u00e8mia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi]], on deposit at the Palace of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]], [[Barcelona]]).]]A war between [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and his rival, the German Emperor [[Conrad the Salic]], in 1032 led to Provence becoming a fiefdom of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which it remained until 1246. Within the family of the Counts, shared inheritance was practiced from the start of the 11th century, leading to two lines each using the title of Count. The claim of one of these lines, sometimes using the title of [[Margrave]]s of Provence, passed by marriage to [[William III, Count of Toulouse]]. This led to a long-standing Toulouse claim to the County, finally resolved by partition in 1125. A similar situation resulted in another partition in the next generation, one branch retaining a smaller County of Provence, the other the [[County of Forcalquier]]. These were reunited by an intra-dynastic marriage in 1193.\n\nIn 1112, a descendant of Count William I, [[Douce I, Countess of Provence]], married the Catalan [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona]], who as a result became Raymond Berenguer I, Count of Provence. He ruled Provence from 1112 until 1131, and his descendants, the '''Catalan Dynasty''', ruled Provence until 1246. In 1125, Provence was divided; the part of Provence north and west of the [[Durance River]] went to the [[Count of Toulouse]], while the lands between the [[Durance]] and the Mediterranean, and from the Rhone River to the Alps, belonged to the Counts of Provence. The capital of Provence was moved from Arles to Aix-en-Provence, and later to [[Brignoles]].<ref>''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 16</ref>\n[[File:Arles kirche st trophime fassade.jpg|thumb|upright|The Church of [[Saint-Trophime d'Arles|Saint Trophime]] in [[Arles]] (12th century]]\n\nFollowing the [[Crusades]], international commerce began to resume in the ports of the Mediterranean and along the Rh\u00f4ne River. The port of Marseille flourished again. A new city built on the Petit-Rhone, [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|Saint-Gilles]], became a transit point for cloth from [[Flanders]] and spices and the products of the eastern Mediterranean. [[Tarascon]] and [[Avignon]] on the Rh\u00f4ne became important trading ports.\n\nDuring the 12th century some of the cities of Provence became virtually autonomous. They were ruled by consuls, formally under the Counts of Provence but with considerable authority. Consulates existed in Avignon in 1229, 1131 in Arles, between 1140 and 1150 in Tarascon, Nice and Grasse, and 1178 in Marseille. Marseille went farther than the others, establishing a ''confrerie'' or charitable and religious organization of the one hundred leaders of the professions, crafts and businesses in the city, which drew up a code of justice and municipal regulations. Several Proven\u00e7al cities directly negotiated commercial treaties with the republics of [[Pisa]] and [[Genoa]] in Italy. Other cities, however, such as Aix, Toulon, Hy\u00e8res, Digne, Cavaillon and Carpentras, remained under the authority of the Counts. In the 13th century the counts of Provence suppressed most of the consulats, but the seeds of civil liberty and democracy had been planted in the cities.<ref>''Marquisat et Comtes en Provence'', pg. 147-149</ref>\n\n==Cathedrals and monasteries in Provence (12th century)==\n\nUnder the Catalan dynasty, the 12th century saw the construction of important [[cathedrals]] and [[abbeys]] in Provence, in a harmonious new style, the [[romanesque architecture]], which united the [[Gallo-Roman]] style of the Rhone Valley with the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] style of the Alps. [[Aix Cathedral]] was built on the site of the old Roman forum, and then rebuilt in the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] style in the 13th and 14th centuries. The [[Church of St. Trophime]] in Arles was a landmark of [[Romanesque architecture]], built between the 12th and the 15th centuries. A vast fortress-like monastery, [[Montmajour Abbey]], was built on an island just north of Arles, and became a major destination for medieval [[pilgrim]]s.\n\nIn the 12th century three [[Cistercian]] monasteries were built in remote parts of Provence, far from the political intrigues of the cities. [[S\u00e9nanque Abbey]] was the first, established in the [[Luberon]] between 1148 and 1178. [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] was founded in a remote valley near [[Draguignan]] in 1160. [[Silvacane Abbey]], on the Durance River at [[La Roque-d'Anth\u00e9ron]], was founded in 1175.\n\n==France, Toulouse and Catalonia battle for Provence==\nIn the early 13th century a religious and political struggle in neighboring [[Languedoc]] upset the existing order in Provence. [[Pope Innocent III]] sent missionaries and then soldiers to suppress the [[Cathar]] religious movement in [[Languedoc]]. The Pope accused [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse]] of supporting the Cathars, excommunicated him, and invited an army of French knights on a [[crusade]] to cleanse the south of France of the [[heresy]]. A war began in Provence between the French knights and the soldiers of Raymond VI and his son [[Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse|Raymond VII]].\n\nSoldiers from Tarascon, Marseille and Avignon joined the army of the Counts of Provence to fight the French. The French commander, [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], was killed at the siege of Toulouse in 1218. Then Raymond VI died in 1222, and a dispute over his lands in Provence began. King [[Louis VIII of France]] decided to intervene, and a French royal army marched down the valley of the Rh\u00f4ne and laid siege to Avignon. The city held out for three months but was finally forced by hunger to surrender. Avignon was forced to destroy its ramparts and accept a French castle on the other side of the river, and by a treaty signed in Paris on April 12, 1229, the part of Provence west of the Rhone River that had belonged to the Counts of Toulouse became part of France.<ref>''Marquisant et Comtes en Provence'', pg. 157</ref>\n[[File:Statue Raimond B\u00e9renger IV.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Statue of Ramon Berenguer in Aix Cathedral]]\nBeginning in 1220, Provence east of the Rhone had a new ruler, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence|Ramon Berenguer IV]], of the Catalan dynasty. He was the first Count of Provence to actually reside in Provence permanently, usually living with his court in Aix. He launched a military campaign to impose his authority over the cities of Provence, ending the independence of [[Grasse]] and Tarascon, occupying Nice, which had tried to ally with Genoa; and founding a new town, Barcelonette, in the far east of Provence, near the Italian border.\n\nThe ambitions of Ramon Berenguer were energetically resisted by the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VII, who had lost most of his own territory to France. Raymond VII became an ally of Marseille and Avignon in their fight against Ramon Berenguer. In 1232 his army devastated the territories of Ramon Berenguer around Tarascon and Arles.\n\nRamon Berenguer responded to this attack by strengthening his alliance with France; he married his daughter, Marguerite, to King [[Louis IX of France]], and appealed to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], for support. In exchange for his support, Frederic demanded that the cities of Arles and Avignon be governed by the Holy Roman Empire. A prolonged struggle took place between Raymond VII and his allies, the cities of Marseille and Avignon, against Ramon Berenguer for authority in Provence. Arles was [[blockade]]d and all traffic on the Rhone River stopped.\n\nThe French army finally intervened to help Ramon Berenguer, the French king's father-in-law. Raymond VII was forced to abandon his quest, and Ramon Berenguer was able to appoint his own candidate as bishop of Avignon and to subdue the rest of eastern Provence. When Ramon Berenguer died in 1245, not quite forty years old, he controlled all of Provence between the Rh\u00f4ne and Italian border except the rebellious city of Marseille.<ref>''Marquisat et Comptes en Provence'', pg. 156-57</ref>\n\nRamon Berenguer had four daughters, but no sons. After his death his youngest daughter and heiress, [[Beatrice of Provence|Beatrice]], married [[Charles I of Naples|Charles, Count of Anjou]], the youngest son of [[Louis VIII of France]]. Provence's fortunes became even more closely tied to the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]].<ref>Basti\u0117, ''Histoire de la Provence''</ref>\n\n== Popes in Avignon (14th century) ==\n[[File:Fa\u00e7ade du Palais des Papes.jpg|thumb|The [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the [[Palais des Papes]].]]In 1309, [[Pope Clement V]], who was originally from [[Bordeaux]], moved the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Papacy]] to Avignon. From 1309 until 1377, seven Popes reigned in Avignon before the [[Western Schism]] between the Roman and Avignon churches, which led to rival popes in each place. After that three [[Antipopes]] reigned in Avignon until 1423, when the Papacy finally returned to Rome. Between 1334 and 1363 Pope [[Benedict XII]] built the Papal Palace in Avignon, and [[Clement VI]] built the New Palace; together the [[Palais des Papes]] was the largest gothic palace in Europe.<ref>Basti\u0117, ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 20.</ref>\n\nThe 14th century was a terrible time in Provence, and all of Europe: the population of Provence had been about 400,000 people; the [[Black Death]] (1348\u20131350) killed fifteen thousand people in Arles, half the population of the city, and greatly reduced the population of the whole region. The defeat of the French Army during the [[Hundred Years' War]] forced the cities of Provence to build walls and towers to defend themselves against armies of former soldiers who ravaged the countryside.\n\nThe Angevin rulers of Provence also had a difficult time. An assembly of nobles, religious leaders, and town leaders of Provence organized to resist the authority of Queen [[Joan I of Naples]] (1343\u20131382). She was murdered in 1382 by her cousin and heir, [[Charles III of Naples|Charles of Durazzo]], who started a new war, leading to the separation of Nice, [[Puget-Th\u00e9niers]] and [[Barcelonnette]] from Provence in 1388, and their attachment to the territories of [[Savoy]].\n\n== Good King Ren\u00e9, the last ruler of Provence ==\n[[File:Nicolas Froment 004.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of the ''Burning Bush'' triptych by Nicolas Froment, showing Ren\u00e9 and his wife Jeanne de Laval]]\nThe 15th century saw a series of wars between the Kings of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the Counts of Provence. In 1423 the army of [[Alphonse V of Aragon]] captured Marseille, and in 1443 captured Naples and forced its ruler, King [[Ren\u00e9 I of Naples]], to flee. He eventually settled in one of his remaining territories, Provence.\n\nHistory and legend has given Ren\u00e9 the title \"Good King Ren\u00e9 of Provence\", though he only lived in Provence in the last ten years of his life, from 1470 to 1480, and his political policies of territorial expansion were costly and unsuccessful. Provence benefitted from population growth and economic expansion, and Ren\u00e9 was a generous patron of the arts, sponsoring painters [[Nicolas Froment]], [[Louis Br\u00e9a]], and other masters. He also completed one of the finest castles in Provence at [[Tarascon]], on the Rhone River.\n\nWhen Ren\u00e9 died in 1480, his title passed to his nephew [[Charles IV, Duke of Anjou|Charles du Maine]]. One year later, in 1481, when Charles died, the title passed to [[Louis XI of France]]. Provence was legally incorporated into the French royal domain in 1486.\n\n== Provence becomes French (1486 to 1789) ==\n{{See also|Massacre of M\u00e9rindol|Waldensians}}\nSoon after Provence became part of France, it became involved in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] that swept the country in the 16th century. Between 1493 and 1501, many Jews were expelled from their homes and sought sanctuary in the region of Avignon, which was still under the direct rule of the Pope. In 1545, the [[Parliament of Aix-en-Provence]] ordered the destruction of the villages of [[Lourmarin]], [[M\u00e9rindol]] and [[Cabri\u00e8res-d'Avignon]] in the [[Luberon]], because their inhabitants were [[Waldensians|Vaudois]] of Italian [[Piedmontese]] origin, and were not considered sufficiently orthodox Catholics. Most of Provence remained strongly Catholic, with only one enclave of [[Protestants]], the principality of [[Orange, Vaucluse]], an enclave ruled by Prince [[William the Silent]] (1533\u20131584) of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] of the Netherlands, which was created in 1544 and was not incorporated into France until 1673. An army of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] laid siege to the Protestant city of [[M\u00e9nerbes]] in the [[Vaucluse]] between 1573 and 1578. The wars did not stop until the end of the 16th century, with the consolidation of power in Provence by the [[House of Bourbon]] kings.\n\n[[File:Vernet-toulon-1.jpg|thumb|View of Toulon Harbour around 1750, by [[Joseph Vernet]].]]\n[[File:Vernet-marseille-1754.jpg|thumb|left|Marseille in 1754, by Vernet]]\n\nThe semi-independent [[Parliament of Aix-en-Provence]] and some of the cities of Provence, particularly Marseille, continued to rebel against the authority of the Bourbon king. After uprisings in 1630\u201331 and 1648\u20131652, the young King [[Louis XIV]] had two large forts, [[Fort Saint-Jean (Marseille)|Fort Saint-Jean]] and {{ILL|Fort St. Nicholas, Marseille|fr|Fort Saint-Nicolas (Marseille)}}, built at the harbor entrance to control the city's unruly population.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] began to build a naval arsenal and dockyard at [[Toulon]] to serve as a base for a new French Mediterranean fleet. The base was greatly enlarged by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], the minister of [[Louis XIV]], who commissioned his chief military engineer, [[Vauban]] to strengthen the fortifications around the city.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, Provence had a population of about 450,000 people.<ref name=\"Basti\u00e9, pg. 35\">Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', (pg. 35)</ref> It was predominantly rural, devoted to raising wheat, wine, and olives, with small industries for tanning, pottery, perfume-making, and ship and boat building.

The cities of Marseille, [[Toulon]], Avignon and Aix-en-Provence saw the construction of boulevards and richly decorated private houses.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century Provence suffered from the economic malaise of the end of the reign of Louis XIV. The [[Plague (disease)|plague]] struck the region between 1720 and 1722, beginning in Marseille, killing some 40,000 people. Still, by the end of the century, many artisanal industries began to flourish; making [[perfumes]] in [[Grasse]]; olive oil in Aix and the [[Alpilles]]; textiles in Orange, Avignon and Tarascon; [[faience]] pottery in Marseille, Apt, [[Aubagne]], and [[Moustiers-Sainte-Marie]]. Many immigrants arrived from [[Liguria]] and Piedmont in Italy. By the end of the 18th century, Marseille had a population of 120,000 people, making it the third-largest city in France.<ref name=\"Basti\u00e9, pg. 35\"/>\n\n== French Revolution ==\n{{Main|French Revolution}} \nThough most of Provence, with the exception of Marseille, Aix and Avignon, was rural, conservative and largely royalist, it did produce some memorable figures in the [[French Revolution]]:\n* [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]] from Aix, who tried to moderate the Revolution, and turn France into a [[constitutional monarchy]] like England; \n* [[Marquis de Sade]] from [[Lacoste]] in the Luberon, who was a deputy from the far left in the National Assembly; \n* [[Charles Barbaroux]] from Marseille, who sent a battalion of volunteers to Paris to fight in the [[French Revolutionary Army]];\n* [[Emmanuel-Joseph Siey\u00e8s]] (1748\u20131836), an abbot, essayist and political leader, who was one of the chief theorists of the French Revolution, [[French Consulate]], and First French Empire, and who, in 1799, was the instigator of the coup d'\u00e9tat of [[18 Brumaire]], which brought [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to power.\n[[File:Marche-des-marseillois.jpg|thumb|left|La Marseillaise 1792]] \nProvence also produced the most memorable song of the period, [[La Marseillaise]]. The song was originally written by a citizen of [[Strasbourg]], [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]] in 1792. It was originally a war song for the revolutionary [[Army of the Rhine (1791\u20131801)|Army of the Rhine]]. It became famous when sung on the streets of Paris by the volunteers from Marseille, who had heard it in Marseille sung by a young volunteer from [[Montpellier]] named [[Fran\u00e7ois Mireur]]. It became the most popular song of the French Revolution and in 1879 became the national anthem of France.\n\nThe French Revolution was as violent and bloody in Provence as it was in other parts of France. On April 30, 1790, Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille was besieged, and many of the soldiers inside were massacred. On October 17, 1791 a massacre of royalists and religious figures took place in the ice storage rooms (''glaciere'') of the prison of the [[Palais des Papes|Palace of the Popes]] in Avignon.\n\nWhen the radical [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnard]]s seized power from the [[Girondins]] in May 1793, a real counter-revolution broke out in Avignon, Marseille and Toulon. A revolutionary army under [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Carteaux]] recaptured Marseille in August 1793 and renamed it \"City without a Name\" (''Ville sans Nom''). In Toulon, the opponents of the Revolution handed the city to a British and Spanish fleet on August 28, 1793. A Revolutionary Army laid siege to the British positions for four months (see the [[Siege of Toulon]]), and finally, thanks to the enterprise of the young commander of artillery, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], defeated the British and drove them out in December, 1793. About 15,000 royalists escaped with the British fleet, but five to eight hundred of the 7,000 who remained were shot on the [[Champ de Mars]], and Toulon was renamed \"Port la Montagne\".\n\nThe fall of the Montagnards in July 1794 was followed by a new [[First White Terror|White Terror]] aimed at the revolutionaries. Calm was only restored by the rise of Napoleon to power in 1795.\n\n== Provence under Napoleon I ==\nNapoleon restored the property and power of the families of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] in Provence. The British fleet of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] blockaded Toulon, and almost all maritime commerce was stopped, causing hardship and poverty. When Napoleon was defeated, his fall was celebrated in Provence. When he escaped from [[Elba]] on March 1, 1815, and landed at [[Golfe-Juan]], he detoured to avoid the cities of Provence, which were hostile to him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n== Provence in the 19th century ==\n[[File:Marseille port c1825.jpg|thumb|Marseille in 1825]]\nProvence enjoyed prosperity in the 19th century; the ports of Marseille and Toulon connected Provence with the expanding [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] in North Africa and the Orient, especially after the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869.\n\nIn April\u2013July 1859, [[Napoleon III]] made a secret agreement with the [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour|Count of Cavour]], Prime Minister of [[Piedmont]], for France to assist in expelling Austria from the [[Italian peninsula]] and bringing about a united Italy, in exchange for Piedmont ceding [[Savoy]] and the Nice region to France. He went to war with Austria in 1859 and won a victory at [[Solferino]], which resulted in Austria ceding [[Lombardy]] to Piedmont, and, in return, Napoleon received Savoy and Nice in 1860, and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]] and [[Menton]] in 1861.\n\nThe railroad connected Paris with Marseille in 1848 and then with Toulon and Nice in 1864. Nice, [[Antibes]] and Hy\u00e8res became popular winter resorts for European royalty, including [[Queen Victoria]]. Under Napoleon III, Marseille grew to a population of 250,000, including a very large Italian community. Toulon had a population of 80,000. Large cities like Marseille and Toulon saw construction of churches, opera houses, grand boulevards, and parks.\n\nAfter the fall of [[Louis Napoleon]] following his defeat in the [[Franco-German War]] barricades went up in the streets of Marseille on March 23, 1871 and the Communards, led by [[Gaston Cremieux]] and following the lead of the [[Paris Commune]], took control of the city. The Commune was crushed by the army and Cremieux was executed on November 30, 1871. Though Provence was generally conservative, it often elected reformist leaders; Prime Minister [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]] was the son of a Marseille grocer, and future prime minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] was elected deputy from the Var in 1885.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century saw a revival of the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] language and culture, particularly traditional rural values, driven by a movement of writers and poets called the [[F\u00e9librige]], led by poet [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]]. Mistral achieved literary success with his work ''[[Mir\u00e8io]]'' (''Mireille'' in French); he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for literature in 1904.\n\n== Provence in the 20th century ==\nBetween World War I and World War II Provence was bitterly divided between the more conservative rural areas and the more radical big cities. There were widespread strikes in Marseille in 1919, and riots in Toulon in 1935.\n\nAfter the defeat of France by Germany in June 1940, France was divided into an occupied zone and unoccupied zone, with Provence in the unoccupied zone. Parts of eastern Provence were occupied by Italian soldiers. [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Collaboration]] and passive resistance gradually gave way to more active resistance, particularly after [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941 and the [[Communist Party]] became active in the [[French Resistance]]. [[Jean Moulin]], the deputy of [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of the [[Free France]] resistance movement, parachuted into [[Eygali\u00e8res]] in the [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]] on January 2, 1942 to unite the diverse resistance movements in all of France against the Germans.\n\nIn November 1942, following Allied landings in North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), the Germans occupied all of Provence ([[Operation Attila (WW II)|Operation Attila]]) and then headed for Toulon ([[Case Anton]]). The French fleet at Toulon sabotaged its own ships to keep them from falling into German hands.\n\nThe Germans began a systematic rounding-up of French Jews and refugees from Nice and Marseille. Many thousands were taken to concentration camps, and few survived. A large quarter around the port of Marseille was emptied of inhabitants and dynamited, so it would not serve as a base for the resistance. Nonetheless, the resistance grew stronger; the leader of the pro-German militia in Marseille, the [[Milice]], was assassinated in April 1943.\n\nOn August 15, 1944, two months after the Allied landings in Normandy ([[Operation Overlord]]), the [[Seventh United States Army]] under General [[Alexander M. Patch]], with a [[Free French]] corps under General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]], landed on the coast of the Var between [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|St. Raphael]] and [[Cavalaire]] ([[Operation Dragoon]]). The American forces moved north toward [[Manosque]], [[Sisteron]] and [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], while the French [[1st Armored Division (France)|First Armored Division]] under General [[Jean Touzet du Vigier]] liberated [[Brignoles]], [[Salon-de-Provence|Salon]], Arles, and Avignon. The Germans in Toulon resisted until August 27, and Marseille was not liberated until August 25.\n[[File:Avignon tgv station.jpg|thumb|upright|Avignon TGV station, 2001]]\nAfter the end of the war, Provence faced an enormous task of repair and reconstruction, particularly of the ports and railroads destroyed during the war. As part of this effort, the first modern concrete apartment block, the [[Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation]] of [[Corbusier]], was built in Marseille in 1947\u201352. In 1962, Provence absorbed a large number of French citizens who had left Algeria after its independence. Since that time, large North African communities have settled in and around the big cities, particularly Marseille and Toulon.\n\nIn the 1940s, Provence underwent a cultural renewal, with the founding of the [[Avignon Festival]] of theatre (1947), the reopening of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] (begun in 1939), and many other major events. With the building of new highways, particularly the Paris-Marseille autoroute which opened in 1970, Provence became a destination for mass tourism from all over Europe. Many Europeans, particularly from Britain, bought summer houses in Provence. The arrival of the [[TGV]] high-speed trains shortened the trip from Paris to Marseille to less than four hours.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, the residents of Provence were struggling to reconcile economic development and population growth with their desire to preserve the landscape and culture that make Provence unique.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Timeline of Provence|fr|3=Chronologie de la Provence}}\n\n;Cities in Provence\n* [[Timeline of Aix-en-Provence]]\n* [[Timeline of Marseille]]\n* [[Timeline of Toulon]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===General histories of Provence===\n*Edouard Baratier (editor), ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990 ({{ISBN|2-7089-1649-1}})\n*Aldo Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Ouest-France, 2001.\n*Martin Garrett, 'Provence: a Cultural History' (2006)\n*James Pope-Hennessy, ''Aspects of Provence'' (1988)\n*Denizeau, Gerard, ''Histoire Visuelle des Monuments de France'', Larousse, 2003\n\n===Prehistoric, Celto-Ligurian, Greek and Roman Provence===\n*Henry de Lumley, ''La Grand Histoire des premiers hommes europeens'', Odile Jacob, 2007.

Evidence found at the Grotte du Vallonnet shows they were more scavengers than hunters, using tools to scrape meat from the carcasses of bison, deer, rhinoceros, horses and other game killed by [[saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed tigers]], tigers, panthers and other predators.<ref>Lumley, ''La Grande Histoire des premiers europeens'', pg. 125.</ref> They endured two ice ages, which caused dramatic changes in climate, vegetation and even sea level. At the beginning of the paleolithic period, the sea level in western Provence was 150 meters higher than it is today. By the end of the paleolithic, it had dropped 100 to 150 meters lower than today's sea level.

They had weapons made of iron, which allowed them to defeat the Ligures, who were still armed with bronze weapons. One tribe, called the Segobriga, settled near modern-day Marseille. The [[Caturiges]], [[Tricastin]]s, and [[Cavares]] settled to the west of the [[Durance]] River.<ref>J. R. Palanque, \"Ligures, Celts et Grecs\", in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34</ref>\n\nThe Ligures were more numerous than the Celtic peoples, and the Celto-Ligures eventually shared the territory of Provence, each tribe in its own alpine valley or settlement along a river, each with its own king and dynasty. They built hilltop forts and settlements, later given the Latin name ''[[oppidum|oppida]]''. Today the traces of 165 ''oppida'' have been found in the [[Var (department)|Var]] and as many as 285 in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]].<ref name=\"R. Palanque, Pg. 34\">J. R.

Later, in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the tribes formed confederations; the [[Vocontii]] from the [[Is\u00e8re]] to the [[Vaucluse]]; the [[Cavares]] in the [[Comtat Venaissin|Comtat]]; and the [[Salyens]], from the [[Rh\u00f4ne River]] to the Var.\n\nThe Celto-Ligures used the Rh\u00f4ne River to trade iron, silver, alabaster, marble, gold, resin, wax, honey and cheese with other tribes in Gaul. [[Etruscan society|Etruscan]] traders from Italy began to visit the coast.

At its height, in the 4th century BC, it had a population of about 6,000 inhabitants, on about fifty hectares surrounded by a wall. It was governed as an aristocratic [[republic]], by an assembly of the 600 wealthiest citizens. It had a large temple of the cult of [[Apollo]] of [[Delphi]] on a hilltop overlooking the port and a temple of the cult of [[Artemis]] of Ephesus at the other end of the city. [[Drachma]] coins minted in Massalia were found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Traders from Massalia ventured into France on the [[Durance]] and Rh\u00f4ne rivers, established overland trade routes to Switzerland and Burgundy, and travelled as far north as the [[Baltic Sea]]. They exported their own products: local wine, salted pork and fish, aromatic and medicinal plants, coral and cork.<ref name=\"R. Palanque, pg. 41\"/>\n\nThe Massalians established a series of small colonies and trading posts along the coast, which later became towns. They founded Citharista ([[La Ciotat]]), Tauroeis ({{ILL|Le Brusc|fr}}), Olbia (near [[Hy\u00e8res]]), Pergantion ([[Fort de Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on|Breganson]]), Caccabaria ([[Cavalaire]]), Athenopolis ([[Saint-Tropez]]), Antipolis ([[Antibes]]), Nikaia ([[Nice]]), and Monoicos ([[Monaco]]). They had a strong cultural influence on the interior of Provence &mdash; the Salyen ''oppidum'' of [[Glanum]] had villas and an outdoor public meeting area built in the classical Greek style.<ref>Anne Roth Cong\u00e8s, ''Glanum - De l'oppidum salyen \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 latine'', Editions du Patrimoine, Centre des Monuments Nationaux, 2010</ref>\n\nThe most famous citizen of Massalia was the mathematician, astronomer and navigator [[Pytheas]]. Pytheas made mathematical instruments which allowed him to establish almost exactly the [[latitude]] of Marseille. He was the first scientist to observe that the tides were connected with the phases of the moon. Between 330 and 320 BC he organized an expedition by ship into the Atlantic and as far north as England; he visited [[Iceland]], [[Shetland]], and Norway, where he was the first scientist to describe drift ice and the midnight sun. Though he hoped to establish a sea trading route for tin from [[Cornwall]], his trip was not a commercial success, and it was not repeated. The Massalians found it cheaper and simpler to trade with Northern Europe over land routes.<ref>R.

The Romans sent sixty ships with two legions led by [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] to Massalia in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept Hannibal.<ref>J.R. Palanque, \"Le Rattachement a l'Empire Romaine\", section in Edouard Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 53.</ref> In 207 BC, when [[Hasdrubal Barca]] led another Carthaginian army to attack Rome, Rome and Massalia became allies again. The Roman orator [[Cicero]] referred to Massalians as \"The most faithful allies of the Romans.\"<ref>''Pro Fonteio'', addresses by Cicero.</ref>\n\nThe Massalians had good trade relations with peoples throughout Gaul. They were not a great military power and often had difficult relations with their neighbors, the Ligurian and Celtic Gauls. In the 2nd century BC the Massalians appealed to Rome for help against the Gauls. They did not understand that Rome wanted subjects, not allies.\n\nIn 181 BC at the request of Massalia, the Romans suppressed Ligurian [[pirate]]s based along the coast between [[Genoa]] and [[Albenga]]. Then, in 154 BC, when a Roman ambassador was abused and attacked at [[Cagnes]], the Roman [[consul]] {{ILL|Quintus Opimius|fr}} led an army into Provence and defeated the [[Oxybii]] and the [[Deciates]]. Rome re-established the authority of Massalia along the coast from the rock of [[Monaco]] to the mouth of the [[Argens River]]\n\nIn 125 BC, an alliance of Celtic peoples, the [[Salyes]], threatened Massalia itself. In 125 a Roman army led by the consul [[Marcus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 125 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Flaccus]] crossed the Alps by either the [[Col de Montgen\u00e8vre]] or [[Maddalena Pass|Col de Larche]], marched along the valley of the Durance, and subdued the Ligures of [[Barcelonette]], the [[Vocontii]] and the Salyes. The following year another Roman army, led by [[Gaius Sextius Calvinus]], marched into Provence and captured the capital of the Salyes, the hilltop fortress of [[Oppidum d'Entremont]], as well as the sanctuary of [[Roquepertuse]] and the ''oppida'' of [[Saint-Blaise, Alpes-Maritimes|Saint-Blaise]] and Baou Roux.<ref>J.R. Palanque, ''Le Rattachement a l'Empire Romaine'', section in Edouard Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 53. Palanque notes that excavations of these hilltop forts found traces of the Roman siege, including stone balls weighing six kilograms that had been thrown by Roman catapults. See also Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 9</ref>\n\nAfter the battle Sextus Calvinus destroyed the hilltop fortress of Entremont. At the foot of the hill, where [[thermal spring]]s were located, he founded a new town, called ''Aquae Sextiae'' (\"The Waters of Sextius\"). Later it became known simply as Aix, then as [[Aix-en-Provence]].<ref>The historian [[Strabo]], telling the story of [[Sextius Calvinus]], called Aix \"the city which took his name.\" Cited by J.R. Palanque in \"La Rattachement a l'Empire Romain\" in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 54</ref>\n\nIn 122 BC the Romans faced a new uprising of the Gauls, led by another Salye chief, Teutonmotulus, who was joined in his uprising by the [[Arverni]] and the [[Allobroges]]. A new Roman consul, [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 122 BC)|Dimitius Ahenobargus]], met the Gauls with a new and terrifying weapon, elephants, and was able to defeat the much larger Gallic army at the battle of [[B\u00e9darrides|Vindalium]] on the [[Sorgue]] River.\n\nIn 121 BC a new Roman army led by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus]] came to Provence to reinforce Domitius. Domitius defeated a Gallic army of Allobroges and Arverni on the plains of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley. One hundred thousand Gauls were killed in the battle. After the battle Domitius claimed the entire territory between Italy and Spain as a Roman province. In 118 BC, at the mouth of the [[Aude River]], his soldiers founded the first Roman colony outside of Italy, called ''Narbo Martius'' (later [[Narbonne]]). Within this territory, only the Greek port colony of Massalia remained independent.<ref>J.R. Palanque in \"La Rattachement a l'Empire Romain in Baratier\", ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 54</ref>\n\nIn 109 BC Provence faced a new invasion from the north. An enormous migration of Celto-Germanic tribes, the [[Teutons]] and [[Cimbri]], left the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast and moved south into Gaul, looking for a new homeland. They moved into the Rh\u00f4ne Valley and in 105 BC defeated the Roman legions of [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]] and Servilus Caepio at [[Battle of Arausio|Arausio]] (the modern town of [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]]).\n\nThe Romans sent one of their best generals, [[Gaius Marius]], to Provence with six legions to block the path of the Teutons and Cimbri toward Italy. Gaius Marius waited patiently for two years, while the Teutons and Cimbri ventured into Spain and northern Gaul. The Roman general kept his soldiers busy digging a canal next to the Rh\u00f4ne River between Arles and [[Fos-sur-Mer|Fos]], allowing his soldiers to be supplied from the sea and also making navigation much easier through the Rh\u00f4ne delta. In 102 BC the Cimbres went east while the Teutons and their new allies, the [[Ambrones]] marched south through Provence, heading toward northern Italy. Gaius Marius met them near Aix in the autumn of 102 BC and defeated them, killing, according to [[Plutarch]], one hundred thousand Teutons and Ambrones. Italy and Provence were safe from invasion for a century afterward.<ref>J.R. Palanque in \"La Rattachement a l'Empire Romain\" in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 56-57</ref>\n\nThe most famous of the proconsuls of the new province called [[Narbonensis]] was [[Julius Caesar]], who governed it from 58 to 49 BC. He was rarely there, using Narbonensis as a supply base for his famous wars against the Gauls further north.(See [[Gallic Wars]].)\n\nUntil this time the city of Massalia had guarded its independence and profited from its alliance with Rome. However, in 49 BC, when the struggle for the leadership of Rome began between [[Pompey the Great]] and Julius Caesar, the leaders of Massalia made the fatal decision to back Pompey. (See [[Caesar's Civil War]]). Caesar immediately sent an army to Massalia and besieged the city. He built long trenches around the town, as he had done against the Gauls at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]]; and cut down the sacred forests of the Ligures to build [[siege tower]]s. He also had a dozen warships built at [[Arles]] and his new fleet, led by his [[legatus|legate]] [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], defeated the Massalian fleet off the isles of the [[Frioul archipelago]], and blockaded the city from the sea. Disease ravaged the population. In September 49 BC, the soldiers of Caesar's legate [[Trebonius]] breached the walls of Massalia and captured it. The Massalians paid a heavy price for backing Pompey; the city lost its independence, had to surrender its warships and treasury, and was forced to give up all of its territories on the coast and interior, except for the [[:wikt:Stoechades|Stoechades]] islands and [[Nice]].<ref>J.R. Palanque in \"La Rattachement a l'Empire Romain in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 58</ref>\n\nThe final phase of the Roman conquest of Provence took place between 24 BC and 14 BC, when the Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]] sent an army to conquer the last Ligurian tribes, around modern [[Sisteron]], [[Digne]], [[Castellane]] and other mountainous valleys, who still resisted Roman domination. In 8 BC the Emperor [[Augustus]] built a triumphal monument at [[La Turbie]] to commemorate the final pacification of the region.<ref>J.R.

During this period, all of Provence, from the Alps to the [[Pyren\u00e9es]], for the first time had the same language, administration, currency and culture. Residents of Provence felt secure enough to give up their fortified hilltop towns and move down into the plains. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote \"it was more than a province, it was another Italy.\"<ref>Cited by Jean-Remy Palanque, ''Le rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'' pg. 66</ref>\n\nIn addition to the vast province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]], which reached all the way to Spain, with its capital at [[Narbonne]], in 7 BC the Emperor [[Augustus]] created [[Alpes Maritimae]], where the Alps met the Mediterranean, with its capital at {{ILL|Cemenelum|fr}} (now [[Cimiez]]), in the hills above present-day [[Nice]]; and also created a small client kingdom called [[Alpes Cottiae]], in the Alps along the Italian border further north, with its capital at ''Segusium'', the modern-day [[Susa]] in [[Piedmont]]. The Emperor [[Nero]] officially made Alpes Cottiae a Roman province in 67 AD.<ref name=\"Jean-Remy Palanque pg. 63\">Jean-Remy Palanque, ''Le rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'' (pg. 63</ref> The purpose of these new provinces was to secure the passes of the Alps for the passage of Roman armies and traders.\n\nThe Romans established twenty-five towns and a common system of administration throughout Provence. Julius Caesar created three [[coloniae]], or colonies, for the veterans of his legions at Forum Julii (now [[Fr\u00e9jus]]), [[Arles]] and Arausio (now [[Orange, Vaucluse]]. Citizens of these towns had the full rights of Roman citizens, including the right to vote. The Emperor August founded seven more colonies of Roman army veterans at [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]], [[Avignon]], [[Carpentras]], [[Cavaillon]] [[Die, Dr\u00f4me|Die]], [[Digne]], and [[Riez]].\n\nOther types of towns, classified as either [[municipia]] or [[civitates]], were founded throughout the rest of Provence. Some of the capital towns or villages of Gallic tribes were transformed into Roman ''municipia''; The capital of the [[Brigantes]] tribe became the Roman ''muncipium'' of [[Brian\u00e7on]]. The residents of these ''muncipia'' and ''civitates'' had most of the rights and obligations of Roman citizens, but no vote.<ref>Jean-Remy Palanque, ''Le rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'' (pg. 60)</ref>\n\nTo connect these towns and allow easy movement of Roman armies between Italy and Spain or up the Rhone Valley, Roman engineers constructed a series of new roads, solidly built and regularly maintained. The oldest was the [[Via Domitia]], built in 118 BC, which went all the way from the [[Col de Montgen\u00e8vre]], the easiest crossing point of the Alps, through [[Sisteron]], [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]] and [[Cavaillon]] to [[Tarascon]] on the Rhone River, and then along the coast to [[Narbonne]] and to Spain. The [[Via Aurelia]] ran from Italy to the Rhone Valley, passing through Cimiez, [[Fr\u00e9jus]], and Aix. The [[Via Agrippa]] ran up the Rhone Valley from Arles to Lyon, through Avignon, Orange, and Valence. It was completely rebuilt six times during the height of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"Jean-Remy Palanque pg. 63\"/>\n\nAfter Massalia lost its independence and its territories, the town of Arles became the most important economic center of Provence. It had inherited the territories taken from Massalia, it had the most important bridge across the Rhone, and it was the meeting point of the [[trade route]]s along the coast and up and down the Rhone River. The major products of Provence were wheat, oil, pork, mutton, the sausages and other preserved meats of Avignon and Arles, and fish from Antibes and Fr\u00e9jus. The Emperor [[Domitian]] banned the planting of [[vineyard]]s in Provence, but the region around Marseille still produced famous wines and all the cities of Provence imported wines from Italy.<ref>Jean-Remy Palanque, \"Le rattachement a l'Empire Romain\", in Baratier, ''Histoire de la Provence'' (pg. 64)</ref> \n \nArles and the other towns of Provence were the showcases of Roman wealth, culture and power. The Roman [[amphitheater]] at Arles could seat twenty thousand spectators. Roman engineers and architects built monuments, theaters, baths, villas, fora, arenas and [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s throughout Provence, many of which still exist. (See [[Architecture of Provence]].)\n\nThe [[Pax Romana]] in Provence lasted until the middle of the third century. [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes invaded Provence in 257 and 275.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} At the beginning the 4th century, the court of Roman Emperor [[Constantine]] (280-337) was forced to take refuge in Arles. By the end of the 5th century, Roman power in Provence had vanished, and an age of invasions, wars, and chaos began.\n\n==The end of the Roman Empire and the arrival of Christianity (3rd-6th centuries AD) ==\nIn 297, the Emperor [[Diocletian]] redrew the provincial borders within the Roman Empire, dividing Gallia Narbonensis into two provinces. The new province east of the Rhone was called [[Septem Provinciae|Viennensis]], after its capital, [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]]. In 397, this new province was split in two; The Province of Vienne kept the Rhone Valley, Arles and Vienne, while a new province, called Narbonensis the Second, was created, with its capital at Aix. The Romans also added new layers of administration, called ''dioceses'' and ''prefectures'', and new officials to govern the provinces.\n\nDuring the late 3rd century, invasions of the [[Franks]] and [[Alemanni]] ravaged other parts of Roman Gaul, but Provence was largely spared. The high walls of Arles and Marseille successfully resisted barbarian invaders. The ports of Provence prospered, thanks to their trade with the Roman Mediterranean world. [[Toulon]] produced the special purple dye used for the robes of the Emperors. Marseille developed a profitable commerce, first importing and then making elaborate carved sacrophogi for the wealthy residents of all of Gaul. Communities of Syrians, Phoenicians and Jews settled in Marseille and Arles. Arles built a new port on the right bank of the Rhone, and in 418 the Roman Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] wrote of Arles that \"All the riches of the orient, perfumes of Arabia, delicacies of [[Assyria]], are found in such abundance there that one would believe they were the products of the countryside.\"<ref>Jean Remy Palanque, ''La Desagregation du monde antique'', in Histoire de Provence, Privat, Toulon, 1990. pg. 76.</ref> The circus and amphitheater of Arles were still being used for Roman games in the 4th century. The [[Emperor Constantine]] himself visited Arles in 314 and 316. The Emperors [[Avitus]] and [[Majorian|Majorien]], among the last of the Roman emperors, resided there respectively in 455 and 459.<ref name=\"Jean Remy Palanque, pg. 78\">Jean Remy Palanque, pg. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Frejus Cathedral Baptistery.jpg|thumb|upright|The baptistery of Fr\u00e9jus Cathedral (5th century) is still in use]]\n\nDuring Roman times the people of Provence worshiped a wide variety of gods and religions; they worshiped goddesses of fecundity (called ''[[Matres and Matronae|matres]]''), gods living in springs of fresh water (such as the ''Vediantiae'' at Cimiez); gods of nature (the mistral wind, worshipped as ''Circius''); and [[Mont Sainte-Victoire]], worshipped under its Ligure name, ''Vintur''. They worshiped deities which combined Roman and Ligure-Celtic gods, such as ''[[Toutatis|Mars-Teutates]]'', worshiped at Aix and Orange. In the large cities, they worshiped the traditional Roman gods and goddesses: [[Jupiter]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]] were worshiped in Arles and Aix. In Marseille, they worshiped the Greek goddesses of the sea.\n\nSince the time of Julius Caesar, they also worshiped the official cult of the Roman emperors and later the empresses. From the time of Emperor [[Vespasian]], an official of this cult, called the ''[[Flamen_Divi_Julii|flamen Augusti]]'', was designated each year to oversee worship of the emperors, placing their busts and shrines throughout Provence.<ref name=\"Rattachement a l pg. 68\">''Le Rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', pg. 68.</ref>\n\nLater in the Empire, Eastern cults began to take hold in Provence: traces of the cult of [[Mithra]] have been found in Arles, [[Vaison]] and Glanum; of the Syrian god [[Baal]] in Marseille; and the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]] at Marseille and Arles; and most popular of all, [[Cybele]], the \"mother of deities\", worshiped at Marseille, Arles, Vence, Vaison, Riez, and Die.<ref name=\"Rattachement a l pg. 68\"/>\n\nThere were many legends about the earliest Christians in Provence. One claimed that the bishop of Arles, Lazarus, buried at Marseille, was the same [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] healed by Jesus; another claimed that his sister Martha came to Provence to convert [[Tarascon]]; another popular legend claimed that Saints [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary Salome]] and [[Mary Jacobe]] came to [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]] in the [[Camargue]] by boat and settled in the mountains at [[Sainte-Baume]]. A skull which is described as that of Mary Magdalene is displayed in the basilica of [[Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume]]. These legends first appeared during the [[Carolingian]] period. Relics claiming to be those of the Three Marys were discovered in the 15th century and put on display. However, there is no other historical evidence to support these legends.<ref>''Le Rattachement a l'Empire Romain'', pg. 71.</ref>\n\nIn the second quarter of the 3rd century the Christian Church in Rome began to send missionaries to evangelize Provence. By Catholic tradition, the first bishops in Provence were [[Trophimus of Arles]] and [[Paul of Narbonne]]. There were active churches and bishops in Arles in 254, in [[Marseille]] in 314, in [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]], in [[Vaison]] and [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]] in 314, in [[Cavaillon]], [[Digne]], [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], and [[Fr\u00e9jus]] at the end of the 4th century, [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 408, [[Carpentras]], Avignon, [[Riez]], Cimiez and [[Vence]] in 439, [[Antibes]] in 442, [[Toulon]] in 451, [[Senez]] in 406, [[Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch\u00e2teaux]] in 517; and [[Gland\u00e8ves]] in 541.<ref>Aldo Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', (pg. 13.)</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 4th century, with the conversion and baptism of Constantine, Christianity became the official religion of the Empire. Later, under the Emperors [[Gratian]] and [[Theodosius]], Christianity was not only permitted, it was required. Churches were built in all the large cities of Provence, usually near the city walls, and often using the sites and even the pillars and other architectural elements of old Roman temples. A [[baptistry]] was usually constructed next to the church. The oldest still-existing Christian structure in Provence is the baptistery of the cathedral in Fr\u00e9jus, dating from the 5th century. By the 5th century there were twenty-one [[bishop]]s in Provence, and chapels on the large estates and churches in almost every town.\n\nAt about the same time, in the 5th century, the first two monasteries in Provence were founded: [[L\u00e9rins Abbey|L\u00e9rins]], on an island near [[Cannes]] and [[St. Victor's Abbey, Marseille|Saint-Victor]] in Marseille. The monasteries became the centers of learning and religious doctrine for Provence and for much of Gaul. Monks from Lerins Abbey became bishops in Arles, Cimiez, Vence, Riez, and other cities in Provence; they actively promoted the cult of saints, local [[martyr]]s, and of the [[Virgin Mary]].<ref name=\"Jean Remy Palanque, pg. 78\"/>\n\n== Barbarians and Merovingians in Provence (5th\u20136th centuries)==\n[[File:Visigothic buckle MNMA Cl8871.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Visigothic buckle, found in the Visigothic necropolis at [[Tressan]]]]\n\nIn 412, the [[Visigoths]] of [[Alaric I|Alaric]], after capturing Rome itself and the death of their leader, passed through Provence on their way to [[Aquitaine]] and Spain, and occupied the entire region between the Atlantic and the Rh\u00f4ne. They unsuccessfully attacked Arles in 425, 452, and 458. But Roman power could no longer defend Provence. An army of [[Burgundians]] swept down the Rh\u00f4ne Valley as far as Valence and the valley of the Durance River. In 471 an army of [[Visigoths]] led by [[Euric]] defeated the army of the Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]]. The valley of the lower Rhone was ravaged by the [[Visigoths]], and Arles was threatened with famine. In 476 the last emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]] was deposed in [[Ravenna]], and Euric entered Arles and Marseille without a battle.<ref>Jean-R\u00e9my Palanque, ''La Desagregation du monde antique'', in ''Histoire de la Provence'', edited by Edouard Baratier. Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990.</ref>\n\nWith the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Visigoths and Burgundians divided Provence. The Visigoths ruled the lands south of the Durance River, while the Burgundians ruled the lands to the north. The Visigoths took two thirds of the lands and slaves for themselves; the Burgundians took half.{{what|date=February 2018}} The barbarians installed their own system of government: Each city was ruled by a count (''comes''), and a group of cities was ruled by a duke (''dux''). The arrival of the barbarians brought a decline to the fortunes of Arles and a resurgence of Marseille, which imported spices and other goods from around the Mediterranean.\n\nThe rule of the Visigoths in Provence was short-lived; their king, [[Alaric II]], was defeated by [[Clovis I]], King of the [[Franks]], in 507. The Burgundians, allied with the Franks, tried to take all of Provence for themselves. They were stopped by another barbarian power, the [[Ostrogoths]], led by [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], who entered Provence, lifted the Burgundian siege of Arles, and took Marseille and Avignon in 508. Theodoric was both a barbarian king and an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; under his rule Provence was officially, though loosely, attached to the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nThe rule of the Ostrogoths lasted little more than thirty years. After the death of Theodoric the [[Merovingian]] kings of the Franks gradually claimed the [[Goths|Gothic]] territories; in 532 they annexed Burgundy and laid siege to Arles. In 536, the Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian]] ceded all of Provence to the [[Merovingian]] kings.\n\nThe Merovingians were the first northern European rulers to govern Provence. They had their capitals in [[Soissons]], [[Metz]], [[Paris]], [[Orl\u00e9ans]], and [[Reims]], and rarely visited the south. After 561, Provence was split between two distant Merovingian kings; [[Sigebert I]], the king of [[Austrasia]], ruled Marseille, Aix and Avignon, while [[Guntram]], the King of [[Burgundy]], ruled the eastern part of Provence.\n\nThe second half of the 6th century was a terrible time for Provence; the region suffered continual conflicts between the two kings, attacks by [[Lombards]] and [[Saxon]] raiders, and epidemics of [[plague (disease)|plague]] and other diseases. [[Irrigation]] works built by the Romans fell into ruins and the fields which the Romans had drained in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley turned back into marshes. Roman buildings and [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] were not maintained. The amphitheater at Arles and the theater at Orange were abandoned and filled with residences. Populations left the cities and moved to fortified villages on the hilltops. The only city to thrive was the port of Marseille, supported by its commerce with the east.\n\nOne enduring legacy of the Merovingian rule is the current northern boundary of Provence; beginning at this time, the name \"Provincia\" was given to the Ostrogoth and Visigoth territories south of a line midway between the [[Is\u00e8re (river)|Is\u00e8re]] and the Durance rivers.<ref>[[Jean-R\u00e9my Palanque]], \"La Desagregation du monde antique\", in ''Histoire de la Provence'', edited by Edouard Baratier. Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990. Pg. 98-99</ref>\n\n==The Franks and Arabs in Provence (7th-9th century)==\n[[File:King Boson of Provence.JPG|thumb|King Boson of Provence and Saint Stephen (fragment of fresco at [[Charlieu Abbey]])]]\nBeginning in the 8th century, Provence became the frontier and battleground between the Frankish kings of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty and the expanding new power in the Mediterranean world, the [[Arabs]], called the [[Saracens]] by the French. The Frankish [[Mayor of the Palace]], [[Charles Martel]], defeated the Arabs at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732 and kept them from advancing further north, but the Arabs remained a formidable power on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nIn 736 Arles and Marseille and other towns of western Provence rebelled against Charles Martel, and installed their own leader. Charles Martel invaded Provence and recaptured and punished the rebel towns. In 737 the cities of Provence rebelled again, this time calling for help from the Arabs. Once again Charles Martel sent an army to Provence, capturing [[Avignon]] and massacring a large part of the population. The rebellion broke out again in 739, and Charles Martel was forced to bring in [[Lombards|Lombard]] warriors from Italy as allies to fight the Arabs and bring Provence under control.<ref>Edouard Baratier, \"Entre Francs et Arabes\", in ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990</ref>\n\nThe reign of [[Charlemagne]] over the Frankish kingdom (768-814) brought a period of relative calm and order to Provence, but the region was desperately poor; the coastal and river trade that had made Provence such a prosperous part of the Roman Empire had halted, and the region was reduced to living from the cultivation of its poor and rocky soil.\n\nWhen the successors of Charlemagne began to quarrel and divide the empire, the troubles of Provence began again. Invaders came by sea to raid the coast and the Rhone Valley. In 838 Marseille was captured and devastated by Arab [[pirate]]s, who destroyed the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|Abbey of Saint Victor]]. In 849 the city was attacked again, this time by [[Byzantine]] pirates. Arles was pillaged in 842 but resisted an Arab attack in 850. During the same period, a band of [[Normans]] arrived by sea from the Atlantic and settled in the [[Camargue]], using it as a base to raid the towns on the coast and in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley.<ref>Edouard Baratier, \"Entre Francs et Arabes\", in ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990, pg. 102-103</ref>\n\nIn 855, following the death of the Carolinian Emperor [[Lothair I]], a kingdom of Provence was briefly created for his third son Charles. It was composed of the lands between the Rh\u00f4ne, the Alps and the Mediterranean, and reached north as far as [[Uz\u00e8s]], [[Viviers, Ard\u00e8che|Viviers]] and [[Lyon]]. When Charles died eight years later, this first kingdom of Provence became the southern part of the new [[Kingdom of Burgundy]].\n\nThe Carolingian Empire continued to disintegrate as the successors quarreled. When the Emperor [[Charles the Bald]] died in 879, his brother-in-law, [[Boso of Provence]] (also known as Boson) brought together the high clergy and the principal counts of southeast France at Mantaille, near [[Vienne]], and had himself declared King of Provence. He was immediately challenged by the other Carolingian rulers because he was not of Carolingian blood, and had to flee into the mountains of [[Diois]], but refused to renounce the throne. The situation was confused until he died in 887, and his widow, Ermengarde, who was of Carolingian blood, had their son Louis adopted by the Emperor [[Charles the Fat]]. This solved the problem of legitimacy and succession; Louis was crowned King of an independent kingdom of Provence in 890.<ref>Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990, pg. 104-105</ref>\n\n== First Counts of Provence==\nFor four centuries Provence was ruled by a series of Counts or Marquises of Provence. They were nominally [[vassal]]s of the crumbling [[Carolingian Empire]], of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Catalonia]], or the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but in practice they were independent rulers. \n\t\nThe [[Bosonids]] were the descendants of [[Boso the Elder]], whose grandson [[Boso of Provence]] became king. [[Louis the Blind]], the son of the younger Boso, was not satisfied with Provence, and aspired to become King of Italy and Emperor, basing his claim on the fact that he was grandson of the Carolingian Emperor [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis II]]. He had some success at first, and was crowned Emperor by [[Pope Benedict V]] in Rome in 901, but then was defeated and captured by his rival, [[Berengar I of Italy]]. He promised to leave Italy forever, and Berengar released him, but the following year he attacked Italy again. He was again captured by Berengar at a battle at [[Verona]] and blinded for breaking his promise. He was sent back to Provence, where he ruled until his death in 928.\n\nDuring the last part of the reign of Louis the Blind, Provence was effectively governed by his cousin, [[Hugh of Italy]], also known as Hugh of Arles. Hugh moved the capital of Provence from Vienne to Arles, and when Louis died took the title Duke of Provence. Hugh, like Louis, aspired to become King of Italy, but with more success. When Berengar died, Hugh claimed the title and was crowned in [[Pavia]] in 926. He ruled both Italy and Provence for twenty years. He made Provence a [[fief]] of [[Rudolph I of Burgundy]] in exchange for preserving his power in Italy. But finally he was chased out of Italy and forced to return to Arles, where he became a monk and died in 948.\n\nWith the death of Hugh, the title of Count of Provence passed to [[Conrad of Burgundy]], the King of Burgundy, also known as Conrad the Peaceful, who named the counts of Arles, Avignon and Apt, and viscounts of Cavaillon and Marseille, all of whom were of Burgundian origin.<ref>Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in the collection ''Histoire de Provence''. pg. 106.</ref> Of these, Count [[Rotbold I, Count of Provence|Rotbald]] of Arles would give rise to a new dynasty who would became the Counts of Provence, beginning with his son Boson, who last appears in 965/7. They would control the county for the next century and a half.\n\n==Expulsion of the Saracens==\n[[File:Abbaye Saint-Victor (Marseille).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille]] was destroyed by Saracen pirates in either 731 or 838 then rebuilt in the 11th century]]\nWhile Louis the Blind and Hugh had been occupied in Italy, the Muslim [[Saracens]] in Provence had established a base on the coast called [[Fraxinetum]], near modern-day [[Saint-Tropez]], from which they controlled the mountains of the [[Massif des Maures]] and the coast between modern Fr\u00e9jus and Hy\u00e8res.<ref>Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in the collection ''Histoire de Provence''. pg. 108.</ref> Between 900 and 910, and 925 and 940, the Saracens raided throughout Provence. They usually avoided walled towns but attacked isolated villas and monasteries. They raided from the Rh\u00f4ne as far east as the Italian Riviera, to [[Albenga]] and [[Sanremo]], and north to the alpine valleys of [[Piedmont]], where they pillaged the monasteries of San Dalmazzo near [[Cuneo]] and [[Novalaise]] near Suse.<ref name=\"autogenerated109\">Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in the collection ''Histoire de Provence''. pg. 109.</ref>\n\nLouis the Blind attempted to expel the Saracens from Provence without success. [[Hugh of Italy]] enlisted the Byzantine fleet to blockade Fraxinetum, and was preparing an attack, when an uprising in Italy forced him to cancel his plans.\n\nIn 973, the Saracens captured Mayeul, the [[abbot]] of the monastery at [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluny]], and held him for ransom. The ransom was paid and the abbot was released. [[William I of Provence|Count William I]], the Count of Arles, organized an army with the help of allied soldiers from Piedmont, and defeated the Saracens near [[La Garde-Freinet]] at the [[Battle of Tourtour]]. The Saracens who were not killed at the battle were forcibly baptized and made into slaves, and the remaining Saracens in Provence fled the region.\n\nThe expulsion of the Saracens in 973 became an epic event in the history and legends of Provence. William became known as \"William the Liberator.\" He distributed the lands taken from the Saracens between Toulon and Nice to his entourage. His descendants became the recognized leaders of Provence, above the other counts of the region.<ref name=\"autogenerated109\"/>\n\nDuring this long period of wars and banditry in Provence, the population retreated to walled cities, maritime trade was rare, and little new art or architecture, other than fortification, was created. The [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al language]] was formed, based on Latin and closer to Latin than the French spoken in northern France. In the 11th century Proven\u00e7al terms began to appear, mixed with Latin, in documents.<ref>Edouard Baratier, ''Entre Francs et Arabes'', in the collection ''Histoire de Provence''. pg. 119.</ref>\n\n==Catalan dynasty (12th-13th century)==\n[[File:Ramon Berenguer III.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Catalan [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer I]], Count of Provence, in the Castle in Fos, painted by [[Mari\u00e0 Fortuny]] ([[Reial Acad\u00e8mia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi]], on deposit at the Palace of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]], [[Barcelona]]).]]A war between [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and his rival, the German Emperor [[Conrad the Salic]], in 1032 led to Provence becoming a fiefdom of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which it remained until 1246. Within the family of the Counts, shared inheritance was practiced from the start of the 11th century, leading to two lines each using the title of Count. The claim of one of these lines, sometimes using the title of [[Margrave]]s of Provence, passed by marriage to [[William III, Count of Toulouse]]. This led to a long-standing Toulouse claim to the County, finally resolved by partition in 1125. A similar situation resulted in another partition in the next generation, one branch retaining a smaller County of Provence, the other the [[County of Forcalquier]]. These were reunited by an intra-dynastic marriage in 1193.\n\nIn 1112, a descendant of Count William I, [[Douce I, Countess of Provence]], married the Catalan [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona]], who as a result became Raymond Berenguer I, Count of Provence. He ruled Provence from 1112 until 1131, and his descendants, the '''Catalan Dynasty''', ruled Provence until 1246. In 1125, Provence was divided; the part of Provence north and west of the [[Durance River]] went to the [[Count of Toulouse]], while the lands between the [[Durance]] and the Mediterranean, and from the Rhone River to the Alps, belonged to the Counts of Provence. The capital of Provence was moved from Arles to Aix-en-Provence, and later to [[Brignoles]].<ref>''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 16</ref>\n[[File:Arles kirche st trophime fassade.jpg|thumb|upright|The Church of [[Saint-Trophime d'Arles|Saint Trophime]] in [[Arles]] (12th century]]\n\nFollowing the [[Crusades]], international commerce began to resume in the ports of the Mediterranean and along the Rh\u00f4ne River. The port of Marseille flourished again. A new city built on the Petit-Rhone, [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|Saint-Gilles]], became a transit point for cloth from [[Flanders]] and spices and the products of the eastern Mediterranean. [[Tarascon]] and [[Avignon]] on the Rh\u00f4ne became important trading ports.\n\nDuring the 12th century some of the cities of Provence became virtually autonomous. They were ruled by consuls, formally under the Counts of Provence but with considerable authority. Consulates existed in Avignon in 1229, 1131 in Arles, between 1140 and 1150 in Tarascon, Nice and Grasse, and 1178 in Marseille. Marseille went farther than the others, establishing a ''confrerie'' or charitable and religious organization of the one hundred leaders of the professions, crafts and businesses in the city, which drew up a code of justice and municipal regulations. Several Proven\u00e7al cities directly negotiated commercial treaties with the republics of [[Pisa]] and [[Genoa]] in Italy. Other cities, however, such as Aix, Toulon, Hy\u00e8res, Digne, Cavaillon and Carpentras, remained under the authority of the Counts. In the 13th century the counts of Provence suppressed most of the consulats, but the seeds of civil liberty and democracy had been planted in the cities.<ref>''Marquisat et Comtes en Provence'', pg. 147-149</ref>\n\n==Cathedrals and monasteries in Provence (12th century)==\n\nUnder the Catalan dynasty, the 12th century saw the construction of important [[cathedrals]] and [[abbeys]] in Provence, in a harmonious new style, the [[romanesque architecture]], which united the [[Gallo-Roman]] style of the Rhone Valley with the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] style of the Alps. [[Aix Cathedral]] was built on the site of the old Roman forum, and then rebuilt in the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] style in the 13th and 14th centuries. The [[Church of St. Trophime]] in Arles was a landmark of [[Romanesque architecture]], built between the 12th and the 15th centuries. A vast fortress-like monastery, [[Montmajour Abbey]], was built on an island just north of Arles, and became a major destination for medieval [[pilgrim]]s.\n\nIn the 12th century three [[Cistercian]] monasteries were built in remote parts of Provence, far from the political intrigues of the cities. [[S\u00e9nanque Abbey]] was the first, established in the [[Luberon]] between 1148 and 1178. [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] was founded in a remote valley near [[Draguignan]] in 1160. [[Silvacane Abbey]], on the Durance River at [[La Roque-d'Anth\u00e9ron]], was founded in 1175.\n\n==France, Toulouse and Catalonia battle for Provence==\nIn the early 13th century a religious and political struggle in neighboring [[Languedoc]] upset the existing order in Provence. [[Pope Innocent III]] sent missionaries and then soldiers to suppress the [[Cathar]] religious movement in [[Languedoc]]. The Pope accused [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse]] of supporting the Cathars, excommunicated him, and invited an army of French knights on a [[crusade]] to cleanse the south of France of the [[heresy]]. A war began in Provence between the French knights and the soldiers of Raymond VI and his son [[Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse|Raymond VII]].\n\nSoldiers from Tarascon, Marseille and Avignon joined the army of the Counts of Provence to fight the French. The French commander, [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], was killed at the siege of Toulouse in 1218. Then Raymond VI died in 1222, and a dispute over his lands in Provence began. King [[Louis VIII of France]] decided to intervene, and a French royal army marched down the valley of the Rh\u00f4ne and laid siege to Avignon. The city held out for three months but was finally forced by hunger to surrender. Avignon was forced to destroy its ramparts and accept a French castle on the other side of the river, and by a treaty signed in Paris on April 12, 1229, the part of Provence west of the Rhone River that had belonged to the Counts of Toulouse became part of France.<ref>''Marquisant et Comtes en Provence'', pg. 157</ref>\n[[File:Statue Raimond B\u00e9renger IV.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Statue of Ramon Berenguer in Aix Cathedral]]\nBeginning in 1220, Provence east of the Rhone had a new ruler, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence|Ramon Berenguer IV]], of the Catalan dynasty. He was the first Count of Provence to actually reside in Provence permanently, usually living with his court in Aix. He launched a military campaign to impose his authority over the cities of Provence, ending the independence of [[Grasse]] and Tarascon, occupying Nice, which had tried to ally with Genoa; and founding a new town, Barcelonette, in the far east of Provence, near the Italian border.\n\nThe ambitions of Ramon Berenguer were energetically resisted by the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VII, who had lost most of his own territory to France. Raymond VII became an ally of Marseille and Avignon in their fight against Ramon Berenguer. In 1232 his army devastated the territories of Ramon Berenguer around Tarascon and Arles.\n\nRamon Berenguer responded to this attack by strengthening his alliance with France; he married his daughter, Marguerite, to King [[Louis IX of France]], and appealed to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], for support. In exchange for his support, Frederic demanded that the cities of Arles and Avignon be governed by the Holy Roman Empire. A prolonged struggle took place between Raymond VII and his allies, the cities of Marseille and Avignon, against Ramon Berenguer for authority in Provence. Arles was [[blockade]]d and all traffic on the Rhone River stopped.\n\nThe French army finally intervened to help Ramon Berenguer, the French king's father-in-law. Raymond VII was forced to abandon his quest, and Ramon Berenguer was able to appoint his own candidate as bishop of Avignon and to subdue the rest of eastern Provence. When Ramon Berenguer died in 1245, not quite forty years old, he controlled all of Provence between the Rh\u00f4ne and Italian border except the rebellious city of Marseille.<ref>''Marquisat et Comptes en Provence'', pg. 156-57</ref>\n\nRamon Berenguer had four daughters, but no sons. After his death his youngest daughter and heiress, [[Beatrice of Provence|Beatrice]], married [[Charles I of Naples|Charles, Count of Anjou]], the youngest son of [[Louis VIII of France]]. Provence's fortunes became even more closely tied to the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]].<ref>Basti\u0117, ''Histoire de la Provence''</ref>\n\n== Popes in Avignon (14th century) ==\n[[File:Fa\u00e7ade du Palais des Papes.jpg|thumb|The [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the [[Palais des Papes]].]]In 1309, [[Pope Clement V]], who was originally from [[Bordeaux]], moved the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Papacy]] to Avignon. From 1309 until 1377, seven Popes reigned in Avignon before the [[Western Schism]] between the Roman and Avignon churches, which led to rival popes in each place. After that three [[Antipopes]] reigned in Avignon until 1423, when the Papacy finally returned to Rome. Between 1334 and 1363 Pope [[Benedict XII]] built the Papal Palace in Avignon, and [[Clement VI]] built the New Palace; together the [[Palais des Papes]] was the largest gothic palace in Europe.<ref>Basti\u0117, ''Histoire de la Provence'', pg. 20.</ref>\n\nThe 14th century was a terrible time in Provence, and all of Europe: the population of Provence had been about 400,000 people; the [[Black Death]] (1348\u20131350) killed fifteen thousand people in Arles, half the population of the city, and greatly reduced the population of the whole region. The defeat of the French Army during the [[Hundred Years' War]] forced the cities of Provence to build walls and towers to defend themselves against armies of former soldiers who ravaged the countryside.\n\nThe Angevin rulers of Provence also had a difficult time. An assembly of nobles, religious leaders, and town leaders of Provence organized to resist the authority of Queen [[Joan I of Naples]] (1343\u20131382). She was murdered in 1382 by her cousin and heir, [[Charles III of Naples|Charles of Durazzo]], who started a new war, leading to the separation of Nice, [[Puget-Th\u00e9niers]] and [[Barcelonnette]] from Provence in 1388, and their attachment to the territories of [[Savoy]].\n\n== Good King Ren\u00e9, the last ruler of Provence ==\n[[File:Nicolas Froment 004.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of the ''Burning Bush'' triptych by Nicolas Froment, showing Ren\u00e9 and his wife Jeanne de Laval]]\nThe 15th century saw a series of wars between the Kings of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the Counts of Provence. In 1423 the army of [[Alphonse V of Aragon]] captured Marseille, and in 1443 captured Naples and forced its ruler, King [[Ren\u00e9 I of Naples]], to flee. He eventually settled in one of his remaining territories, Provence.\n\nHistory and legend has given Ren\u00e9 the title \"Good King Ren\u00e9 of Provence\", though he only lived in Provence in the last ten years of his life, from 1470 to 1480, and his political policies of territorial expansion were costly and unsuccessful. Provence benefitted from population growth and economic expansion, and Ren\u00e9 was a generous patron of the arts, sponsoring painters [[Nicolas Froment]], [[Louis Br\u00e9a]], and other masters. He also completed one of the finest castles in Provence at [[Tarascon]], on the Rhone River.\n\nWhen Ren\u00e9 died in 1480, his title passed to his nephew [[Charles IV, Duke of Anjou|Charles du Maine]]. One year later, in 1481, when Charles died, the title passed to [[Louis XI of France]]. Provence was legally incorporated into the French royal domain in 1486.\n\n== Provence becomes French (1486 to 1789) ==\n{{See also|Massacre of M\u00e9rindol|Waldensians}}\nSoon after Provence became part of France, it became involved in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] that swept the country in the 16th century. Between 1493 and 1501, many Jews were expelled from their homes and sought sanctuary in the region of Avignon, which was still under the direct rule of the Pope. In 1545, the [[Parliament of Aix-en-Provence]] ordered the destruction of the villages of [[Lourmarin]], [[M\u00e9rindol]] and [[Cabri\u00e8res-d'Avignon]] in the [[Luberon]], because their inhabitants were [[Waldensians|Vaudois]] of Italian [[Piedmontese]] origin, and were not considered sufficiently orthodox Catholics. Most of Provence remained strongly Catholic, with only one enclave of [[Protestants]], the principality of [[Orange, Vaucluse]], an enclave ruled by Prince [[William the Silent]] (1533\u20131584) of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] of the Netherlands, which was created in 1544 and was not incorporated into France until 1673. An army of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] laid siege to the Protestant city of [[M\u00e9nerbes]] in the [[Vaucluse]] between 1573 and 1578. The wars did not stop until the end of the 16th century, with the consolidation of power in Provence by the [[House of Bourbon]] kings.\n\n[[File:Vernet-toulon-1.jpg|thumb|View of Toulon Harbour around 1750, by [[Joseph Vernet]].]]\n[[File:Vernet-marseille-1754.jpg|thumb|left|Marseille in 1754, by Vernet]]\n\nThe semi-independent [[Parliament of Aix-en-Provence]] and some of the cities of Provence, particularly Marseille, continued to rebel against the authority of the Bourbon king. After uprisings in 1630\u201331 and 1648\u20131652, the young King [[Louis XIV]] had two large forts, [[Fort Saint-Jean (Marseille)|Fort Saint-Jean]] and {{ILL|Fort St. Nicholas, Marseille|fr|Fort Saint-Nicolas (Marseille)}}, built at the harbor entrance to control the city's unruly population.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] began to build a naval arsenal and dockyard at [[Toulon]] to serve as a base for a new French Mediterranean fleet. The base was greatly enlarged by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], the minister of [[Louis XIV]], who commissioned his chief military engineer, [[Vauban]] to strengthen the fortifications around the city.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, Provence had a population of about 450,000 people.<ref name=\"Basti\u00e9, pg. 35\">Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', (pg. 35)</ref> It was predominantly rural, devoted to raising wheat, wine, and olives, with small industries for tanning, pottery, perfume-making, and ship and boat building. [[Proven\u00e7al quilts]], made from the mid-17th century onwards, were successfully exported to England, Spain, Italy, Germany and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=isa>{{Citation| last = Etienne-Bugnot| first = Isabelle| title = Quilting in France: The French Traditions| url = http://www.historyofquilts.com/french_quilt_history.html| accessdate = 2010-05-02| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180929094251/http://www.historyofquilts.com/french_quilt_history.html| archive-date = 2018-09-29| url-status = dead}}</ref> There was considerable commerce along the coast, and up and down the Rhone River. The cities of Marseille, [[Toulon]], Avignon and Aix-en-Provence saw the construction of boulevards and richly decorated private houses.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century Provence suffered from the economic malaise of the end of the reign of Louis XIV. The [[Plague (disease)|plague]] struck the region between 1720 and 1722, beginning in Marseille, killing some 40,000 people. Still, by the end of the century, many artisanal industries began to flourish; making [[perfumes]] in [[Grasse]]; olive oil in Aix and the [[Alpilles]]; textiles in Orange, Avignon and Tarascon; [[faience]] pottery in Marseille, Apt, [[Aubagne]], and [[Moustiers-Sainte-Marie]]. Many immigrants arrived from [[Liguria]] and Piedmont in Italy. By the end of the 18th century, Marseille had a population of 120,000 people, making it the third-largest city in France.<ref name=\"Basti\u00e9, pg. 35\"/>\n\n== French Revolution ==\n{{Main|French Revolution}} \nThough most of Provence, with the exception of Marseille, Aix and Avignon, was rural, conservative and largely royalist, it did produce some memorable figures in the [[French Revolution]]:\n* [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]] from Aix, who tried to moderate the Revolution, and turn France into a [[constitutional monarchy]] like England; \n* [[Marquis de Sade]] from [[Lacoste]] in the Luberon, who was a deputy from the far left in the National Assembly; \n* [[Charles Barbaroux]] from Marseille, who sent a battalion of volunteers to Paris to fight in the [[French Revolutionary Army]];\n* [[Emmanuel-Joseph Siey\u00e8s]] (1748\u20131836), an abbot, essayist and political leader, who was one of the chief theorists of the French Revolution, [[French Consulate]], and First French Empire, and who, in 1799, was the instigator of the coup d'\u00e9tat of [[18 Brumaire]], which brought [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to power.\n[[File:Marche-des-marseillois.jpg|thumb|left|La Marseillaise 1792]] \nProvence also produced the most memorable song of the period, [[La Marseillaise]]. The song was originally written by a citizen of [[Strasbourg]], [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]] in 1792. It was originally a war song for the revolutionary [[Army of the Rhine (1791\u20131801)|Army of the Rhine]]. It became famous when sung on the streets of Paris by the volunteers from Marseille, who had heard it in Marseille sung by a young volunteer from [[Montpellier]] named [[Fran\u00e7ois Mireur]]. It became the most popular song of the French Revolution and in 1879 became the national anthem of France.\n\nThe French Revolution was as violent and bloody in Provence as it was in other parts of France. On April 30, 1790, Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille was besieged, and many of the soldiers inside were massacred. On October 17, 1791 a massacre of royalists and religious figures took place in the ice storage rooms (''glaciere'') of the prison of the [[Palais des Papes|Palace of the Popes]] in Avignon.\n\nWhen the radical [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnard]]s seized power from the [[Girondins]] in May 1793, a real counter-revolution broke out in Avignon, Marseille and Toulon. A revolutionary army under [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Carteaux]] recaptured Marseille in August 1793 and renamed it \"City without a Name\" (''Ville sans Nom''). In Toulon, the opponents of the Revolution handed the city to a British and Spanish fleet on August 28, 1793. A Revolutionary Army laid siege to the British positions for four months (see the [[Siege of Toulon]]), and finally, thanks to the enterprise of the young commander of artillery, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], defeated the British and drove them out in December, 1793. About 15,000 royalists escaped with the British fleet, but five to eight hundred of the 7,000 who remained were shot on the [[Champ de Mars]], and Toulon was renamed \"Port la Montagne\".\n\nThe fall of the Montagnards in July 1794 was followed by a new [[First White Terror|White Terror]] aimed at the revolutionaries. Calm was only restored by the rise of Napoleon to power in 1795.\n\n== Provence under Napoleon I ==\nNapoleon restored the property and power of the families of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] in Provence. The British fleet of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] blockaded Toulon, and almost all maritime commerce was stopped, causing hardship and poverty. When Napoleon was defeated, his fall was celebrated in Provence. When he escaped from [[Elba]] on March 1, 1815, and landed at [[Golfe-Juan]], he detoured to avoid the cities of Provence, which were hostile to him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n== Provence in the 19th century ==\n[[File:Marseille port c1825.jpg|thumb|Marseille in 1825]]\nProvence enjoyed prosperity in the 19th century; the ports of Marseille and Toulon connected Provence with the expanding [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] in North Africa and the Orient, especially after the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869.\n\nIn April\u2013July 1859, [[Napoleon III]] made a secret agreement with the [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour|Count of Cavour]], Prime Minister of [[Piedmont]], for France to assist in expelling Austria from the [[Italian peninsula]] and bringing about a united Italy, in exchange for Piedmont ceding [[Savoy]] and the Nice region to France. He went to war with Austria in 1859 and won a victory at [[Solferino]], which resulted in Austria ceding [[Lombardy]] to Piedmont, and, in return, Napoleon received Savoy and Nice in 1860, and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]] and [[Menton]] in 1861.\n\nThe railroad connected Paris with Marseille in 1848 and then with Toulon and Nice in 1864. Nice, [[Antibes]] and Hy\u00e8res became popular winter resorts for European royalty, including [[Queen Victoria]]. Under Napoleon III, Marseille grew to a population of 250,000, including a very large Italian community. Toulon had a population of 80,000. Large cities like Marseille and Toulon saw construction of churches, opera houses, grand boulevards, and parks.\n\nAfter the fall of [[Louis Napoleon]] following his defeat in the [[Franco-German War]] barricades went up in the streets of Marseille on March 23, 1871 and the Communards, led by [[Gaston Cremieux]] and following the lead of the [[Paris Commune]], took control of the city. The Commune was crushed by the army and Cremieux was executed on November 30, 1871. Though Provence was generally conservative, it often elected reformist leaders; Prime Minister [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]] was the son of a Marseille grocer, and future prime minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] was elected deputy from the Var in 1885.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century saw a revival of the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] language and culture, particularly traditional rural values, driven by a movement of writers and poets called the [[F\u00e9librige]], led by poet [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]]. Mistral achieved literary success with his work ''[[Mir\u00e8io]]'' (''Mireille'' in French); he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for literature in 1904.\n\n== Provence in the 20th century ==\nBetween World War I and World War II Provence was bitterly divided between the more conservative rural areas and the more radical big cities. There were widespread strikes in Marseille in 1919, and riots in Toulon in 1935.\n\nAfter the defeat of France by Germany in June 1940, France was divided into an occupied zone and unoccupied zone, with Provence in the unoccupied zone. Parts of eastern Provence were occupied by Italian soldiers. [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Collaboration]] and passive resistance gradually gave way to more active resistance, particularly after [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941 and the [[Communist Party]] became active in the [[French Resistance]]. [[Jean Moulin]], the deputy of [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of the [[Free France]] resistance movement, parachuted into [[Eygali\u00e8res]] in the [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]] on January 2, 1942 to unite the diverse resistance movements in all of France against the Germans.\n\nIn November 1942, following Allied landings in North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), the Germans occupied all of Provence ([[Operation Attila (WW II)|Operation Attila]]) and then headed for Toulon ([[Case Anton]]). The French fleet at Toulon sabotaged its own ships to keep them from falling into German hands.\n\nThe Germans began a systematic rounding-up of French Jews and refugees from Nice and Marseille. Many thousands were taken to concentration camps, and few survived. A large quarter around the port of Marseille was emptied of inhabitants and dynamited, so it would not serve as a base for the resistance. Nonetheless, the resistance grew stronger; the leader of the pro-German militia in Marseille, the [[Milice]], was assassinated in April 1943.\n\nOn August 15, 1944, two months after the Allied landings in Normandy ([[Operation Overlord]]), the [[Seventh United States Army]] under General [[Alexander M. Patch]], with a [[Free French]] corps under General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]], landed on the coast of the Var between [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|St. Raphael]] and [[Cavalaire]] ([[Operation Dragoon]]). The American forces moved north toward [[Manosque]], [[Sisteron]] and [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], while the French [[1st_Armored_Division_(France)|First Armored Division]] under General [[Jean Touzet du Vigier]] liberated [[Brignoles]], [[Salon-de-Provence|Salon]], Arles, and Avignon. The Germans in Toulon resisted until August 27, and Marseille was not liberated until August 25.\n[[File:Avignon tgv station.jpg|thumb|upright|Avignon TGV station, 2001]]\nAfter the end of the war, Provence faced an enormous task of repair and reconstruction, particularly of the ports and railroads destroyed during the war. As part of this effort, the first modern concrete apartment block, the [[Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation]] of [[Corbusier]], was built in Marseille in 1947\u201352. In 1962, Provence absorbed a large number of French citizens who had left Algeria after its independence. Since that time, large North African communities have settled in and around the big cities, particularly Marseille and Toulon.\n\nIn the 1940s, Provence underwent a cultural renewal, with the founding of the [[Avignon Festival]] of theatre (1947), the reopening of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] (begun in 1939), and many other major events. With the building of new highways, particularly the Paris-Marseille autoroute which opened in 1970, Provence became a destination for mass tourism from all over Europe. Many Europeans, particularly from Britain, bought summer houses in Provence. The arrival of the [[TGV]] high-speed trains shortened the trip from Paris to Marseille to less than four hours.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, the residents of Provence were struggling to reconcile economic development and population growth with their desire to preserve the landscape and culture that make Provence unique.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Timeline of Provence|fr|3=Chronologie de la Provence}}\n\n;Cities in Provence\n* [[Timeline of Aix-en-Provence]]\n* [[Timeline of Marseille]]\n* [[Timeline of Toulon]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===General histories of Provence===\n*Edouard Baratier (editor), ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990 ({{ISBN|2-7089-1649-1}})\n*Aldo Basti\u00e9, ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Ouest-France, 2001.\n*Martin Garrett, 'Provence: a Cultural History' (2006)\n*James Pope-Hennessy, ''Aspects of Provence'' (1988)\n*Denizeau, Gerard, ''Histoire Visuelle des Monuments de France'', Larousse, 2003\n\n===Prehistoric, Celto-Ligurian, Greek and Roman Provence===\n*Henry de Lumley, ''La Grand Histoire des premiers hommes europeens'', Odile Jacob, 2007.

Her books include ''Families, History and Social Change'' and ''Aging and Generational Relations''.<ref name=nyt />\n\nBorn in [[Chernivtsi]], [[Romania]] (now [[Ukraine]]),<ref name=nyt>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/06/us/tamara-kern-hareven-65-social-historian-of-the-family.html Obituary: Tamara Kern Hareven], 'The New York Times'', November 6, 2002</ref> and of Jewish origin,<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0009_0_09042.html Historians] at the Jewish Virtual Library</ref> she died of [[kidney failure]] at the age of 65.\n\nShe did her BA at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1960 and followed that with an MA in Medieval Jewish history at the University of Cincinnati in 1962. She completed her PhD at Ohio State University in American history with a dissertation on Eleanor Roosevelt, published as ''Eleanor Roosevelt: An American Conscience''(1968). She worked with her PhD advisor John H. Bremner and others on ''Children and Youth in America'', a seminal three volume collection that launched the field of the history of childhood. She was among the founders in North America of the history of the family as a serious field of study. \n\nShe taught at Dalhousie University in Canada briefly before moving to Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1973, while at Clark, she organized a major international conference on the History of the Family. An outgrowth of the conference, a newsletter focused on the history of the family developed into the ''Journal of Family History'' in 1975. She later played a role in establishing ''The History of the Family: An International Quarterly.'' Her support for the work of younger scholars was a strong and consistent part of her career. In the early 1980s she was a Fulbright Scholar in Japan, which led to her last book, ''The Silk Weavers of Kyoto: Family and Work in a Changing traditional Industry.''  In 1988 she became Unidel Professor at the University of Delaware. Hareven's papers are held at the [https://library.udel.edu/static/purl.php?mss0564 University of Delaware].\n\n== Selected works ==\n* (ed.).

She completed her PhD at Ohio State University in American history with a dissertation on Eleanor Roosevelt, published as ''Eleanor Roosevelt: An American Conscience''(1968). She worked with her PhD advisor John H. Bremner and others on ''Children and Youth in America'', a seminal three volume collection that launched the field of the history of childhood. She was among the founders in North America of the history of the family as a serious field of study. \n\nShe taught at Dalhousie University in Canada briefly before moving to Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1973, while at Clark, she organized a major international conference on the History of the Family. An outgrowth of the conference, a newsletter focused on the history of the family developed into the ''Journal of Family History'' in 1975. She later played a role in establishing ''The History of the Family: An International Quarterly.'' Her support for the work of younger scholars was a strong and consistent part of her career. In the early 1980s she was a Fulbright Scholar in Japan, which led to her last book, ''The Silk Weavers of Kyoto: Family and Work in a Changing traditional Industry.''  In 1988 she became Unidel Professor at the University of Delaware. \n\n== Selected works ==\n* (ed.).
