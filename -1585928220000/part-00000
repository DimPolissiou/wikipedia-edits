Rachman in 1977 maintains that there are three conditions by which fear is developed.<ref>{{harvp|Rachman|1977|p=375}}</ref> These include direct personal experience, observational experience, and informational or instructional experience. For example, direct personal experience consists of having a personal negative encounter with a dog such as being bitten. In contrast, seeing a friend attacked by a dog and thus developing a fear of dogs would be observational experience. Whereas both of these types of experiences involves a live dog, informational or instructional experience simply includes being told directly or indirectly (i.e., information read in a book, film, parental cues such as avoidance or dislike, etc.) that dogs are to be feared.\n\nA study was conducted at the [[State University of New York]] to distinguish the significance of these three conditions upon the development of cynophobia.<ref>{{harvp|Di Nardo|Guzy|Jenkins|Bak|1988|p=241}}</ref> Thirty-seven women ages 18 to 21 were first screened into two groups: fearful of dogs and non-fearful of dogs.<ref name=\"DiNardo_242\">{{harvp|Di Nardo|Guzy|Jenkins|Bak|1988|p=242}}</ref> Next, each woman was given a questionnaire which asked if she had ever had a frightening and/or painful confrontation with a dog, what her expectation was upon encountering a dog (pain, fear, etc.), and subjectively, what was the probability of that expectation actually occurring.<ref name=\"DiNardo_242\"/> The results indicated that, while non-fearful subjects had a different expectation of what would happen when encountering a dog, painful experiences with dogs were common among both groups; therefore, the study concluded that other factors must affect whether or not these painful experiences will develop into dog phobia.<ref>{{harvp|Di Nardo|Guzy|Jenkins|Bak|1988|p=243}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Rachman's theory is the accepted model of fear acquisition, cases of cynophobia have been cited in which none of these three causes apply to the patient.<ref>{{harvp|Doogan|Thomas|1992|p=387}}</ref> In a speech given at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Society for Psychophysiological Research, Dr. Arne \u00d6hman proposed that animal fears in particular are likely to be an evolutionary remnant of the necessity \"to escape and to avoid becoming the prey of predators\".<ref>{{harvp|\u00d6hman|1986|p=128}}</ref> Furthermore, in his book ''Overcoming Animal/Insect Phobias'', Dr. Martin Antony suggests that in the absence of Rachman's three causes, providing that the patient's memory is sound, biological factors may be a fourth cause of fear acquisition\u2014meaning that the fear is inherited or is a throwback to an earlier genetic [[defense mechanism]].<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=30}}</ref> In any case, these causes may in actuality be a generalization of a complicated blend of both learning and [[genetics]].<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=31}}</ref>\n\n== Treatment ==\nThe most common methods for the treatment of specific phobias are [[systematic desensitization]] and [[in vivo]] or [[exposure therapy]].\n\n=== Systematic desensitization therapy ===\nSystematic desensitization therapy was introduced by Joseph Wolpe in 1958 and employs relaxation techniques with imagined situations.<ref name=\"Wiederhold_6\">{{harvp|Wiederhold|2005|p=6}}</ref> In a controlled environment, usually the therapist's office, the patient will be instructed to visualize a threatening situation (i.e., being in the same room with a dog). After determining the patient's anxiety level, the therapist then coaches the patient in breathing exercises and relaxation techniques to reduce their anxiety to a normal level. The therapy continues until the imagined situation no longer provokes an anxious response.\n\nThis method was used in the above-mentioned study done by Drs. Hoffmann and Human whereby twelve female students at the Arcadia campus of Technikon Pretoria College in South Africa were found to possess symptoms of cynophobia.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|pp=31\u201332}}</ref> These twelve students were provided with systematic desensitization therapy one hour per week for five to seven weeks; after eight months, the students were contacted again to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|pp=32\u201334}}</ref> Final results indicated the study was fairly successful with 75% of the participants showing significant improvement eight months after the study.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|p=40}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in his book, ''Virtual Reality Therapy for Anxiety Disorders'', Dr. Wiederhold questions the effectiveness of systematic desensitization as the intensity of the perceived threat is reliant on the patient's imagination and could therefore produce a false response in regards to the patient's level of anxiety.<ref name=\"Wiederhold_6\"/> His research into recent technological developments has made it possible to integrate [[virtual reality]] into systematic desensitization therapy in order to accurately recreate the threatening situation.<ref name=\"Wiederhold_6\"/> At the time of publication, there had been no studies done to determine its effectiveness.<ref name=\"Wiederhold_6\"/>\n\n=== In vivo or exposure therapy ===\nIn vivo or exposure therapy is considered the most effective treatment for cynophobia and involves systematic and prolonged exposure to a dog until the patient is able to experience the situation without an adverse response.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=66}}</ref> This therapy can be conducted over several sessions or, as Dr. Lars-G\u00f6ran \u00d6st showed in a study done in 1988, can be done in a single multi-hour session.<ref>{{harvp|\u00d6st|1989|p=1}}</ref> This study utilized 20 female patients suffering from various specific phobias and ranging in age from 16 to 44.<ref>{{harvp|\u00d6st|1989|p=4}}</ref> Patients were each provided with an individual therapy session in which Dr. \u00d6st combined exposure therapy with modeling (where another person demonstrates how to interact with the feared object) to reduce or completely cure the phobia.<ref name=\"\u00d6st_3\">{{harvp|\u00d6st|1989|p=3}}</ref> As each patient was gradually exposed to the feared stimulus, she was encouraged to approach and finally interact with it as her anxiety decreased, concluding the session when fear had been reduced by 50% or completely eliminated.<ref name=\"\u00d6st_3\"/> Once the session was concluded, the patient was then to continue interaction with the feared object on her own to reinforce what had been learned in the therapy session.<ref name=\"\u00d6st_3\"/> Dr. \u00d6st's results were collected over a seven-year period and concluded that \"90% of the patients were much improved or completely recovered after a mean of 2.1 hours of therapy\".<ref>{{harvp|\u00d6st|1989|p=6}}</ref>\n\n==== Self-help treatment ====\nAlthough most commonly done with the help of a therapist in a professional setting, exposure to dogs is also possible as a [[self-help]] treatment. First, the patient is advised to enlist the help of an assistant who can help set-up the exposure environment, assist in handling the dog during sessions, and demonstrate modeling behaviors.<ref name=\"Antony_49\">{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=49}}</ref> This should also be someone whom the patient trusts and who has no fear of dogs.<ref name=\"Antony_49\"/> Then, the patient compiles a hierarchy of fear provoking situations based on their rating of each situation.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|pp=41\u201342}}</ref> For example, on a scale from 0 to 100, a patient may feel that looking at photos of dogs may cause a fear response of only 50, however, petting a dog's head may cause of fear response of 100.<ref name=\"Antony_49\"/> With this list of situations from least to most fearful the assistant helps the patient to identify common elements that contribute to the fear (i.e., size of the dog, color, how it moves, noise, whether or not it is restrained, etc.).<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|pp=44\u201346}}</ref>  Next, the assistant helps the patient recreate the least fearful situation in a safe, controlled environment, continuing until the patient has had an opportunity to allow the fear to subside thus reinforcing the realization that the fear is unfounded.<ref name=\"Antony_49\"/> Once a situation has been mastered, the next fearful situation is recreated and the process is repeated until all the situations in the hierarchy have been experienced.<ref name=\"Antony_49\"/>\n\nSample videos showing humans and dogs interacting without either exhibiting significant fear are available.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Showing Interaction|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTYad3uyXAg}}</ref>\n\n=== Recovery timeframe and maintenance ===\nWhether utilizing systematic desensitization therapy or exposure therapy, several factors will determine how many sessions will be required to completely remove the phobia; however, some studies (such as a follow-up study done by Dr. \u00d6st in 1996) have shown that those who overcome their phobia are usually able to maintain the improvement over the long-term.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=5}}</ref> As avoidance contributes to the perpetuation of the phobia, constant, yet safe, real world interaction is recommended during and after therapy in order to reinforce positive exposure to the animal.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=73}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anxiety disorder]]\n* [[List of phobias]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|21em}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{Refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite book |last=Antony |first=Martin M. |title=Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A Guide to Assessment and Treatment |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |year=2000 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Antony |first1=Martin M. |first2=Randi E. |last2=McCabe |title=Overcoming Animal Insect Phobias: How to Conquer Fear of Dogs, Snakes, Rodents, Bees, Spiders More |location=Oakland |publisher=[[New Harbinger Publications]] |year=2005 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Barlow |first=David H. |title=Anxiety and its Disorders: The Nature and Treatment of Anxiety and Panic |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2002 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Timothy J. |first2=William C. |last2=Sanderson |title=Specific Phobias: Clinical Applications of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy |location=Northvale |publisher=Jason Aronson Inc. |year=1998 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Di Nardo |first1=Peter A. |first2=Lawrence T. |last2=Guzy |first3=Jill Ann |last3=Jenkins |first4=Rita M. |last4=Bak |first5=Susan F. |last5=Tomasi |first6=Michelle |last6=Copland |title=Etiology and maintenance of dog fears |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=26 |issue=3 |year=1988 |pages=241\u2013244 |pmid=3408458 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Di Nardo |first1=Peter A. |first2=Lawrence T. |last2=Guzy |first3=Rita M. |last3=Bak |title=Anxiety response patterns and etiological factors in dog-gearful and non-fearful subjects |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=26 |issue=3 |year=1988 |pages=245\u2013251 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) |edition=4th |location=Washington DC |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |year=2000 |ref=DSM}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Doogan |first1=Sharon |first2=Glyn V. |last2=Thomas |title=Origins of fear of dogs in adults and children: the role of conditioning processes and prior familiarity with dogs |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=30 |issue=4 |year=1992 |pages=387\u2013394 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Hoffmann |first1=Willem A. |first2=Lourens H. |last2=Human |title=Experiences, characteristics and treatment of women suffering from dog phobia |journal=[[Anthrozo\u00f6s]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=28 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Neville J. |first2=Viv |last2=Clowes-Hollins |first3=Thomas H. |last3=Ollendick |title=The etiology of childhood dog phobia |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=35 |issue=1 |year=1997 |page=77 |pmid=9009047 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Maj |editor1-first=Mario |editor2-first=Hagop S. |editor2-last=Akiskal |editor3-first=Juan Jos\u00e9 |editor3-last=L\u00f3pez-Ibor |editor4-first=Ahmed |editor4-last=Okasha| display-editors = 3 |title=Phobias |location=Chichester |publisher=J.

Hoffmann and Human whereby twelve female students at the Arcadia campus of Technikon Pretoria College in South Africa were found to possess symptoms of cynophobia.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|pp=31\u201332}}</ref> These twelve students were provided with systematic desensitization therapy one hour per week for five to seven weeks; after eight months, the students were contacted again to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|pp=32\u201334}}</ref> Final results indicated the study was fairly successful with 75% of the participants showing significant improvement eight months after the study.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|p=40}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in his book, ''Virtual Reality Therapy for Anxiety Disorders'', Dr. Wiederhold questions the effectiveness of systematic desensitization as the intensity of the perceived threat is reliant on the patient's imagination and could therefore produce a false response in regards to the patient's level of anxiety.<ref name=\"Wiederhold_6\"/> His research into recent technological developments has made it possible to integrate [[virtual reality]] into systematic desensitization therapy in order to accurately recreate the threatening situation.<ref name=\"Wiederhold_6\"/> At the time of publication, there had been no studies done to determine its effectiveness.<ref name=\"Wiederhold_6\"/>\n\n=== In vivo or exposure therapy ===\nIn vivo or exposure therapy is considered the most effective treatment for cynophobia and involves systematic and prolonged exposure to a dog until the patient is able to experience the situation without an adverse response.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=66}}</ref> This therapy can be conducted over several sessions or, as Dr. Lars-G\u00f6ran \u00d6st showed in a study done in 1988, can be done in a single multi-hour session.<ref>{{harvp|\u00d6st|1989|p=1}}</ref> This study utilized 20 female patients suffering from various specific phobias and ranging in age from 16 to 44.<ref>{{harvp|\u00d6st|1989|p=4}}</ref> Patients were each provided with an individual therapy session in which Dr. \u00d6st combined exposure therapy with modeling (where another person demonstrates how to interact with the feared object) to reduce or completely cure the phobia.<ref name=\"\u00d6st_3\">{{harvp|\u00d6st|1989|p=3}}</ref> As each patient was gradually exposed to the feared stimulus, she was encouraged to approach and finally interact with it as her anxiety decreased, concluding the session when fear had been reduced by 50% or completely eliminated.<ref name=\"\u00d6st_3\"/> Once the session was concluded, the patient was then to continue interaction with the feared object on her own to reinforce what had been learned in the therapy session.<ref name=\"\u00d6st_3\"/> Dr. \u00d6st's results were collected over a seven-year period and concluded that \"90% of the patients were much improved or completely recovered after a mean of 2.1 hours of therapy\".<ref>{{harvp|\u00d6st|1989|p=6}}</ref>\n\n==== Self-help treatment ====\nAlthough most commonly done with the help of a therapist in a professional setting, exposure to dogs is also possible as a [[self-help]] treatment. First, the patient is advised to enlist the help of an assistant who can help set-up the exposure environment, assist in handling the dog during sessions, and demonstrate modeling behaviors.<ref name=\"Antony_49\">{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=49}}</ref> This should also be someone whom the patient trusts and who has no fear of dogs.<ref name=\"Antony_49\"/> Then, the patient compiles a hierarchy of fear provoking situations based on their rating of each situation.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|pp=41\u201342}}</ref> For example, on a scale from 0 to 100, a patient may feel that looking at photos of dogs may cause a fear response of only 50, however, petting a dog's head may cause of fear response of 100.<ref name=\"Antony_49\"/> With this list of situations from least to most fearful the assistant helps the patient to identify common elements that contribute to the fear (i.e., size of the dog, color, how it moves, noise, whether or not it is restrained, etc.).<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|pp=44\u201346}}</ref>  Next, the assistant helps the patient recreate the least fearful situation in a safe, controlled environment, continuing until the patient has had an opportunity to allow the fear to subside thus reinforcing the realization that the fear is unfounded.<ref name=\"Antony_49\"/> Once a situation has been mastered, the next fearful situation is recreated and the process is repeated until all the situations in the hierarchy have been experienced.<ref name=\"Antony_49\"/>\n\nSample videos showing humans and dogs interacting without either exhibiting significant fear are available.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Showing Interaction|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTYad3uyXAg}}</ref>\n\n=== Recovery timeframe and maintenance ===\nWhether utilizing systematic desensitization therapy or exposure therapy, several factors will determine how many sessions will be required to completely remove the phobia; however, some studies (such as a follow-up study done by Dr. \u00d6st in 1996) have shown that those who overcome their phobia are usually able to maintain the improvement over the long-term.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=5}}</ref> As avoidance contributes to the perpetuation of the phobia, constant, yet safe, real world interaction is recommended during and after therapy in order to reinforce positive exposure to the animal.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=73}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anxiety disorder]]\n* [[List of phobias]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|21em}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{Refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite book |last=Antony |first=Martin M. |title=Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A Guide to Assessment and Treatment |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |year=2000 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Antony |first1=Martin M. |first2=Randi E. |last2=McCabe |title=Overcoming Animal Insect Phobias: How to Conquer Fear of Dogs, Snakes, Rodents, Bees, Spiders More |location=Oakland |publisher=[[New Harbinger Publications]] |year=2005 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Barlow |first=David H. |title=Anxiety and its Disorders: The Nature and Treatment of Anxiety and Panic |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2002 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Timothy J. |first2=William C. |last2=Sanderson |title=Specific Phobias: Clinical Applications of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy |location=Northvale |publisher=Jason Aronson Inc. |year=1998 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Di Nardo |first1=Peter A. |first2=Lawrence T. |last2=Guzy |first3=Jill Ann |last3=Jenkins |first4=Rita M. |last4=Bak |first5=Susan F. |last5=Tomasi |first6=Michelle |last6=Copland |title=Etiology and maintenance of dog fears |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=26 |issue=3 |year=1988 |pages=241\u2013244 |pmid=3408458 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Di Nardo |first1=Peter A. |first2=Lawrence T. |last2=Guzy |first3=Rita M. |last3=Bak |title=Anxiety response patterns and etiological factors in dog-gearful and non-fearful subjects |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=26 |issue=3 |year=1988 |pages=245\u2013251 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) |edition=4th |location=Washington DC |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |year=2000 |ref=DSM}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Doogan |first1=Sharon |first2=Glyn V. |last2=Thomas |title=Origins of fear of dogs in adults and children: the role of conditioning processes and prior familiarity with dogs |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=30 |issue=4 |year=1992 |pages=387\u2013394 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Hoffmann |first1=Willem A. |first2=Lourens H. |last2=Human |title=Experiences, characteristics and treatment of women suffering from dog phobia |journal=[[Anthrozo\u00f6s]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=28 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Neville J. |first2=Viv |last2=Clowes-Hollins |first3=Thomas H. |last3=Ollendick |title=The etiology of childhood dog phobia |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=35 |issue=1 |year=1997 |page=77 |pmid=9009047 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Maj |editor1-first=Mario |editor2-first=Hagop S. |editor2-last=Akiskal |editor3-first=Juan Jos\u00e9 |editor3-last=L\u00f3pez-Ibor |editor4-first=Ahmed |editor4-last=Okasha| display-editors = 3 |title=Phobias |location=Chichester |publisher=J.

Attendees are encouraged to dress in costume befitting a Halloween dance party. The event has five performance stages. The Main Stage is where The String Cheese Incident plays three sets each evening and is then followed by other headlining bands. The Amphitheater has a stage to accommodate additional headliners. The Patch is an additional stage the size of the Amphitheater. Spirit Lake is home to the art installation and a silent disco. The Campground Stage accommodates local, less well-known bands). Each year approximately 100 artists perform.\n\nIn 2014, Suwannee Hulaween added a day to the festival to become a four-day long festival. If Halloween (October 31) falls on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday of that year, Suwannee Hulaween is held during those four days. Otherwise it is held the weekend before.\n\nThe 2018 festival featured the world's first virtual reality music stage that allowed attendees to interactively explore the relationship between music and sound.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/soundscape-vr-virtual-reality-music-stage-suwannee-hulaween|title=Soundscape VR Virtual Reality Music Stage Premieres At Suwannee Hulaween|date=2018-11-26|work=JamBase|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127022357/https://www.jambase.com/article/soundscape-vr-virtual-reality-music-stage-suwannee-hulaween|archive-date=2018-11-27|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\nSuwannee Hulaween 2019 was confirmed in May 2019 and will headline The String Cheese Incident, Bassnectar, Anderson Paak and The Free Nationals, and Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit.

Attendees are encouraged to dress in costume befitting a Halloween dance party. The event has five performance stages. The Main Stage is where The String Cheese Incident plays three sets each evening and is then followed by other headlining bands. The Amphitheater has a stage to accommodate additional headliners. The Patch is an additional stage the size of the Amphitheater. Spirit Lake is home to the art installation and a silent disco. The Campground Stage accommodates local, less well-known bands). Each year approximately 100 artists perform.\n\nIn 2014, Suwannee Hulaween added a day to the festival to become a four-day long festival. If Halloween (October 31) falls on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday of that year, Suwannee Hulaween is held during those four days. Otherwise it is held the weekend before.\n\nThe 2018 festival featured the world's first virtual reality music stage that allowed attendees to interactively explore the relationship between music and sound.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/soundscape-vr-virtual-reality-music-stage-suwannee-hulaween|title=Soundscape VR Virtual Reality Music Stage Premieres At Suwannee Hulaween|date=2018-11-26|work=JamBase|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127022357/https://www.jambase.com/article/soundscape-vr-virtual-reality-music-stage-suwannee-hulaween|archive-date=2018-11-27|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\nSuwannee Hulaween 2019 was confirmed in May of 2019 and will headline The String Cheese Incident, Bassnectar, Anderson Paak and The Free Nationals, and Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit.

They farmed [[cassava]], peanuts, tobacco, [[sweet potato]]es and maize, in addition to extracting the essence from other local plants such as the [[Caryocar brasiliense|pequi]] and the [[Attalea speciosa|babassu]]. Production was for food, [[straw]] or [[madeira]].  They cultivated local fruits such as [[jabuticaba]], [[cashew]]s, [[Spondias mombin]] and [[Goiaba]]s.\n\nThe Indians both influenced and were influenced by the Europeans who arrived in the fifteenth century. The Portuguese \"nourished themselves with wood-flour, slaughtered the big game to eat, packed their nets and imitated the rough, free life\" in the words of Pedro Calmon.<ref>CALMON, Pedro: ''Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil'', S\u00e3o Paulo, 1939, vol. 1</ref>\n\nUntil other crops began to be exported, [[brazilwood]] was the main reason Portugal wanted control in Brazil.<ref>{{cite book | last = ARRUDA | first = Jos\u00e9 Jobson  | title = Hist\u00f3ria Integrada: da Idade M\u00e9dia ao nascimento do mundo moderno  | edition = 2\u00aa | year = 1996 | publisher = [[editora \u00c1tica|\u00c1tica]] | place = S\u00e3o Paulo | isbn = 85-08-05399-1 | pages = 126, 129  | chapter = Cap. 21 \u2013 ''Os primeiros tempos: a explora\u00e7\u00e3o do pau-brasil'' | quote = Foi com o objetivo de explorar o com\u00e9rcio dessa madeira que os portugueses fundaram uma s\u00e9rie de benfeitorias(...)

This provided arable land and ashes for use as fertilizer and soil cover.\n\nScholars such as [[Monteiro Lobato]] considered this practice to be harmful. However, burning only became a problem when the Europeans adopted the practice aggressively around 1500, divided land into farms, began monocropping, etc. The combination of burning with these new farming methods decimated native flora.<ref name=aa>{{cite journal |title=O uso do fogo: o manejo ind\u00edgena e a piromania da monocultura |volume=14 |issue=40 |pages=231\u2013250 |language=pt |author=Leonel, Mauro |journal=Estudos Avan\u00e7ados |date=Sep\u2013Dec 2000 |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1590/S0103-40142000000300019 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIndian land management included garden areas in locations selected to allow interaction with their surroundings.

They farmed [[cassava]], peanuts, tobacco, [[sweet potato]]es and maize, in addition to extracting the essence from other local plants such as the [[Caryocar brasiliense|pequi]] and the [[Attalea speciosa|babassu]]. Production was for food, [[straw]] or [[madeira]].  They cultivated local fruits such as [[jabuticaba]], [[cashew]]s, [[Spondias mombin]] and [[Goiaba]]s.\n\nThe Indians both influenced and were influenced by the Europeans who arrived in the fifteenth century. The Portuguese \"nourished themselves with wood-flour, slaughtered the big game to eat, packed their nets and imitated the rough, free life\" in the words of Pedro Calmon.<ref>CALMON, Pedro: ''Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil'', S\u00e3o Paulo, 1939, vol. 1</ref>\n\nUntil other crops began to be exported, [[brazilwood]] was the main reason Portugal wanted control in Brazil.<ref>{{cite book | last = ARRUDA | first = Jos\u00e9 Jobson  | title = Hist\u00f3ria Integrada: da Idade M\u00e9dia ao nascimento do mundo moderno  | edition = 2\u00aa | year = 1996 | publisher = [[editora \u00c1tica|\u00c1tica]] | place = S\u00e3o Paulo | isbn = 85-08-05399-1 | pages = 126, 129  | chapter = Cap. 21 \u2013 ''Os primeiros tempos: a explora\u00e7\u00e3o do pau-brasil'' | quote = Foi com o objetivo de explorar o com\u00e9rcio dessa madeira que os portugueses fundaram uma s\u00e9rie de benfeitorias(...)

This provided arable land and ashes for use as fertilizer and soil cover.\n\nScholars such as [[Monteiro Lobato]] considered this practice to be harmful. However, burning only became a problem when the Europeans adopted the practice aggressively around 1500, divided land into farms, began monocropping, etc. The combination of burning with these new farming methods decimated native flora.<ref name=aa>{{cite journal |title=O uso do fogo: o manejo ind\u00edgena e a piromania da monocultura |volume=14 |issue=40 |pages=231\u2013250 |language=pt |author=Leonel, Mauro |journal=Estudos Avan\u00e7ados |date=Sep\u2013Dec 2000 |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1590/S0103-40142000000300019 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIndian land management included garden areas in locations selected to allow interaction with their surroundings.

While laws prohibited their enslavement, in many areas the law was not respected. Locals responded by rebelling, flight or simply dying. European diseases took a heavy toll on indigenous peoples.\n\nThe settlers then switched to enslaving and importing Africans to do the work.<ref name=\"hh\">SILVA, Joaquim, PENNA, J. B.

Antonil stated: \"the slaves are the hands and feet of the mill, because without them in Brazil, it is not possible to make, maintain or expand the farm or have a running mill.\"<ref name=\"hh\" />\n\nThe slaves cleared the agricultural frontiers, such as in the west for coffee [[plantation]]s. By the end of the Second Reign, Brazil accounted for more than half the world's coffee production.<ref name=\"hh\" />\n\nOn 13 May 1888 Brazil adopted the [[Lei \u00c1urea]] ('Golden Law'), which abolished slavery in Brazil.

Many of the farmers turned to the Republican party or became indifferent to the attack of the institutions...\"\n\nThe law did not provide an accompanying land distribution to the ex-captives.

During fiscal year 2015, Palm Tran provided 10,773,132 one-way passenger trips and 889,056 [[paratransit]] trips to [[Palm Beach County]]. Palm Tran also serves a portion of [[Broward County, Florida]] where it overlaps with [[Broward County Transit]]. Palm Tran has four main facilities (North Campus in [[West Palm Beach]], South Campus in [[Delray Beach]], Palm Tran Connection/Military Trail and the Belle Glade Facility) with its main headquarters in [[West Palm Beach]] on Electronics Way. The current Executive Director is Clinton B. Forbes.\n\n==History==\nIn 1971, Florida Transit Management, Inc. began service with 20 buses on seven routes.  In 1980, this service was expanded to over 60 buses in 22 routes, then renamed '''CoTran''', short for \"County Transportation\".  Finally, in 1996, '''CoTran''' was completely restructured to over 150 buses in over 30 routes, then renamed '''Palm Tran,''' its fleet repainted to the present white and teal design scheme, and has been that way since.  At that time the basic design of the livery of the buses was changed from white and orange to white and teal, some of which are screen-wrapped to the logos and design of the company that sponsors those particular buses, but preserve their Palm Tran logos and bus numbers, the latter of which are assigned a four-digit number according to the year and order in which they were acquired. Also at that time, Florida Transit Management was replaced with Palm Tran Inc., a nonprofit. Palm Tran will introduce USB charging stations on its newest fleet in early 2017.\n\nOn September 30, 2018, Palm Tran implemented the first overhaul to the entire network since 1996. In addition, free Wi-Fi was added on all busses.<ref>http://discover.pbcgov.org/palmtran/Pages/RPM.aspx</ref>\n\n==Future==\nOn April 23, 2019, The Palm Tran broke ground on an expansion project on its South County Facility in Delray Beach, Florida.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.masstransitmag.com/technology/facilities/shelters-stations-fixtures-parking-lighting/press-release/21079936/palm-tran-palm-tran-breaks-ground-on-its-south-county-facility-expansion-project|title=Palm Tran Breaks Ground on its South County Facility Expansion Project|website=www.MassTransitMag.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>The current 3,800 Square foot space will be converted into a three-story 34,000 square foot facility.<ref name=\":1\" />The project is set to cost 25 million, 90 percent of which is federally funded.<ref name=\":1\" />The facility will feature charging stations for their fleet of fully electric buses; along with service stations for 20 additional buses.<ref name=\":1\" />The building will feature art by Palm Beach County's Art in Public Places Program.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Fare==\n'''NOTE:''' all fares are free due to the [[COVID-19]] outbreak since late March 2020, up to further notice.\n\nThe standard adult one-way fare is $2.

During fiscal year 2015, Palm Tran provided 10,773,132 one-way passenger trips and 889,056 [[paratransit]] trips to [[Palm Beach County]]. Palm Tran also serves a portion of [[Broward County, Florida]] where it overlaps with [[Broward County Transit]]. Palm Tran has four main facilities (North Campus in [[West Palm Beach]], South Campus in [[Delray Beach]], Palm Tran Connection/Military Trail and the Belle Glade Facility) with its main headquarters in [[West Palm Beach]] on Electronics Way. The current Executive Director is Clinton B. Forbes.\n\n==History==\nIn 1971, Florida Transit Management, Inc. began service with 20 buses on seven routes.  In 1980, this service was expanded to over 60 buses in 22 routes, then renamed '''CoTran''', short for \"County Transportation\".  Finally, in 1996, '''CoTran''' was completely restructured to over 150 buses in over 30 routes, then renamed '''Palm Tran,''' its fleet repainted to the present white and teal design scheme, and has been that way since.  At that time the basic design of the livery of the buses was changed from white and orange to white and teal, some of which are screen-wrapped to the logos and design of the company that sponsors those particular buses, but preserve their Palm Tran logos and bus numbers, the latter of which are assigned a four-digit number according to the year and order in which they were acquired. Also at that time, Florida Transit Management was replaced with Palm Tran Inc., a nonprofit. Palm Tran will introduce USB charging stations on its newest fleet in early 2017.\n\nOn September 30, 2018, Palm Tran implemented the first overhaul to the entire network since 1996. In addition, free Wi-Fi was added on all busses.<ref>http://discover.pbcgov.org/palmtran/Pages/RPM.aspx</ref>\n\n==Future==\nOn April 23, 2019, The Palm Tran broke ground on an expansion project on its South County Facility in Delray Beach, Florida.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.masstransitmag.com/technology/facilities/shelters-stations-fixtures-parking-lighting/press-release/21079936/palm-tran-palm-tran-breaks-ground-on-its-south-county-facility-expansion-project|title=Palm Tran Breaks Ground on its South County Facility Expansion Project|website=www.MassTransitMag.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>The current 3,800 Square foot space will be converted into a three-story 34,000 square foot facility.<ref name=\":1\" />The project is set to cost 25 million, 90 percent of which is federally funded.<ref name=\":1\" />The facility will feature charging stations for their fleet of fully electric buses; along with service stations for 20 additional buses.<ref name=\":1\" />The building will feature art by Palm Beach County\u2019s Art in Public Places Program.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Fare==\n'''NOTE:''' all fares are free due to the [[COVID-19]] outbreak since late March 2020, up to further notice.\n\nThe standard adult one-way fare is $2.

Part of the new stadium was a temporary stand from Trent Bridge which was literally floated across the river.\n\nOn 3 September 1910, County moved to Meadow Lane, the first game was a 1\u20131 draw with old rivals Nottingham Forest, played in front of {{formatnum:27000}} fans paying receipts of \u00a3775.<ref>The Magpies Keith Warsop page 52 {{ISBN|0-86023-214-X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the landlord, Nottingham Corporation, which leased the land to the club, came very close to removing the club from its premises to make way for an abattoir.<ref>[http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10426~2155601,00.html nearly an abattoir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924072522/http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10426~2155601,00.html |date=24 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe stadium remained largely the same until 1923 when the [[Sneinton]] Side was replaced with a new stand, named the County Road Stand after the newly constructed road behind it.\n\nMeadow Lane was bombed during [[World War II]] forcing the club to suspend all fixtures during the 1942 season. The northern side of the Main Stand was badly damaged and the pitch left in an unplayable condition.<ref>[http://www.nottscounty-mad.co.uk/news/loadsngl.asp?cid=ED21 Meadow Lane bombed]</ref>\n\n[[File:MeadowLane2.jpg|thumb|The Jimmy Sirrel Stand]]\n[[File:MeadowLane3.jpg|thumb|The Derek Pavis Stand]]\n[[File:MeadowLane1.jpg|thumb|The Spion Kop]]\n[[File:Jimmy_and_Jack_statue.jpeg|thumb|right| Jimmy Sirrel & Jack Wheeler statue at Meadow Lane]]\n[[File:Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial image showing the proximity of Meadow Lane (top) to the [[City Ground]]]]\nThe stadium has played host to Forest games on a number of occasions. After the war, when flooding from the River Trent left the City Ground in an unplayable condition and again in 1968 when the Main Stand at the City Ground was destroyed by fire in a game against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\n==A new stadium==\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s the stadium became increasingly dilapidated. The Meadow Lane End was demolished in 1978<ref>{{cite book|last=Wain|first=Paul|title=Notts County: a pictorial history|date=2004|publisher=Yore Publications|location=Harefield, U.K.|isbn=0-9547830-3-4|page=70}}</ref>  and replaced by a building which housed new dressing rooms, a social club and a variety of other facilities designed to generate more income. There was no stand at this end for several years and Meadow Lane was reduced to a three sided ground. Eventually a small terrace was installed on this side. The [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and [[Hillsborough disaster]] brought the safety of football stadia into the public gaze and eventually the [[Taylor Report]] required that football clubs modernise their grounds. Meadow Lane was subsequently redeveloped during the early 1990s, although the work was planned before the report was issued. The Meadow Lane End, County Road Stand and Spion Kop were all demolished in the 1992 close season and replaced with the ''Family Stand'', the ''[[Jimmy Sirrel]] Stand'' and the ''Spion Kop Stand'' respectively. The Main Stand was replaced during the close season of 1994 by the ''Derek Pavis Stand''.\n\nIn June 2002, as part of a sponsorship deal, the ground was briefly renamed the \"Aaron Scargill Stadium\". However, the ground reverted to its original name when the deal later fell through.<ref name=\"world.nottscountyfc\">{{Cite web |url=http://world.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0,,10426~2105675,00.html |title=Notts County &#124; Club &#124; Meadow Lane &#124; Meadow Lane&nbsp;\u2014 The Home Of Notts County FC |publisher=Nottscountyfc.premiumtv.co.uk |access-date=28 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2179121.stm |title=UK &#124; England &#124; Magpies sponsor deal collapses |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2002 |accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Meadow Lane today==\n\nThe Derek Pavis Stand contains a number of conference and function facilities to complement ''The Broken Wheelbarrow'' bar behind the Family Stand. These host numerous functions throughout the year, ranging from social evenings organised by Notts County's supporter organisations, to wedding receptions and meetings of [[Protestantism|evangelical]] Christian churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracechurchnottingham.org |title=Grace Church Nottingham |publisher=Grace Church Nottingham |date= |accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nAway supporters are normally restricted to the Jimmy Sirrel stand, at the County Road side. This features a triangular gable (a replica of that on the old County Road stand) with the name of the club and its year of formation. Such gables are also present in the stadia of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].\n\nThe Family Stand was renamed The Haydn Green Family Stand in 2007, after the man who saved Notts County from liquidation in 2003, by buying the lease on the ground and investing several million pounds. Haydn Green died suddenly in 2007 leaving an estate which still controls the lease on the ground.\n\nOutside the stadium on Meadow Lane is a bronze statue of [[Jimmy Sirrel]] and coach [[Jack Wheeler (footballer, born 1919)|Jack Wheeler]]. Entitled \"Legends of the Lane\", the statue was sculpted by Andy Edwards and unveiled on 5 May 2016.\n\n==Rugby Union==\n\nIn 2006, it was announced that [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham Rugby]] would play a number of home games at the stadium. It was further announced in May 2006 that Notts County and Nottingham Rugby were negotiating making the agreement permanent. In October 2006 it was announced that an agreement had been reached with Notts County, allowing Nottingham Rugby to play the remainder of their 2006/07 home fixtures at Meadow Lane.

The northern side of the Main Stand was badly damaged and the pitch left in an unplayable condition.<ref>[http://www.nottscounty-mad.co.uk/news/loadsngl.asp?cid=ED21 Meadow Lane bombed]</ref>\n\n[[File:MeadowLane2.jpg|thumb|The Jimmy Sirrel Stand]]\n[[File:MeadowLane3.jpg|thumb|The Derek Pavis Stand]]\n[[File:MeadowLane1.jpg|thumb|The Spion Kop]]\n[[File:Jimmy_and_Jack_statue.jpeg|thumb|right| Jimmy Sirrel & Jack Wheeler statue at Meadow Lane]]\n[[File:Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial image showing the proximity of Meadow Lane (top) to the [[City Ground]]]]\nThe stadium has played host to Forest games on a number of occasions. After the war, when flooding from the River Trent left the City Ground in an unplayable condition and again in 1968 when the Main Stand at the City Ground was destroyed by fire in a game against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\n==A new stadium==\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s the stadium became increasingly dilapidated. The Meadow Lane End was demolished in 1978<ref>{{cite book|last=Wain|first=Paul|title=Notts County: a pictorial history|date=2004|publisher=Yore Publications|location=Harefield, U.K.|isbn=0-9547830-3-4|page=70}}</ref>  and replaced by a building which housed new dressing rooms, a social club and a variety of other facilities designed to generate more income. There was no stand at this end for several years and Meadow Lane was reduced to a three sided ground. Eventually a small terrace was installed on this side. The [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and [[Hillsborough disaster]] brought the safety of football stadia into the public gaze and eventually the [[Taylor Report]] required that football clubs modernise their grounds. Meadow Lane was subsequently redeveloped during the early 1990s, although the work was planned before the report was issued. The Meadow Lane End, County Road Stand and Spion Kop were all demolished in the 1992 close season and replaced with the ''Family Stand'', the ''[[Jimmy Sirrel]] Stand'' and the ''Spion Kop Stand'' respectively. The Main Stand was replaced during the close season of 1994 by the ''Derek Pavis Stand''.\n\nIn June 2002, as part of a sponsorship deal, the ground was briefly renamed the \"Aaron Scargill Stadium\". However, the ground reverted to its original name when the deal later fell through.<ref name=\"world.nottscountyfc\">{{Cite web |url=http://world.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0,,10426~2105675,00.html |title=Notts County &#124; Club &#124; Meadow Lane &#124; Meadow Lane&nbsp;\u2014 The Home Of Notts County FC |publisher=Nottscountyfc.premiumtv.co.uk |access-date=28 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2179121.stm |title=UK &#124; England &#124; Magpies sponsor deal collapses |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2002 |accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Meadow Lane today==\n\nThe Derek Pavis Stand contains a number of conference and function facilities to complement ''The Broken Wheelbarrow'' bar behind the Family Stand. These host numerous functions throughout the year, ranging from social evenings organised by Notts County's supporter organisations, to wedding receptions and meetings of [[Protestantism|evangelical]] Christian churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracechurchnottingham.org |title=Grace Church Nottingham |publisher=Grace Church Nottingham |date= |accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nAway supporters are normally restricted to the Jimmy Sirrel stand, at the County Road side. This features a triangular gable (a replica of that on the old County Road stand) with the name of the club and its year of formation. Such gables are also present in the stadia of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].\n\nThe Family Stand was renamed The Haydn Green Family Stand in 2007, after the man who saved Notts County from liquidation in 2003, by buying the lease on the ground and investing several million pounds. Haydn Green died suddenly in 2007 leaving an estate which still controls the lease on the ground.\n\nOutside the stadium on Meadow Lane is a bronze statue of [[Jimmy Sirrel]] and coach [[Jack Wheeler (footballer, born 1919)|Jack Wheeler]]. Entitled \"Legends of the Lane\", the statue was sculpted by Andy Edwards and unveiled on 5 May 2016.\n\n==Rugby Union==\n\nIn 2006, it was announced that [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham Rugby]] would play a number of home games at the stadium. It was further announced in May 2006 that Notts County and Nottingham Rugby were negotiating making the agreement permanent. In October 2006 it was announced that an agreement had been reached with Notts County, allowing Nottingham Rugby to play the remainder of their 2006/07 home fixtures at Meadow Lane. In 2014 it was announced that the rugby club would move out of Meadow Lane to play at The Bay, West Bridgford.\n\n==Stands==\n\nFor the 2017-18 season, the capacity set by the local authority for football is 19,841.<ref>[http://committee.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/documents/s58996/2017%2006%2023%20NCFC%20report%202017%20final.pdf]</ref> The stadium has a total of 20,211 seats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n\n|-\n!Stand\n!Previously\n!Fans\n!Section Capacity\n!Stand Capacity\n|-\n|Derek Pavis Stand\n|Main Stand\n|Home \n|6,330 (Seats)\n385 (VIPs/Press)\n|6,715\n|-\n|Haydn Green\nFamily Stand\n|Meadow Lane End\n|Home \n|2,137 (Seats)\n144 (Boxes)\n|2,281 \n|-\n|Jimmy Sirrel Stand\n|County Road Stand\n|Home/Away \nor Away only\n|2,040 (Home) 3365 (Away)\n|5,775 (Away only)\n|-\n|Kop\n|Iremonger Road End \n|Home \n|2,024 (Upper Tier) \n3,416 (Lower Tier) \n|5,440\n|-\n|Total\n|\n|\n|\n|20,211 seats are available \n18,816 (Football)\n|}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* The Magpies, Keith Warsop {{ISBN|978-0-86023-214-8}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.footballgroundguide.com/leagues/england/league-two/meadow-lane-notts-county.html Football Ground Guide Article]\n*[http://www.stadiumguide.com/meadowlane/ Stadium Guide Article]\n\n{{Notts County F.C.}}\n{{National League (English football)}}\n\n[[Category:Sports venues in Nottingham]]\n[[Category:Football venues in England]]\n[[Category:Notts County F.C.]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1910]]\n[[Category:English Football League venues]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:a456:7ad2:1:4d36:3a0f:7d88:7fef", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow_Lane"}
