In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement.

The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born.

Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out). Around 4000 people, including foreign diplomats, members of the local government and celebrities participated amidst a strong police presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/Vijesti/a376875/Bez-ijednog-incidenta-Zavrsena-prva-Bh.-povorka-ponosa-u-Sarajevu.html|title=Bez ijednog incidenta: Zavr\u0161ena prva Bh. povorka ponosa u Sarajevu|publisher=N1}}</ref> \n\n====Bulgaria====\nLike the other countries from the [[Balkan]]s, Bulgaria's population is very conservative when it comes to issues like [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]]. Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.\n\n====Croatia====\n{{see also|LGBT rights in Croatia#LGBT prides and other marches}}\nFirst pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in [[Zagreb Pride|Zagreb]] and has been held annually ever since.

In its current format, it has been held every year since 1996, where Copenhagen hosted EuroPride. Before 1994 the national LGBT association organised demonstration-like freedom marches. Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest. In 2017, some 25,000 people took part in the parade with [[float (parade)|floats]] and flags, and about 300,000 were out in the streets to experience it.<ref>{{cite web |title=K\u00e6mpe-optog: 300.000 f\u00f8lger Pride gennem K\u00f8benhavn|url=https://www.avisen.dk/300000-foelger-farverigt-optog-i-hovedstadens-gader_458063.aspx|publisher=avisen.dk |date=19 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe smaller [[Aarhus Pride]] in held every year in June in the [[Jutland]]ic city of [[Aarhus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://good-evening-europe.dk/2017/06/06/video-aarhus-pride-2017-parade-prisuddeling-og-underholdning-topklasse/ |title=Aarhus Pride 2017 \u2013 Parade, prisuddeling og underholdning i topklasse! |publisher=good-evening-europe.dk |language=Danish |date=6 June 2017 |accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Estonia====\n\nThe [[Baltic Pride]] event was held in Tallinn in 2011, 2014 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://balticpride.org/about/|title=About|website=balticpride.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>\n\n====Finland====\nThe [[Helsinki Pride]] was first time organized in 1975 and called ''Freedom Day''.

Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful.

In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement.

The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration.

Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out). Around 4000 people, including foreign diplomats, members of the local government and celebrities participated amidst a strong police presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/Vijesti/a376875/Bez-ijednog-incidenta-Zavrsena-prva-Bh.-povorka-ponosa-u-Sarajevu.html|title=Bez ijednog incidenta: Zavr\u0161ena prva Bh. povorka ponosa u Sarajevu|publisher=N1}}</ref> \n\n====Bulgaria====\nLike the other countries from the [[Balkan]]s, Bulgaria's population is very conservative when it comes to issues like [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]]. Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.\n\n====Croatia====\n{{see also|LGBT rights in Croatia#LGBT prides and other marches}}\nFirst pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in [[Zagreb Pride|Zagreb]] and has been held annually ever since.

In its current format, it has been held every year since 1996, where Copenhagen hosted EuroPride. Before 1994 the national LGBT association organised demonstration-like freedom marches. Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest. In 2017, some 25,000 people took part in the parade with [[float (parade)|floats]] and flags, and about 300,000 were out in the streets to experience it.<ref>{{cite web |title=K\u00e6mpe-optog: 300.000 f\u00f8lger Pride gennem K\u00f8benhavn|url=https://www.avisen.dk/300000-foelger-farverigt-optog-i-hovedstadens-gader_458063.aspx|publisher=avisen.dk |date=19 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe smaller [[Aarhus Pride]] in held every year in June in the [[Jutland]]ic city of [[Aarhus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://good-evening-europe.dk/2017/06/06/video-aarhus-pride-2017-parade-prisuddeling-og-underholdning-topklasse/ |title=Aarhus Pride 2017 \u2013 Parade, prisuddeling og underholdning i topklasse! |publisher=good-evening-europe.dk |language=Danish |date=6 June 2017 |accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Estonia====\n\nThe [[Baltic Pride]] event was held in Tallinn in 2011, 2014 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://balticpride.org/about/|title=About|website=balticpride.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>\n\n====Finland====\nThe [[Helsinki Pride]] was first time organized in 1975 and called ''Freedom Day''.

Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful.

In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement.

The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

The main parade, which is also partly funded by the city's municipality, was one of the largest ever to take place in Israel, with approximately 200,000 participants. The first [[Tel Aviv Pride|Pride parade in Tel Aviv]] took place in 1993.\n\nOn June 30, 2005, the fourth annual Pride march of [[Jerusalem]] took place. The Jerusalem parade has been met with resistance due to the high presence of religious bodies in the city. It had originally been prohibited by a municipal ban which was canceled by the court. Many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem's [[Muslim]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christians|Christian]] communities had arrived to a rare consensus asking the municipal government to cancel the permit of the paraders.\n\nAnother parade, this time billed as an international event, was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2005, but was postponed to 2006 due to the stress on police forces during the summer of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]]. In 2006, it was again postponed due to the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israel-Hezbollah war]]. It was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006, and caused a wave of protests by [[Haredi]] Jews around central Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=114609 |title=9 Protesters Detained at Anti-Gay Pride Demonstration |publisher=[[Arutz 7]] |date=November 1, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The [[Israeli Police|Israel National Police]] had filed a petition to cancel the parade due to foreseen strong opposition. Later, an agreement was reached to convert the parade into an assembly inside the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] stadium in Jerusalem. June 21, 2007, the [[Jerusalem Open House]] organization succeeded in staging a parade in central Jerusalem after police allocated thousands of personnel to secure the general area. The rally planned afterwards was canceled due to an unrelated national fire brigade strike which prevented proper permits from being issued. The parade was postponed once more in 2014, as a result of [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Protective Edge]] Operation.\n\n====Japan====\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n''See also [[:ja:\u30b2\u30a4\u30fb\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9#\u65e5\u672c|Pride Parade in Japan]]''\n\nThe first Pride Parade in Japan was held on August 28th, 1994 in Tokyo (while the names were not Pride Parade until 2007).

At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\n\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out).

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.\n\n====Croatia====\n{{see also|LGBT rights in Croatia#LGBT prides and other marches}}\nFirst pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in [[Zagreb Pride|Zagreb]] and has been held annually ever since.

In its current format, it has been held every year since 1996, where Copenhagen hosted EuroPride. Before 1994 the national LGBT association organised demonstration-like freedom marches. Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest.

The Festival involves the Pride Parade, the route of which is from [[O'Connell Street]] to [[Merrion Square]]. However, the route was changed for the 2017 Parade due to [[Luas Cross City]] works.\nThe parade attracts thousands of people who line the streets each year.

Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\n\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\n\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\n\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2nd. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held.

The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].\n\nIn 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].\n\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\n\nOther [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] parades are held in [[Cabo Frio]] ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Campinas]] ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]), [[Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Vit\u00f3ria]] (capital of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]]), and [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Uberaba]] ([[Minas Gerais]]). [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazilian]] parades take place in [[Curitiba]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Pelotas]], and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western]] ones happen in [[Campo Grande]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Across [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], they are present in all capitals, namely, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Aracaju]], [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Recife]], [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Teresina]] and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]], and also in [[Cear\u00e1]]'s [[Sert\u00e3o|hinterland]] major urban center, [[Juazeiro do Norte]].

As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kolher|first1=Will|title=June 28, 1970 \u2013 From Liberation to Pride: The 45th Anniversary of the Christopher Street Liberation Day March \u2013 Rare Video|url=http://www.back2stonewall.com/2015/06/june-28-1970-liberation-pride-45th-anniversary-christopher-street-liberation-day-march-rare-video.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017|publisher=back2stonewall.com|date=June 28, 2015}}</ref> and they dropped \"Gay Liberation\" and \"Gay Freedom\" from the names, replacing them with \"Gay Pride\".\n[[File:Chicago Pride Parade 1985 030.jpg|thumb|right|Pride march in [[Lakeview, Chicago]] in 1985]]\n\n==Description==\n[[File: Gay parade.jpg|thumb|Gay Pride Parade in New York City, 2008]]\nMany parades still have at least some of the original political or [[activism|activist]] character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\n\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out).

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]].

The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre.

The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain's Gay Liberation Front, and Italy's activist homosexual rights group ''{{ill|Fuori!|it}}''.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\">{{cite book |language=Italian |last1=Rossi Barilli |first1=Gianni |title=Il movimento gay in Italia |trans-title=The Gay Movement in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2cJ1zT70ucwC |publisher=[[Feltrinelli (publisher)|Feltrinelli]] |location=Milano |year=1999 |isbn=88-07-81559-1 |oclc=801192305 |series=Universale economica}}</ref>{{rp|54\u201359}}\n\nThe first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of ''Fuori!'' held in [[Turin]] in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|103}}  Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in [[Livorno]]. In [[Pisa]] in November of that year, the {{ill|Orfeo Collective|it|Collettivo Omosessuale Orfeo}} organized the first march against anti-gay violence.  Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|122\u2013124}}\n\nLater, a system of \"national Pride\" observances designated one city to hold the official events, starting with Rome in 1994. Starting in 2013, the organization Onda Pride organized additional events, and in 2017 events were organized in 24 cities nationwide under its auspices.\n\n====Latvia====\n{{Main|Riga Pride and Friendship Days}}\n\nOn July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in [[Riga]], surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the [[Riga City Council]], and the then-[[Prime Minister of Latvia]], [[Aigars Kalv\u012btis]], opposed the event, stating Riga should \"not promote things like that\", however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4708617.stm | work=BBC News | title=Latvia gay pride given go-ahead | date=July 22, 2005 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by \"No Pride\" protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed.\n\nIn 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around [[V\u0113rmane Garden]], protected physically from \"No Pride\" protesters by 1,500 [[State Police (Latvia)|Latvian police]], with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses.

Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\n\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\n\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\n\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2nd. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held.

The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].\n\nIn 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].\n\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\n\nOther [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] parades are held in [[Cabo Frio]] ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Campinas]] ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]), [[Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Vit\u00f3ria]] (capital of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]]), and [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Uberaba]] ([[Minas Gerais]]). [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazilian]] parades take place in [[Curitiba]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Pelotas]], and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western]] ones happen in [[Campo Grande]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Across [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], they are present in all capitals, namely, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Aracaju]], [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Recife]], [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Teresina]] and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]], and also in [[Cear\u00e1]]'s [[Sert\u00e3o|hinterland]] major urban center, [[Juazeiro do Norte]]. [[North Region, Brazil|Northern Brazilian]] parades are those from [[Bel\u00e9m]], [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]] and [[Manaus]].\n\n==== Guyana ====\nGuyana held its first pride parade in June 2018.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://demerarawaves.com/2018/06/02/virtually-incident-free-gay-pride-parade-held-in-guyana-to-demand-election-promises/|title=Virtually incident-free gay pride parade held in Guyana to demand election promises|last=Chabrol|first=Denis|date=2018-06-03|website=Demerara Waves|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref> It was the first in the Anglo-phone Caribbean and was successfully staged in spite of religious opposition.\n\n==Opposition==\n\n<nowiki/><nowiki/>{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:SF Pride Drag Queens.jpg|thumb|A festive float with costumed dancers at [[San Francisco Pride]] 2005]]\nThere is opposition to pride events both within LGBT and mainstream populations.\n\nCritics, such as [[Gay Shame]], charge the parades with an undue emphasis on sex and [[sexual fetish|fetish-related]] interests, which they see as counterproductive to LGBT interests, and expose the \"gay community\" to ridicule. LGBT activists{{Who|date=July 2010}} counter that traditional media have played a role in emphasizing the most outlandish and therefore non-representative aspects of the community.

After the Democratic Party primary in July, a runoff was held in August in which U.S. Congressman [[Lyndon B.

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.  Johnson was a candidate to fill the vacancy created by the death of [[Morris Sheppard]].<ref name=\"Quezada\">{{cite book |last=Quezada |first= J. Gilberto |date=2001 |title=Border Boss: Manuel B.

Assume that the dishonest man had secured a pledge of support from the bosses of the Valley, as he probably would. If the race were close, and the honest man was ahead by only a few thousand votes with all of the returns in except from the Valley...the election could easily be 'stolen' by having the Valley counties send in just enough votes to put the dishonest man in office.

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.
