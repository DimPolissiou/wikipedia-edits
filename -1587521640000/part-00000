Christy in a report prepared for the Home and School Association of Sewickley on November 8, 1912,  the Sewickley Public Library owes its origins to the arrival of a whiskey boat at the Saw Mill landing one Saturday evening in the winter of 1872-73. \"The consequent riot and disorder...led some, interested in the welfare of the young men, to think that such things would not be, had we a place for proper and rational amusement and self-improvement.\"\n\nThe Young Men's Library Association was formed in 1873 and rented a room for library services at the [[Mozart Hall]] (corner of Beaver and Broad Streets). It was later moved to a building next door called Choral Hall. In 1880 the property of the library was transferred to the Sewickley School Board under the general school laws of the state.\n\nIn 1923 the library formally moved to its present location, a building given by Mr. William L. Clause in memory of his wife Elizabeth Ann Clause.\n\nIn the dedication address by Mr. Clause, he stated, \"In presenting this library, it is my desire that it should be the property of the entire valley, yet under the existing conditions, there is no way this can be done, as there is no way the matter can be handled except to deed it to the School District of the borough of Sewickley. Of course if the boroughs ever become consolidated, or if the school districts are ever consolidated, that would solve this problem.\"\n\nIn the ensuing years, [[Osborne, Pennsylvania|Osborne]] and [[Edgeworth, Pennsylvania|Edgeworth]] School Districts also supported the library until 1956 at which time a jointure of eleven municipalities comprising [[Aleppo]], [[Bell Acres]], [[Edgeworth, Pennsylvania|Edgeworth]], [[Glenfield, Pennsylvania|Glenfield]], [[Haysville, Pennsylvania|Haysville]], [[Leet]], [[Leetsdale]], [[Osborne, Pennsylvania|Osborne]], [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania|Sewickley]], [[Sewickley Heights]] and [[Sewickley Hills]], formed the [[Quaker Valley School District]].

It first began with a contribution of books and 51 subscribers. In 1913, the [[Sarasota Woman's Club|Woman's Club]] took over the library then eventually in 1915 it was relocated to the east wing of the Women's Club. The Sarasota City Council soon appropriated $150 a year to locate the library in the old schoolhouse on Main Street rent free for five years. In 1940 the Women's Club requested that the city take absolute control of the library so the city moved it to [[Chidsey Library]].

The company claims it to be the first Android-powered handset which allows the user to modify operating system components without having to [[rooting (Android OS)|root]] the device first. New OS images can easily be installed on the device; the company operates a [[wiki]] and a forum for users to share knowledge. However, unlike similar efforts such as [[Openmoko]], GeeksPhone does not publish details on the phone's hardware beyond common technical specifications.\n\nAnother difference to Openmoko is that GeeksPhone aims to provide a stable device suitable for everyday use and capable of competing with other commercial devices on the market. The GeeksPhone One ships with an Android version which has undergone quality tests and passed Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Code Compliance certification, allowing it to include closed-source Android components and participate in Android Market.\n\nAs of July 2010, the GeeksPhone is not available through any of the big mobile operators.
