It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2005, and won the Grand Jury Prize for Best New American Film from the [[Seattle International Film Festival]]. The title and theme of the film were inspired by the [[Latin]] name for the Chesapeake Bay's indigenous Maryland blue crab \u2013 ''[[Callinectes sapidus]]'' \u2013 ''Callinectes'' translates as \"beautiful swimmers.\"<ref name=swimprod>[http://www.swimmersthemovie.com/production.htm Swimmers \u2013 Production<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSet in a small waterfront town in coastal [[Maryland]], ''Swimmers'' is a film that focuses on Emma Tyler, a fiercely intelligent and observant 11-year-old who develops an ear problem requiring surgery that the Tylers can ill afford. Emma's father, Will, drinks a lot and lives hand to mouth as a waterman. Her mother, Julia, has become a miserable soul, trying to keep a household together on meager funds. She also suspects that Will is having an affair.\n\nGrounded, literally, from her favorite pastime, swimming, Emma is forced to look for alternative ways to pass those lazy summer days. When no one seems to be very interested in talking to Emma, she finds friendship with a troubled young woman, Merrill, who has returned to town looking to deal with her past. The sweetly innocent Emma allows the world-weary Merrill in some ways to reconnect with her own lost innocence, while Merrill, for her part, provides an oasis for Emma, who feels invisible at home in the eyes of her struggling parents. Added to this volatile mix of domestic strife is a love story desperately trying to emerge between Merrill and one of Emma's older brothers Clyde. However, Merrill's ugly past and pathologic need to be used threatens to resurface and destroy her newfound sense of purity.\n\nWill and Julia love their daughter immensely, but suffer from the financial woes of a poor fishing season, the sudden loss of Will's boat and Will's fierce pride in not having to ask for handouts.\n\n==Casting==\n*[[Tara Devon Gallagher]] plays the pivotal role of 11-year-old Emma Tyler, whose passion for swimming is suddenly disrupted by an ear injury requiring expensive surgery. Although Gallagher never had an acting class before \u2013 much less ever acted, she beat out hundreds of other preteens from New York, Los Angeles and Maryland.

Ketchikan is located on [[Revillagigedo Island]], so named in 1793 by Captain [[George Vancouver]].\n\nKetchikan is named after [[Ketchikan Creek]], which flows through the town, emptying into the [[Tongass Narrows]] a short distance southeast of its downtown. \"Ketchikan\" comes from the Tlingit name for the creek, {{lang|tli|Kitschk-hin}}, the meaning of which is unclear. It may mean \"the river belonging to Kitschk\"; other accounts claim it means \"Thundering Wings of an Eagle\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045193/Ketchikan |title=Ketchikan |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2008-05-12 |accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref> In modern Tlingit, this name is {{lang|tli|Kichx\u0331\u00e1an}}.<ref>Edwards, Keri.

Ketchikan Creek served as a summer fish camp for [[Tlingit|Tlingit natives]] for untold years before the town was established by Mike Martin in 1885. He was sent to the area by an Oregon canning company to assess prospects. He established the saltery Clark & Martin and a general store with [[Nova Scotia]] native George Clark, who had been foreman at a cannery that burned down.<ref>http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/TongassPacking/040707_tongass_packing.html</ref>\n\n==Totem poles==\n[[File:Ketchikan from the waterfront, Alaska, nd (COBB 56).jpeg|thumb|Ketchikan waterfront ca. 1918]]\nKetchikan has the world's largest collection of standing [[totem pole]]s, found throughout the city and at four major locations: [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] Totem Park, [[Totem Bight State Historical Park|Totem Bight State Park]], Potlatch Park, and the [[Totem Heritage Center]].

Following a round of [[redistricting]], the convening of the 28th Alaska State Legislature in January 2013 marked the first time in the state's history that no residents of Ketchikan or the surrounding area serve as members of the [[Alaska Legislature]].  Ketchikan is represented in the [[Alaska Senate]] by [[Bert Stedman]], who lives in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and in the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] by [[Independent politician]] [[Dan Ortiz (politician)]], a former schoolteacher who taught at Ketchikan High School.\n\nOver the decades, Ketchikan has produced a number of political figures of note to Alaska in general.  In territorial days, [[Norman Ray Walker|Norman Ray \"Doc\" Walker]], a Canadian-born pharmacist practicing in Ketchikan, was arguably the first career member of the [[Alaska Legislature]].  Walker served in the territorial Senate for 16 years before losing reelection in 1948 following a feud with territorial governor [[Ernest Gruening]].  During the first governorship of [[Walter Hickel]] in the 1960s, two members of his cabinet ([[Frank Murkowski]] and [[Robert W. Ward]]) held strong ties to Ketchikan.  Following Hickel's resignation, Ward ascended to the office of [[List of lieutenant governors of Alaska|secretary of state]] when [[Keith H. Miller]] became governor.  Ketchikan native Walter L.

The surrounding borough, encompassing suburbs both north and south of the city along the [[Tongass Highway]] (most of which are commonly regarded as a part of Ketchikan, albeit not a part of the city itself), plus small rural settlements accessible mostly by water, registered a population of 13,477 in that same census.<ref>http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/02/02130.html6{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Estimates put the 2017 population at 13,754 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/02/02130.html|title=Ketchikan Gateway Borough QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau|work=census.gov}}</ref> Incorporated on August 25, 1900, Ketchikan is the earliest extant incorporated city in Alaska, because [[Consolidated city-county|consolidation or unification]] elsewhere in Alaska resulted in dissolution of those communities' city governments.  Ketchikan is located on [[Revillagigedo Island]], so named in 1793 by Captain [[George Vancouver]].\n\nKetchikan is named after [[Ketchikan Creek]], which flows through the town, emptying into the [[Tongass Narrows]] a short distance southeast of its downtown. \"Ketchikan\" comes from the Tlingit name for the creek, ''Kitschk-hin'', the meaning of which is unclear. It may mean \"the river belonging to Kitschk\"; other accounts claim it means \"Thundering Wings of an Eagle\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045193/Ketchikan |title=Ketchikan |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2008-05-12 |accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref> In modern Tlingit this name is rendered as ''Kichx\u0331\u00e1an''.<ref>Edwards, Keri.

Ketchikan Creek served as a summer fish camp for [[Tlingit|Tlingit natives]] for untold years before the town was established by Mike Martin in 1885. He was sent to the area by an Oregon canning company to assess prospects. He established the saltery Clark & Martin and a general store with [[Nova Scotia]] native George Clark, who had been foreman at a cannery that burned down.<ref>http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/TongassPacking/040707_tongass_packing.html</ref>\n\n==Totem poles==\n[[File:Ketchikan from the waterfront, Alaska, nd (COBB 56).jpeg|thumb|Ketchikan waterfront ca. 1918]]\nKetchikan has the world's largest collection of standing [[totem pole]]s, found throughout the city and at four major locations: [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] Totem Park, [[Totem Bight State Historical Park|Totem Bight State Park]], Potlatch Park, and the [[Totem Heritage Center]]. Most of the totems at Saxman Totem Park and Totem Bight State Park are recarvings of older poles, a practice that began during the [[Franklin D.

Rainfall averages {{convert|3893|mm|in|0|order=flip}} per year, falling more heavily in autumn and winter. On average, the growing season (non-freezing temperatures) lasts about 6.3 months or 191 days, extending from about April 19 to about October 27.\n\nFurther east and away from moderating maritime influence, winters on these parallels in inland North America are much colder.\n\nThe record high temperature in Ketchikan was {{convert|96|\u00b0F}} on June 25, 1913.

Following a round of [[redistricting]], the convening of the 28th Alaska State Legislature in January 2013 marked the first time in the state's history that no residents of Ketchikan or the surrounding area serve as members of the [[Alaska Legislature]].  Ketchikan is represented in the [[Alaska Senate]] by [[Bert Stedman]], who lives in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and in the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] by [[Independent politician]] [[Dan Ortiz (politician)]], a former schoolteacher who taught at Ketchikan High School.\n\nOver the decades, Ketchikan has produced a number of political figures of note to Alaska in general.  In territorial days, [[Norman Ray Walker|Norman Ray \"Doc\" Walker]], a Canadian-born pharmacist practicing in Ketchikan, was arguably the first career member of the [[Alaska Legislature]].  Walker served in the territorial Senate for 16 years before losing reelection in 1948 following a feud with territorial governor [[Ernest Gruening]].  During the first governorship of [[Walter Hickel]] in the 1960s, two members of his cabinet ([[Frank Murkowski]] and [[Robert W. Ward]]) held strong ties to Ketchikan.  Following Hickel's resignation, Ward ascended to the office of [[List of lieutenant governors of Alaska|secretary of state]] when [[Keith H. Miller]] became governor.  Ketchikan native Walter L. Kubley, deputy commissioner of commerce under Hickel, became commissioner of the department under Miller.  Another Ketchikan native, Terry Gardiner, was notable as the youngest person elected to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] (at age 22), as well as the youngest person elected [[List of Speakers of the Alaska House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] (at age 28).\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] maintains a large shore installation, [[Coast Guard Base Ketchikan]], south of the downtown area, which serves as a homeport to three cutters and as a regional maintenance base for Alaska.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], one of Ketchikan's two zip codes, 99950, is the highest-numbered in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-facts/fun-facts.htm|title=Fun Facts - Postal Facts|website=about.usps.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203142552/https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-facts/fun-facts.htm|archive-date=2017-02-03|url-status=dead|access-date=2016-02-13}}</ref>\n\n==Economy and industries==\n[[File:Street scene, Ketchikan, Alaska, September 18, 1908 (COBB 13).jpeg|thumb|A main street in Ketchikan, September 1908]]\n[[File:Fishermen dressing and packing halibut on dock, Ketchikan, Alaska, October 3, 1910 (COBB 127).jpeg|thumb|Fishermen dressing and packing [[halibut]] at a dock in Ketchikan, October 1910]]\n\nA major and first port of entry into Alaska, Ketchikan's economy has been based on fishing industries, canneries in particular, tourism, government, and forestry.
