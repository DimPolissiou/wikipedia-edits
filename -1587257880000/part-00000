Instead of the schematics, [[hardware description language]] (HDL) code is shared. HDL descriptions are commonly used to set up [[system-on-a-chip]] systems either in [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA) or directly in [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) designs. HDL modules, when distributed, are called [[semiconductor intellectual property core]]s, also known as IP cores.\n\nOpen-source hardware also helps alleviate the issue of [[proprietary device driver]]s for the [[free and open-source software]] community, however, it is not a pre-requisite for it, and should not be confused with the concept of open documentation for proprietary hardware, which is already sufficient for writing FLOSS device drivers and complete operating systems.<ref name=opencon06-docs>{{cite conference\n|author= Theo de Raadt |date= 2016-12-03\n|url= http://www.openbsd.org/papers/opencon06-docs/index.html\n|title= Open Documentation for Hardware\n|conference-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070109032258/http://www.opencon.org/program.php\n|conference= OpenCON 2006, 2\u20133 December 2006\n|location= Courtyard Venice Airport, Venice/Tessera, Italy\n|author-link= Theo de Raadt\n}}</ref><ref name=lor-opencon06>{{cite web\n|author= Constantine A.

He launched the Open Hardware Certification Program, which had the goal of allowing hardware manufacturers to self-certify their products as open.<ref>Perens, B. 1997.

OHSpec: The Open Hardware Specification Project].</ref> In early 1999, Sepehr Kiani, Ryan Vallance and Samir Nayfeh joined efforts to apply the open-source philosophy to machine design applications. Together they established the Open Design Foundation (ODF) as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an [[Open Design]] Definition. But most of these activities faded out after a few years.\n\nA \"Free Hardware\" organization, known as FreeIO, was started in the late 1990s by Diehl Martin, who also launched a FreeIO website in early 2000. In the early to mid 2000s, FreeIO was a focus of free/open hardware designs released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. The FreeIO project advocated the concept of Free Hardware and proposed four freedoms that such hardware provided to users, based on the similar freedoms provided by free software licenses.<ref>[http://freeio.org/about-freeio/ FreeIO: Free Hardware Definition]</ref> The designs gained some notoriety due to Martin's naming scheme in which each free hardware project was given the name of a breakfast food such as Donut, Flapjack, Toast, etc. Martin's projects attracted a variety of hardware and software developers as well as other volunteers. Development of new open hardware designs at FreeIO ended in 2007 when Martin died of pancreatic cancer but the existing designs remain available from the organization's website.<ref>[http://freeio.org/about-freeio/diehl-martin-and-freeio-org/ FreeIO: About Diehl Martin]</ref>\n\nBy the mid 2000s open-source hardware again became a hub of activity due to the emergence of several major open-source hardware projects and companies, such as [[OpenCores]], [[RepRap]] ([[3D printing]]), [[Arduino]], [[Adafruit]] and [[SparkFun]]. In 2007, Perens reactivated the openhardware.org website.\n\nFollowing the [[Open Graphics Project]], an effort to design, implement, and manufacture a free and open 3D graphics chip set and reference graphics card, Timothy Miller suggested the creation of an organization to safeguard the interests of the Open Graphics Project community. Thus, Patrick McNamara founded the [[Open Hardware Foundation]] (OHF) in 2007.<ref>McNamara, P. 2007a. \u201cOpen Hardware\u201d.

That is, to refer to the electronic hardware on which the software runs (see previous section). However, as more and more non-electronic hardware products are made open source (for example Wikihouse, OpenBeam or Hovalin), this term tends to be used back in its broader sense of \"physical product\".

He launched the Open Hardware Certification Program, which had the goal of allowing hardware manufacturers to self-certify their products as open.<ref>Perens, B. 1997.

OHSpec: The Open Hardware Specification Project].</ref> In early 1999, Sepehr Kiani, Ryan Vallance and Samir Nayfeh joined efforts to apply the open-source philosophy to machine design applications. Together they established the Open Design Foundation (ODF) as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an [[Open Design]] Definition. But most of these activities faded out after a few years.\n\nA \"Free Hardware\" organization, known as FreeIO, was started in the late 1990s by Diehl Martin, who also launched a FreeIO website in early 2000. In the early to mid 2000s, FreeIO was a focus of free/open hardware designs released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. The FreeIO project advocated the concept of Free Hardware and proposed four freedoms that such hardware provided to users, based on the similar freedoms provided by free software licenses.<ref>[http://freeio.org/about-freeio/ FreeIO: Free Hardware Definition]</ref> The designs gained some notoriety due to Martin's naming scheme in which each free hardware project was given the name of a breakfast food such as Donut, Flapjack, Toast, etc. Martin's projects attracted a variety of hardware and software developers as well as other volunteers. Development of new open hardware designs at FreeIO ended in 2007 when Martin died of pancreatic cancer but the existing designs remain available from the organization's website.<ref>[http://freeio.org/about-freeio/diehl-martin-and-freeio-org/ FreeIO: About Diehl Martin]</ref>\n\nBy the mid 2000s open-source hardware again became a hub of activity due to the emergence of several major open-source hardware projects and companies, such as [[OpenCores]], [[RepRap]] ([[3D printing]]), [[Arduino]], [[Adafruit]] and [[SparkFun]].

Keys would not allow it; \"they already had set the monster loose\", she recalled. \"Once I started producing my own stuff there wasn't any going back.\"<ref name=\"Pareles\"/> Keys stated that Columbia had the \"wrong vision\" for her. \"They didn't want me to be an individual, didn't really care\", Keys concluded. \"They just wanted to put me in a box.\"<ref name=\"Guardian 01\"/> Control over her creative process was \"everything\" to Keys.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\nKeys had wanted to leave Columbia since they began \"completely disrespecting [her] musical creativity\".<ref name=\"Oprah\"/> Leaving Columbia was \"a hell of a fight\", she recalled. \"Out of spite, they were threatening to keep everything I'd created even though they hated it.

In the 1990s, a Virginia Tech Board of Visitors committee expressed an intent that henceforth Hokie Stone should be used in all buildings constructed on the central campus. In 2010, the board of visitors passed a resolution making that sentiment official university policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vt.edu/about/traditions/hokie-stone.html|title=All About Hokie Stone|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=March 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314091234/http://www.vt.edu/about/traditions/hokie-stone.html|archive-date=March 14, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHokie Stone is generally gray, shaded by hues of brown and pink. The limestone is mined from various quarries in Southwest Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama \u2013 one of which has been operated by the university since the 1950s. However, while it is true that the majority of buildings on campus incorporate Hokie Stone into their design, there are a few notable exceptions. For example, all buildings on the Upper Quad, including Lane Hall, are constructed of red brick. Also, a number of academic buildings were not constructed using Hokie Stone, as they were built before the institution of the rule mandating its use in all new university buildings.\n\n{{wide image|Drill Field Virginia Tech.jpg|1500px|Panoramic view of Virginia Tech's Drillfield}}\n\n===Extended campuses===\nThe university has established five branch campuses:<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia Tech Graduate School: Extended Campuses|url=http://graduateschool.vt.edu/extended_campuses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529164923/http://graduateschool.vt.edu/extended_campuses|archive-date=May 29, 2014|url-status=dead|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* Virginia Tech [[Hampton Roads]] Centers, [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Virginia Tech Hampton Roads Center|date=September 2013|url=http://www.hrc.vt.edu/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527011918/http://www.hrc.vt.edu/|archive-date=May 27, 2014|url-status=live|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* Northern Virginia Center, [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] (National Capital Region)<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Virginia Center|url=http://www.nvc.vt.edu/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527012002/http://www.nvc.vt.edu/|archive-date=May 27, 2014|url-status=live|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Virginia Tech Richmond Center]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Greetings from the Virginia Tech Richmond Center|date=September 2013 |url=http://www.richmond.vt.edu/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403055630/http://www.richmond.vt.edu/ |archive-date=April 3, 2014 |url-status=live |work=Virginia Tech Richmond Center |publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* Virginia Tech Roanoke Center, [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia Tech Roanoke Center|url=http://www.vtrc.vt.edu/|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821001341/http://www.vtrc.vt.edu/|archive-date=August 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Virginia Tech Southwest Center, [[Abingdon, Virginia|Abingdon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Virginia Center Higher Education Center: About Us|url=http://www.swcenter.edu/about-us/|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906043204/http://www.swcenter.edu/about-us/|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Northern Virginia Center (National Capital Region)====\nVirginia Tech's presence in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]] links regional graduate education and outreach programs that are consistent with the university's strategic research areas of excellence: energy materials and environment, social and individual transformation, health, food, and nutrition, and innovative technologies and complex systems.<ref name=\"AboutNRC\">{{cite web|title=About the National Capital Region|url=http://www.ncr.vt.edu/About/index.html|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906140055/http://www.ncr.vt.edu/About/index.html|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSupporting the university's missions is the Virginia Tech National Capital Region.

The [[HokieBird]] is a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]-like creature whose form has evolved from the original school mascot of the [[Fighting Gobbler]]. While the modern HokieBird still resembles a Fighting Gobbler, the word \"Hokie\" has all but replaced Fighting Gobbler in terms of colloquial use. The term originated from the ''[[Old Hokie]]'' spirit yell, in which there was no particular meaning indicated for the word.\n\nThey compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports since the 2004\u201305 season. The Hokies previously competed in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] from 2000\u201301 to 2003\u201304 (football program from 1991\u201392 to 1999\u20132000); the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] (A-10) from 1995\u201396 to 1999\u20132000; and the [[Metro Conference]] from 1978\u201379 to 1994\u201395.\n\nMen's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and wrestling. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball.\n\nThe stylized \"VT\" (the abbreviation for \"Virginia Tech\") is used primarily by the athletic department as a symbol for Virginia Tech athletic teams. The \"athletic VT\" symbol is trademarked by the university and appears frequently on licensed merchandise.\n\nDuring the early years of VPI, a rivalry developed between it and [[Virginia Military Institute]]. This rivalry developed into the original [[Military Classic of the South]] an annual football game between VMI and VPI usually held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. That series ended after the 1984 season; VMI had elected to play at the [[Division I-AA]] level, now Division I FCS, after the NCAA's 1978 divisional split for football, and the schools' wide disparity in size had led to a similar imbalance in results. Another long-standing and important rivalry is between Virginia Tech and the [[University of Virginia]]. The [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry]] strengthened in concurrence with both UVA's and Tech's growth during the 1960s and 1970s and this is now the Hokies' primary program-wide athletic rivalry. The two schools compete in football for the Governor's \"Commonwealth Cup\" each season.\n\nVirginia Tech's [[fight song]], \"[[Tech Triumph]]\", was written in 1919 and remains in use today. The song is played at sporting events by both the Virginia Tech student band, [[The Marching Virginians]], and the regimental Corps of Cadets' band, the [[Highty Tighties]].

The student body that had been approximately 5,682 in 1962 increased by roughly 1,000 students each year, new dormitories and academic buildings were constructed, faculty members were added \u2013 in 1966, for instance, more than 100 new professors joined the faculty \u2013 and research budgets were increased.<ref name=\"TH\" /> During Hahn's tenure, not only did the university graduate its first [[Rhodes Scholar]], W.W.

In the early 1990s, university administration authorized the official use of \"Virginia Tech\" as equivalent to the full legal name; it has been used as the first-reference name for the school's athletic teams since the 1970s. However, diplomas and transcripts still spell out the formal name. Similarly, the abbreviation \"VT\" is far more common today than either VPI or VPI&SU.\n\n===Vietnam War era===\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] students on college campuses across the nation protested [[conscription|the draft]] and U.S. involvement in the conflict. Despite its long history as a [[military school]], Virginia Tech was no exception. Most protests at Virginia Tech were small sit-ins and teach-ins, but In mid-April 1970 a group of anti-war protesters including students and faculty members disrupted a Corps of Cadets drill on campus. The Virginia Tech administration under Dr. Hahn took swift action. The students involved were suspended and the faculty members involved were fired from the university and the administration went to court and obtained an injunction to prevent them from repeating the act. This succeeded in calming tensions on campus, but only for a few weeks.<ref name=\"spec.lib.vt.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/unrest/intro.htm|title=Campus Unrest at Virginia Tech|date=1997|publisher=Virginia Tech Special Collections|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20180521171706/https://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/unrest/intro.htm|archive-date=May 21, 2018|url-status=}}</ref>\n\nTensions on campus reached the boiling point several days following the [[Kent State Shootings]] when on May 12, 1970, a large mob including students and a number of non-student anti-war protesters enraged by the Kent State incident and angered by the administration's disciplinary actions in response to a number of recent infractions by protesters including; vandalism of university property, a series of potentially dangerous fires set on campus, breaking and entering into a university building, and a sit-in in Cowgill Hill, seized Williams Hall and barricaded themselves inside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/unrest/hahnstmt.htm|title=Hahn's statement on the Williams occupation|last=Hahn|first=T.

Once inside the building the police discovered bomb making materials and determined that the students had apparently intended to build a [[Incendiary device|firebomb]]. The first few protesters were dragged out of the building; the rest left peacefully and were arrested and taken to the Montgomery County jail. The students involved in the seizure, were suspended from Virginia Tech and given twenty-four hours to remove their belongings from campus after being released from jail.\n\nSeveral more anti-war protests occurred at Virginia Tech during the early 1970s but none turned violent.<ref name=\"spec.lib.vt.edu\"/>\n\n===Twenty-first century===\nThe early decades of this century have seen expansion across the university's institutions in both physical and population sizes.

The mass shooting prompted many states to introduce legislation to prohibit public colleges and universities from banning [[concealed weapons]] on campus for permit holders. In 2013, at least nineteen states introduced legislation to allow concealed carry on campus in some form and in the 2014 legislative session, at least fourteen states introduced similar legislation. [[Tennessee]] passed a bill in 2016, permitting faculty members to carry handguns on campus after notifying local law enforcement. In 2015, [[Texas]] became the eighth state to allow concealed weapons on college campuses. In December 2016, Governor [[John Kasich]] signed a bill into law which lifted Ohio's statewide ban on firearms on college campuses leaving the decision to individual institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/guns-on-campus-overview.aspx|title=Guns on Campus: Overview|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2019-06-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216075451/http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/guns-on-campus-overview.aspx|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017 Georgia became the tenth state to prohibit colleges and universities from banning concealed weapons on campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ncph.org/history-at-work/campus-carry-and-the-public-history-of-the-gun-debate/|title=Campus Carry and the public history of the gun debate|website=National Council on Public History|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327212255/https://ncph.org/history-at-work/campus-carry-and-the-public-history-of-the-gun-debate/|archive-date=March 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Virginia law allows individual institutions to make the decision regarding whether to allow concealed weapons on campus, Virginia Tech continues to ban concealed carry permit holders from carrying guns on campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline|title=Nightline|website=ABC News|access-date=March 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121214222/https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline|archive-date=November 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====2009 beheading====\n\nOn January 21, 2009 Virginia Tech graduate student Xin Yang was beheaded by fellow graduate student Haiyang Zhu in the Au Bon Pain cafe in the university's Graduate Life Center on campus.

The Drillfield's name, coined in 1926 after the completion of Virginia Tech's first real stadium, stems from its use by the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]] to conduct military drills. A waterway, Stroubles Creek, runs beneath the Drillfield on the south side. A three-sided conduit for the creek that retains the natural bed of the creek was installed in 1934, and, in 1971, the first two asphalt walks were added.

Newman Library is located on the eastern side of campus and connects to Torgersen Bridge, which spans the main road into campus, Alumni Mall. North of the Drillfield and northwest of Alumni Mall lies the Upper Quad, known to many students as military campus. The Upper Quad is home to the Corps of Cadets' barracks.\n\nOn the main campus in Blacksburg, the majority of the buildings incorporate [[Hokie Stone]] as a building material. In the 1990s, a Virginia Tech Board of Visitors committee expressed an intent that henceforth Hokie Stone should be used in all buildings constructed on the central campus. In 2010, the board of visitors passed a resolution making that sentiment official university policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vt.edu/about/traditions/hokie-stone.html|title=All About Hokie Stone|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=March 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314091234/http://www.vt.edu/about/traditions/hokie-stone.html|archive-date=March 14, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHokie Stone is generally gray, shaded by hues of brown and pink. The limestone is mined from various quarries in Southwest Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama \u2013 one of which has been operated by the university since the 1950s. However, while it is true that the majority of buildings on campus incorporate Hokie Stone into their design, there are a few notable exceptions. For example, all buildings on the Upper Quad, including Lane Hall, are constructed of red brick. Also, a number of academic buildings were not constructed using Hokie Stone, as they were built before the institution of the rule mandating its use in all new university buildings.\n\n{{wide image|Drill Field Virginia Tech.jpg|1500px|Panoramic view of Virginia Tech's Drillfield}}\n\n===Extended campuses===\nThe university has established five branch campuses:<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia Tech Graduate School: Extended Campuses|url=http://graduateschool.vt.edu/extended_campuses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529164923/http://graduateschool.vt.edu/extended_campuses|archive-date=May 29, 2014|url-status=dead|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* Virginia Tech [[Hampton Roads]] Centers, [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Virginia Tech Hampton Roads Center|date=September 2013|url=http://www.hrc.vt.edu/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527011918/http://www.hrc.vt.edu/|archive-date=May 27, 2014|url-status=live|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* Northern Virginia Center, [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] (National Capital Region)<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Virginia Center|url=http://www.nvc.vt.edu/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527012002/http://www.nvc.vt.edu/|archive-date=May 27, 2014|url-status=live|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Virginia Tech Richmond Center]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Greetings from the Virginia Tech Richmond Center|date=September 2013 |url=http://www.richmond.vt.edu/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403055630/http://www.richmond.vt.edu/ |archive-date=April 3, 2014 |url-status=live |work=Virginia Tech Richmond Center |publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* Virginia Tech Roanoke Center, [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia Tech Roanoke Center|url=http://www.vtrc.vt.edu/|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821001341/http://www.vtrc.vt.edu/|archive-date=August 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Virginia Tech Southwest Center, [[Abingdon, Virginia|Abingdon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Virginia Center Higher Education Center: About Us|url=http://www.swcenter.edu/about-us/|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906043204/http://www.swcenter.edu/about-us/|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Northern Virginia Center (National Capital Region)====\nVirginia Tech's presence in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]] links regional graduate education and outreach programs that are consistent with the university's strategic research areas of excellence: energy materials and environment, social and individual transformation, health, food, and nutrition, and innovative technologies and complex systems.<ref name=\"AboutNRC\">{{cite web|title=About the National Capital Region|url=http://www.ncr.vt.edu/About/index.html|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906140055/http://www.ncr.vt.edu/About/index.html|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSupporting the university's missions is the Virginia Tech National Capital Region.

The requirement was changed to two years until 1964, when participation became voluntary. Members of the ROTC program are required to participate in the Corps of Cadets. Virginia Tech remains one of three public universities in the United States with both an active corps of cadets and regular civilian students on its campus ([[Texas A&M University]] and the [[University of North Georgia]] are the other two).\n\n=== Cadet Residential life ===\nMore than 1,000 cadets reside on the campus of Virginia Tech. The Corps of Cadets Community is located in the Upper Quad, which features some of the oldest buildings on campus. Cadet dorms are also known as \"cadet barracks\". Two new dormitories were constructed on the Upper Quad to house all of the cadets. Pearson Hall replaced Rasche Hall in November 2015, and in August 2017, Brodie Hall was replaced by the New Cadet Dorm (a.k.a. \"New Brodie\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/06/060815-vpa-brodiedemolition.html|title=Brodie Hall demolition begins this week|last2=Foy|first2=Bill|date=June 8, 2015|publisher=Virginia Tech|last1=Spieldenner|first1=Bob|accessdate=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905072245/http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/06/060815-vpa-brodiedemolition.html|archive-date=September 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Former cadet dorms, Thomas Hall and Monteith Hall were demolished in 2017.

Some of these organizations include Bolt at Virginia Tech which builds electric racing motorcycles; PRISM a student-run ad agency; BASIS at Virginia Tech the largest student-run fixed income portfolio group in the nation managing $5 million; the Chocolate Milk Club; and a [[Young Life]] Chapter.\n\n== Athletics ==\n{{Main|Virginia Tech Hokies}}\n[[File:Virginia Tech Hokies logo.svg|thumb|right|260px|Stylized \"VT\" logo]]\n[[File:VirginiaTechWordmark.png|thumb|260x260px|Virginia Tech Athletic Font]]\nVirginia Tech teams are known as the Hokies. The [[HokieBird]] is a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]-like creature whose form has evolved from the original school mascot of the [[Fighting Gobbler]]. While the modern HokieBird still resembles a Fighting Gobbler, the word \"Hokie\" has all but replaced Fighting Gobbler in terms of colloquial use. The term originated from the ''[[Old Hokie]]'' spirit yell, in which there was no particular meaning indicated for the word.\n\nThey compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports since the 2004\u201305 season. The Hokies previously competed in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] from 2000\u201301 to 2003\u201304 (football program from 1991\u201392 to 1999\u20132000); the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] (A-10) from 1995\u201396 to 1999\u20132000; and the [[Metro Conference]] from 1978\u201379 to 1994\u201395.\n\nMen's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and wrestling. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball.\n\nThe stylized \"VT\" (the abbreviation for \"Virginia Tech\") is used primarily by the athletic department as a symbol for Virginia Tech athletic teams. The \"athletic VT\" symbol is trademarked by the university and appears frequently on licensed merchandise.\n\nDuring the early years of VPI, a rivalry developed between it and [[Virginia Military Institute]]. This rivalry developed into the original [[Military Classic of the South]] an annual football game between VMI and VPI usually held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. That series ended after the 1984 season; VMI had elected to play at the [[Division I-AA]] level, now Division I FCS, after the NCAA's 1978 divisional split for football, and the schools' wide disparity in size had led to a similar imbalance in results. Another long-standing and important rivalry is between Virginia Tech and the [[University of Virginia]]. The [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry]] strengthened in concurrence with both UVA's and Tech's growth during the 1960s and 1970s and this is now the Hokies' primary program-wide athletic rivalry. The two schools compete in football for the Governor's \"Commonwealth Cup\" each season.\n\nVirginia Tech's [[fight song]], \"[[Tech Triumph]]\", was written in 1919 and remains in use today. The song is played at sporting events by both the Virginia Tech student band, [[The Marching Virginians]], and the regimental Corps of Cadets' band, the [[Highty Tighties]]. The \"[[Old Hokie]]\" spirit yell, written in 1896 and used to this day, is familiar to many Virginia Tech fans. This chant is also where the word \"Hoki\" (since modified to \"Hokie\") originally appeared.\n\nA few notable Virginia Tech athletics figures include [[Nickeil Alexander-Walker]], [[Frank Beamer]], [[Allan Bristow]], [[Kam Chancellor|Kim Chancellor]], [[Bimbo Coles]], [[Dell Curry]], [[Ace Custis]], Rennee Dennis, [[Terrell Edmunds]], [[Tremaine Edmunds]], [[Bud Foster]], [[Kendall Fuller]], [[Kyle Fuller]], [[Chuck Hartman]], [[Charles Moir]], [[Johnny Oates]], [[Bruce Smith]], [[Tyrod Taylor]], [[Angela Tincher O'Brien|Angela Tincher]], and [[Michael Vick]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hokiesports.com/sports/2018/4/19/retired-numbers-jerseys-at-virginia-tech.aspx|title=Retired Numbers & Jerseys At Virginia Tech|website=Virginia Tech Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent athletic facilities are [[Lane Stadium]], [[Cassell Coliseum]], [[English Field]], Thompson Field, Tech Softball Park, Rector Field House, the Beamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility, and the Christiansburg Aquatic Center.\n\n{{wide image|2016 Lane Stadium Panoramic.jpg|1000px|Lane Stadium}}\n<gallery widths=\"130\" heights=\"130\">\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:VT Cassell Coliseum.jpg|[[Cassell Coliseum]] -->\nFile:VT Lacrosse and Soccer Stadium.JPG|Thompson Field\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:VT Tech Softball Park.jpeg|Tech Softball Park -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:VT Rector Field House.jpg|Rector Field House -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:VT Beamer-Lawson.png|Beamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility -->\n</gallery>\n\n==Alumni==\n{{Main|List of Virginia Tech alumni}}\n\nSince opening in 1872 as Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, Virginia Tech has produced a number of distinguished alumni whose contributions have bolstered the university's reputation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Notable Virginia Tech alumni|url=http://www.vt.edu/alumni/notable-2011/notable.html|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905060114/http://www.vt.edu/alumni/notable-2011/notable.html|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}</ref>\n{{clear right}} The Virginia Tech Alumni Association includes more than 240,000 living alumni throughout the U.S. and around the world.
