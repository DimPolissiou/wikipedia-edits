It is set on October 8, 1904, and both men are on the verge of disclosing amazing ideas (Einstein will publish his [[special theory of relativity]] in 1905 and Picasso will paint ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in 1907).  At the Lapin Agile, they have a lengthy debate about the value of [[genius]] and [[skill|talent]], while interacting with a host of other characters.\n\nEach character in ''Lapin Agile'' has a specific role. For example, Schmendiman, an inventor, believes he is a genius but really knows very little, while Gaston, an amicable old Frenchman with [[prostate]] problems, is hesitant to listen to or believe anything that does not revolve around sex or drinking. There is much discussion of the major cultural influences of the twentieth century. Picasso represents art, Einstein represents science, and Schmendiman represents commercialism.\n\nPicasso and Einstein eventually realize that their abilities are equally valuable. Once the main characters have reached their moment of insight, \"The Visitor\", a man from the future, crashes the party. Although the Visitor is never named, his identity can be surmised as [[Elvis Presley]]. The Visitor adds a third dimension to Picasso's and Einstein's debate, representing the idea that genius is not always the product of academic or philosophical understanding, or as Gaston refers to it, \"Brains\".\n\nMartin has written: \"Focusing on Einstein\u2019s [[Special relativity|Special Theory of Relativity]] and Picasso\u2019s master painting, ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the play attempts to explain, in a light-hearted way, the similarity of the creative process involved in great leaps of imagination in art and science\".<ref>{{Citation| last = Martin| first = Steve| author-link = Steve Martin| title = Of arts and sciences | newspaper = [[The Observer (La Grande)|The Observer]]| date = March 13, 2009| url = http://www.lagrandeobserver.com/opinion/4066493-151/of-arts-and-sciences}}</ref>\n\n==Cast, in order of appearance==\n*Freddy&nbsp;\u2013 The owner and bartender of the Lapin Agile.

(2). 247\u2013248: Piana degli Albanesi or Plain of the Albanians is a literal translation of the village's Albanian name, Hora e Arb\u00ebresh\u00ebvet. The name provides a quick insight into its history and geography. Piana was founded in 1488 by Albanian refugees fleeing the Turkish conquest of the Balkans and has been inhabited ever since by descendants of the original settlers. The village is situated 24 kilometers south of Palermo on an elevated plain about 740 meters above sea level, and is encircled by rather steep mountains which separate its inhabitants from their Italian neighbours. Not least because of this enclosed geographical site, the Albanians, or Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb, of Piana degli Albanesi, still retain their language, and religious and cultural traditions. Though most of the several hundred fifteenth-century Albanian settlements in Italy have long since been assimilated, Piana remains \"the most self- consciously Italo-Albanian\" village and is considered \"the spiritual center of the Albanians of Sicily (Hobsbawm, 1965:102; Serra, 1987:12). The other striking historical fact is the long tradition of Pianese revolutionary commitment which led the British historian Trevalyn to call Piana \"the hearth of freedom in Western Sicily\" (1909:158), and which attracted Hobsbawm's attention. The early struggles were of the Pianese against outsiders: feudal overlords, followed by monarchs. Since the 1890s, however, bitter social conflicts within the village that pit Pianese peasants against the local landholding elite gave rise to a remarkable degree of revolutionary activity, with some two-thirds of the adult population enrolled first in the socialist and then, after 1919, in the communist party.\"; p. 269. \"Rossi, and Hobsbawm and Guha following him, refer to the town as Piana dei Greci \u2014 a name it received from the Italians because of the Albanians\u2019 Greek Orthodox Christianity. Mussolini, presumably in an attempt to gather support for his imperialist intentions toward Albania, changed the name to Piana degli Albanesi.\"</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb of Piana degli Albanesi played a significant role for the Italian national unity, and participated in the stronger phases of the movement of [[Fasci Siciliani]].<ref>''The Albanians: An Ethnic History from Prehistoric Times to the Present'', Edwin E. Jacques, 1994.</ref> The inhabitants of Piana degli Albanesi were known to have a reputation for rebelliousness, but were not organized politically until the arrival of the [[Fascio]] in April 1893.{{clarify|date=May 2011}}<ref name=\"Hobsbawm1971\"/>\n\nIn 1947, the regional Mafia hired the bandit [[Salvatore Giuliano]] to shoot down the annual May Day demonstration of the Pianesi, which took place in a remote mountain pass. The bandit and his gang indeed attacked them there, killing fourteen people in what came to be known as the [[Portella della Ginestra massacre]].\n\n===Symbols===\n[[File:Piana degli Albanesi-Stemma Comune.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Emblem of the municipality]]\n[[File:Hora e Arbereshevet.jpg|thumb|130px|Sticker with municipal emblem]]\n[[File:Piana degli Albanesi-Stemma.png|thumb|Variant of the emblem in the former Town Hall]]\nThe coat of arms of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi is thus described by the municipal statute: {{citazione|[...] Ricamato con fili di seta di colore giallo in varie tonalit\u00e0, raffigura un'aquila bicipite ad ali spiegate con le teste coronate e sormontate da una stella a sei punte e con tre spighe di grano in entrambi gli artigli. (Embroidered with yellow silk threads in various shades, it depicts a two-headed eagle with spread wings with crowned heads and surmounted by a six-pointed star and with three ears of wheat in both claws.)}}\n\nThe [[gonfalon]] of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi is a rectangular drape with a blue background or red with a round in the center adorned with gold embroidery reproducing the Latin inscription ''Nobilis Plan\u00e6 Albanensium Civitas'' and bearing the emblem. The banner is governed by the statutory provisions of the municipality.\n\nOriginally the coat of arms consisted of two ears joined by a knot ribbon with an eight-pointed star in the upper part and with the acronym S.P.Q.A. (''Senatus Populus Que Albanensis''), or N.P.A.C. (''Nobilis Plan\u00e6 Albanensium Civitas''). This coat of arms, which symbolizes the agricultural work of the Albanians, can be seen in local stone in the oldest fountains, such as that of the \"Fusha and Pontit\" (1765), and on the side door of the Church of St. George, the ancient Matrix. Later the Albanian double eagle was always used, with the ears between the claws and the inscription N.P.A.C. In the former Town Hall in Piazza Vitt. Emanuele, now the seat of the Municipal Library \"G. Schir\u00f2\", has a stone coat of arms with the figure of Castriota Scanderbeg in the center. According to the Statute of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi, the municipality has its own anthem in Albanian language.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\n[[File:PianaDegliAlbanesiMitLago.jpg|thumb|Landscape of Piana degli Albanesi]]\nPiana degli Albanesi is {{convert|740|m|ft}} above sea level in a mountainous valley, located in the hinterland of Palermo. The municipal territory, bordered mostly by natural borders and extended in a south-east direction, has an extension of approximately 64.92&nbsp;km\u00b2 and is inserted in the \"Serre della Pizzuta oriented natural reserve\" and in the \"Piana degli Albanesi lake\" .\n\nIt is a mountain resort, whose natural environment and typical mild mediterranean climate create a peaceful and serene oasis. Its natural frame consists of a lake, the mountains and the typical rural quarters.\n\nIt is surrounded by four mountains (Pizzuta, Kumeta, Maganoce, Xeravulli), natural sites (Neviere, Cave Garrone, Honi), and the nature reserve ''Serre della Pizzuta''. There are a number of recreational activities available in the area, such as hiking, cycling, horse riding, canoeing, and paragliding.\n\nThe territory is crossed by several [[streams]]. To the south-east, immersed in the greenness, there is the artificial lake formed in 1923 by damming the Belice Destro river (''Lumi Honi''), barred in the 1920s to allow for the construction of the [[Lago di Piana degli Albanesi|Lake of Piana degli Albanesi]], since 1999 a natural oasis protected and safeguarded by the [[World Wildlife Foundation]].\n\n===Topography===\nThe original inhabited area initially developed on the rocky Mount Pizzuta (''mali Picuta''), although, a cause of the rigid temperature, the Albanian exiles moved a little further downstream, in the area of the plain below, on the slopes of the Sheshi mound.\n\nDue to its ethnic, cultural, religious, historical and environmental peculiarities it is part of the varied Sicilian landscape as a unique unrepeatable.\n\n===Climate===\nPiana degli Albanesi is located in a plateau surrounded by high mountains and is subject to a particular microclimate. Summers are on average warm and sunny, but more windy than in the rest of the island thanks to the mountain breezes. Winters are generally cold but quite variable depending on the year, with rigid snow periods. Unlike the surrounding areas, humidity is high and rainfall is more abundant.\n\n==Demography==\n{{Historical populations\n|footnote= Source: [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|ISTAT]], 2017\n|1488 | 2.699<ref>[http://www.unibesa.it/images/N3marzo2004.pdf Biblos, N3 March 2004.]</ref><ref>Movimento della popolazione secondo i riveli del '600, cfr. \"M.

One of the most critical moments came towards the end of the seventeenth century, when a large group of arb\u00ebresh\u00eb decided to move with their families to the nearby fiefdom of Santa Cristina, owned by the Archbishopric of Palermo, to build a new farmhouse.<ref>Giuseppe Chiaramonte Musacchia, ''Notizie sulle origini e sulla storia della colonia albanese di S.

The community is configured as a historically consolidated system with an independent profile in the territory. The different origins, with the strong historical, cultural and value connotations, constitute specific points of the community, on the other hand perfectly integrated.\n\nThe ''Arb\u00ebreshe'' identity, tempered in a foreign land (''te dheu i huaj''), seals its strong indigenous character. The cornerstones of the community are: the Albanian language, the Byzantine rite, traditional customs and customs, history. The social component was the endogenous force of Piana degli Albanesi: the ''intelligentsia Arb\u00ebreshe'', the priests in the first place and exponents of political and cultural life, through institutions and the work of many illustrious men, worked with zeal to defend the peculiarities identity. The maintenance of the Albanian status, as in every identity reality, is confronted daily with the socio-cultural transformism and if once ignoring each other between Albanians and Sicilians was the way to preserve each one's own specificities, the current territorial dynamics not they allow it to the extent that the world-system is expressed through relations from the local to the supra-local.\n\nIdentity aspects, such as ritual, language and customs, are still kept alive by the whole community, thanks to a strong and deep-rooted popular tradition in which this people is linked and is recognized, and religious and cultural institutions also contribute validly to the safeguard and to the enhancement of ancestral heritage.\n\nA flourishing Albanian community of Albania of very recent immigration, post-fall of the communist regime of 1990, coexists and is well integrated in the social of Piana degli Albanesi, with the creation of a community of ''arb\u00ebresh\u00eb'' which gathers within it a rooted core of ''shqiptar\u00eb''.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263065951_New_Albanian_immigrants_in_the_old_Albanian_diaspora_Piana_degli_Albanesi ''New Albanian immigrants in the old Albanian diaspora: Piana degli Albanesi'' in researchgate.net]</ref> There is no lack of marriages between Italo-Albanians and Albanians from the Balkans.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2002 the municipality and the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi welcomed and helped the Albanians from [[Kosovo]] affected by the war.\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Piana_degli_Albanesi.jpg|thumb|Overview from the hill ''Sheshi'']]\nThe historic center of the town has a late-medieval style, reflecting the social status and economic conditions of the time when the settlement was built. The city streets are narrow and consist of steps (''shkall\u00ebt'') and neighbourhoods (''gjitonia''), the roads are generally narrow and provide a meeting place in front of the houses, with the exception of the main road (''dhromi i madh\u00eb'') which is wide and straight and divides the town into different sections. There is also a Piazza Grande (''Qaca e Madhe'') which is the centre of community relationships.\n\nThe churches of the town are among the most important architectural structures, the testimony of these two styles, the baroque linked to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and Italian. Of particular interest are the works of the architect and painter [[Pietro Novelli]], very active in the Albanian community.\n\n===Religious architecture===\n[[File:Sh\u00ebnMitri.jpg|thumb|right|[[Piana degli Albanesi Cathedral]]]] \n[[File:Sklica.jpg|thumb|right|Monastery of Basilian monks (''Sklica'')]]\nThe most notable churches in Piana degli Albanesi are:\n* [[Piana degli Albanesi Cathedral|The Cathedral of ''Sh\u00ebn Mitri D\u00ebshmor i Math'']] ([[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|St. Demetrius Megalomartyr]]), which serves as the principal church of the [[Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi]], the church dates to 1498/1590. The Cathedral is a building dating from the late fifteenth-century, that preserves some significant frescoes by [[Pietro Novelli]]. The most ancient work is the icon of the God Mother with the Christ (1500). The presence of two cultures (Byzantine-baroque) is so evident in the place.\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn M\u00ebria e Dhitrj\u00ebs'' ([[Hodegetria|St. Mary Odigitria]]), located in the village main square, was built in 1644 in the style of [[Pietro Novelli]]. The church, the only architectural work by Novelli, has the nave divided from the two aisles by four pillars to support the octagonal dome with a small lantern. It preserves a [[Hodegetria|Virgin Odigitria]] [[icon]] that is said to have been brought here by the refugees during their voyage from [[Albania]].\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn Gjergji D\u00ebshmor i Math''' ([[St. George]]), built in 1492, is the most ancient in the town. It preserves some remarkable frescoes.\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn Kolli'' ([[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]]), an important church which houses precious icons from the seventeenth century.\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn Viti'' ([[San Vito|St. Vito]]), dating back to 1514, with an imposing portal, which is of [[Latin rite]].\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn Gjoni i Math'' ([[Anthony the Great]]), from the 16th century, has preserved the altar to the east, typical of Byzantine architecture.\n\nThe Monastery of the Basilian Fathers (Sclizza or in Albanian ''Sklica'') of the Byzantine Rite is it in a panoramic spot over the town, you can admire some mosaic works by Spiridione Marino (Dhoni), a local Italo-Albanian artist. From here, it is also worth having a look at the valley below.\n\n===Archaeology===\nWithin the confines of Piana degli Albanesi, in Contrada Sant'Agata (''Sh\u00ebnt Arhta'' in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]), the remains of an early Christian necropolis of late Roman age, called [[Pirama (Sicily)|Pirama]], were brought to light in 1988.

After the religious ceremony, there is a procession through the main street, all the women and several men dress in traditional Arb\u00ebresh costume, the procession leads to the square after the blessing the red eggs are distributed as a sign of Christ's resurrection.\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Traditional costume ===\n[[File:Cost trad pianadeglialbanesi.jpg|thumb|left|300px|(''Ncilona'') Traditional Arb\u00ebresh costume worn during the wedding ceremony performed according to the Byzantine rite]]\n[[File:Traditional dress of Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb women in Piana degli Albanesi.jpg|thumb|150px|Women in typical Albanian costume of Piana degli Albanesi, historical photo dates to the end of the 19th century]]\n[[File:Donna di Sicilia in costume di Piana degli Albanesi - Ettore De Maria Bergler.jpg|thumb|Ettore De Maria Bergler, ''Woman in costume of Piana degli Albanesi'', [[oil on canvas]] (1933)]]\nThe traditional female costume of Piana degli Albanesi, along with language and the Byzantine rite, is one of the most obvious signs of Arb\u00ebreshe cultural identity, and is a unique expression of local self-consciousness, which manifests itself in the desire to retain identity and traditions. From the historical point of view Piana degli Albanesi is one of the most notable Arb\u00ebresh communities in Arb\u00ebria and Sicily.  There are several artistic works on the clothes of Albanians of Piana degli Albanesi, including very valuable Vuillier prints of the eighteenth century, and paintings by Ettore De Maria Bergler, partly preserved at the Art Gallery of the monumental complex of Sant'Anna in Palermo and other private prints, postcards and watercolors by unknown authors. Both the former, together with numerous additional representations portray and demonstrate the incomparability of the costume of Piana degli Albanesi.\n\nThe clothes, linked to the various moments of women's lives, from everyday life to marriage, punctuated the rhythms of social tradition of the past. Handed down from mother to daughter, and zealously preserved, they are no longer clothes, but costumes. The progressive loss of this link began in the 1940s, when after the war in Europe there was a need for more practical clothing.\n\nThe opulent and elegant clothes have preserved intact their special character, and are worn on special occasions such as [[baptisms]], [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], Easter and especially marriage, continuing to be carefully preserved by the women of Piana degli Albanesi. It costs thousands of [[euros]] to make and repair these costumes, and the majority of women use them on these occasions. An epitome of beauty is the bridal costume, which makes it particularly valuable and the religious event of the [[Byzantine rite]]. The quality of production is due to the great craftsmanship of the Arb\u00ebresh embroiderers in gold and silk wheelwork, velvet and gold (in leads, and lenticciole canatiglie).  Embroidery is done using a pillow, a frame or a needle alone.\n\nThe traditional female costume of Piana degli Albanesi has been admired through time and consensus. In the competition held in Venice in 1928, in which costume groups from every region of Italy took part, the group from Piana degli Albanesi was awarded first prize, a recognition of their traditional dress as the most sumptuous, rich in design, fabrics and colors out of all the regional competitors.<ref name=\"Historia\"/>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main article|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people}}\n[[File:Bilingual signs.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Bilingual signs in Piana degli Albanesi]]\nThe most obvious traces of the strong ethnic identity of Piana degli Albanesi is the Albanian language ([[Arb\u00ebresh language|Arb\u00ebrisht]]). It is spoken by all, and can be seen in street names, road signs, and shop signs in the village. The Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb community has preserved its identity as much as possible. The language shares the widespread language variations seen in southern [[Albania]], mixed at times with Greek phonetics. The language is recognized by the local government and primary schools as a minority ethno-linguistic language. [[Arb\u00ebresh language|Arb\u00ebrisht]] remains the dominant language in the region. Piana degli Albanesi is officially bilingual; the official town documents are written in both Albanian and Italian. The citizens are bilingual, able to use both the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and Italian languages.<ref>New Albanian Immigrants in the Old Albanian Diaspora: Piana Degli Albanesi. Eda Derhemi</ref>\n\nThe Albanian language is used in radio stations (ex. ''Radio Hora'' or ''Radio Jona''), and especially in books and periodicals (ex. ''Mondo Albanese'', ''Kartularet e Biblos'', ''Albanica'', ''Fluturimi i aikull\u00ebs'', ''Lajmtari Arb\u00ebreshvet'' or ''Mir\u00eb dit\u00eb'').\n\n===Music===\nThe music and chants of Piana degli Albanesi are deeply tied to religious tradition. The repertoire of sacred songs in Greek and in Albanian language, used throughout the liturgical year of complex and detailed, is very wide. The weekly liturgies, festivals and other officiating are always adorned with a ceaseless flow of melody. The poetic and musical forms are dell'innografia Byzantine liturgical repertory of the museum system is modal theory and follows the Byzantine dell'okt\u00f2ichos. In addition to these compositions, the prevailing source of educated, there are other evidences of a profane nature, strongly influenced, moreover, of the musical traditions of indigenous origin, it has a large number of popular songs, heritage still very much alive and thriving. \n\nThe transmission of the songs is, even today, almost entirely through oral tradition.

(2). 247\u2013248: Piana degli Albanesi or Plain of the Albanians is a literal translation of the village's Albanian name, Hora e Arb\u00ebresh\u00ebvet. The name provides a quick insight into its history and geography. Piana was founded in 1488 by Albanian refugees fleeing the Turkish conquest of the Balkans and has been inhabited ever since by descendants of the original settlers. The village is situated 24 kilometers south of Palermo on an elevated plain about 740 meters above sea level, and is encircled by rather steep mountains which separate its inhabitants from their Italian neighbours. Not least because of this enclosed geographical site, the Albanians, or Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb, of Piana degli Albanesi, still retain their language, and religious and cultural traditions. Though most of the several hundred fifteenth-century Albanian settlements in Italy have long since been assimilated, Piana remains \"the most self- consciously Italo-Albanian\" village and is considered \"the spiritual center of the Albanians of Sicily (Hobsbawm, 1965:102; Serra, 1987:12). The other striking historical fact is the long tradition of Pianese revolutionary commitment which led the British historian Trevalyn to call Piana \"the hearth of freedom in Western Sicily\" (1909:158), and which attracted Hobsbawm's attention. The early struggles were of the Pianese against outsiders: feudal overlords, followed by monarchs. Since the 1890s, however, bitter social conflicts within the village that pit Pianese peasants against the local landholding elite gave rise to a remarkable degree of revolutionary activity, with some two-thirds of the adult population enrolled first in the socialist and then, after 1919, in the communist party.\"; p. 269. \"Rossi, and Hobsbawm and Guha following him, refer to the town as Piana dei Greci \u2014 a name it received from the Italians because of the Albanians\u2019 Greek Orthodox Christianity. Mussolini, presumably in an attempt to gather support for his imperialist intentions toward Albania, changed the name to Piana degli Albanesi.\"</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb of Piana degli Albanesi played a significant role for the Italian national unity, and participated in the stronger phases of the movement of [[Fasci Siciliani]].<ref>''The Albanians: An Ethnic History from Prehistoric Times to the Present'', Edwin E. Jacques, 1994.</ref> The inhabitants of Piana degli Albanesi were known to have a reputation for rebelliousness, but were not organized politically until the arrival of the [[Fascio]] in April 1893.{{clarify|date=May 2011}}<ref name=\"Hobsbawm1971\"/>\n\nIn 1947, the regional Mafia hired the bandit [[Salvatore Giuliano]] to shoot down the annual May Day demonstration of the Pianesi, which took place in a remote mountain pass. The bandit and his gang indeed attacked them there, killing fourteen people in what came to be known as the [[Portella della Ginestra massacre]].\n\n===Symbols===\n[[File:Piana degli Albanesi-Stemma Comune.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Emblem of the municipality]]\n[[File:Hora e Arbereshevet.jpg|thumb|130px|Sticker with municipal emblem]]\n[[File:Piana degli Albanesi-Stemma.png|thumb|Variant of the emblem in the former Town Hall]]\nThe coat of arms of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi is thus described by the municipal statute: {{citazione|[...] Ricamato con fili di seta di colore giallo in varie tonalit\u00e0, raffigura un'aquila bicipite ad ali spiegate con le teste coronate e sormontate da una stella a sei punte e con tre spighe di grano in entrambi gli artigli. (Embroidered with yellow silk threads in various shades, it depicts a two-headed eagle with spread wings with crowned heads and surmounted by a six-pointed star and with three ears of wheat in both claws.)}}\n\nThe [[gonfalon]] of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi is a rectangular drape with a blue background or red with a round in the center adorned with gold embroidery reproducing the Latin inscription ''Nobilis Plan\u00e6 Albanensium Civitas'' and bearing the emblem. The banner is governed by the statutory provisions of the municipality.\n\nOriginally the coat of arms consisted of two ears joined by a knot ribbon with an eight-pointed star in the upper part and with the acronym S.P.Q.A. (''Senatus Populus Que Albanensis''), or N.P.A.C. (''Nobilis Plan\u00e6 Albanensium Civitas''). This coat of arms, which symbolizes the agricultural work of the Albanians, can be seen in local stone in the oldest fountains, such as that of the \"Fusha and Pontit\" (1765), and on the side door of the Church of St. George, the ancient Matrix. Later the Albanian double eagle was always used, with the ears between the claws and the inscription N.P.A.C. In the former Town Hall in Piazza Vitt. Emanuele, now the seat of the Municipal Library \"G. Schir\u00f2\", has a stone coat of arms with the figure of Castriota Scanderbeg in the center. According to the Statute of the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi, the municipality has its own anthem in Albanian language.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\n[[File:PianaDegliAlbanesiMitLago.jpg|thumb|Landscape of Piana degli Albanesi]]\nPiana degli Albanesi is {{convert|740|m|ft}} above sea level in a mountainous valley, located in the hinterland of Palermo. The municipal territory, bordered mostly by natural borders and extended in a south-east direction, has an extension of approximately 64.92&nbsp;km\u00b2 and is inserted in the \"Serre della Pizzuta oriented natural reserve\" and in the \"Piana degli Albanesi lake\" .\n\nIt is a mountain resort, whose natural environment and typical mild mediterranean climate create a peaceful and serene oasis. Its natural frame consists of a lake, the mountains and the typical rural quarters.\n\nIt is surrounded by four mountains (Pizzuta, Kumeta, Maganoce, Xeravulli), natural sites (Neviere, Cave Garrone, Honi), and the nature reserve ''Serre della Pizzuta''. There are a number of recreational activities available in the area, such as hiking, cycling, horse riding, canoeing, and paragliding.\n\nThe territory is crossed by several [[streams]]. To the south-east, immersed in the greenness, there is the artificial lake formed in 1923 by damming the Belice Destro river (''Lumi Honi''), barred in the 1920s to allow for the construction of the [[Lago di Piana degli Albanesi|Lake of Piana degli Albanesi]], since 1999 a natural oasis protected and safeguarded by the [[World Wildlife Foundation]].\n\n===Topography===\nThe original inhabited area initially developed on the rocky Mount Pizzuta (''mali Picuta''), although, a cause of the rigid temperature, the Albanian exiles moved a little further downstream, in the area of the plain below, on the slopes of the Sheshi mound.\n\nDue to its ethnic, cultural, religious, historical and environmental peculiarities it is part of the varied Sicilian landscape as a unique unrepeatable.\n\n===Climate===\nPiana degli Albanesi is located in a plateau surrounded by high mountains and is subject to a particular microclimate. Summers are on average warm and sunny, but more windy than in the rest of the island thanks to the mountain breezes. Winters are generally cold but quite variable depending on the year, with rigid snow periods. Unlike the surrounding areas, humidity is high and rainfall is more abundant.\n\n==Demography==\n{{Historical populations\n|footnote= Source: [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|ISTAT]], 2017\n|1488 | 2.699<ref>[http://www.unibesa.it/images/N3marzo2004.pdf Biblos, N3 March 2004.]</ref><ref>Movimento della popolazione secondo i riveli del '600, cfr. \"M.

The building of the farmhouse was therefore relatively rapid, so much so that this first group was joined, between 1532 and 1534, by other Albanian refugees from Corone and Modone<ref>Giuseppe Schir\u00f2, ''Canti Tradizionali ed altri saggi delle colonie albanesi di Sicilia'', Comune di Piana degli Albanesi, Palermo, 1986, p. cit., LXXXIV.</ref>. The demographic and economic growth was constant, due also to the constant arrival of new nuclei of Albanian exiles who settled in the town.\n\nThe 1624 epidemic that struck Sicily and the continuing famines raged over demographic development. One of the most critical moments came towards the end of the seventeenth century, when a large group of arb\u00ebresh\u00eb decided to move with their families to the nearby fiefdom of Santa Cristina, owned by the Archbishopric of Palermo, to build a new farmhouse<ref>Giuseppe Chiaramonte Musacchia, ''Notizie sulle origini e sulla storia della colonia albanese di S. Cristina Gela'', 1967, in \"Annuario accademico del Centro Internazionale di Studi Albanesi\", p. 98 e segg.</ref>. The displacement involved more than a hundred Albanians, whose names are indicated in the chapters approved in 1691.\n\nFrom the eighteenth century to the unification of Italy, a positive demographic increase is evident, up to the peak of the population in the first half of the 20th century, although affected by the emigration phenomenon towards the Americas (United States, Canada, Brazil, Cile, Uruguay and Argentina), European states (Germany) or north Italy. Since the second half of the 20th century the population has remained fairly stable.\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n[[File:Bar Shqjp\u00ebria.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|A historic \"Bar Shqjp\u00ebria\"]]\n[[File:Cattedrale San Demetrio - Coro.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|Albanian flag in the cathedral during Holy Week]]\nThe ethnic composition of Piana degli Albanesi is significantly different from that of the surrounding Sicilian environment, whose population is and still feels Albanian<ref>Mario Gandolfo Giacomarra, ''Condizioni di minoranza oggi: gli albanesi di Sicilia fra etnicismi e globalizzazione'', in Albanica, Palermo, A.C.Mirror, 2003, pp. 84\u2013120</ref><ref>Rosalba Catalano, ''Piana degli Albanesi e il suo territorio: Fonti documenti e progetti di sviluppo'', Palermo, A.C.Mirror, 2003, pp. 104\u2013105.</ref>. The community is configured as a historically consolidated system with an independent profile in the territory. The different origins, with the strong historical, cultural and value connotations, constitute specific points of the community, on the other hand perfectly integrated.\n\nThe ''Arb\u00ebreshe'' identity, tempered in a foreign land (''te dheu i huaj''), seals its strong indigenous character. The cornerstones of the community are: the Albanian language, the Byzantine rite, traditional customs and customs, history. The social component was the endogenous force of Piana degli Albanesi: the ''intelligentsia Arb\u00ebreshe'', the priests in the first place and exponents of political and cultural life, through institutions and the work of many illustrious men, worked with zeal to defend the peculiarities identity. The maintenance of the Albanian status, as in every identity reality, is confronted daily with the socio-cultural transformism and if once ignoring each other between Albanians and Sicilians was the way to preserve each one's own specificities, the current territorial dynamics not they allow it to the extent that the world-system is expressed through relations from the local to the supra-local.\n\nIdentity aspects, such as ritual, language and customs, are still kept alive by the whole community, thanks to a strong and deep-rooted popular tradition in which this people is linked and is recognized, and religious and cultural institutions also contribute validly to the safeguard and to the enhancement of ancestral heritage.\n\nA flourishing Albanian community of Albania of very recent immigration, post-fall of the communist regime of 1990, coexists and is well integrated in the social of Piana degli Albanesi, with the creation of a community of ''arb\u00ebresh\u00eb'' which gathers within it a rooted core of ''shqiptar\u00eb''<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263065951_New_Albanian_immigrants_in_the_old_Albanian_diaspora_Piana_degli_Albanesi ''New Albanian immigrants in the old Albanian diaspora: Piana degli Albanesi'' in researchgate.net]</ref>. There is no lack of marriages between Italo-Albanians and Albanians from the Balkans.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2002 the municipality and the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi welcomed and helped the Albanians from [[Kosovo]] affected by the war.\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Piana_degli_Albanesi.jpg|thumb|Overview from the hill ''Sheshi'']]\nThe historic center of the town has a late-medieval style, reflecting the social status and economic conditions of the time when the settlement was built. The city streets are narrow and consist of steps (''shkall\u00ebt'') and neighbourhoods (''gjitonia''), the roads are generally narrow and provide a meeting place in front of the houses, with the exception of the main road (''dhromi i madh\u00eb'') which is wide and straight and divides the town into different sections. There is also a Piazza Grande (''Qaca e Madhe'') which is the centre of community relationships.\n\nThe churches of the town are among the most important architectural structures, the testimony of these two styles, the baroque linked to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and Italian. Of particular interest are the works of the architect and painter [[Pietro Novelli]], very active in the Albanian community.\n\n===Religious architecture===\n[[File:Sh\u00ebnMitri.jpg|thumb|right|[[Piana degli Albanesi Cathedral]]]] \n[[File:Sklica.jpg|thumb|right|Monastery of Basilian monks (''Sklica'')]]\nThe most notable churches in Piana degli Albanesi are:\n* [[Piana degli Albanesi Cathedral|The Cathedral of ''Sh\u00ebn Mitri D\u00ebshmor i Math'']] ([[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|St. Demetrius Megalomartyr]]), which serves as the principal church of the [[Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi]], the church dates to 1498/1590. The Cathedral is a building dating from the late fifteenth-century, that preserves some significant frescoes by [[Pietro Novelli]]. The most ancient work is the icon of the God Mother with the Christ (1500). The presence of two cultures (Byzantine-baroque) is so evident in the place.\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn M\u00ebria e Dhitrj\u00ebs'' ([[Hodegetria|St. Mary Odigitria]]), located in the village main square, was built in 1644 in the style of [[Pietro Novelli]]. The church, the only architectural work by Novelli, has the nave divided from the two aisles by four pillars to support the octagonal dome with a small lantern. It preserves a [[Hodegetria|Virgin Odigitria]] [[icon]] that is said to have been brought here by the refugees during their voyage from [[Albania]].\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn Gjergji D\u00ebshmor i Math''' ([[St. George]]), built in 1492, is the most ancient in the town. It preserves some remarkable frescoes.\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn Kolli'' ([[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]]), an important church which houses precious icons from the seventeenth century.\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn Viti'' ([[San Vito|St. Vito]]), dating back to 1514, with an imposing portal, which is of [[Latin rite]].\n* the Church of ''Sh\u00ebn Gjoni i Math'' ([[Anthony the Great]]), from the 16th century, has preserved the altar to the east, typical of Byzantine architecture.\n\nThe Monastery of the Basilian Fathers (Sclizza or in Albanian ''Sklica'') of the Byzantine Rite is it in a panoramic spot over the town, you can admire some mosaic works by Spiridione Marino (Dhoni), a local Italo-Albanian artist. From here, it is also worth having a look at the valley below.\n\n===Archaeology===\nWithin the confines of Piana degli Albanesi, in Contrada Sant'Agata (''Sh\u00ebnt Arhta'' in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]), the remains of an early Christian necropolis of late Roman age, called [[Pirama (Sicily)|Pirama]], were brought to light in 1988.

After the religious ceremony, there is a procession through the main street, all the women and several men dress in traditional Arb\u00ebresh costume, the procession leads to the square after the blessing the red eggs are distributed as a sign of Christ's resurrection.\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Traditional costume ===\n[[File:Cost trad pianadeglialbanesi.jpg|thumb|left|300px|(''Ncilona'') Traditional Arb\u00ebresh costume worn during the wedding ceremony performed according to the Byzantine rite]]\n[[File:Traditional dress of Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb women in Piana degli Albanesi.jpg|thumb|150px|Women in typical Albanian costume of Piana degli Albanesi, historical photo dates to the end of the 19th century]]\n[[File:Donna di Sicilia in costume di Piana degli Albanesi - Ettore De Maria Bergler.jpg|thumb|Ettore De Maria Bergler, ''Woman in costume of Piana degli Albanesi'', [[oil on canvas]] (1933)]]\nThe traditional female costume of Piana degli Albanesi, along with language and the Byzantine rite, is one of the most obvious signs of Arb\u00ebreshe cultural identity, and is a unique expression of local self-consciousness, which manifests itself in the desire to retain identity and traditions. From the historical point of view Piana degli Albanesi is one of the most notable Arb\u00ebresh communities in Arb\u00ebria and Sicily.  There are several artistic works on the clothes of Albanians of Piana degli Albanesi, including very valuable Vuillier prints of the eighteenth century, and paintings by Ettore De Maria Bergler, partly preserved at the Art Gallery of the monumental complex of Sant'Anna in Palermo and other private prints, postcards and watercolors by unknown authors. Both the former, together with numerous additional representations portray and demonstrate the incomparability of the costume of Piana degli Albanesi.\n\nThe clothes, linked to the various moments of women's lives, from everyday life to marriage, punctuated the rhythms of social tradition of the past. Handed down from mother to daughter, and zealously preserved, they are no longer clothes, but costumes. The progressive loss of this link began in the 1940s, when after the war in Europe there was a need for more practical clothing.\n\nThe opulent and elegant clothes have preserved intact their special character, and are worn on special occasions such as [[baptisms]], [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], Easter and especially marriage, continuing to be carefully preserved by the women of Piana degli Albanesi. It costs thousands of [[euros]] to make and repair these costumes, and the majority of women use them on these occasions. An epitome of beauty is the bridal costume, which makes it particularly valuable and the religious event of the [[Byzantine rite]]. The quality of production is due to the great craftsmanship of the Arb\u00ebresh embroiderers in gold and silk wheelwork, velvet and gold (in leads, and lenticciole canatiglie).  Embroidery is done using a pillow, a frame or a needle alone.\n\nThe traditional female costume of Piana degli Albanesi has been admired through time and consensus. In the competition held in Venice in 1928, in which costume groups from every region of Italy took part, the group from Piana degli Albanesi was awarded first prize, a recognition of their traditional dress as the most sumptuous, rich in design, fabrics and colors out of all the regional competitors.<ref name=\"Historia\"/>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main article|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people}}\n[[File:Bilingual signs.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Bilingual signs in Piana degli Albanesi]]\nThe most obvious traces of the strong ethnic identity of Piana degli Albanesi is the Albanian language ([[Arb\u00ebresh language|Arb\u00ebrisht]]). It is spoken by all, and can be seen in street names, road signs, and shop signs in the village. The Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb community has preserved its identity as much as possible. The language shares the widespread language variations seen in southern [[Albania]], mixed at times with Greek phonetics. The language is recognized by the local government and primary schools as a minority ethno-linguistic language. [[Arb\u00ebresh language|Arb\u00ebrisht]] remains the dominant language in the region. Piana degli Albanesi is officially bilingual; the official town documents are written in both Albanian and Italian. The citizens are bilingual, able to use both the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and Italian languages.<ref>New Albanian Immigrants in the Old Albanian Diaspora: Piana Degli Albanesi. Eda Derhemi</ref>\n\nThe Albanian language is used in radio stations (ex. ''Radio Hora'' or ''Radio Jona''), and especially in books and periodicals (ex. ''Mondo Albanese'', ''Kartularet e Biblos'', ''Albanica'', ''Fluturimi i aikull\u00ebs'', ''Lajmtari Arb\u00ebreshvet'' or ''Mir\u00eb dit\u00eb'').\n\n===Music===\nThe music and chants of Piana degli Albanesi are deeply tied to religious tradition. The repertoire of sacred songs in Greek and in Albanian language, used throughout the liturgical year of complex and detailed, is very wide. The weekly liturgies, festivals and other officiating are always adorned with a ceaseless flow of melody. The poetic and musical forms are dell'innografia Byzantine liturgical repertory of the museum system is modal theory and follows the Byzantine dell'okt\u00f2ichos. In addition to these compositions, the prevailing source of educated, there are other evidences of a profane nature, strongly influenced, moreover, of the musical traditions of indigenous origin, it has a large number of popular songs, heritage still very much alive and thriving. \n\nThe transmission of the songs is, even today, almost entirely through oral tradition.

Local food is rich in values and flavors, with its rituals and its symbolic codes, it constitutes an element of socio-cultural identification. The manufacturing process to obtain these products is almost a ritual, which from ancient times has been handed down from father to son to the present day [111]. A complete overview of typical products, especially desserts (\u00ebmb\u00eblsirat), is for Easter, when all the Albanian traditions rediscover their splendid form. Piana degli Albanesi is famous for bread (''buk\u00eb''), olive oil (''vajt\u00eb ulliri''), ricotta (''gjiz\u00eb''), cheese (''udhos\u00eb'') and cannoli (''Kanoj\u00ebt'') filled with candied ricotta.\n\nAmong the various typical gastronomic products we can mention: ''Stranguj\u00ebt'' ([[Gnocchi]]), ''Lik\u00ebnk\u00eb'' (Salsiccia), ''Grosha'' or ''Grosh\u00ebt'', ''Milanis\u00eb'', ''Grur\u00ebt'' (Cucc\u00eca), ''Vet\u00eb t\u00eb kuqe'' (Easter red eggs), ''Panaret'' (Easter Breads), ''Loshkat e petullat'', ''Dor\u00ebz\u00ebt'', ''T\u00eb plot\u00eb'' (Buccellati),\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:ZefSkiroi.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Giuseppe Schir\u00f2]] (1865\u20131925)]]\n* [[Luca Matranga]] (1567\u20131619), Orthodox priest, writer who gave the official start [[Albanian literature]] in diaspora.\n* [[Giorgio Guzzetta]] (1682\u20131756), [[Apostle]] of the Albanians in Sicily, founder of the \"Italo-Albanian Seminary\" and priest of Byzantine rite for the sanctity of life and apostolic works memorable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giorgio-guzzetta_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=GUZZETTA, Giorgio.
