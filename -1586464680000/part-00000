The area of the diocese is {{convert|8487|sqmi|km2}}.\n\nOn February 23, 2010, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] appointed Monsignor [[Joseph Bambera|Joseph C. Bambera]] the tenth Bishop of Scranton. Bambera was ordained and installed as bishop on April 26, 2010, at St. Peter\u2019s Cathedral. [[Justin Francis Rigali|Cardinal Justin Rigali]], [[Archbishop of Philadelphia]], served as principal consecrator and [[James Timlin]], Bishop Emeritus of Scranton, and [[John Dougherty (bishop)|John Dougherty]], former Auxiliary Bishop of Scranton, served as co-consecrators.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] populations attracted by the coal-mining industry came to comprise one-half of the Catholic population.\n\nAlthough many of the early settlers were Catholic immigrants, the first official visit of a priest to this territory of which there is any authentic record was not until 1787. In that year (during the [[suppression of the Society of Jesus]]) the former [[Jesuit]] [[James Pellentz]] (1727\u20131800)<ref>Jakob Pellentz was a native of Messenich in the diocese of Trier in Germany. He ceased being a Jesuit when the society was dissolved by [[Pope Clement XIV]] in 1773. He was a Vicar General of Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore. {{cite book|editor=Martin I. J.

Planned as a retreat for French nobility, the site chosen was on the banks of the Susquehanna River, opposite the present village of [[Standing Stone Township, Pennsylvania|Standing Stone]] in Bradford County. Today scarcely a trace of this unique settlement remains.\n\nThe earliest permanent Catholic settlements were at [[Friendsville, Pennsylvania|Friendsville]] and [[Silver Lake Township, Pennsylvania|Silver Lake]] in Susquehanna County. These, as well as the other Catholic settlers scattered throughout this district, were attended occasionally by priests sent from [[Philadelphia]]. In 1825 \u2013 largely due to the solicitations of Patrick Griffin, father of [[Gerald Griffin]] \u2013 [[Francis Kenrick]], Bishop of Philadelphia, sent the Rev. [[John O'Flynn]] as the first resident pastor. His work, however, was similar to that of a missionary, as his field of labor comprised thirteen counties in northeastern Pennsylvania and five counties in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.\n\nThe first church in the diocese was built in 1825 near Silver Lake. Father O'Flynn died at [[Danville, Pennsylvania|Danville]] in 1829, and was succeeded by Father Clancy. On February 1, 1836, [[Henry Fitzsimmons]] was sent to take charge of this territory and took up his residence in Carbondale, where a church had been built in 1832. In 1838 [[John Vincent O'Reilly]] was sent by Kenrick to assist in administering to the Catholics of this extensive territory. He took up his residence at Silver Lake and his charge comprised Susquehanna, Bradford, Tioga, Potter and Sullivan counties in Pennsylvania and the five adjoining counties in New York. The early history of the diocese is intimately bound to the labors of Father O'Reilly and the foundations of many present parishes were the results of his missionary zeal.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Bishops of Scranton===\nThe following bishops have served as the [[diocesan bishop]] of the Diocese of Scranton.\n[[File:William O'Hara 1893.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[William O'Hara]], 1893]]\n\n# [[William O'Hara]] (1868-1899)<ref>O'Hara was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Giacomo Fransoni. {{cite book|author1=Ritzler, Remigius|author2=Pirminus Sefrin|title=Hierarchia catholica Medii et recentioris aevi...

In the autumn of 1842, he opened a college at St. Joseph's, Susquehanna County. Under his supervision, it grew and flourished and in the 22 years of its existence, the college educated two bishops and over 20 priests. It was destroyed by fire on January 1, 1864 and was never rebuilt. St. Thomas College was established in 1888 and came under the direction of the Christian Brothers. In 1938, it was elevated to become the [[University of Scranton]]. The [[Society of Jesus]] took charge of its governance in 1942. [[Marywood University]], also in Scranton, was founded and is operated by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. [[King's College (Pennsylvania)|King's College]] in Wilkes-Barre is operated by the Congregation of the Holy Cross. And, in [[Dallas, Pennsylvania|Dallas]], [[Misericordia University]] was founded by the [[Religious Sisters of Mercy]] in 1924.\n\nIn the 1940s, it opened the [[Roger Williams Public School No. 10|South Scranton Catholic High School]], later Bishop Klonowski High School. The school closed in 1982.<ref name=\"arch\">{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H097577_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Roger Williams Public School No. 10| accessdate = 2012-01-03| author = Cynthia A.

The final decisions, made in January 2007, resulted in the consolidation of all schools as under direct diocesan control. It created four regional systems (as shown below), and closed many individual schools. All of the secondary education centers in Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties were closed and replaced by two regional schools: Holy Cross High School to serve Lackawanna County and Holy Redeemer High School to serve Luzerne County. The curriculum of the diocese was standardized to promote continuity and uniformity in the education of the students, and improvements have been visible in the results of college attendance and standardized test results, which consistently rank well above the area's public schools. In April 2010, Bishop Joseph Bambera announced an adjustment of the diocesan school system, which dealt with financial contributions, marketing and promotion of the schools, and the closure of four elementary school sites.\n\nAs of the 2011-2012 school year, the Diocese of Scranton operates six early childhood centers,<ref name=\"dioceseofscranton.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dioceseofscranton.org/catholicschools/locate-a-school-draft/ |title=Locate a School \u00ab Diocese of Scranton |publisher=Dioceseofscranton.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-03}}</ref> sixteen elementary schools<ref name=\"dioceseofscranton.org\"/> and four high schools,<ref name=\"dioceseofscranton.org\"/> as shown below (in alphabetical order of the municipality in which they occur).

The area of the diocese is {{convert|8487|sqmi|km2}}.\n\nOn February 23, 2010, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] appointed Monsignor [[Joseph Bambera|Joseph C. Bambera]] the tenth Bishop of Scranton. Bambera was ordained and installed as bishop on April 26, 2010, at St. Peter\u2019s Cathedral.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] populations attracted by the coal-mining industry came to comprise one-half of the Catholic population.\n\nAlthough many of the early settlers were Catholic immigrants, the first official visit of a priest to this territory of which there is any authentic record was not until 1787. In that year the former Jesuit [[James Pellentz]] (1727\u20131800)<ref>Jakob Pellentz was a native of Messenich in the diocese of Trier in Germany. He ceased being a Jesuit when the society was dissolved by [[Pope Clement XIV]] in 1773. He was a Vicar General of Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore. {{cite book|editor=Martin I. J.

Planned as a retreat for French nobility, the site chosen was on the banks of the Susquehanna River, opposite the present village of [[Standing Stone Township, Pennsylvania|Standing Stone]] in Bradford County. Today scarcely a trace of this unique settlement remains.\n\nThe earliest permanent Catholic settlements were at [[Friendsville, Pennsylvania|Friendsville]] and [[Silver Lake Township, Pennsylvania|Silver Lake]] in Susquehanna County. These, as well as the other Catholic settlers scattered throughout this district, were attended occasionally by priests sent from [[Philadelphia]]. In 1825, largely due to the solicitations of Patrick Griffin, father of [[Gerald Griffin]], [[Francis Kenrick]], Bishop of Philadelphia, sent the Rev. [[John O'Flynn]] as the first resident pastor. His work, however, was similar to that of a missionary, as his field of labor comprised thirteen counties in northeastern Pennsylvania and five counties in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.\n\nThe first church in the diocese was built in 1825 near Silver Lake. Father O'Flynn died at [[Danville, Pennsylvania|Danville]] in 1829, and was succeeded by Father Clancy. On February 1, 1836, [[Henry Fitzsimmons]] was sent to take charge of this territory and took up his residence in Carbondale, where a church had been built in 1832. In 1838 [[John Vincent O'Reilly]] was sent by Kenrick to assist in administering to the Catholics of this extensive territory. He took up his residence at Silver Lake and his charge comprised Susquehanna, Bradford, Tioga, Potter and Sullivan counties in Pennsylvania and the five adjoining counties in New York. The early history of the diocese is intimately bound to the labors of Father O'Reilly and the foundations of many present parishes were the results of his missionary zeal.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Bishops of Scranton===\nThe following bishops have served as the [[diocesan bishop]] of the Diocese of Scranton.\n[[File:William O'Hara 1893.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[William O'Hara]], 1893]]\n\n# [[William O'Hara]] (1868-1899)<ref>O'Hara was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Giacomo Fransoni. {{cite book|author1=Ritzler, Remigius|author2=Pirminus Sefrin|title=Hierarchia catholica Medii et recentioris aevi...

In the autumn of 1842, he opened a college at St. Joseph's, Susquehanna County. Under his supervision, it grew and flourished and in the 22 years of its existence, the college educated two bishops and over 20 priests. It was destroyed by fire on January 1, 1864 and was never rebuilt. St. Thomas College was established in 1888 and came under the direction of the Christian Brothers. In 1938, it was elevated to become the [[University of Scranton]]. The [[Society of Jesus]] took charge of its governance in 1942. [[Marywood University]], also in Scranton, was founded and is operated by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. [[King's College (Pennsylvania)|King's College]] in Wilkes-Barre is operated by the Congregation of the Holy Cross. And, in [[Dallas, Pennsylvania|Dallas]], [[Misericordia University]] was founded by the [[Religious Sisters of Mercy]] in 1924.\n\nIn the 1940s, it opened the [[Roger Williams Public School No. 10|South Scranton Catholic High School]], later Bishop Klonowski High School.

The final decisions, made in January 2007, resulted in the consolidation of all schools as under direct diocesan control. It created four regional systems (as shown below), and closed many individual schools. All of the secondary education centers in Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties were closed and replaced by two regional schools: Holy Cross High School to serve Lackawanna County and Holy Redeemer High School to serve Luzerne County. The curriculum of the diocese was standardized to promote continuity and uniformity in the education of the students, and improvements have been visible in the results of college attendance and standardized test results, which consistently rank well above the area's public schools. In April 2010, Bishop Joseph Bambera announced an adjustment of the diocesan school system, which dealt with financial contributions, marketing and promotion of the schools, and the closure of four elementary school sites.\n\nAs of the 2011-2012 school year, the Diocese of Scranton operates six early childhood centers,<ref name=\"dioceseofscranton.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dioceseofscranton.org/catholicschools/locate-a-school-draft/ |title=Locate a School \u00ab Diocese of Scranton |publisher=Dioceseofscranton.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-03}}</ref> sixteen elementary schools<ref name=\"dioceseofscranton.org\"/> and four high schools,<ref name=\"dioceseofscranton.org\"/> as shown below (in alphabetical order of the municipality in which they occur).

{"title_page": "Port, Templeport", "text_new": "[[File:Port, Templeport.jpg|thumb|Road beside Templeport Lough, County Cavan, Ireland, heading west.]]\n\n'''Port''' ({{Irish derived place name|Port meaning 'A Landing-Place'}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state-\n\n''The soil is light yellow clay intermixed with sand stone...The townland is bounded on the W. side by a large lake, on the E. bank of which is situated the parish church. It is a handsome modern building to which is attached a graveyard in which nearly all the Protestant inhabitants are buried. There is an island belonging to this townland near the centre of the lake.''\n\nPort is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes.\n\nThe townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas. He doubts whether the said collation and provision of the said vicarage which, as the pope has learned, is still void as above, holds good. Dignum [arbitramur]''.<ref>Calendar of Papal Registers Relating To Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 6, 1404-1415, ed. W H Bliss and J A Twemlow (London, 1904), p. 476.</ref> In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''. Port was one of these four polls.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/MonasticonHibernicumV1|page=[https://archive.org/details/MonasticonHibernicumV1/page/n90 71]|quote=Kilfert.|title=Monasticon Hibernicum: or, a history of the abbeys, priories, and other religious houses in Ireland; interspersed with memoirs of their several founders and benefactors, and of their abbots and other superiors, to the time of their final suppression|first=Mervyn|last=Archdall|date=14 September 1873|publisher=W.

Port was one of these four pulls.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S6MUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA233&dq=cavan+Tampleporte&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiy8t3o-sjjAhVbiVwKHbjUAVIQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=cavan%20Tampleporte&f=false]</ref>\n\nBy grant dated 10 August 1607, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a further lease of ''the farms, termons or hospitals of Templeport containing 2 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of 13 shillings'' to the aforesaid Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]] of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. This grant covered the two extra polls of ecclesiastical land in the parish which had been overlooked in the previous inquisitions and grants.\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte were containing 6 pulls lying near the parish church and that the rectory was appropriated to the [[Abbey of Kells]], [[County Meath]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=popOAAAAIAAJ&dq=killfeart+templeporte+killadough&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=templeporte]</ref> Port was one of these six pulls.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport to consist of six polls of land, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 10 shillings and 2/3rd of a beef per annum''.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state-\n\n''The soil is light yellow clay intermixed with sand stone...The townland is bounded on the W. side by a large lake, on the E. bank of which is situated the parish church. It is a handsome modern building to which is attached a graveyard in which nearly all the Protestant inhabitants are buried. There is an island belonging to this townland near the centre of the lake.''\n\nPort is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes.\n\nThe townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the parish not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas.

Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s party ate sled dogs during his expedition to the South Pole. This allowed the party to carry less food, thus lightening the load.<ref name=southpole /> When comparing sled dogs to ponies as draught animals he also notes:\n<blockquote>there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u2013 and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.<ref name=southpole >{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|title=The South Pole|first=Roald|last=Amundsen|access-date=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926120454/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|archive-date=2009-09-26|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Douglas Mawson]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] were part of the [[Far Eastern Party]], a three-man sledging team with [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis]], to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers.

One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from.

Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers. Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition [[hypervitaminosis A]] because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do.

Robb and his family continued to live there until his death in 1976.<ref name=\"whig\"/>\n\n==== ''Gitchi Nagamo'' ====\n''Gitchi Nagamo'' is the name of a bell Robb had cast for Abbey Dawn. Gitchi Nagamo is an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] word meaning 'great sound,' which Robb further translated to 'a beautiful song.' The bell was cast in Crowden, England by [[Gillett and Johnston]] in 1936, and on the bell are the words cast from Robb's poem \"Morningsong;\"\n\n<i>I give my soul to the Silent Dawn,<br />\nAnd it goes where the song of the birds has gone<ref name=\"far bell\">{{cite book |last1=Robb |first1=Wallace Havelock |title=A Far Bell Calling |date=1949 |publisher=Abbey Dawn Press|type=paperback}}</ref></i>\n\nThe bell was cast to Robb's specifications, and was mounted at Abbey Dawn. It was rung twice every day at dawn and dusk, at 4:30 daily for a pastoral and then again by visiting poets and pregnant women, and then again if they day were a holiday. It was also rung when a baby was baptized at the site.<ref name=\"far bell\"/> Robb conducted many baptisms at Abbey Dawn \u2013 Robb claimed that poets were originally priests, and that long before Christianity, baptisms were name-giving ceremonies.

The bell was originally commissioned out of inspiration and respect for the 'first poet of North America,' who according to Robb is simply a [[Indigenous peoples|'redman']].<ref name=\"far bell\"/>\n\n=== Work with Mohawk people ===\nClose to Belleville is [[Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte First Nation|Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]], a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] reserve home to the Bay of Quinte Mohawks. Much of Robb's published work refers to a place called 'Kente,' which is the traditional name for the [[Bay of Quinte|Bay of Quinte region]] (of which Belleville is a part). 'Quinte' is the current term for the area, having been morphed from the traditional Mohawk name. Robb and his wife lived with the Mohawks on this reservation for 3 1/2 years, learning the language and assisting with the preservation of the culture and its history.<ref name=\"bard\">{{cite news |last1=Bainbridge |first1=Roger |title=The bard of Abbey Dawn |publisher=The Kingston Whig-Standard |date=June 19, 1972|type=Clipping}}</ref>\n\nRobb has been identified for his efforts in preserving and celebrating Mohawk culture. Mohawks from [[Six Nations of the Grand River]] (near [[Brantford, Ontario]]) had gifted Robb the title of 'Honorary Pine Tree Chief,' and he held an honorary Mohawk name meaning 'Great White Eagle' as he was adopted as a brother of the Mohawks.<ref name=\"dawn cove abbey\"/>\n\nWorks of his that relate to Mohawk culture and lore include Thunderbird, Tecumtha, and Kayonakonte.\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nRobb died January 29, 1976 at his home in Abbey Dawn. His obituary in the ''[[Kingston Whig-Standard]]'' described him as a \"distinguished poet,\" and a \"poet-naturalist\".<ref name=\"obit\">{{cite news |title=Famed Poet Dead |publisher=Kingston Whig-Standard |date=January 30, 1976 |pages=1, 2|type=Clipping}}</ref>' His obituary was also featured in ''The Globe and Mail'' on January 31, 1976 where he was remembered for his conservation work.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wallace Robb, 88, poet and author |work=The Globe and Mail |date=January 31, 1976|page=10|type=Clipping}}</ref>\n\nHis legacy remains as a vibrant Canadian poet. When performing his poems at events, he wore a 'wine-red-purple' gowned donned with native symbols on the arms. This gown was made and given to him by the woman's literacy club in Saint Catherine's.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Duir |first1=Angus |title=And, By Golly, He IS A Poet! |publisher=The Telegram (Toronto) |date=November 13, 1961|type=Clipping}}</ref> Robb had even received letters from [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] congratulating him on his poetic work. The Queen had received a copy of 'Hail Canada!' after it was forwarded to her by the Governor General's residence in 1967.<ref name=\"tribute\">{{cite news |title=A Queen's Tribute is Poet's Reward |publisher=The Kingston Whig-Standard |date=February 18, 1967|type=Clipping}}</ref> The letter of acknowledgement read 'Her Majesty was delighted to accept these poems. The Queen enjoyed reading them very much and thought they were a most appropriate commemoration of Canada's Centennial Year.' The Queen had also mailed Robb earlier in 1959, after Robb had written a poem about the royal yacht that the Queen was touring Canada in. The Queen had received a copy prior to her departure, and one week later Robb received a letter of thanks for the poem.<ref name=\"tribute\"/>\n\n== Published work ==\nWallace Havelock Robb published multiple collections of poetry about Canadian flora and fauna and Indigenous lore, including:\n*''The Quill and Candle'' (1927)\n*''The Door of Dawn'' (1937)\n*''Indian Christmas Carol'' (1940)\n*''Thunderbird'' (1949)\n*''A Far Bell Calling'' (1949)\n*''Indian lore of the Bay of Quinte'' (1952)\n*''Tecumtha'' (1958)\n*''Kayanokonte'' (1961)\n*''Hail Canada!''

His involvement with the society resulted in his joining American Audubon Society field man [[Herbert K.

The land, first described as a 500-acre plateau of woodland, initially served as Robb's family's home farm where they managed 84 head of cattle and crops.<ref name=\"whig\"/> Over time, the land developed into a retreat and study centre for visiting poets as well as a bird sanctuary and a museum of interesting [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous]] artifacts Robb had found in the area.

The official description of the game reserve is below:\n[[File:WallaceHavelockRobbReading.jpg|thumb|left|Robb giving a poetry reading, 1925.]]\n\n<i>\"In the Township of Pittsburgh in the County of Frontenac, being composed of parts of lots 5, 6, and 7, in Concession I, having an area of 500 acres, more or less, and described as follows:\nCommencing at the north-easterly angle of Lot 7; thence southerly along the easterly boundary of that lot a distance of 94 chains, more or less, to its intersection with the northerly limit of the right-of-way of that part of the King's Highway known as number 2; thence south 52\u00b058' west along that northerly limit a distance of 27 chains and 50 links, more or less, to the high-water mark on the northerly bank of a creek flowing through lots 5 and 6; thence westerly along that high-water mark a distance of 12 chains, more or less, to its intersection with the limit between the east and west halves of that lot 5; thence northerly along that limit a distance of 88 chains, more or less, to the northerly limit of that lot; thence easterly along the northerly limits of lots 5, 6, and 7, a distance of 48 chains and 50 links, more or less, to the place of commencement.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Government of Ontario |title=Consolidated Regulations of Ontario, 1950 : a revision and consolidation of regulations published under the authority of the Regulations Consolidation Act, 1949 |publisher=Baptist Johnson, Printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty |edition=Amendment |chapter=Reg. 221/54, Appendix B, Schedule 1|type=Hardcover}}</ref></i>\n\nAbbey Dawn closed to the public in 1962 due to vandalism. Robb and his family continued to live there until his death in 1976.<ref name=\"whig\"/>\n\n==== ''Gitchi Nagamo'' ====\n''Gitchi Nagamo'' is the name of a bell Robb had cast for Abbey Dawn. Gitchi Nagamo is an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] word meaning 'great sound,' which Robb further translated to 'a beautiful song.' The bell was cast in Crowden, England by [[Gillett and Johnston]] in 1936, and on the bell are the words cast from Robb's poem \"Morningsong;\"\n\n<i>I give my soul to the Silent Dawn,<br />\nAnd it goes where the song of the birds has gone<ref name=\"far bell\">{{cite book |last1=Robb |first1=Wallace Havelock |title=A Far Bell Calling |date=1949 |publisher=Abbey Dawn Press|type=paperback}}</ref></i>\n\nThe bell was cast to Robb's specifications, and was mounted at Abbey Dawn. It was rung twice every day at dawn and dusk, at 4:30 daily for a pastoral and then again by visiting poets and pregnant women, and then again if they day were a holiday. It was also rung when a baby was baptized at the site.<ref name=\"far bell\"/> Robb conducted many baptisms at Abbey Dawn \u2013 Robb claimed that poets were originally priests, and that long before Christianity, baptisms were name-giving ceremonies. Robb only baptized children of people who were not church-goers.<ref name=\"names\">{{cite news |last1=Knapp |first1=Cliff |title=Youngsters Given Indian Names |publisher=The Kingston Whig-Standard |date=April 19, 1965|type=Clipping}}</ref>\n\nRobb claimed this bell was a symbol of love and happiness, representative of 'the Bluebird of Happiness.' The bell was originally commissioned out of inspiration and respect for the 'first poet of North America,' who according to Robb is simply a [[Indigenous peoples|'redman']].<ref name=\"far bell\"/>\n\n=== Work with Mohawk people ===\nClose to Belleville is [[Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte First Nation|Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]], a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] reserve home to the Bay of Quinte Mohawks. Much of Robb's published work refers to a place called 'Kente,' which is the traditional name for the [[Bay of Quinte|Bay of Quinte region]] (of which Belleville is a part). 'Quinte' is the current term for the area, having been morphed from the traditional Mohawk name. Robb and his wife lived with the Mohawks on this reservation for 3 1/2 years, learning the language and assisting with the preservation of the culture and its history.<ref name=\"bard\">{{cite news |last1=Bainbridge |first1=Roger |title=The bard of Abbey Dawn |publisher=The Kingston Whig-Standard |date=June 19, 1972|type=Clipping}}</ref>\n\nRobb has been identified for his efforts in preserving and celebrating Mohawk culture. Mohawks from [[Six Nations of the Grand River]] (near [[Brantford, Ontario]]) had gifted Robb the title of 'Honorary Pine Tree Chief,' and he held an honorary Mohawk name meaning 'Great White Eagle' as he was adopted as a brother of the Mohawks.<ref name=\"dawn cove abbey\"/>\n\nWorks of his that relate to Mohawk culture and lore include Thunderbird, Tecumtha, and Kayonakonte.\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nRobb died January 29, 1976 at his home in Abbey Dawn. His obituary in the ''[[Kingston Whig-Standard]]'' described him as a \"distinguished poet,\" and a \"poet-naturalist\".<ref name=\"obit\">{{cite news |title=Famed Poet Dead |publisher=Kingston Whig-Standard |date=January 30, 1976 |pages=1, 2|type=Clipping}}</ref>' His obituary was also featured in ''The Globe and Mail'' on January 31, 1976 where he was remembered for his conservation work.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wallace Robb, 88, poet and author |work=The Globe and Mail |date=January 31, 1976|page=10|type=Clipping}}</ref>\n\nHis legacy remains as a vibrant Canadian poet. When performing his poems at events, he wore a 'wine-red-purple' gowned donned with native symbols on the arms. This gown was made and given to him by the woman's literacy club in Saint Catherine's.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Duir |first1=Angus |title=And, By Golly, He IS A Poet! |publisher=The Telegram (Toronto) |date=November 13, 1961|type=Clipping}}</ref> Robb had even received letters from [[Elizabeth II| Queen Elizabeth II]] congratulating him on his poetic work. The Queen had received a copy of 'Hail Canada!' after it was forwarded to her by the Governor General's residence in 1967.<ref name=\"tribute\">{{cite news |title=A Queen's Tribute is Poet's Reward |publisher=The Kingston Whig-Standard |date=February 18, 1967|type=Clipping}}</ref> The letter of acknowledgement read 'Her Majesty was delighted to accept these poems. The Queen enjoyed reading them very much and thought they were a most appropriate commemoration of Canada's Centennial Year.' The Queen had also mailed Robb earlier in 1959, after Robb had written a poem about the royal yacht that the Queen was touring Canada in. The Queen had received a copy prior to her departure, and one week later Robb received a letter of thanks for the poem.<ref name=\"tribute\"/>\n\n== Published work ==\nWallace Havelock Robb published multiple collections of poetry about Canadian flora and fauna and Indigenous lore, including:\n*''The Quill and Candle'' (1927)\n*''The Door of Dawn'' (1937)\n*''Indian Christmas Carol'' (1940)\n*''Thunderbird'' (1949)\n*''A Far Bell Calling'' (1949)\n*''Indian lore of the Bay of Quinte'' (1952)\n*''Tecumtha'' (1958)\n*''Kayanokonte'' (1961)\n*''Hail Canada!''

It was released on 12 September 2008 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Holocaust]] drama relates the horror of a [[Nazi]] [[extermination camp]] through the eyes of two 8-year-old boys; Bruno ([[Asa Butterfield]]), the son of the camp's Nazi commandant, and Shmuel ([[Jack Scanlon]]), a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[prisoner|inmate]].\n\nThe film has drawn criticism from some Holocaust educators for its factual inaccuracy.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with the quote \"Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows\", by [[John Betjeman]]. A young boy named Bruno lives in [[Berlin]], in [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. His father Ralf is promoted, and relocates the family to the \"countryside\" ([[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]]). Living without neighbours, far from any town, Bruno becomes lonely and bored. After spotting people working on what he thinks is a farm in the distance \u2013 actually a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] \u2013 he is forbidden from playing in the back garden.\n\nBruno and his sister Gretel\u2019s tutor, Herr Liszt, pushes an agenda of [[antisemitism]] and [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]]. This, together with Gretel's infatuation with [[Lieutenant]] Kurt Kotler, makes her fanatical in her support for the Third Reich, to the point of covering her bedroom wall with posters and portraits of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Bruno is confused, as the only [[Jews|Jew]] he has seen, the family's servant Pavel, does not resemble the antisemitic caricatures in Liszt's teachings.\n\nBruno sneaks into the woods, arriving at a barbed wire fence surrounding the camp. He befriends a boy named Shmuel, and their ignorance of the camp\u2019s true nature is revealed: Bruno thinks the striped uniforms that Shmuel, Pavel, and the other prisoners wear are pyjamas, and Shmuel believes his grandparents died from an illness during their journey to the camp. Bruno meets Shmuel regularly, sneaking him food and playing board games. He learns Shmuel is a Jew, brought to the camp with his father and mother.\n\n[[File:Sachsenhausen clothes.jpg|thumb|left|Prisoner's clothing from [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]]]\nBruno\u2019s mother Elsa discovers the reality of Ralf's assignment after Kotler lets slip that the black smoke coming from the camp's chimneys is due to the burning corpses of Jews, and she confronts Ralf. At dinner, Kotler admits that his father had left his family for [[Switzerland]]. Ralf tells Kotler that he should have informed the authorities of his father's disagreement with the current political regime. Embarrassed, Kotler violently beats Pavel for spilling a glass of wine.\n\nBruno sees Shmuel working in his home, and offers him some cake. When Kotler finds Bruno and Shmuel socialising, he berates Shmuel, and notices him chewing.

Shmuel\u2019s father has gone missing after participating in a march, and Bruno decides to redeem himself by helping Shmuel find his father. Donning a prisoner\u2019s striped outfit and a cap to cover his unshaven head, Bruno digs under the fence to join Shmuel. He is shocked to see the many sick and weak-looking Jews, and the boys are taken on a march with other inmates by [[Sonderkommando]]s.\n\nAt the house, Gretel and Elsa discover Bruno's disappearance, and Elsa bursts into Ralf's meeting to alert him that Bruno is missing. Ralf and his men mount a search, with Elsa and Gretel following behind. A dog tracks Bruno's scent to his discarded clothing outside the fence, and Ralf enters the camp. Bruno, Shmuel, and the inmates are taken to a changing room and told to remove their clothes for a \"shower\". They are packed into a [[gas chamber]], as a [[Schutzstaffel]] soldier pours [[Zyklon B]] pellets inside, and the prisoners begin panicking. When Ralf realises that a gassing is taking place, he cries out his son's name; at the fence, Elsa and Gretel hear Ralf's cries and fall to their knees in despair.

It was released on 12 September 2008 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Holocaust]] drama relates the horror of a [[Nazi]] [[extermination camp]] through the eyes of two 8-year-old boys; Bruno ([[Asa Butterfield]]), the son of the camp's Nazi commandant, and Shmuel ([[Jack Scanlon]]), a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[prisoner|inmate]].\n\nThe film has drawn criticism from some Holocaust educators for its factual inaccuracy.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with the quote \"Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows\", by [[John Betjeman]]. A young boy named Bruno lives in [[Berlin]], in [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. His father Ralf is promoted, and relocates the family to the \"countryside\" ([[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]]). Living without neighbours, far from any town, Bruno becomes lonely and bored. After spotting people working on what he thinks is a farm in the distance \u2013 actually a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] \u2013 he is forbidden from playing in the back garden.\n\nBruno and his sister Gretel\u2019s tutor, Herr Liszt, pushes an agenda of [[antisemitism]] and [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]]. This, together with Gretel's infatuation with [[Lieutenant]] Kurt Kotler, makes her fanatical in her support for the Third Reich, to the point of covering her bedroom wall with posters and portraits of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Bruno is confused, as the only [[Jews|Jew]] he has seen, the family's servant Pavel, does not resemble the antisemitic caricatures in Liszt's teachings.\n\nBruno sneaks into the woods, arriving at a barbed wire fence surrounding the camp. He befriends a boy named Shmuel, and their ignorance of the camp\u2019s true nature is revealed: Bruno thinks the striped uniforms that Shmuel, Pavel, and the other prisoners wear are pyjamas, and Shmuel believes his grandparents died from an illness during their journey to the camp. Bruno meets Shmuel regularly, sneaking him food and playing board games. He learns Shmuel is a Jew, brought to the camp with his father and mother.\n\n[[File:Sachsenhausen clothes.jpg|thumb|left|Prisoner's clothing from [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]]]\nBruno\u2019s mother Elsa discovers the reality of Ralf's assignment after Kotler lets slip that the black smoke coming from the camp's chimneys is due to the burning corpses of Jews, and she confronts Ralf. At dinner, Kotler admits that his father had left his family for [[Switzerland]]. Ralf tells Kotler that he should have informed the authorities of his father's disagreement with the current political regime. Embarrassed, Kotler violently beats Pavel for spilling a glass of wine.\n\nBruno sees Shmuel working in his home, and offers him some cake. When Kotler finds Bruno and Shmuel socialising, he berates Shmuel, and notices him chewing. Shmuel explains that Bruno offered the cake, which the fearful Bruno denies, and Kotler tells Shmuel they will have a \"little chat\" later. Bruno goes to apologise to Shmuel, but finds him gone. He returns to the fence every day, and eventually Shmuel reappears, sporting a black eye. Bruno apologises and Shmuel forgives him, renewing their friendship.\n\nAfter the funeral of his grandmother, killed in Berlin by an Allied bombing, Ralf tells Bruno and Gretel that their mother suggests they live with a relative where it is safer; in truth, Elsa does not want her children living with their murderous father. Shmuel\u2019s father has gone missing after participating in a march, and Bruno decides to redeem himself by helping Shmuel find his father. Donning a prisoner\u2019s striped outfit and a cap to cover his unshaven head, Bruno digs under the fence to join Shmuel. He is shocked to see the many sick and weak-looking Jews, and the boys are taken on a march with other inmates by [[Sonderkommando]]s.\n\nAt the house, Gretel and Elsa discover Bruno's disappearance, and Elsa bursts into Ralf's meeting to alert him that Bruno is missing. Ralf and his men mount a search, with Elsa and Gretel following behind. A dog tracks Bruno's scent to his discarded clothing outside the fence, and Ralf enters the camp. Bruno, Shmuel, and the inmates are taken to a changing room and told to remove their clothes for a \"shower\". They are packed into a [[gas chamber]], as a [[Schutzstaffel]] soldier pours [[Zyklon B]] pellets inside, and the prisoners begin panicking. When Ralf realises that a gassing is taking place, he cries out his son's name; at the fence, Elsa and Gretel hear Ralf's cries and fall to their knees in despair. The film ends by showing the closed door of the now silent gas chamber, indicating that all prisoners, including Bruno and Shmuel, are dead.\n\n==Production==\nFilming was completed during 29 April 2007 to 7 July 2007, in [[Hungary]].

Based on the fact that the ''Midichlorian'' genes for the flagellum and for the cbb3 cytochrome oxidase were proven to be ancestral, the genes were inferred to have been present in the bacterium that established the symbiosis with the ancestor of the eukaryotic cell, that became the mitochondrion.\n\nHence, sequencing the genome of ''M. mitochondrii'' allowed an improved reconstruction of the mitochondrias' hypothetical free-living ancestor: It was a motile bacterium able to survive in microaerophilic conditions. Both these characteristics may have played an important role in the beginning of the symbiosis between the eukaryotic cell and the mitochondrion.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Beninati | first1 = T. | last2 = Lo | first2 = N. | last3 = Sacchi | first3 = L. | last4 = Genchi | first4 = C. | last5 = Noda | first5 = H. | last6 = Bandi | first6 = C. | year = 2004 | title = A novel alpha-proteobacterium resides in the mitochondria of ovarian cells of the tick Ixodes ricinus | url = | journal = Appl.
