He claimed that he had \"strongly pleaded with the Centre that the policy should be changed\". He added that \"the Centre is the buyer of our mineral products.

It is a coming of age story of a ten-year-old boy sent to the house of his maternal grandparents, which is full of eccentric characters. The boy has to deal with the realization of his sexual identity. The title makes reference to the analogy of a lame pigeon with homosexuality.<ref name=\"Benavent 440\"/> The film is an exploration of class and sexual identity in [[Andalusia]], Spain, in the 1950s.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1958, Felipe, a ten-year-old boy, is sent by his mother to spend the summer with his maternal relatives in [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]] while he recuperates his frail health. His grandparents are wealthy and live in a vast residence that serves as the center that reunites a large family and many visitors. The house is dominated by the frequent howls of the boy's ancient great-grandmother, who is senile and is taken care by Adoraci\u00f3n, a strict nurse, who endures the old woman's endlessly repeated recollection of the four bandoleros who killed each other for her love.\n\nPampered on his arrival by the women in the house, Felipe is ordered to stay in bed by the family's doctor. He is installed in the bedroom of his absent uncle Ram\u00f3n and spends his time reading [[Little Women]]. Felipe quickly strikes a close friendship with Mari, the talkative and meddlesome maid. She keeps four lovers on a string, but refuses to let go of her virginity. An expert on men's matters, Mari shamelessly flirts with the boy even when she has the impression that he might be gay. In secrecy, she shows Felipe some items that she has found in uncle Ram\u00f3n's bedroom: a suggesting photograph of Ram\u00f3n in swimming wear revealing his anatomy and a postcard from 1936 signed by someone named Federico that depicts a dog looking at a dove with what Mari describes a lovesick face. The message in the postcard and its image imply that there was a homoerotic relationship between Ram\u00f3n and Federico. Felipe points out that the picture was taken in the terrace of the bedroom and both Mari and the boy are fascinated by Ram\u00f3n's revealing attire in the photograph.\n\nFelipe also befriends Uncle Ricardo, the eccentric brother of the boy's grandfather, who trains pigeons and dreams of finding a treasure at sea with his boat. Felipe tells him of Mari's believe that lame doves are queers and then inquires his great uncle if he might be queer. Although Ricardo denies it, he does not do so when the boy ask the same question regarding uncle Ram\u00f3n, evasively responding that he does not longer remembers.\n\nPeace in the house is frequently disturbed by many visitors like Reglita, a mature spinster, and there is general commotion with the arrival of Felipe's cosmopolitan Aunt Victoria, a singer who sweeps into town with Luigi, her muscle-bound Italian \"secretary\" in tow.  A liberal free thinker who has travelled Europe extensively, Victoria scandalizes Felipe's conservative grandmother with her recitation of erotic and anti-Franco poetry that makes the neighbors blushed but fascinates Reglita.  With her free way of living and her expertise on men, Victoria draws the attention of Mari who asks her about her lovers and Victoria shows her a valuable ring that one of them gave her.\n\nThe uncertainty of Felipe's blossoming sexuality is subjected to further confusion with the surprising arrival of the charismatic Communist uncle Ram\u00f3n, who takes back possession of his bedroom. Both Felipe and Mari are fascinated by him. Felipe asks Ram\u00f3n which tastes better, a man, a lady, or a young gal? to which the worldly Uncle Ram\u00f3n responds, Ladies and young gal taste great, and I once met a man who tasted like Manchego cheese. Felipe immediately identifies this man as Federico. The boy then compliments his uncle on having gorgeous eyes.\n\nThere is new commotion in the house with the elopement of Luigi with one of Mari's lovers, stealing Victoria's valuable ring, and with the death of Felipe's senile great grandmother. Mari tells Felipe that he can spy from his bedroom uncle Ram\u00f3n naked at night, but instead she shows up dancing naked by his window and with Victoria's ring in her hand. The next day Felipe accuses Mari of having stealing the ring and she is fired by the grandfather after Felipe reveals where she hides the ring. Felipe goes to Mari's room before her departure to reconcile. To Felipe's sadness uncle Ram\u00f3n has left as sudden as he arrived.

The best-known of these is Scott Lake Golf and Practice Center, the winner of the 2011 Michigan Golf Course Owners Association \"Golf Course of the Year\" and the 2012 National Golf Course Owners Association \"Golf Course of the Year.\n\n==History==\nIn 1838 a settlement known as \"North's Mill\" was established by Daniel North. The name changed to \"Mill Creek\" in 1848. The area became a major transportation hub, serving both the [[Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad]] and [[Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad]], and set the tone for becoming the northern Grand Rapids-area crossroads it is today. It was renamed \"Comstock Park\" in 1906, after [[Charles C. Comstock]], who represented the district in Congress in 1885 and 1886. Comstock lived on the other side of the Grand River and never in Comstock Park.\n\n==Geography==\nComstock Park is in western Kent County, in the southeast corner of Alpine Township and the southwest corner of Plainfield Charter Township.

The name changed to \"Mill Creek\" in 1848. The area became a major transportation hub, serving both the [[Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad]] and [[Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad]], and set the tone for becoming the northern Grand Rapids-area crossroads it is today. It was renamed \"Comstock Park\" in 1906, after [[Charles C. Comstock]], who represented the district in Congress in 1885 and 1886. Comstock lived on the other side of the Grand River and never in Comstock Park.\n\n==Geography==\nComstock Park is in western Kent County, in the southeast corner of Alpine Township and the southwest corner of Plainfield Charter Township.

They currently work as [[Pharmaceutical sales representative|MRs]] while hoping to make quick money through a [[Godman (India)|Godman]] who promises to triple their profit. The Godman turns out to be part of a larger con and his scheme is discovered by the police. As a result, Chako and Tino are scammed out of [[\u20b9]]1,80,000 (or 180,000 [[rupee]]s).\n\nChako's father, Jeetu ([[Darshan Jariwala]]), runs a small local tea stall, in which hangs a painting from a prominent artist named M.F. Hassan (based on the late [[M.F. Husain]]). The piece was gifted to Jeetu as a sign of their close friendship, before Hassan's rise to prominence and eventual death. Upon learning that Jeetu's tea stall painting is highly coveted, Tino comes up with another idea to secure an investment with ''The Other Side'': secretly replace the painting with an identical fake one, and then loan the original for cash. Initially hesitant but desperate, Chako assists in the plan along with their friend Uday ([[Kavin Dave]]), an avid painter who begrudgingly agrees to compose an exact copy of the piece himself.\n\nWith the switch successful, Chako and Tino mortgage the original painting to a local art dealer, Y.B. Gandhi ([[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]]). Shortly thereafter, however, Gandhi informs Chako that the painting he received is fake and that someone else had tried to sell the same painting to another dealer. Gandhi convinces Chako that either Tino had double-crossed him, or that his father had been lying about the painting's authenticity. Chako returns the money back to Gandhi, and angrily confronts Tino, who indeed went to a separate dealer, but was sent by Uday for an art survey only. Chako then meets his father and accuses him of confabulating a friendship. Angered by the accusations and hurt by Chako's loss of the painting, Jeetu kicks him out of the house.\n\nThe M.F. Hassan painting, however, was an original all along, and Gandhi - whom Hassan hated and never lent his work  to - had cheated Chako and Tino out of the painting. Gandhi then publicly humiliates Jeetu by telling the press he never had a friendship with Hassan, and that the stories of him making his paintings at the tea stall are all false.\n\nHoping to redeem themselves, Chako and Tino devise a plan to take advantage of Gandhi's own greed in order to get the painting back for Jeetu. Helping with the elaborate scheme include Uday and Jigisha (Samvedna Suwalka), Tino's girlfriend. They hire a method actor named Pranav (Amit Mistry) to pose as \"Prabodh Gupta\", a fictitious international artist from [[Bihar]] whose work has yet to be exhibited in [[India]]. The group successfully lures Gandhi into funding a fabricated [[NGO]] and conducting Prabodh's supposed lucrative first exhibition in India, in exchange for the tea stall painting.\n\nPranav and Uday narrowly retrieve the painting on the day of the held exhibition, just as Gandhi realizes that Prabodh is a fraud. He confronts the place of the fake NGO but encounters Chako, Tino, and Jeetu. Chako and Tino demand that he publicly retract his earlier statements about Jeetu, or else be arrested for selling fake paintings and creating the fictitious \"Prabodh Gupta\" himself (since Gandhi was tricked earlier into funding the fake NGO). Realizing his defeat, Gandhi tries to offer money, but Jeetu declines and chastises him for his greed being the reason Hassan never worked with large art curators.\n\nGandhi holds a televised news conference the next morning, apologizing for his previous accusations against Jeetu. Hassan's piece is returned to Jeetu's shop, after he and Chako fully reconcile. Uday, whose own paintings were used as Prabodh's work from earlier, is offered his own local exhibition, attended by much happier Chako and Tino.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Darshan Jariwala]] as Jeetu Bhai\n* [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as Y.B.

They currently work as [[Pharmaceutical sales representative|MRs]] while hoping to make quick money through a [[Godman (India)|Godman]] who promises to triple their profit. The Godman turns out to be part of a larger con and his scheme is discovered by the police. As a result, Chako and Tino are scammed out of [[\u20b9]]1,80,000 (or 180,000 [[rupee]]s).\n\nChako's father, Jeetu ([[Darshan Jariwala]]), runs a small local tea stall, in which hangs a painting from a prominent artist named M.F. Hassan (based on the late [[M.F. Husain]]). The piece was gifted to Jeetu as a sign of their close friendship, before Hassan's rise to prominence and eventual death. Upon learning that Jeetu's tea stall painting is highly coveted, Tino comes up with another idea to secure an investment with ''The Other Side'': secretly replace the painting with an identical fake one, and then loan the original for cash. Initially hesitant but desperate, Chako assists in the plan along with their friend Uday ([[Kavin Dave]]), an avid painter who begrudgingly agrees to compose an exact copy of the piece himself.\n\nWith the switch successful, Chako and Tino mortgage the original painting to a local art dealer, Y.B. Gandhi ([[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]]). Shortly thereafter, however, Gandhi informs Chako that the painting he received is fake and that someone else had tried to sell the same painting to another dealer. Gandhi convinces Chako that either Tino had double-crossed him, or that his father had been lying about the painting's authenticity. Chako returns the money back to Gandhi, and angrily confronts Tino, who indeed went to a separate dealer, but was sent by Uday for an art survey only. Chako then meets his father and accuses him of confabulating a friendship. Angered by the accusations and hurt by Chako's loss of the painting, Jeetu kicks him out of the house.\n\nThe M.F. Hassan painting, however, was an original all along, and Gandhi - whom Hassan hated and never lent his work  to - had cheated Chako and Tino out of the painting. Gandhi then publicly humiliates Jeetu by telling the press he never had a friendship with Hassan, and that the stories of him making his paintings at the tea stall are all false.\n\nHoping to redeem themselves, Chako and Tino devise a plan to take advantage of Gandhi's own greed in order to get the painting back for Jeetu. Helping with the elaborate scheme include Uday and Jigisha (Samvedna Suwalka), Tino's girlfriend. They hire a method actor named Pranav (Amit Mistry) to pose as \"Prabodh Gupta\", a fictitious international artist from [[Bihar]] whose work has yet to be exhibited in [[India]]. The group successfully lures Gandhi into funding a fabricated [[NGO]] and conducting Prabodh's supposed lucrative first exhibition in India, in exchange for the tea stall painting.\n\nPranav and Uday narrowly retrieve the painting on the day of the held exhibition, just as Gandhi realizes that Prabodh is a fraud. He confronts the place of the fake NGO but encounters Chako, Tino, and Jeetu. Chako and Tino demand that he publicly retract his earlier statements about Jeetu, or else be arrested for selling fake paintings and creating the fictitious \"Prabodh Gupta\" himself (since Gandhi was tricked earlier into funding the fake NGO). Realizing his defeat, Gandhi tries to offer money, but Jeetu declines and chastises him for his greed being the reason Hassan never worked with large art curators.\n\nGandhi holds a televised news conference the next morning, apologizing for his previous accusations against Jeetu. Hassan's piece is returned to Jeetu's shop, after he and Chako fully reconcile. Uday, whose own paintings were used as Prabodh's work from earlier, is offered his own local exhibition, attended by much happier Chako and Tino.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Darshan Jariwala]] as Jeetu Bhai\n* [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as Y.B.

Mohammad, who was the owner of a real life [[Ahmedabad]] tea stall, then-named ''Lucky Tea Stall'', and had a painting gifted to him by the late Indian artist [[M.F.
