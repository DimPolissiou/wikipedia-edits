These include a number of works for the guitar, mostly written for the Danish guitarist [[Erling M\u00f8ldrup]]: ''In Memory Of...'' (1978), ''Papalagi'' (1981), a series of suites called ''Tales from a Hand'' (1985\u20132001), ''Early Morn'' (1997\u201398) and ''Rondino Amorino'' (1999). One of his most important works for percussion solo is ''I Ching'' (1982) for the Danish percussionist Gert Mortensen.

The method takes its name from the endlessly [[self-similar]] nature of the resulting musical material {{harv|Mortensen|n.d.(b)}}, comparable to [[fractal|fractal geometry]]. Mathematically, the infinity series is an [[integer sequence]]. \"Invented in an attempt to unify in a perfect way repetition and variation,\" {{harv|Sloane}} the first few terms of its simplest form are 0, 1, \u22121, 2, 1, 0, \u22122, 3, \u2026 {{OEIS|A004718}}.\n\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd discovered the melodic infinity series in 1959 and it proved an inspiration for many of his works during the 1960s. However, it was not until his ''Voyage into the Golden Screen'' for small ensemble (1968)\u2014which has been identified as the first \"properly instrumental piece of [[spectral composition]]\" {{harv|Anderson|2000|loc=14}}\u2014and Symphony No. 2 (1970) that it provided the structure for an entire work {{harv|N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd|1975|loc=9}}.

He has written many articles dealing with music not only from a technical but also a philosophical viewpoint.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n== Music ==\n[[File:Infinityseries.png|thumb|upright=2|{{listen|plain=yes|filename=Infinityseries.mid|title=Uendelighedsr\u00e6kken in G major (the first 32 terms)}} with numbers=scale steps and 0=A]]\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd's music often features the use of the '''infinity series''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] ''Uendelighedsr\u00e6kken'') for [[serialism|serializing]] melody, harmony, and rhythm in musical composition. The method takes its name from the endlessly [[self-similar]] nature of the resulting musical material {{harv|Mortensen|n.d.(b)}}, comparable to [[fractal|fractal geometry]]. Mathematically, the infinity series is an [[integer sequence]]. \"Invented in an attempt to unify in a perfect way repetition and variation,\" {{harv|Sloane}} the first few terms of its simplest form are 0, 1, \u22121, 2, 1, 0, \u22122, 3, \u2026 {{OEIS|A004718}}.\n\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd discovered the melodic infinity series in 1959 and it proved an inspiration for many of his works during the 1960s. However, it was not until his ''Voyage into the Golden Screen'' for small ensemble (1968)\u2014which has been identified as the first \"properly instrumental piece of [[spectral composition]]\" {{harv|Anderson|2000|loc=14}}\u2014and Symphony No. 2 (1970) that it provided the structure for an entire work {{harv|N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd|1975|loc=9}}.

It hosted the canoeing and rowing competitions for the 1980 Summer Olympics.]]\nFor the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a total of twenty-eight '''sports venues''' were used. The first venue used for the Games was built in 1923. With the creation of the [[Spartakiad]] in [[Moscow]] in 1928, more venues were constructed. Central Lenin Stadium Grand Arena was built in 1956 for that year's versions of the Spartkiad. A plan in 1971 to construct more sports venues by 1990 was initiated, but accelerated in 1974 when Moscow was awarded the 1980 Games. The new venues to be used for the Games were completed in 1979. During the Games themselves at the permanent road cycling venue, the first ever constructed, the largest margin of victory was recorded in the individual road race cycling event since 1928. The Grand Arena hosted the football final that was played in a rainstorm for the third straight Olympics. After the 1991 break of the Soviet Union, the venues in Kiev, Minsk, and Tallinn would be located in Ukraine, Belarus, and Estonia, respectively. Luzhniki Stadium, formerly Grand Arena, continues to be used, and it was affected by the [[Luzhniki disaster]] in 1982. The stadium served as host for the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in 2013. Another venue, the Moscow Canoeing and Rowing Basin, served as host to the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in 2014. In December 2010, Russia was awarded the 2018 FIFA World Cup with Luzhniki Stadium and Dynamo Stadium proposed as venues for those events.\n\n==Venues==\n===Central Lenin Stadium Area===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=780px\n!Venue\n!Sports\n!Capacity\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n|-\n|| [[Druzhba Multipurpose Arena]] || [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|Volleyball]] || align=\"right\"|3,900\n| align=center|<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1980/or1980v2pt1.pdf 1980 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2.

The first venue used for the Games was built in 1923. With the creation of the [[Spartakiad]] in [[Moscow]] in 1928, more venues were constructed. Central Lenin Stadium Grand Arena was built in 1956 for that year's versions of the Spartkiad. A plan in 1971 to construct more sports venues by 1990 was initiated, but accelerated in 1974 when Moscow was awarded the 1980 Games. The new venues to be used for the Games were completed in 1979. During the Games themselves at the permanent road cycling venue, the first ever constructed, the largest margin of victory was recorded in the individual road race cycling event since 1928. The Grand Arena hosted the football final that was played in a rainstorm for the third straight Olympics. After the 1991 break of the Soviet Union, the venues in Kiev, Minsk, and Tallinn would be located in Ukraine, Belarus, and Estonia, respectively. Luzhniki Stadium, formerly Grand Arena, continues to be used, and it was affected by the [[Luzhniki disaster]] in 1982. The stadium served as host for the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in 2013. Another venue, the Moscow Canoeing and Rowing Basin, served as host to the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in 2014. In December 2010, Russia was awarded the 2018 FIFA World Cup with Luzhniki Stadium and Dynamo Stadium proposed as venues for those events.\n\n==Venues==\n===Central Lenin Stadium Area===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=780px\n!Venue\n!Sports\n!Capacity\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n|-\n|| [[Druzhba Multipurpose Arena]] || [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|Volleyball]] || align=\"right\"|3,900\n| align=center|<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1980/or1980v2pt1.pdf 1980 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2.

Completed in 1920 as the [[lead ship]] of [[Nagato-class battleship|her class]], she carried supplies for the survivors of the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] in 1923. The ship was modernized in 1934\u20131936 with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the [[pagoda mast]] style. ''Nagato'' briefly participated in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 and was the [[flagship]] of [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. She covered the withdrawal of the attacking ships and did not participate in the attack itself.\n\nOther than participating in the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942, where she did not see combat, the ship spent most of the first two years of the [[Pacific War]] training in home waters. She was transferred to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in mid-1943, but did not see any combat until the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. ''Nagato'' did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in October. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. ''Nagato'' was converted into a floating [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. [[Attack on Yokosuka|She was attacked in July 1945]] as part of the American campaign to destroy the IJN's last remaining [[capital ship]]s, but was only slightly damaged and went on to be the only Japanese battleship to have survived [[World War II]]. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for [[nuclear weapon]] tests during [[Operation Crossroads]]. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second.\n\n==Description==\n''Nagato'' had a length of {{convert|201.17|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|215.8|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]].

This increased her overall length by {{convert|1.59|m|ftin|sp=us}} to {{convert|217.39|m|ftin|sp=us}}. During her 1934\u20131936 reconstruction, the ship's stern was lengthened by {{convert|7.55|m|ft|sp=us}} to improve her speed and her forward superstructure was rebuilt into a [[pagoda mast]]. She was given [[torpedo bulge]]s to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment. These changes increased her overall length to {{convert|224.94|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, her beam to {{convert|34.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and her draft to {{convert|9.49|m|ftin|sp=us}}.

Turning back, ''Nagato'' engaged the American escort carriers and their screening ships, claiming to have damaged one [[cruiser]]{{refn|No cruisers were present, only destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s.<ref name=ha/> In the Battle off Samar, Japanese observers misidentified Taffy 3's escort carriers, destroyers and destroyer escorts as larger light carriers, cruisers and destroyers.|group=Note}} with forty-five 410&nbsp;mm and ninety-two 14&nbsp;cm shells. The ineffectiveness of her shooting was the result of the poor visibility caused by numerous rain [[squall]]s and by [[smoke screen]]s laid by the defending escorts. At 09:10 Kurita ordered his ships to break off the engagement and head north. At 10:20 he ordered the fleet south once more, but as they came under increasingly severe air attack he ordered a retreat again at 12:36. At 12:43 ''Nagato'' was hit in the bow by two bombs, but the damage was not severe. Four [[gunner (artillery)|gunners]] were washed overboard at 16:56 as the ship made a sharp turn to avoid dive-bomber attacks; a destroyer was detached to rescue them, but they could not be found. As it retreated back to Brunei on 26 October, the Japanese fleet came under repeated air attacks. ''Nagato'' and ''Yamato'' used ''Sankaidan'' shells against them and claimed to have shot down several bombers. Over the course of the last two days she fired ninety-nine 410&nbsp;mm and six hundred fifty-three 14&nbsp;cm shells, suffering 38 crewmen killed and 105 wounded during the same time.<ref name=ha/>\n\n====Final days of the war====\nOn 15 November the ship was assigned to Battleship Division 3 of the [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|2nd Fleet]]. After an aerial attack at Brunei on 16 November, ''Nagato'', ''Yamato'', and the fast battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kong\u014d||2}} left the following day, bound for Kure. En route, ''Kong\u014d'' and one of the escorting destroyers was sunk by {{USS|Sealion|SS-315|6}} on 21 November. On 25 November, she arrived at [[Yokosuka (city)|Yokosuka]], Japan, for repairs. Lack of fuel and materials meant that she could not be brought back into service and she was turned into a [[floating battery|floating anti-aircraft battery]]. Her funnel and mainmast were removed to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns, which were increased by two Type 89 mounts and nine triple Type 96 gun mounts. Her forward secondary guns were removed in compensation. Captain Kiyomi Shibuya relieved Kobe in command of ''Nagato'' on 25 November. Battleship Division 3 was disbanded on 1 January 1945 and the ship was reassigned to Battleship Division 1. That formation was disbanded on 10 February and she was assigned to the [[Yokosuka Naval District]] as a [[coastal defense ship]].<ref name=ha/> [[wikt:moor|Moored]] alongside a [[pier]], a coal-burning [[donkey boiler]] was installed on the pier for heating and cooking purposes and a converted [[submarine chaser]] was positioned alongside to provide steam and electricity;<ref name=tu>Tully</ref> her anti-aircraft guns lacked full power and were only partially operational. On 20 April, ''Nagato'' was reduced to reserve and retired Rear Admiral [[Miki Otsuka]] assumed command a week later.<ref name=ha/>\n\n[[File:Japanese battleship Nagato at Yokosuka 1945.jpeg|thumb|right|An Avenger flies past ''Nagato'' as she lies at anchor in Yokosuka, probably after the surrender.  c. August, 1945]]\n\nIn June 1945, all of her secondary guns and about half of her anti-aircraft armament was moved ashore, together with her rangefinders and [[searchlight]]s. Her crew was accordingly reduced to less than 1,000 officers and enlisted men. On 18 July 1945, the heavily camouflaged ship [[Attack on Yokosuka|was attacked]] by fighter bombers and torpedo bombers from five American carriers as part of Admiral [[William Halsey Jr.]]'s campaign to destroy the IJN's last surviving [[capital ship]]s. ''Nagato'' was hit by two bombs, the first {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb struck the bridge and killed Otsuka, the [[executive officer]], and twelve sailors when it detonated upon hitting the roof of the conning tower. The second 500-pound bomb struck the deck aft of the mainmast and detonated when it hit No. 3 barbette. It failed to damage the barbette or the turret above it, but blew a hole nearly {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} in diameter in the deck above the officer's lounge, killing 21 men and damaging four Type 96 guns on the deck above. A [[dud]] [[rocket]] of uncertain size hit the ship's fantail, but failed to do any significant damage. To convince the Americans that ''Nagato'' had been badly damaged by the attack, her damage was left unrepaired and some of her [[ballast tank]]s were pumped full of seawater to make her sit deeper in the water as if she had sunk to the harbor bottom.<ref name=ha/><ref name=tu/>\n\n[[File:Japanese battleship Nagato at anchor off the Yokosuka Naval Base, circa in September 1945.jpg|thumb|''Nagato'' at Yokosuka, September 1945]]\nCaptain Shuichi Sugino was appointed as ''Nagato''{{'}}s new captain on 24 July, but he was unable to take up his appointment until 20 August. Retired Rear Admiral [[Masamichi Ikeguchi]] was assigned as the ship's interim captain until Sugino arrived. The Yokosuka Naval District received an alarm on the night of 1/2 August that a large convoy was approaching [[Sagami Bay]] and ''Nagato'' was ordered to attack immediately. The ship was totally unprepared for any attack, but Ikeguchi began the necessary preparations. The water in the ballast compartments was pumped out and her crew began reloading the propellant charges for her 16-inch guns. The ship received more fuel from a barge later that morning, but no order to attack ever came as it had been a false alarm.

Completed in 1920 as the [[lead ship]] of [[Nagato-class battleship|her class]], she carried supplies for the survivors of the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] in 1923. The ship was modernized in 1934\u20131936 with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the [[pagoda mast]] style. ''Nagato'' briefly participated in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 and was the [[flagship]] of [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. She covered the withdrawal of the attacking ships and did not participate in the attack itself.\n\nOther than participating in the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942, where she did not see combat, the ship spent most of the first two years of the [[Pacific War]] training in home waters. She was transferred to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in mid-1943, but did not see any combat until the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. ''Nagato'' did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in October. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. ''Nagato'' was converted into a floating [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. [[Attack on Yokosuka|She was attacked in July 1945]] as part of the American campaign to destroy the IJN's last remaining [[capital ship]]s, but was only slightly damaged and went on to be the only Japanese battleship to have survived [[World War II]]. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for [[nuclear weapon]] tests during [[Operation Crossroads]]. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second.\n\n==Description==\n''Nagato'' had a length of {{convert|201.17|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|215.8|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]].

This increased her overall length by {{convert|1.59|m|ftin|sp=us}} to {{convert|217.39|m|ftin|sp=us}}. During her 1934\u20131936 reconstruction, the ship's stern was lengthened by {{convert|7.55|m|ft|sp=us}} to improve her speed and her forward superstructure was rebuilt into a [[pagoda mast]]. She was given [[torpedo bulge]]s to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment. These changes increased her overall length to {{convert|224.94|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, her beam to {{convert|34.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and her draft to {{convert|9.49|m|ftin|sp=us}}. Her displacement increased over {{convert|7000|t|LT|sp=us}} to {{convert|46690|t|LT|sp=us}} at deep load.

In the [[Battle off Samar]], ''Nagato'' engaged the escort carriers and destroyers of [[Task Group]] 77.4.3, codenamed \"Taffy 3\". At 06:01 she opened fire on three escort carriers, the first time she had ever fired her guns at an enemy ship, but missed.

The two battleships were forced 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) away from the engagement before the torpedoes ran out of fuel. Turning back, ''Nagato'' engaged the American escort carriers and their screening ships, claiming to have damaged one [[cruiser]]{{refn|No cruisers were present, only destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s.<ref name=ha/> In the Battle off Samar, Japanese observers misidentified Taffy 3's escort carriers, destroyers and destroyer escorts as larger light carriers, cruisers and destroyers.|group=Note}} with forty-five 410&nbsp;mm and ninety-two 14&nbsp;cm shells. The ineffectiveness of her shooting was the result of the poor visibility caused by numerous rain [[squall]]s and by [[smoke screen]]s laid by the defending escorts. At 09:10 Kurita ordered his ships to break off the engagement and head north. At 10:20 he ordered the fleet south once more, but as they came under increasingly severe air attack he ordered a retreat again at 12:36. At 12:43 ''Nagato'' was hit in the bow by two bombs, but the damage was not severe. Four [[gunner (artillery)|gunners]] were washed overboard at 16:56 as the ship made a sharp turn to avoid dive-bomber attacks; a destroyer was detached to rescue them, but they could not be found. As it retreated back to Brunei on 26 October, the Japanese fleet came under repeated air attacks. ''Nagato'' and ''Yamato'' used ''Sankaidan'' shells against them and claimed to have shot down several bombers. Over the course of the last two days she fired ninety-nine 410&nbsp;mm and six hundred fifty-three 14&nbsp;cm shells, suffering 38 crewmen killed and 105 wounded during the same time.<ref name=ha/>\n\n====Final days of the war====\nOn 15 November the ship was assigned to Battleship Division 3 of the [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|2nd Fleet]]. After an aerial attack at Brunei on 16 November, ''Nagato'', ''Yamato'', and the fast battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kong\u014d||2}} left the following day, bound for Kure. En route, ''Kong\u014d'' and one of the escorting destroyers was sunk by {{USS|Sealion|SS-315|6}} on 21 November. On 25 November, she arrived at [[Yokosuka (city)|Yokosuka]], Japan, for repairs. Lack of fuel and materials meant that she could not be brought back into service and she was turned into a [[floating battery|floating anti-aircraft battery]]. Her funnel and mainmast were removed to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns, which were increased by two Type 89 mounts and nine triple Type 96 gun mounts. Her forward secondary guns were removed in compensation. Captain Kiyomi Shibuya relieved Kobe in command of ''Nagato'' on 25 November. Battleship Division 3 was disbanded on 1 January 1945 and the ship was reassigned to Battleship Division 1. That formation was disbanded on 10 February and she was assigned to the [[Yokosuka Naval District]] as a [[coastal defense ship]].<ref name=ha/> [[wikt:moor|Moored]] alongside a [[pier]], a coal-burning [[donkey boiler]] was installed on the pier for heating and cooking purposes and a converted [[submarine chaser]] was positioned alongside to provide steam and electricity;<ref name=tu>Tully</ref> her anti-aircraft guns lacked full power and were only partially operational. On 20 April, ''Nagato'' was reduced to reserve and retired Rear Admiral [[Miki Otsuka]] assumed command a week later.<ref name=ha/>\n\n[[File:Japanese battleship Nagato at Yokosuka 1945.jpeg|thumb|right|An Avenger flies past ''Nagato'' as she lies at anchor in Yokosuka, probably after the surrender.  c. August, 1945]]\n\nIn June 1945, all of her secondary guns and about half of her anti-aircraft armament was moved ashore, together with her rangefinders and [[searchlight]]s. Her crew was accordingly reduced to less than 1,000 officers and enlisted men. On 18 July 1945, the heavily camouflaged ship [[Attack on Yokosuka|was attacked]] by fighter bombers and torpedo bombers from five American carriers as part of Admiral [[William Halsey Jr.]]'s campaign to destroy the IJN's last surviving [[capital ship]]s. ''Nagato'' was hit by two bombs, the first {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb struck the bridge and killed Otsuka, the [[executive officer]], and twelve sailors when it detonated upon hitting the roof of the conning tower. The second 500-pound bomb struck the deck aft of the mainmast and detonated when it hit No. 3 barbette. It failed to damage the barbette or the turret above it, but blew a hole nearly {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} in diameter in the deck above the officer's lounge, killing 21 men and damaging four Type 96 guns on the deck above. A [[dud]] [[rocket]] of uncertain size hit the ship's fantail, but failed to do any significant damage. To convince the Americans that ''Nagato'' had been badly damaged by the attack, her damage was left unrepaired and some of her [[ballast tank]]s were pumped full of seawater to make her sit deeper in the water as if she had sunk to the harbor bottom.<ref name=ha/><ref name=tu/>\n\n[[File:Japanese battleship Nagato at anchor off the Yokosuka Naval Base, circa in September 1945.jpg|thumb|''Nagato'' at Yokosuka, September 1945]]\nCaptain Shuichi Sugino was appointed as ''Nagato''{{'}}s new captain on 24 July, but he was unable to take up his appointment until 20 August. Retired Rear Admiral [[Masamichi Ikeguchi]] was assigned as the ship's interim captain until Sugino arrived. The Yokosuka Naval District received an alarm on the night of 1/2 August that a large convoy was approaching [[Sagami Bay]] and ''Nagato'' was ordered to attack immediately. The ship was totally unprepared for any attack, but Ikeguchi began the necessary preparations. The water in the ballast compartments was pumped out and her crew began reloading the propellant charges for her 16-inch guns. The ship received more fuel from a barge later that morning, but no order to attack ever came as it had been a false alarm.

For Test Baker, an [[underwater explosion]], the ship was positioned {{convert|950|yd|m|order=flip|sp=us}} from ground zero. ''Nagato'' rode out the [[tsunami]] from the explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated.
