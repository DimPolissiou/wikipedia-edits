A new campus was launched in Tashkent in autumn 2019. Each year about 8,000 students from Russia and abroad study at MGIMO University.\n\nMGIMO is a centre for the Russian-French Trianon [https://dialogue-trianon.ru/ Dialogue], the Russian-Czech Discussion Forum, the Russian-Austrian forum Sochi Dialogue, ASEAN Centre. \n\n==History==\nMGIMO was founded on 14 October 1944 by a special decree of the Soviet Government on the basis of the recently established School of International Relations of the [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]]. The first 200 students were veterans who had survived in the Second World War and were determined to build international peace and stability.\n\nBy early 1950s, MGIMO comprised three schools, since its ancestor, the School of History and International Relations was added by the School of International Law and the School of International Economic Relations. In 1954 the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, one of the oldest Russian institutes and the successor of the [[Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages]] created in 1815, was integrated into MGIMO.\n\nIn 1958, MGIMO incorporated one more university \u2013 of Foreign Trade \u2013 and became the national leader of education and expertise in International Relations.\n\nIn 1969 the School of Journalism and the School of Law were added to the scope of education and research fields.\n\nIn the second half of 1980s MGIMO became a fully open institution. In 1989, admission on a commercial basis started and first students from Western countries began to arrive. In the late 1980s, MGIMO became the first national university to establish its own business school that later in 2012 emerged as the School of Business and International Proficiency.\n\n1992 saw the creation of the School of International Business and Business Administration.\n\nIn 1994 MGIMO was granted university status but traditionally contains the word ''institute'' in its name. The same year saw the creation of the International Institute of Administration.

The first 200 students were veterans who had survived in the Second World War and were determined to build international peace and stability.\n\nBy early 1950s, MGIMO comprised three schools, since its ancestor, the School of History and International Relations was added by the School of International Law and the School of International Economic Relations. In 1954 the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, one of the oldest Russian institutes and the successor of the [[Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages]] created in 1815, was integrated into MGIMO.\n\nIn 1958, MGIMO incorporated one more university \u2013 of Foreign Trade \u2013 and became the national leader of education and expertise in International Relations.\n\nIn 1969 the School of Journalism and the School of Law were added to the scope of education and research fields.\n\nIn the second half of 1980s MGIMO became a fully open institution. In 1989, admission on a commercial basis started and first students from Western countries began to arrive. In the late 1980s, MGIMO became the first national university to establish its own business school that later in 2012 emerged as the School of Business and International Proficiency.\n\n1992 saw the creation of the School of International Business and Business Administration.\n\nIn 1994 MGIMO was granted university status but traditionally contains the word ''institute'' in its name. The same year saw the creation of the International Institute of Administration. The same year a Department of Politics was introduced within the School of International Relations and evolved into the separate School of Political Science in 1998.\n\nThe next decade saw the further buildup of reforms and improvement of educational quality, including newly opened schools and Master programs with the number of partnering universities abroad. In 2000, two educational divisions were established - Institute of Energy Policy and Diplomacy and School of Applied Economics and Commerce. In 2005, the European Studies Institute was opened on MGIMO basis.\n\nIn 2011, the Institute for Foreign Economic Relations was transformed into the School of Applied Economics and Commerce.
