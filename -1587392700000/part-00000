It stars [[Sam Neill]], [[Julie Carmen]], [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Charlton Heston]]. Informally, the film is the third installment in Carpenter's ''Apocalypse Trilogy'', preceded by ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/2/3279482/the-classics-john-carpenter-apocalypse-trilogy|title=The Classics: John Carpenter's 'Apocalypse Trilogy'|last=Topolsky|first=Joshua|date=2012-09-02|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn the midst of an unspecified disaster, Dr. Wrenn ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) visits John Trent ([[Sam Neill]]), a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and Trent recounts his story:\n\nTrent, a freelance insurance investigator, has lunch with a colleague, the owner of an insurance company, who asks Trent to work on his largest insured: investigating a claim by New York-based Arcane Publishing. During their conversation, Trent is attacked by a man wielding an axe who, after asking him if he reads Sutter Cane, is shot dead by a police officer before he can harm Trent. The man was Cane's agent, who went insane and killed his family after reading one of Cane's books.\n\nTrent meets with Arcane Publishing director, Jackson Harglow ([[Charlton Heston]]), who tasks him with investigating the disappearance of popular horror novelist, Sutter Cane ([[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]]), and recovering the manuscript for Cane's final novel. He assigns Cane's editor, Linda Styles ([[Julie Carmen]]), to accompany him. Linda explains that Cane's stories have been known to cause disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in \"less stable readers\". Trent is skeptical, convinced the disappearance is a publicity stunt. Trent notices red lines on the covers of Cane's books, which, when aligned properly, form the outline of [[New Hampshire]] and mark a location alluded to be Hobb's End, the fictional setting for many of Cane's works.\n\nThey set out to find the town. Linda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late night drive, and they inexplicably arrive at Hobb's End in daylight. Trent and Linda search the small town, encountering people and landmarks described as fictional in Cane's novels. Trent believes it all to be staged, but Linda disagrees. She admits to Trent that Arcane Publishing's claim was a stunt to promote Cane's book, but the time distortion and exact replica of Hobb's End were not part of the plan.\n\nLinda enters a church to confront Cane, who exposes her to his final novel, ''In the Mouth of Madness'', which drives her insane; she begins embracing and kissing Cane passionately. A man ([[Wilhelm von Homburg]]) approaches Trent in a bar and warns him to leave, then commits suicide. Outside the bar, a mob of monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon him. Trent drives away from Hobb's End, but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town. After crashing his car, Trent awakens inside the church with Linda, where Cane explains that the public's belief in his stories freed an ancient race of monstrous beings which will reclaim the Earth. Cane reveals that Trent is merely one of his characters, who must follow Cane's plot and return the manuscript of ''In The Mouth of Madness'' to Arcane Publishing, furthering the end of humanity.\n\nAfter giving Trent the manuscript, Cane tears his face open, creating a portal to the dimension of Cane's monstrous masters. Trent sees a long tunnel that Cane said would take him back to his world, and urges Linda to come with him. She tells him she can't, because she has already read the entire book. Trent races down the hall, with Cane's monsters close on his heels. He trips and falls, then suddenly finds himself lying on a country road, apparently back in reality. During his return to New York, Trent destroys the manuscript. Back at Arcane Publishing, Trent relates his experience to Harglow. Harglow claims ignorance of Linda; Trent was sent alone to find Cane, and the manuscript was delivered months earlier. ''In the Mouth of Madness'' has been on sale for weeks, with a [[Novel adaptation|film adaptation]] in [[post production]]. Trent encounters a reader of the newly released novel, who is bleeding from his altered eyes, and murders him with an axe, being arrested for murder and sent to the asylum.\n\nAfter Trent finishes telling his story, Dr. Wrenn judges it a meaningless hallucination. Trent wakes the following day to find the asylum abandoned. He departs as a radio announces that the world has been overrun with monstrous creatures, including mutating humans, and that outbreaks of suicide and mass murder are commonplace. Trent goes to see the ''In the Mouth of Madness'' film and discovers that he is the main character. As he watches his previous actions play out on screen, including a scene where he insisted to Linda \"This is reality!\" Trent begins laughing hysterically before breaking down crying; finally realizing he was a character in the book all along.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material.

P. Lovecraft]], with many references to his stories and themes. Its title is a play on Lovecraft's novella, ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', and [[insanity]] plays as great a role in the film as it does in Lovecraft's fiction. The opening scene depicts Trent's confinement to an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]], with the bulk of the story told in [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]], a common technique of Lovecraft. Reference is made to Lovecraftian settings and details (such as a character that shares the name of Lovecraft's [[Pickman's Model|Pickman]] family).  Sutter Cane's novels have similar titles to H.P. Lovecraft stories : ''The Whisperer of the Dark'' (''The Whisperer in Darkness''), ''The Thing in the Basement'' (''The Thing on the Doorstep''), ''Haunter out of Time'' (''The Haunter of the Dark''/''The Shadow Out of Time''), and ''The Hobbs End Horror'' (''The Dunwich Horror''), the latter also referencing Hobbs End underground station from [[Nigel Kneale]]'s ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]''.\n\nThe film can also be seen as a reference to [[Stephen King]], who, like Lovecraft, writes horror fiction set in New England hamlets.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://secure.deseretnews.com/movies/review/1,5208,864,00.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20121217130116/https://secure.deseretnews.com/movies/review/1,5208,864,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-12-17 | title=Deseret News: In the Mouth of Madness Review | author=Chris Hicks | date=1995-02-07 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | publisher=Deseret News }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/inthemou.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213236/http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/inthemou.html |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Box office===\n''In the Mouth of Madness'' was released in December 1994 in Italy, and on February 3, 1995 in the U.S. For its worldwide release, In The Mouth Of Madness opened at the #4 spot and grossed $3,441,807 on 1,510 theaters in its first weekend.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a mixed two-out-of-four stars, complimenting Neill's acting and Carpenter's work as a director, but ultimately said the film fell flat due to its screenplay, saying \"...one wonders how ''In the Mouth of Madness'' might have turned out if the script had contained even just a little more wit and ambition\". [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film the same rating, as did [[James Berardinelli]], who said the film \"comes close to doing something interesting but gets cold feet\" and is \"confusing, weird, and not very involving\", comparing the film to buying an exotic sports car owned only to be driven slowly. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a C+ rating.\n\nIn negative reviews, Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said the film was \"cheesy horror celebrating the power of cheesy horror, while pretending to be appalled\" and gave the film a one-out-of-four star rating. Fred Topel of [[About.com]] said the film was \"too confusing\" and \"hard to follow\", giving the film a one-out-of-five rating. In fully positive reviews from the time period, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave it an A, calling it \"a thinking person's horror picture that dares to be as cerebral as it is visceral\", later listing the film as one of the best of 1995.  [[Seattle Times]] also gave the film a very positive review, saying \"in a horror scene oversatured with flashy surface-floating images that only serve to briefly shock, Carpenter has the audacity to create a genuinely horrifying concept that dives beneath the surface and brings back a story that will stick with its audiences like a bloody adhesive.\" In a later review, [[Chris Stuckmann]] also awarded the film with an A, noting its ambition, creativity, and originality alongside Carpenter's direction. Reel Film Reviews gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating.\n\nAs with most of Carpenter's work, ''In The Mouth Of Madness'' has received a cult following and has gained more positive reviews in the years following its initial release. Stuckmann wrote that he believes the film would've done significantly better if released today, saying \"it fits right in with most indie horror films of the last five years\" and also noted this film's influence on modern horror. Director [[Ari Aster]] said ''In The Mouth Of Madness'' was one of the most influential films to his style and one of his favorite films.\n\nFrench magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'' listed the film as #10 on their 1995 Top 10 List.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top lists Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html#y1995|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|accessdate=10 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html#y1995|archive-date=27 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It stars [[Sam Neill]], [[Julie Carmen]], [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Charlton Heston]]. Informally, the film is the third installment in Carpenter's ''Apocalypse Trilogy'', preceded by ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/2/3279482/the-classics-john-carpenter-apocalypse-trilogy|title=The Classics: John Carpenter's 'Apocalypse Trilogy'|last=Topolsky|first=Joshua|date=2012-09-02|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn the midst of an unspecified disaster, Dr. Wrenn ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) visits John Trent ([[Sam Neill]]), a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and Trent recounts his story:\n\nTrent, a freelance insurance investigator, has lunch with a colleague, the owner of an insurance company, who asks Trent to work on his largest insured: investigating a claim by New York-based Arcane Publishing. During their conversation, Trent is attacked by a man wielding an axe who, after asking him if he reads Sutter Cane, is shot dead by a police officer before he can harm Trent. The man was Cane's agent, who went insane and killed his family after reading one of Cane's books.\n\nTrent meets with Arcane Publishing director, Jackson Harglow ([[Charlton Heston]]), who tasks him with investigating the disappearance of popular horror novelist, Sutter Cane ([[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]]), and recovering the manuscript for Cane's final novel. He assigns Cane's editor, Linda Styles ([[Julie Carmen]]), to accompany him. Linda explains that Cane's stories have been known to cause disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in \"less stable readers\". Trent is skeptical, convinced the disappearance is a publicity stunt. Trent notices red lines on the covers of Cane's books, which, when aligned properly, form the outline of [[New Hampshire]] and mark a location alluded to be Hobb's End, the fictional setting for many of Cane's works.\n\nThey set out to find the town. Linda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late night drive, and they inexplicably arrive at Hobb's End in daylight. Trent and Linda search the small town, encountering people and landmarks described as fictional in Cane's novels. Trent believes it all to be staged, but Linda disagrees. She admits to Trent that Arcane Publishing's claim was a stunt to promote Cane's book, but the time distortion and exact replica of Hobb's End were not part of the plan.\n\nLinda enters a church to confront Cane, who exposes her to his final novel, ''In the Mouth of Madness'', which drives her insane; she begins embracing and kissing Cane passionately. A man ([[Wilhelm von Homburg]]) approaches Trent in a bar and warns him to leave, then commits suicide. Outside the bar, a mob of monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon him. Trent drives away from Hobb's End, but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town. After crashing his car, Trent awakens inside the church with Linda, where Cane explains that the public's belief in his stories freed an ancient race of monstrous beings which will reclaim the Earth. Cane reveals that Trent is merely one of his characters, who must follow Cane's plot and return the manuscript of ''In The Mouth of Madness'' to Arcane Publishing, furthering the end of humanity.\n\nAfter giving Trent the manuscript, Cane tears his face open, creating a portal to the dimension of Cane's monstrous masters. Trent sees a long tunnel that Cane said would take him back to his world, and urges Linda to come with him. She tells him she can't, because she has already read the entire book. Trent races down the hall, with Cane's monsters close on his heels. He trips and falls, then suddenly finds himself lying on a country road, apparently back in reality. During his return to New York, Trent destroys the manuscript. Back at Arcane Publishing, Trent relates his experience to Harglow. Harglow claims ignorance of Linda; Trent was sent alone to find Cane, and the manuscript was delivered months earlier. ''In the Mouth of Madness'' has been on sale for weeks, with a [[Novel adaptation|film adaptation]] in [[post production]]. Trent encounters a reader of the newly released novel, who is bleeding from his altered eyes, and murders him with an axe, being arrested for murder and sent to the asylum.\n\nAfter Trent finishes telling his story, Dr. Wrenn judges it a meaningless hallucination. Trent wakes the following day to find the asylum abandoned. He departs as a radio announces that the world has been overrun with monstrous creatures, including mutating humans, and that outbreaks of suicide and mass murder are commonplace. Trent goes to see the ''In the Mouth of Madness'' film and discovers that he is the main character. As he watches his previous actions play out on screen, including a scene where he insisted to Linda \"This is reality!\" Trent begins laughing hysterically before breaking down crying; finally realizing he was a character in the book all along.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material.

P. Lovecraft]], with many references to his stories and themes. Its title is a play on Lovecraft's novella, ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', and [[insanity]] plays as great a role in the film as it does in Lovecraft's fiction. The opening scene depicts Trent's confinement to an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]], with the bulk of the story told in [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]], a common technique of Lovecraft. Reference is made to Lovecraftian settings and details (such as a character that shares the name of Lovecraft's [[Pickman's Model|Pickman]] family).  Sutter Cane's novels have similar titles to H.P. Lovecraft stories : ''The Whisperer of the Dark'' (''The Whisperer in Darkness''), ''The Thing in the Basement'' (''The Thing on the Doorstep''), ''Haunter out of Time'' (''The Haunter of the Dark''/''The Shadow Out of Time''), and ''The Hobbs End Horror'' (''The Dunwich Horror''), the latter also referencing Hobbs End underground station from [[Nigel Kneale]]'s ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]''.\n\nThe film can also be seen as a reference to [[Stephen King]], who, like Lovecraft, writes horror fiction set in New England hamlets.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://secure.deseretnews.com/movies/review/1,5208,864,00.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20121217130116/https://secure.deseretnews.com/movies/review/1,5208,864,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-12-17 | title=Deseret News: In the Mouth of Madness Review | author=Chris Hicks | date=1995-02-07 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | publisher=Deseret News }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/inthemou.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213236/http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/inthemou.html |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Box office===\n''In the Mouth of Madness'' was released in December 1994 in Italy, and on February 3, 1995 in the U.S. For its worldwide release, In The Mouth Of Madness opened at the #4 spot and grossed $3,441,807 on 1,510 theaters in its first weekend.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a mixed two-out-of-four stars, complimenting Neill's acting and Carpenter's work as a director, but ultimately said the film fell flat due to its screenplay, saying \"...one wonders how ''In the Mouth of Madness'' might have turned out if the script had contained even just a little more wit and ambition\". [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film the same rating, as did [[James Berardinelli]], who said the film \"comes close to doing something interesting but gets cold feet\" and is \"confusing, weird, and not very involving\", comparing the film to buying an exotic sports car owned only to be driven slowly. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a C+ rating.\n\nIn negative reviews, Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said the film was \"cheesy horror celebrating the power of cheesy horror, while pretending to be appalled\" and gave the film a one-out-of-four star rating. Fred Topel of [[About.com]] said the film was \"too confusing\" and \"hard to follow\", giving the film a one-out-of-five rating. In fully positive reviews from the time period, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave it an A, calling it \"a thinking person's horror picture that dares to be as cerebral as it is visceral\", later listing the film as one of the best of 1995.  [[Seattle Times]] also gave the film a very positive review, saying \"in a horror scene oversatured with flashy surface-floating images that only serve to briefly shock, Carpenter has the audacity to create a genuinely horrifying concept that dives beneath the surface and brings back a story that will stick with its audiences like a bloody adhesive.\" In a later review, [[Chris Stuckmann]] also awarded the film with an A, noting its ambition, creativity, and originality alongside Carpenter's direction. Reel Film Reviews gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating.\n\nAs with most of Carpenter's work, ''In The Mouth Of Madness'' has received a cult following and has gained more positive reviews in the years following its initial release. Stuckmann wrote that he believes the film would've done significantly better if released today, saying \"it fits right in with most indie horror films of the last five years\" and also noted this film's influence on modern horror. Director [[Ari Aster]] said ''In The Mouth Of Madness'' was one of the most influential films to his style and one of his favorite films.\n\nFrench magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'' listed the film as #10 on their 1995 Top 10 List.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top lists Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html#y1995|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|accessdate=10 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html#y1995|archive-date=27 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

His most famous works include the early satires ''[[Decline and Fall]]'' (1928) and ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'' (1934), the novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1945), and the Second World War trilogy ''[[Sword of Honour]]'' (1952\u20131961). He is recognised as one of the great prose stylists of the English language in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ2yCQAAQBAJ |title=The Vocation of Evelyn Waugh: Faith and Art in the Post-War Fiction |last=DeCoste |first=Mr D.

He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for [[country house]] society. He travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] at the time of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|1935 Italian invasion]]. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the [[Royal Marines]] and then in the [[Royal Horse Guards]]. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.\n\nWaugh converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]]. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the [[welfare state]] culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1981).\n\n==Family background==\n[[File:Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn|Lord Cockburn]], the Scottish judge, was one of Waugh's great-great-grandfathers.]]\nArthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903<ref>Eade, p.

Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an [[Military officer|officer]], and, while awaiting confirmation of his [[Commission (document)|commission]], wrote ''The Loom of Youth'' (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne.

A letter written that year to a Lancing friend, [[Dudley Carew]], hints at severe emotional pressures: \"I have been living very intensely these last three weeks.

I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened\".<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 12</ref> He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921\u201322 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.<ref>Hastings, p. 112</ref>\n\nBack at home,  Waugh began a novel, ''[[The Temple at Thatch]]'', and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, ''The Scarlet Woman'', which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for [[Kenya]], Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, [[Heatherley School of Fine Art|Heatherley's]].<ref name= S93>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 93\u201396</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Teaching and writing===\n[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], the subject of Waugh's first full-length book (1927)]]\nWaugh began at Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 210\u201312</ref> He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[North Wales]], beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, ''The Temple at Thatch'', intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.<ref>Hastings, pp. 116\u201334</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in [[Pisa]], Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer [[Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff]], who was engaged on the English translations of [[Marcel Proust]]'s works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left [[North Wales]], he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 112</ref> The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea.

By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500.<ref>Hastings, pp. 180\u201382</ref> In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted [[pneumonia]] and was carried ashore to the British hospital in [[Port Said]]. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, [[John Heygate]], had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929.

The case was heard by an [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical tribunal]] in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936.<ref>Hastings, pp. 290\u201393</ref> In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert.<ref>Byrne, pp. 240\u201341</ref> He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936.<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 103\u201305</ref> There were initial misgivings from the [[Herbert family|Herberts]], an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the [[Church of our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, Westminster|Church of the Assumption]] in Warwick Street, London.<ref>Byrne, pp. 260\u201361</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p6634.htm|title=Person Page|website=thepeerage.com|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a wedding present the bride's grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near [[Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire|Stinchcombe]] in Gloucestershire.<ref>Hastings, pp. 358\u201359</ref> The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, [[Auberon Waugh|Auberon Alexander]], on 17 November 1939.<ref>Hastings, pp. 336 and 392</ref> Between these events, ''Scoop'' was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim.<ref>Stannard, Vol. i pp. 470\u201371</ref> In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to [[Mexico]] after which he wrote ''[[Robbery Under Law]]'', based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing \"little with travel and much with political questions\".<ref>Sykes, p. 184</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Royal Marine and commando===\nWaugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] and moved his young family to [[Pixton Park]] in [[Somerset]], the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment.<ref>Hastings, pp. 384\u201386</ref> He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration,<ref>Sykes, pp. 273\u201376</ref> but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the [[Royal Marines]] in December and entered training at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] naval base.<ref>Hastings, pp. 391\u201392</ref> He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as ''Work Suspended and Other Stories'' (1943).<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 490\u2013501</ref>\n\nWaugh's daily training routine left him with \"so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II, p. 2</ref> In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and given command of a [[company (military unit)|company]] of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 9</ref> Even after the [[Battle of France|German invasion of the Low Countries]] (10 May \u2013 22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 15</ref> Waugh's inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion's Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the [[Battle of Dakar]] in West Africa (23\u201325 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the [[Free French Forces]] to overthrow the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonial government and install General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town's defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh's comment on the affair was this: \"Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.\"<ref name= Stannard16>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 16\u201320</ref><ref>Amory (ed.), p. 141</ref>\n\nIn November 1940, Waugh was posted to a [[commando]] unit, and, after further training, became a member of \"[[Layforce]]\", under Colonel (later Brigadier) [[Robert Laycock]].<ref name= Stannard16/> In February 1941, the unit sailed to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture [[Bardia]], on the Libyan coast.<ref>Hastings, pp. 421\u201322</ref> In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of [[Crete]]: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops.<ref>Sykes, pp. 215\u201316</ref> In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote ''[[Put Out More Flags]]'' (1942), a novel of the war's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s.<ref>Patey, p. 171</ref> Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the [[Royal Horse Guards]], on Laycock's recommendation.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 66\u201367</ref> On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple's fourth child.<ref>Hastings, p. 442</ref>{{refn|Earlier, Laura had borne a daughter, christened Mary, on 1 December 1940, but she lived only a few hours.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 24</ref>|group= n}}\n\n===Frustration, ''Brideshead'' and Yugoslavia===\nWaugh's elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of [[Operation Husky]] (9 July \u2013 17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 445\u201346</ref> Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier.<ref>Sykes, pp. 229\u201330</ref> After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], Waugh began parachute training at [[Tatton Park]], Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a [[fibula]]. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for [[Chagford]], Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was ''[[Brideshead Revisited|Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder]]'' (1945),<ref>Hastings, pp. 454\u201362</ref> the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer [[Douglas Lane Patey]] commented that it was \"the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation\".<ref>Patey, p. 296</ref>\n\nWaugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by [[Randolph Churchill]] to serve in a military mission to [[Yugoslavia]], and, early in July, flew with Churchill from [[Bari]], Italy, to the Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. There, they met [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]], the Communist leader of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]], who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces with Allied support.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 113\u201314</ref> Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 116\u201321</ref>\n\nThe mission eventually arrived at [[Topusko]], where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group's liaison duties, between the [[British Army]] and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and would fare worse when the Communists took control.<ref>Hastings, pp. 468\u201373</ref> He expressed those thoughts in a long report, \"Church and State in Liberated Croatia\". After spells in [[Dubrovnik]] and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.<ref>Hastings, pp. 485\u201391</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n\n===Fame and fortune===\n''Brideshead Revisited'' was published in London in May 1945.<ref name= Hastings494>Hastings, pp. 494\u201395</ref> Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, \"my first novel rather than my last\".<ref>Patey, p. 224</ref> It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status.<ref name= Hastings494/> Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of [[Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]] by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as \"a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts\".<ref>Gallagher (ed.), pp. 289\u201390</ref> Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of [[Winston Churchill]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he saw the accession to power of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new \"Dark Age\".<ref name= Hastings494/>\n[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]], the subject of Waugh's 1950 novel]]\n\nIn September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944)<ref>Hastings, pp. 462 and 494\u201397</ref> but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the [[Nuremberg trials]], and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of [[Francisco de Vitoria]], said to be the founder of [[international law]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 168</ref> Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, ''[[Scott-King's Modern Europe]]''.<ref name= Patey251>Patey, p. 251</ref> In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of ''Brideshead''. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn cemetery]], which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, ''[[The Loved One]]''.<ref name= StannardODNB/> In 1951 he visited the [[Holy Land]] with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes,<ref>Sykes, pp. 338\u201342</ref> and in 1953, he travelled to [[Goa]] to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest [[Francis Xavier]].<ref name= Hastings554>Hastings, p. 554</ref><ref>Waugh's article on the Goa visit, \"Goa, the Home of s Saint\" is reprinted in Gallager (ed.), pp. 448\u201356</ref>\n\nIn between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on ''[[Helena (1950 novel)|Helena]]'', a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the [[True Cross]] that was \"far the best book I have ever written or ever will write\". Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, \"the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud\".<ref>Patey, p. 289</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Waugh published ''[[Men at Arms (Evelyn Waugh)|Men at Arms]]'', the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 5, 82, 340</ref> Other books published during this period included ''[[When The Going Was Good]]'' (1946),<ref name= Patey251/> an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, ''The Holy Places'' (published by the [[Ian Fleming]]-managed [[Queen Anne Press]], 1952) and ''[[Love Among the Ruins. A Romance of the Near Future|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1953), a [[dystopia]]n tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world.<ref>Hastings, p. 553</ref> Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, \"selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible\" and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.<ref>Hastings, pp. 531 and 537</ref>\n\nFrom 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector of objects, particularly Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London's [[Portobello Market]] and from house clearance sales.<ref name= P153/> His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to [[Gloucester]], where he bought \"a lion of wood, finely carved for \u00a325, also a bookcase \u00a335&nbsp;... a charming Chinese painting \u00a310, a Regency easel \u00a37\".<ref>Davie (ed.), p. 658</ref> Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid \u00a310 for Rossetti's \"Spirit of the Rainbow\" to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value. Waugh also began, from 1949, to write knowledgeable reviews and articles on the subject of painting.<ref name= P153>Patey, pp. 153\u201354</ref>{{refn|See, for example, \"Rossetti Revisited\", 1949 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 377\u201379; \"Age of Unrest\", 1954 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 459\u201360; \"The Death of Painting\", 1956 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 503\u201307|group= n}}\n\n===Breakdown===\nBy 1953, Waugh's popularity as a writer was declining. He was perceived as out of step with the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available.<ref name= Hastings554/> His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, ''[[Officers and Gentlemen]]'', had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating.<ref>Patey, p. 324</ref> Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 415</ref> [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\".<ref>{{cite news|last= Brown|first= Mark|title= Waugh at the BBC: \"the most ill-natured interview ever\" on CD after 55 years\"|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/15/bbc.radio|journal= The Guardian|date= 15 April 2008|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1954, Waugh's doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of \"other passengers whispering about me\" and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], Stephen Black. He left the ship in [[Egypt]] and flew on to [[Colombo]], but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him.<ref>Patey, p. 325</ref> Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, [[Frances Donaldson]], whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from [[bromism|bromide poisoning]] from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared.<ref>Donaldson, pp. 56\u201361</ref> Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: \"Clean off my onion!\". The experience was  fictionalised a few years later, in ''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold]]'' (1957).<ref>Patey, pp. 326, 338\u201341</ref>\n\nIn 1956, [[Edwin Newman]] made a short film about Waugh. In the course of it, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refused to drive or use the telephone, and wrote with an old-fashioned [[dip pen]]. He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of [[whisky]], and that every American had been divorced at least once.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edwin |last=Newman |authorlink=Edwin Newman |title=Strictly Speaking: will America be the death of English? |url=https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm |url-access=registration |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm/page/134 134] }}</ref>\n\n===Late works===\n[[File:Combe Florey - near the Old Manor House - geograph.org.uk - 904793.jpg|thumb|left|[[Combe Florey]], the village in Somerset to which Waugh and his family moved in 1956]]\nRestored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished ''Officers and Gentlemen''. In June 1955 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist and reviewer [[Nancy Spain]], accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for ''The Spectator'',<ref>\"Awake, My Soul, It Is a Lord\", published in ''The Spectator'', 8 July 1955, reprinted in Gallagher, (ed.), pp. 468\u201370</ref> but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 636</ref> Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of [[Combe Florey]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 385\u201386</ref> In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the ''Express'' and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.<ref>Stannard, pp. 382\u201383</ref>\n\n''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold|Gilbert Pinfold]]'' was published in the summer of 1957, \"my barmy book\", Waugh called it.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 477</ref> The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate.<ref name= Patey339>Patey, pp. 339\u201341</ref> Waugh's next major book was a biography of his longtime friend [[Ronald Knox]], the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in [[Cyprus]]. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter's return to Britain. The critic and [[biography in literature|literary biographer]] David Wykes called Waugh's sang-froid \"astonishing\" and the family's apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.<ref>Wykes, p. 194</ref>\n\nAlthough most of Waugh's books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life.<ref name= H591/> In 1950, as a means of [[tax avoidance]], he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the \"Save the Children Fund\", after the [[Save the Children|well-established charity of that name]]) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books.<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 254\u201355</ref> He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]'' series conducted by [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]]. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer [[Selina Hastings (writer)|Selena Hastings]], Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a \"pose of world-weary boredom\".<ref name= H591>Hastings, pp. 591\u201392</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 415\u201316</ref> In September, he produced his final travel book, ''[[A Tourist in Africa]]'', based on a visit made in January\u2013March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but \"despised\" the book. The critic [[Cyril Connolly]] called it \"the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken\".<ref>Patey, pp. 346\u201347</ref> The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as ''Unconditional Surrender''.<ref>Hastings, pp. 594\u201398</ref>\n\n===Decline and death===\n[[File:Evelyn Waugh Grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Waugh's grave in Combe Florey, adjacent to but not within the Anglican churchyard.]]\nAs he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, \"fat, deaf, short of breath\", according to Patey.<ref>Patey, p. 359</ref> His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of \"an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 477</ref> In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story ''Basil Seal Rides Again''.

Waugh's agent, A. D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount,<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 485</ref> but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography.

He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for [[country house]] society. He travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] at the time of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|1935 Italian invasion]]. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the [[Royal Marines]] and then in the [[Royal Horse Guards]]. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.\n\nWaugh converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]]. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the [[welfare state]] culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1981).\n\n==Family background==\n[[File:Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn|Lord Cockburn]], the Scottish judge, was one of Waugh's great-great-grandfathers.]]\nArthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903<ref>Eade, p.

Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an [[Military officer|officer]], and, while awaiting confirmation of his [[Commission (document)|commission]], wrote ''The Loom of Youth'' (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne.

However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921\u201322 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.<ref>Hastings, p. 112</ref>\n\nBack at home,  Waugh began a novel, ''[[The Temple at Thatch]]'', and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, ''The Scarlet Woman'', which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for [[Kenya]], Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, [[Heatherley School of Fine Art|Heatherley's]].<ref name= S93>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 93\u201396</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Teaching and writing===\n[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], the subject of Waugh's first full-length book (1927)]]\nWaugh began at Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 210\u201312</ref> He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[North Wales]], beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, ''The Temple at Thatch'', intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.<ref>Hastings, pp. 116\u201334</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in [[Pisa]], Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer [[Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff]], who was engaged on the English translations of [[Marcel Proust]]'s works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left [[North Wales]], he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 112</ref> The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 228\u201330</ref>\n\nDuring the following two years Waugh taught at schools in [[Aston Clinton]] (from which he was dismissed for the attempted drunken seduction of a school matron) and [[Notting Hill]] in London.<ref>Hastings, pp. 148\u201349</ref> He considered alternative careers in printing or cabinet-making, and attended evening classes in carpentry at Holborn Polytechnic while continuing to write.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 145\u201347</ref> A short story, \"The Balance\", written in an experimental [[modernist literature|modernist]] style, became his first commercially published fiction, when it was included by Chapman and Hall in a 1926 anthology, ''Georgian Stories''.<ref>Patey, pp. 19\u201320</ref> An extended essay on the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] was printed privately by Alastair Graham, using by agreement the press of the [[Shakespeare Head Press]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], where he was undergoing training as a printer.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 505</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Doyle |first=Paul A. |title=Some Unpublished Waugh Correspondence III |url=http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/EWN5-1.htm |journal=Evelyn Waugh Newsletter |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1971 |accessdate=17 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610021305/http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/EWN5-1.htm |archivedate=10 June 2011 }}</ref> This led to a contract from the publishers [[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Duckworths]] for a full-length biography of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], which Waugh wrote during 1927.<ref name= Sykes73>Sykes, pp. 73\u201375</ref> He also began working on a [[comic novel]]; after several temporary working titles this became ''[[Decline and Fall]]''.<ref>Waugh diaries, 3 and 4 September 1927: Davie (ed.), p. 289</ref><ref name= Hastings168>Hastings, pp. 168\u201370</ref> Having given up teaching, he had no regular employment except for a short, unsuccessful stint as a reporter on the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in April\u2013May 1927.<ref>Sykes, pp. 72\u201373</ref> That year he met (possibly through his brother [[Alec Waugh|Alec]]) and fell in love with [[Evelyn Gardner]], the daughter of [[Herbert Gardner, 1st Baron Burghclere|Lord and Lady Burghclere]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 152\u201353</ref>\n\n====\"He-Evelyn\" and \"She-Evelyn\"====\n[[File:069 Canonbury Square.jpg|thumb|upright|Canonbury Square, where Waugh and Evelyn Gardner lived during their brief marriage]]\nIn December 1927, Waugh and Evelyn Gardner became engaged, despite the opposition of Lady Burghclere, who felt that Waugh lacked moral fibre and kept unsuitable company.<ref>Hastings, pp. 164\u201365</ref> Among their friends, they quickly became known as \"He-Evelyn\" and \"She-Evelyn\".<ref name= StannardODNB/> Waugh was at this time dependent on a \u00a34-a-week allowance from his father and the small sums he could earn from book reviewing and journalism.<ref>Hastings, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Rossetti biography was published to a generally favourable reception in April 1928: [[J. C. Squire]] in ''The Observer'' praised the book's elegance and wit; Acton gave cautious approval; and the novelist [[Rebecca West]] wrote to express how much she had enjoyed the book. Less pleasing to Waugh was the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''{{'}}s references to him as \"Miss Waugh\".<ref name= Hastings168/>\n\nWhen ''Decline and Fall'' was completed, Duckworths objected to its \"obscenity\", but Chapman and Hall agreed to publish it.<ref>Sykes, p. 84</ref> This was sufficient for Waugh and Gardner to bring forward their wedding plans. They were married in St Paul's Church, Portman Square, on 27 June 1928, with only Acton, Alec Waugh and the bride's friend [[Lady Pansy Lamb|Pansy Pakenham]] present.<ref>Hastings, pp. 175\u201376</ref> The couple made their home in a small flat in Canonbury Square, [[Islington]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 157</ref> The first months of the marriage were overshadowed by a lack of money, and by Gardner's poor health, which persisted into the autumn.<ref>Hastings, pp. 177\u201379</ref>\n\nIn September 1928, ''Decline and Fall'' was published to almost unanimous praise. By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500.<ref>Hastings, pp. 180\u201382</ref> In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted [[pneumonia]] and was carried ashore to the British hospital in [[Port Said]]. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, [[John Heygate]], had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during the process for the [[annulment]] of their marriage a few years later.<ref>Davie (ed.), pp. 305\u201306</ref>\n\n==Novelist and journalist==\n\n===Recognition===\nWaugh's first biographer, [[Christopher Sykes (author)|Christopher Sykes]], records that after the divorce friends \"saw, or believed they saw, a new hardness and bitterness\" in Waugh's outlook.<ref>Sykes, p. 96</ref> Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he \"did not know it was possible to be so miserable and live\",<ref name= Amory39>Amory (ed.), p. 39</ref> he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, ''[[Vile Bodies]]'',<ref name= Patey33/> and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on the meaning of the marriage ceremony.<ref name= Amory39/> During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.<ref name= Patey33/>\n\n''Vile Bodies'', a satire on the [[Bright Young People]] of the 1920s, was published on 19 January 1930 and was Waugh's first major commercial success. Despite its quasi-biblical title, the book is dark, bitter, \"a manifesto of disillusionment\", according to biographer Martin Stannard.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 203\u201304</ref> As a best-selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism.<ref name= Patey33>Patey, pp. 33\u201334</ref> Amid regular work for ''[[The Graphic]]'', ''[[Town and Country (magazine)|Town and Country]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', he quickly wrote ''Labels'', a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She-Evelyn.<ref name= Patey33/>\n\n===Conversion to Catholicism===\nOn 29 September 1930, Waugh was received into the Catholic Church. This shocked his family and surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time.<ref name= Patey35>Patey, pp. 35\u201339</ref> He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: \"Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church\".<ref>Waugh diaries, 22 December 1926: Davie (ed.), p. 237</ref> The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, \"I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson\".<ref>Waugh diaries, 20 February 1927: Davie (ed.), p. 281</ref> Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, \"She bullied me into the Church\".<ref>Sykes, p. 107</ref> It was she who led him to Father [[Martin D'Arcy]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], who persuaded Waugh \"on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion\" that \"the Christian revelation was genuine\". In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was \"unintelligible and unendurable without God\".<ref name= Gallagher366>\"Come Inside\", first published in ''The Road to Damascus'' (1949), ed.

He reported the event as \"an elaborate propaganda effort\" to convince the world that Abyssinia was a civilised nation which concealed the fact that the emperor had achieved power through barbarous means.<ref>Patey, p. 91</ref> A subsequent journey through the [[British East Africa]] colonies and the [[Belgian Congo]] formed the basis of two books; the travelogue ''Remote People'' (1931) and the comic novel ''[[Black Mischief]]'' (1932).<ref>Sykes, p. 109</ref> Waugh's next extended trip, in the winter of 1932\u20131933, was to [[Guyana|British Guiana]] (now Guyana) in South America, possibly taken to distract him from a long and unrequited passion for the socialite [[Teresa Jungman]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 276, 310</ref> On arrival in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Waugh arranged a river trip by steam launch into the interior. He travelled on via several staging-posts to [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]] in Brazil, and then took a convoluted overland journey back to Georgetown.<ref>Hastings, pp. 272\u201381</ref> His various adventures and encounters found their way into two further books: his travel account ''Ninety-two Days'', and the novel ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'', both published in 1934.<ref>Hastings, pp. 296, 306</ref>\n\nBack from South America, Waugh faced accusations of obscenity and [[blasphemy]] from the Catholic journal ''[[The Tablet]]'', which objected to passages in ''Black Mischief''. He defended himself in an open letter to the [[Archbishop of Westminster]], Cardinal [[Francis Bourne]],<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 72\u201378</ref> which remained unpublished until 1980. In the summer of 1934, he went on an expedition to [[Spitsbergen]] in the [[Arctic]], an experience he did not enjoy and of which he made minimal literary use.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 367\u201374</ref> On his return, determined to write a major Catholic biography, he selected the [[Jesuit]] martyr [[Edmund Campion]] as his subject. The book, published in 1935, caused controversy by its forthright pro-Catholic, anti-[[Protestant]] stance but brought its writer the [[Hawthornden Prize]].<ref>Patey, p. 126</ref><ref>Hastings, pp. 324\u201325</ref> He returned to Abyssinia in August 1935 to report the opening stages of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] for the ''Daily Mail''. Waugh, on the basis of his earlier visit, considered Abyssinia  \"a savage place which [[Mussolini]] was doing well to tame\" according to his fellow reporter, [[Bill Deedes|William Deedes]].<ref>Deedes, p. 15</ref> Waugh saw little action and was not wholly serious in his role as a war correspondent.<ref>Davie, p. 391</ref> Deedes remarks on the older writer's snobbery: \"None of us quite measured up to the company he liked to keep back at home\".<ref>Deedes, pp. 35\u201336</ref> However, in the face of imminent Italian air attacks, Deedes found Waugh's courage \"deeply reassuring\".<ref>Deedes, pp. 62\u201363</ref> Waugh wrote up his Abyssinian experiences in a book, ''Waugh in Abyssinia'' (1936), which [[Rose Macaulay]] dismissed as a \"fascist tract\", on account of its pro-Italian tone.<ref>Patey, p. 141</ref> A better-known account is his novel ''[[Scoop (novel)|Scoop]]'' (1938), in which the protagonist, William Boot, is loosely based on Deedes.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 406</ref>\n\nAmong Waugh's growing circle of friends were [[Diana Mitford|Diana Guinness]] and [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne|Bryan Guinness]] (dedicatees of ''[[Vile Bodies]]''), [[Lady Diana Cooper]] and her husband [[Duff Cooper]],<ref>Hastings, p. 263</ref> [[Nancy Mitford]] who was originally a friend of Evelyn Gardner's,<ref>Hastings, p. 191</ref> and the [[Earl Beauchamp|Lygon sisters]]. Waugh had known [[Hugh Patrick Lygon]] at Oxford; now he was introduced to the girls and their country house, [[Madresfield Court]], which became the closest that he had to a home during his years of wandering.<ref>Byrne, p. 155</ref> In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer [[Aubrey Herbert]]. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in [[Portofino]], where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.<ref>Hastings pp. 284\u201387</ref>\n\n===Second marriage===\nOn his conversion, Waugh had accepted that he would be unable to remarry while Evelyn Gardner was alive. However, he wanted a wife and children, and in October 1933, he began proceedings for the [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]] of the marriage on the grounds of \"lack of real consent\". The case was heard by an [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical tribunal]] in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936.<ref>Hastings, pp. 290\u201393</ref> In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert.<ref>Byrne, pp. 240\u201341</ref> He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936.<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 103\u201305</ref> There were initial misgivings from the [[Herbert family|Herberts]], an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the [[Church of our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, Westminster|Church of the Assumption]] in Warwick Street, London.<ref>Byrne, pp. 260\u201361</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p6634.htm|title=Person Page|website=thepeerage.com|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a wedding present the bride's grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near [[Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire|Stinchcombe]] in Gloucestershire.<ref>Hastings, pp. 358\u201359</ref> The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, [[Auberon Waugh|Auberon Alexander]], on 17 November 1939.<ref>Hastings, pp. 336 and 392</ref> Between these events, ''Scoop'' was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim.<ref>Stannard, Vol. i pp. 470\u201371</ref> In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to [[Mexico]] after which he wrote ''[[Robbery Under Law]]'', based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing \"little with travel and much with political questions\".<ref>Sykes, p. 184</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Royal Marine and commando===\nWaugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] and moved his young family to [[Pixton Park]] in [[Somerset]], the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment.<ref>Hastings, pp. 384\u201386</ref> He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration,<ref>Sykes, pp. 273\u201376</ref> but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the [[Royal Marines]] in December and entered training at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] naval base.<ref>Hastings, pp. 391\u201392</ref> He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as ''Work Suspended and Other Stories'' (1943).<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 490\u2013501</ref>\n\nWaugh's daily training routine left him with \"so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II, p. 2</ref> In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and given command of a [[company (military unit)|company]] of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 9</ref> Even after the [[Battle of France|German invasion of the Low Countries]] (10 May \u2013 22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 15</ref> Waugh's inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion's Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the [[Battle of Dakar]] in West Africa (23\u201325 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the [[Free French Forces]] to overthrow the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonial government and install General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town's defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh's comment on the affair was this: \"Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.\"<ref name= Stannard16>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 16\u201320</ref><ref>Amory (ed.), p. 141</ref>\n\nIn November 1940, Waugh was posted to a [[commando]] unit, and, after further training, became a member of \"[[Layforce]]\", under Colonel (later Brigadier) [[Robert Laycock]].<ref name= Stannard16/> In February 1941, the unit sailed to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture [[Bardia]], on the Libyan coast.<ref>Hastings, pp. 421\u201322</ref> In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of [[Crete]]: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops.<ref>Sykes, pp. 215\u201316</ref> In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote ''[[Put Out More Flags]]'' (1942), a novel of the war's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s.<ref>Patey, p. 171</ref> Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the [[Royal Horse Guards]], on Laycock's recommendation.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 66\u201367</ref> On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple's fourth child.<ref>Hastings, p. 442</ref>{{refn|Earlier, Laura had borne a daughter, christened Mary, on 1 December 1940, but she lived only a few hours.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 24</ref>|group= n}}\n\n===Frustration, ''Brideshead'' and Yugoslavia===\nWaugh's elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of [[Operation Husky]] (9 July \u2013 17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 445\u201346</ref> Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier.<ref>Sykes, pp. 229\u201330</ref> After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], Waugh began parachute training at [[Tatton Park]], Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a [[fibula]]. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for [[Chagford]], Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was ''[[Brideshead Revisited|Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder]]'' (1945),<ref>Hastings, pp. 454\u201362</ref> the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer [[Douglas Lane Patey]] commented that it was \"the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation\".<ref>Patey, p. 296</ref>\n\nWaugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by [[Randolph Churchill]] to serve in a military mission to [[Yugoslavia]], and, early in July, flew with Churchill from [[Bari]], Italy, to the Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. There, they met [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]], the Communist leader of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]], who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces with Allied support.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 113\u201314</ref> Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 116\u201321</ref>\n\nThe mission eventually arrived at [[Topusko]], where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group's liaison duties, between the [[British Army]] and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and would fare worse when the Communists took control.<ref>Hastings, pp. 468\u201373</ref> He expressed those thoughts in a long report, \"Church and State in Liberated Croatia\". After spells in [[Dubrovnik]] and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.<ref>Hastings, pp. 485\u201391</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n\n===Fame and fortune===\n''Brideshead Revisited'' was published in London in May 1945.<ref name= Hastings494>Hastings, pp. 494\u201395</ref> Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, \"my first novel rather than my last\".<ref>Patey, p. 224</ref> It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status.<ref name= Hastings494/> Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of [[Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]] by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as \"a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts\".<ref>Gallagher (ed.), pp. 289\u201390</ref> Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of [[Winston Churchill]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he saw the accession to power of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new \"Dark Age\".<ref name= Hastings494/>\n[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]], the subject of Waugh's 1950 novel]]\n\nIn September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944)<ref>Hastings, pp. 462 and 494\u201397</ref> but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling.

The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn cemetery]], which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, ''[[The Loved One]]''.<ref name= StannardODNB/> In 1951 he visited the [[Holy Land]] with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes,<ref>Sykes, pp. 338\u201342</ref> and in 1953, he travelled to [[Goa]] to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest [[Francis Xavier]].<ref name= Hastings554>Hastings, p. 554</ref><ref>Waugh's article on the Goa visit, \"Goa, the Home of s Saint\" is reprinted in Gallager (ed.), pp. 448\u201356</ref>\n\nIn between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on ''[[Helena (1950 novel)|Helena]]'', a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the [[True Cross]] that was \"far the best book I have ever written or ever will write\". Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, \"the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud\".<ref>Patey, p. 289</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Waugh published ''[[Men at Arms (Evelyn Waugh)|Men at Arms]]'', the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 5, 82, 340</ref> Other books published during this period included ''[[When The Going Was Good]]'' (1946),<ref name= Patey251/> an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, ''The Holy Places'' (published by the [[Ian Fleming]]-managed [[Queen Anne Press]], 1952) and ''[[Love Among the Ruins. A Romance of the Near Future|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1953), a [[dystopia]]n tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world.<ref>Hastings, p. 553</ref> Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, \"selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible\" and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.<ref>Hastings, pp. 531 and 537</ref>\n\nFrom 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector of objects, particularly Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London's [[Portobello Market]] and from house clearance sales.<ref name= P153/> His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to [[Gloucester]], where he bought \"a lion of wood, finely carved for \u00a325, also a bookcase \u00a335&nbsp;... a charming Chinese painting \u00a310, a Regency easel \u00a37\".<ref>Davie (ed.), p. 658</ref> Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid \u00a310 for Rossetti's \"Spirit of the Rainbow\" to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value.

He was perceived as out of step with the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available.<ref name= Hastings554/> His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, ''[[Officers and Gentlemen]]'', had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating.<ref>Patey, p. 324</ref> Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 415</ref> [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\".<ref>{{cite news|last= Brown|first= Mark|title= Waugh at the BBC: \"the most ill-natured interview ever\" on CD after 55 years\"|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/15/bbc.radio|journal= The Guardian|date= 15 April 2008|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1954, Waugh's doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of \"other passengers whispering about me\" and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], Stephen Black. He left the ship in [[Egypt]] and flew on to [[Colombo]], but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him.<ref>Patey, p. 325</ref> Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, [[Frances Donaldson]], whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from [[bromism|bromide poisoning]] from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared.<ref>Donaldson, pp. 56\u201361</ref> Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: \"Clean off my onion!\". The experience was  fictionalised a few years later, in ''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold]]'' (1957).<ref>Patey, pp. 326, 338\u201341</ref>\n\nIn 1956, [[Edwin Newman]] made a short film about Waugh. In the course of it, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refused to drive or use the telephone, and wrote with an old-fashioned [[dip pen]]. He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of [[whisky]], and that every American had been divorced at least once.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edwin |last=Newman |authorlink=Edwin Newman |title=Strictly Speaking: will America be the death of English? |url=https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm |url-access=registration |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm/page/134 134] }}</ref>\n\n===Late works===\n[[File:Combe Florey - near the Old Manor House - geograph.org.uk - 904793.jpg|thumb|left|[[Combe Florey]], the village in Somerset to which Waugh and his family moved in 1956]]\nRestored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished ''Officers and Gentlemen''. In June 1955 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist and reviewer [[Nancy Spain]], accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for ''The Spectator'',<ref>\"Awake, My Soul, It Is a Lord\", published in ''The Spectator'', 8 July 1955, reprinted in Gallagher, (ed.), pp. 468\u201370</ref> but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 636</ref> Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of [[Combe Florey]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 385\u201386</ref> In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the ''Express'' and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.<ref>Stannard, pp. 382\u201383</ref>\n\n''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold|Gilbert Pinfold]]'' was published in the summer of 1957, \"my barmy book\", Waugh called it.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 477</ref> The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate.<ref name= Patey339>Patey, pp. 339\u201341</ref> Waugh's next major book was a biography of his longtime friend [[Ronald Knox]], the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in [[Cyprus]]. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter's return to Britain. The critic and [[biography in literature|literary biographer]] David Wykes called Waugh's sang-froid \"astonishing\" and the family's apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.<ref>Wykes, p. 194</ref>\n\nAlthough most of Waugh's books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life.<ref name= H591/> In 1950, as a means of [[tax avoidance]], he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the \"Save the Children Fund\", after the [[Save the Children|well-established charity of that name]]) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books.<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 254\u201355</ref> He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]'' series conducted by [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]]. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer [[Selina Hastings (writer)|Selena Hastings]], Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a \"pose of world-weary boredom\".<ref name= H591>Hastings, pp. 591\u201392</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 415\u201316</ref> In September, he produced his final travel book, ''[[A Tourist in Africa]]'', based on a visit made in January\u2013March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but \"despised\" the book. The critic [[Cyril Connolly]] called it \"the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken\".<ref>Patey, pp. 346\u201347</ref> The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as ''Unconditional Surrender''.<ref>Hastings, pp. 594\u201398</ref>\n\n===Decline and death===\n[[File:Evelyn Waugh Grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Waugh's grave in Combe Florey, adjacent to but not within the Anglican churchyard.]]\nAs he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, \"fat, deaf, short of breath\", according to Patey.<ref>Patey, p. 359</ref> His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of \"an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 477</ref> In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story ''Basil Seal Rides Again''. This revival of the protagonist of ''Black Mischief'' and ''Put Out More Flags'' was published in 1963; the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' called it a \"nasty little book\".<ref>{{cite journal| last= Willett|first= John|title= A Rake Raked Up| journal= The Times Literary Supplement| date= 14 November 1963| page = 921}}</ref> When the first volume of autobiography, ''A Little Learning'', was published in 1964, Waugh's often oblique tone and discreet name changes ensured that friends avoided the embarrassments that some had feared.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 480</ref>\n\nWaugh had welcomed the accession in 1958 of [[Pope John XXIII]]<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 514\u201315</ref> and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963.<ref>\"An Appreciation of Pope John\" first published in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', 27 July 1963, reprinted in Gallagher (ed.), pp. 614\u201318</ref> However, he became increasingly concerned by the decisions emerging from the [[Second Vatican Council]], which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, [[Pope Paul VI]], until 1965.

Waugh's agent, A. D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount,<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 485</ref> but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography.

Although he praised younger writers, such as [[Angus Wilson]], [[Muriel Spark]] and [[V. S.

[[Cyril Connolly]]'s first reaction to the book was that Waugh's powers were failing, an opinion that he later revised.<ref>Stannard, Vol.I pp. 375\u201377</ref>\n\nIn the latter 1930s, Waugh's inclination to Catholic and conservative polemics affected his standing with the general reading public.<ref name= StannardODNB/> The Campion biography is said by David Wykes to be \"so rigidly biased that it has no claims to make as history\".<ref>Wykes, p. 112</ref> The pro-fascist tone in parts of ''Waugh in Abyssinia'' offended readers and critics and prevented its publication in America.<ref>Hastings, p. 345</ref> There was general relief among critics when ''Scoop'', in 1938, indicated a return to Waugh's earlier comic style. Critics had begun to think that his wit had been displaced by partisanship and propaganda.<ref name= Patey157/>\n\nWaugh maintained his reputation in 1942, with ''Put Out More Flags'', which sold well despite wartime restrictions on paper and printing.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 72\u201373</ref> Its public reception, however, did not compare with that accorded to ''Brideshead Revisited'' three years later, on both sides of the Atlantic. ''Brideshead'''s selection as the American [[Book of the Month Club|Book of the Month]] swelled its US sales to an extent that dwarfed those in Britain, which was affected by paper shortages.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 148</ref> Despite the public's enthusiasm, critical opinion was split. ''Brideshead's'' Catholic standpoint offended some critics who had greeted Waugh's earlier novels with warm praise.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Osborne|first= John W.|title= ''Book Review'': Christianity and Chaos|journal= Evelyn Waugh Newsletter and Studies|volume= 36|issue= 3|publisher= Lock Haven University|location= Lock Haven, Pa.|year= 2006|url= https://fama.us.es/iii/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Ffama.us.es%3A443%2Fpatroninfo~S5%2F0%2Fredirect%3D%2Fwamvalidate%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252F0-literature.proquest.com.fama.us.es%253A80%252FsearchFulltext.do%253Fid%253DR4442701%2526divLevel%253D0%2526area%253Dabell%2526forward%253Dcritref_ftIIITICKET&scope=5|accessdate= 12 May 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171228155051/https://fama.us.es/iii/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Ffama.us.es%3A443%2Fpatroninfo~S5%2F0%2Fredirect%3D%2Fwamvalidate%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252F0-literature.proquest.com.fama.us.es%253A80%252FsearchFulltext.do%253Fid%253DR4442701%2526divLevel%253D0%2526area%253Dabell%2526forward%253Dcritref_ftIIITICKET&scope=5|archive-date= 28 December 2017|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}{{subscription}}</ref> Its perceived snobbery and its deference to the aristocracy were attacked by, among others, [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] who, in the Irish literary magazine ''[[The Bell (magazine)|The Bell]]'', wrote of Waugh's \"almost mystical veneration\" for the upper classes.<ref>Conor Cruise O'Brien in \"The Pieties of Evelyn Waugh\", reprinted in Stannard: ''Evelyn Waugh: The Critical Heritage'', pp. 255\u201363.

The revelations about his private life, thoughts and attitudes created controversy. Although Waugh had removed embarrassing entries relating to his Oxford years and his first marriage, there was sufficient left on the record to enable enemies to project a negative image of the writer as intolerant, snobbish and sadistic, with pronounced fascist leanings.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Some of this picture, it was maintained by Waugh's supporters, arose from poor editing of the diaries, and a desire to transform Waugh from a writer to a \"character\".<ref name = Wheatcroft>Review by Geoffrey Wheatcroft of ''The Letters of Evelyn Waugh'', ''Spectator'', 11 October 1980.

Christopher Sykes's biography had appeared in 1975, between 1980 and 1998 three more full biographies were issued and other biographical and critical studies have continued to be produced.
