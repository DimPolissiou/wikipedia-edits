In 1567, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary\u2019s]] short period of personal rule ended in recrimination, intrigue and disaster when, after her capture at [[battle of Carberry Hill|Carberry Hill]], she was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate]] in favour of [[James VI]], her infant son.  Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]], while her Protestant half-brother, [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]] was appointed [[Regent]] on behalf of his nephew.  In early May 1568 Mary escaped, heading west to the country of the Hamiltons, high among her remaining supporters, and the safety of [[Dumbarton Castle]] with the determination to restore her rights as queen. Mary was defeated and went into exile and captivity in England. The battle can be regarded as the start of the [[Marian civil war]].\n\n==Queen's Men==\n[[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|Mary's abdication]] had not been universally popular, even among sections of the Protestant nobility, and news of her escape were widely welcomed.  With an escort of fifty horse led by [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claud Hamilton]] she arrived in [[Lanarkshire]], soon to be joined by a wide cross-section of the nobility, including the Earls of [[Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Cassillis]], [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Rothes]] and [[Earl of Eglinton|Eglinton]], the Lords [[Lord Somerville|Sommerville]], [[Lord Hay of Yester|Yester]], [[Lord Livingston|Livingston]], [[Lord Herries of Terregles|Herries]], [[Lord Fleming|Fleming]], [[James Ross, 4th Lord Ross|Ross]], numerous of the feudal barons and their followers.  Within a few days Mary had managed to gather a respectable force of some 6000 men.\n\nIt was openly declared that her abdication, and her consent to the coronation of James, had been extorted from her under threat of death.  An act of council was then passed, declaring the whole process by which Moray had been appointed as Regent to be [[treason]]able.  A [[Contract|bond]] was drawn up by those present for her restitution, signed by eight earls, nine bishops, eighteen lords, twelve abbots and nearly one hundred barons.\n\n==Mary's march==\nIt was Mary's intention to avoid battle if possible, retiring instead to [[Dumbarton Castle]], still held for her by [[John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming]]. Here she would be in a virtually impregnable position, well placed to receive the expected reinforcements from the north, and then recover her hold over the country by degrees. With the intention of by-passing Moray she marched to [[Rutherglen castle]] meeting loyal supporters and then on a wide circuit past Glasgow, intending to move by way of [[Langside]], [[Crookston, Glasgow|Crookston]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] back towards the [[River Clyde]], and then on to Dumbarton on the north side of the Clyde estuary. Moray drew up his army on the moor close to the village of Langside, then several miles south of Glasgow but now well within the city. [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange|Kirkcaldy]], keeping an eye on the enemy movements, noted that they were keeping to the south of the River Cart, the Regent's army being on the opposite bank. In response he ordered hackbutters ([[musketeer]]s) to mount behind each of his horsemen, rapidly fording the river, and placing them among the cottages, hedges and gardens of the village, which bordered each side of a narrow lane, through which Mary's army must [[defile (geography)|defile]]. Meanwhile Moray continued to deploy the rest of the army, the [[Vanguard (military tactics)|vanguard]] under the command of the [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]] leading the march across a nearby bridge. The whole army then deployed the right around the village. No sooner was this complete than the Queen's vanguard, commanded by Lord Hamilton, began its advance through the village. The battle was now under way.\n\n==Guns and pikes==\nMary's army was commanded by Argyll, who was to show little in the way of real military skill, seemingly hoping simply to push Moray aside by sheer force of numbers: it is even suggested in the sources that he fainted at one point, though this is almost certainly a rumour spread by his enemies.  With her army now engaged the Queen stood some distance to the rear, close to Cathcart Castle on a mound since named as the Court Knowe.  As Hamilton attempted to force a passage through Langside he was met by close fire from Grange's hackbutters.  Many in the front ranks were killed, throwing the remainder back on those following, and adding to the general confusion.  Hamilton pushed on, finally reaching the top of a hill, only to find the main enemy army drawn up in good order. Morton with the border pikemen advanced to intercept Mary's vanguard.  Both sides now met in '[[push of pike]]'.  The forest of inter-locked spears was now so thick it is said that if those behind threw their discharged pistols at the enemy the weapons simply rested on the shafts as on a carpet, rather than falling to the ground.\n\nGrange, whom Moray had allowed considerable leeway, continued to act with courage and distinction; \"...&nbsp;the Regent committed unto the laird of Grange, the special care, as an experienced captain, to oversee every danger, to ride to every wing and encourage and make help where the greatest height was.\"   The battle was now at its height and the outcome still doubtful, until Grange saw that the right wing of the Regent's army-consisting of the barons of [[Renfrewshire]]-was beginning to lose ground.  He immediately galloped to the main battalion and brought reinforcements.  This was done so effectively, and the counter-attack pressed with such force, that it broke the enemy ranks.  Moray, who hitherto had stood on the defensive, repulsing Mary's cavalry, now charged at the main enemy battalion, the fight now joined all along the line.  The Queen's men crumbled, the fugitives being closely pursued by a party of Highlanders.  The Battle of Langside, which had lasted for some forty-five minutes, was over.\n\n==Aftermath==\nMary's biographer, [[Antonia Fraser]], describes the Battle of Langside a \"colossal defeat\" for Mary.<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> Only one of Moray's men was killed, whereas over 100 of Mary's men were lost,<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> a figure that almost certainly would have been much higher but for Moray's decision to avoid further bloodshed by ordering a halt to the pursuit.

From here she left for England, never to see Scotland again.\n\nMary crossed the [[Solway Firth]] to [[Workington]] on 16 May 1568 at night with twenty companions. This unexpected event provoked a dispute amongst the English border officials. On the next day she moved to [[Cockermouth]] and was greeted by Richard Lowther, the deputy of [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope]] at [[Carlisle Castle]]. Lowther escorted Mary to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] on 18 May. Meanwhile, the [[Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] who was at [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]] heard the news from Workington, which was in his jurisdiction.

In 1567, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary\u2019s]] short period of personal rule ended in recrimination, intrigue and disaster when, after her capture at [[battle of Carberry Hill|Carberry Hill]], she was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate]] in favour of [[James VI]], her infant son.  Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]], while her Protestant half-brother, [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]] was appointed [[Regent]] on behalf of his nephew.  In early May 1568 Mary escaped, heading west to the country of the Hamiltons, high among her remaining supporters, and the safety of [[Dumbarton Castle]] with the determination to restore her rights as queen. Mary was defeated and went into exile and captivity in England. The battle can be regarded as the start of the [[Marian civil war]].\n\n==Queen's Men==\n[[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|Mary's abdication]] had not been universally popular, even among sections of the Protestant nobility, and news of her escape were widely welcomed.  With an escort of fifty horse led by [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claud Hamilton]] she arrived in [[Lanarkshire]], soon to be joined by a wide cross-section of the nobility, including the Earls of [[Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Cassillis]], [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Rothes]] and [[Earl of Eglinton|Eglinton]], the Lords [[Lord Somerville|Sommerville]], [[Lord Hay of Yester|Yester]], [[Lord Livingston|Livingston]], [[Lord Herries of Terregles|Herries]], [[Lord Fleming|Fleming]], [[James Ross, 4th Lord Ross|Ross]], numerous of the feudal barons and their followers.  Within a few days Mary had managed to gather a respectable force of some 6000 men.\n\nIt was openly declared that her abdication, and her consent to the coronation of James, had been extorted from her under threat of death.

He meets and befriends actor [[Joe Manganiello]], who convinces Pee-wee to leave Fairville for the first time in his life to travel to [[New York City]] and be a guest at Joe's birthday party.\n\nShortly after leaving Fairville, Pee-wee encounters three women being chased and, assuming they are innocent women in peril, offers them an escape in his [[Fiat 600]]. It turns out that the three women, Pepper, Freckles, and Bella (who coincidentally goes by the nickname \"Pee-Wee\"), are outlaws who have just robbed a bank, and that is the reason they were being chased. The women steal his Fiat. Pee-wee then gets a car ride from a [[wikt:travelling salesman|travelling salesman]] named Gordon, who visits a creepy [[snake farm]] with Pee-Wee in tow, and gives him a disguise kit.\n\nPee-wee attempts to hitch-hike, but after having no luck, seeks refuge at a farmhouse owned by Farmer Brown, who offers to let Pee-wee spend the night. Farmer Brown introduces Pee-wee to his nine daughters, each of whom have a romantic interest in Pee-wee and spend the night flirting with him. The next morning, having heard his daughters talk endlessly about Pee-Wee, Farmer Brown insists that Pee-wee marry one of his daughters. During the wedding ceremony, Pee-wee uses the disguise kit to flee the church. He then gets a ride in an RV driven by three African-American hairdressers who are en route to a hairdressing contest. Pee-Wee realizes he is still far from New York, but the hair stylists implore him not to give up.\n\nPee-wee then meets Penny King (possibly a reference to the character in the television show [[Sky King]]), an aviator with a flying car resembling [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]], who offers to fly him to New York. The flying car crashes in the wilderness where Pee-wee meets Grizzly Bear Daniels who promises to show Pee-wee the way out of the woods, but instead, takes him to his cave.\n\nPee-wee runs away from Grizzly's cave out of fear and after wandering lost for a time, comes upon an [[Amish]] community, where he entertains the locals by slowly letting the air out of a balloon, causing it to squeak loudly and shrilly.\n\nPee-wee discovers that the bank robbers are hiding among the Amish. That night when the women attempt to steal a horse buggy, Pee-wee convinces them to leave some of their money behind for the Amish citizens to purchase a replacement.\n\nPee-wee and the women arrive in New York where the three women are arrested for the robbery. Pee-wee falls down a well in [[Central Park]] just before Joe's birthday party. Joe believes that Pee-wee decided not to come to his party and cannot enjoy himself. Joe, in a state of melancholy turns on the TV to the local news. There is a story about a rescue attempt in progress to get Pee-wee out of the well. Joe rushes to the well and assists in rescuing Pee-wee. During the rescue, we see that the entire town of Fairville, Pepper, Freckles, and Bella (while in their prison cell), travelling salesman Gordon, the staff of the snake farm, the hairdressers, Penny King, and Grizzly Bear Daniels (who have found each other and are relaxing in Grizzly's hot tub) are watching the news broadcast, that went national when Joe got involved. When Pee-wee asks Joe, \"What about the party?\", Joe responds, \"Pee-wee, we ''are'' the party\", and then shows Pee-Wee a miniature version of Fairville he created, reflecting one of Pee-Wee's models he saw earlier.\n\nPee-Wee returns to his job at Dan's Diner, where he shows the Fairville residents some of the items he acquired during his trip. Joe appears in Fairville to give Pee-Wee a ride on his motorcycle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Paul Reubens]] as [[Pee-wee Herman]]\n*[[Joe Manganiello]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|last=Bacle |first=Ariana |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/08/pee-wee-big-holiday-joe-manganiello |title=Joe Manganiello joins 'Pee-wee's Big Holiday' |publisher=EW.com |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> as himself\n*Jessica Pohly<ref name=\"variety1\">{{cite web|author=Dave McNary |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/pee-wees-big-holiday-jessica-pohly-cast-netflix-1201475452/ |title=\u2018Pee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday': Jessica Pohly Joins Cast of Netflix Movie |publisher=Variety |date=2015-04-19 |accessdate=2015-05-10}}</ref> as Pepper\n*[[Alia Shawkat]]<ref name=\"peewee1\"/> as Bella\n*[[Stephanie Beatriz]]<ref name=\"peewee1\">{{cite web|url=http://peewee.com/2015/05/08/new-york-new-york/ |title=New York, New York! - My Log |publisher=Peewee.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-10}}</ref> as Freckles\n*[[Brad William Henke]] as Grizzly Bear Daniels\n*Hal Landon Jr. as Farmer Brown\n*[[Diane Salinger]] as Penny King\n*Patrick Egan as Gordon\n*[[Tara Buck]]<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite web|last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/tara-buck-pee-wees-big-holiday-netflix-1201390134/ |title=\u2018True Blood\u2019s Tara Buck Cast In \u2018Pee-Wee\u2019s Big Holiday\u2019 Netflix Movie |publisher=Deadline |date=2015-03-11 |accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref> as Beverly \n*[[Richard Riehle]] as Dan\n*[[Leo Fitzpatrick]] as Abe\n*[[Christopher Heyerdahl]] as Ezekiel\n*[[Charlie Robinson (actor)|Charlie Robinson]] as Police Captain \n*[[Jordan Black (actor)|Jordan Black]] as Yul/Party Coordinator\n*[[Monica Horan]] as Ruby\n*[[Brian Palermo]] as Marvin\n*[[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] as Sylvester\n*[[Paul Rust]] as Ernie\n*[[Robert R.

He meets and befriends actor [[Joe Manganiello]], who convinces Pee-wee to leave Fairville for the first time in his life to travel to [[New York City]] and be a guest at Joe's birthday party.\n\nShortly after leaving Fairville, Pee-wee encounters three women being chased and, assuming they are innocent women in peril, offers them an escape in his [[Fiat 600]]. It turns out that the three women, Pepper, Freckles, and Bella (who coincidentally goes by the nickname \"Pee-Wee\"), are outlaws who have just robbed a bank, and that is the reason they were being chased. The women steal his Fiat. Pee-wee then gets a car ride from a [[wikt:travelling salesman|travelling salesman]] named Gordon, who visits a creepy [[snake farm]] with Pee-Wee in tow, and gives him a disguise kit.\n\nPee-wee attempts to hitch-hike, but after having no luck, seeks refuge at a farmhouse owned by Farmer Brown, who offers to let Pee-wee spend the night. Farmer Brown introduces Pee-wee to his nine daughters, each of whom have a romantic interest in Pee-wee and spend the night flirting with him. The next morning, having heard his daughters talk endlessly about Pee-Wee, Farmer Brown insists that Pee-wee get married to one of his daughters. During the wedding ceremony, Pee-wee uses the disguise kit to flee the church. He then gets a ride in an RV driven by three African-American hairdressers who are en route to a hairdressing contest. Pee-Wee realizes he is still far from New York, but the hair stylists implore him not to give up.\n\nPee-wee then meets Penny King (possibly a reference to the character in the television show [[Sky King]]), an aviator with a flying car resembling [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]], who offers to fly him to New York. The flying car crashes in the wilderness where Pee-wee meets Grizzly Bear Daniels who promises to show Pee-wee the way out of the woods, but instead, takes him to his cave.\n\nPee-wee runs away from Grizzly's cave out of fear and after wandering lost for a time, comes upon an [[Amish]] community, where he entertains the locals by slowly letting the air out of a balloon, causing it to squeak loudly and shrilly.\n\nPee-wee discovers that the bank robbers are hiding among the Amish. That night when the women attempt to steal a horse buggy, Pee-wee convinces them to leave some of their money behind for the Amish citizens to purchase a replacement.\n\nPee-wee and the women arrive in New York where the three women are arrested for the robbery. Pee-wee falls down a well in [[Central Park]] just before Joe's birthday party. Joe believes that Pee-wee decided not to come to his party and cannot enjoy himself. Joe, in a state of melancholy turns on the TV to the local news. There is a story about a rescue attempt in progress to get Pee-wee out of the well. Joe rushes to the well and assists in rescuing Pee-wee. During the rescue, we see that the entire town of Fairville, Pepper, Freckles, and Bella (while in their prison cell), travelling salesman Gordon, the staff of the snake farm, the hairdressers, Penny King, and Grizzly Bear Daniels (who have found each other and are relaxing in Grizzly's hot tub) are watching the news broadcast, that went national when Joe got involved. When Pee-wee asks Joe, \"What about the party?\", Joe responds, \"Pee-wee, we ''are'' the party\", and then shows Pee-Wee a miniature version of Fairville he created, reflecting one of Pee-Wee's models he saw earlier.\n\nPee-Wee returns to his job at Dan's Diner, where he shows the Fairville residents some of the items he acquired during his trip. Joe appears in Fairville to give Pee-Wee a ride on his motorcycle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Paul Reubens]] as [[Pee-wee Herman]]\n*[[Joe Manganiello]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|last=Bacle |first=Ariana |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/08/pee-wee-big-holiday-joe-manganiello |title=Joe Manganiello joins 'Pee-wee's Big Holiday' |publisher=EW.com |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> as himself\n*Jessica Pohly<ref name=\"variety1\">{{cite web|author=Dave McNary |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/pee-wees-big-holiday-jessica-pohly-cast-netflix-1201475452/ |title=\u2018Pee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday': Jessica Pohly Joins Cast of Netflix Movie |publisher=Variety |date=2015-04-19 |accessdate=2015-05-10}}</ref> as Pepper\n*[[Alia Shawkat]]<ref name=\"peewee1\"/> as Bella\n*[[Stephanie Beatriz]]<ref name=\"peewee1\">{{cite web|url=http://peewee.com/2015/05/08/new-york-new-york/ |title=New York, New York! - My Log |publisher=Peewee.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-10}}</ref> as Freckles\n*[[Brad William Henke]] as Grizzly Bear Daniels\n*Hal Landon Jr. as Farmer Brown\n*[[Diane Salinger]] as Penny King\n*Patrick Egan as Gordon\n*[[Tara Buck]]<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite web|last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/tara-buck-pee-wees-big-holiday-netflix-1201390134/ |title=\u2018True Blood\u2019s Tara Buck Cast In \u2018Pee-Wee\u2019s Big Holiday\u2019 Netflix Movie |publisher=Deadline |date=2015-03-11 |accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref> as Beverly \n*[[Richard Riehle]] as Dan\n*[[Leo Fitzpatrick]] as Abe\n*[[Christopher Heyerdahl]] as Ezekiel\n*[[Charlie Robinson (actor)|Charlie Robinson]] as Police Captain \n*[[Jordan Black (actor)|Jordan Black]] as Yul/Party Coordinator\n*[[Monica Horan]] as Ruby\n*[[Brian Palermo]] as Marvin\n*[[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] as Sylvester\n*[[Paul Rust]] as Ernie\n*[[Robert R.
