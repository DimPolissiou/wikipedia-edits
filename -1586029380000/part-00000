On September 29 of that year they produced an [[MTV Unplugged]] concert. The Cadillacs also won the [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album#1990s|1998 Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album]], and were nominated in the 2000 Latin [[Grammy Awards]] for ''Best Band'' and ''Best Music Video'' (\"La Vida\"), which received the now-defunct International [[Viewer's Choice Award]] (Southern Region) at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n== Return ==\nOn April 7, 2008, the band's front man, Vicentico, announced the band's return from a six-year break.

A series of protest marches in the city in August gathered significant attendance, with an estimated 500,000 taking part on August 27. President [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] ordered the occupation{{by whom|date=February 2015}} of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in September, but protests continued. Using the prominence brought by the Olympics, students gathered in [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] to call for greater civil and democratic rights and showed disdain for the Olympics with slogans such as ''\u00a1No queremos olimpiadas, queremos revoluci\u00f3n!''

Some 5000 soldiers and 200 [[tankette]]s surrounded the plaza. Hundreds of protesters and civilians were killed and over 1000 were arrested. At the time, the event was portrayed in the national media as the military suppression of a violent student uprising, but later analysis indicates that the gathering was peaceful prior to the army's advance.<ref>Werner, Michael S., ed.
