He was born in [[Switzerland]] and became a [[France|French citizen]] in 1930. His career spanned five decades, and he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, and North and South America.\n\nDedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM). Le Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of [[Chandigarh]] in [[India]], and contributed specific designs for several buildings there, specially the government buildings.\n\nOn 17 July 2016, seventeen projects by Le Corbusier in seven countries were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as [[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier|The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1528/|title=The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life (1887\u20131904)==\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, Still Life, oil on canvas, 80.9 x 99.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|80.9|x|99.7|cm|1|abbr=on}}, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]\n\nCharles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret was born on 6 October 1887 in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], a small city in the French-speaking [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel canton]] in north-western Switzerland, in the [[Jura mountains]], {{convert|5|km|mi}} across the border from France. It was an industrial town, devoted to manufacturing watches. (He adopted the pseudonym ''Le Corbusier'' in 1920.) His father was an artisan who enameled boxes and watches, and his mother taught piano. His elder brother Albert was an amateur violinist.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  He attended a kindergarten that used [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Fr\u00f6belian]] methods.<ref>Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier et l'urbain \u2013 la rectification du damier froebelien, pp. 93\u2013117.</ref><ref>Actes du colloque La ville et l'urbanisme apr\u00e8s Le Corbusier, \u00e9ditions d'en Haut 1993 \u2013 {{ISBN|2-88251-033-0}}.</ref><ref>Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier entre Raphael et Fr\u00f6bel, pp. 9\u201327, Journal d'histoire de l'architecture N\u00b01, Presses universitaires de Grenoble 1988 \u2013 {{ISBN|2-7061-0325-6}}.</ref>\n\nLike his contemporaries [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]], Le Corbusier lacked formal training as an architect.  He was attracted to the visual arts; at the age of fifteen he entered the municipal art school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds which taught the applied arts connected with watchmaking.  Three years later he attended the higher course of decoration, founded by the painter [[Charles L'Eplattenier]], who had studied in [[Budapest]] and Paris. Le Corbusier wrote later that L'Eplattenier had made him \"a man of the woods\" and taught him painting from nature.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  His father frequently took him into the mountains around the town.  He wrote later, \"we were constantly on mountaintops; we grew accustomed to a vast horizon.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourdhui'' (1925), p. 198.</ref> His architecture teacher in the Art School was architect Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier's earliest house designs.  He reported later that it was the art teacher L'Eplattenier who made him choose architecture. \"I had a horror of architecture and architects,\" he wrote. \"...I was sixteen, I accepted the verdict and I obeyed.

In 1905, he and two other students, under the supervision of their teacher, Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, designed and built his first house, the [[Villa Fallet]], for the engraver Louis Fallet, a friend of his teacher Charles L'Eplattenier. Located on the forested hillside near Chaux-de-fonds, it was a large chalet with a steep roof in the local alpine style and carefully crafted colored geometric patterns on the fa\u00e7ade.  The success of this house led to his construction of two similar houses, the Villas Jacquemet and Stotzer, in the same area.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=49}}\n\nIn September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; then that winter traveling through Budapest to Vienna, where he stayed for four months and met [[Gustav Klimt]] and tried, without success, to meet [[Josef Hoffmann]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=48}}  In Florence, he visited the [[Florence Charterhouse]] in [[Galluzzo]], which made a lifelong impression on him. \"I would have liked to live in one of what they called their cells,\"  he wrote later. \"It was the solution for a unique kind of worker's housing, or rather for a terrestrial paradise.\"<ref>Letter to Eplattenier in Dumont, ''Le Corbusier, Lettres a ses maitres'', vol. 2, pp. 82\u201383.</ref>  He traveled to Paris, and during fourteen months between 1908 until 1910 he worked as a draftsman in the office of the architect [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of the use of reinforced [[concrete]] in residential construction and the architect of the [[Art Deco]] landmark [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]].  Two years later, between October 1910 and March 1911, he traveled to Germany and worked four months in the office [[Peter Behrens]], where [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]] were also working and learning.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1911, he traveled again with his friend [[August Klipstein]] for five months;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Klip and Corb on the road|last=\u017dakni\u0107|first=Ivan|publisher=Scheidegger & Spiess|year=2019|isbn=978-3-85881-817-1|location=Z\u00fcrich|pages=}}</ref> this time he journeyed to the [[Balkans]] and visited [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], as well as [[Pompeii]] and [[Rome]], filling nearly 80 sketchbooks with renderings of what he saw\u2014including many sketches of the [[Parthenon]], whose forms he would later praise in his work ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'' (1923).  He spoke of what he saw during this trip in many of his books, and it was the subject of his last book, ''Le Voyage d'Orient''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1912, he began his most ambitious project; a new house for his parents. also located on the forested hillside near La-Chaux-de-Fonds.  The Jeanneret-Perret house was larger than the others, and in a more innovative style; the horizontal planes contrasted dramatically with the steep alpine slopes, and the white walls and lack of decoration were in sharp contrast with the other buildings on the hillside. The interior spaces were organized around the four pillars of the salon in the center, foretelling the open interiors he would create in his later buildings.  The project was more expensive to build than he imagined; his parents were forced to move from the house within ten years, and relocate in a more modest house.  However, it led to a commission to build an even more imposing villa in the nearby village of [[Le Locle]]  for a wealthy watch manufacturer, Georges Favre-Jacot. Le Corbusier designed the new house in less than a month. The building was carefully designed to fit its hillside site, and interior plan was spacious and designed around a courtyard for maximum light, significant departure from the traditional house.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=48\u20139}}\n\n==Dom-ino House and Schwob House (1914\u20131918)==\n[[File:Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), 1914-15, Maison Dom-Ino.jpg|thumb|left|Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret, 1914\u201315, [[Dom-ino House|''Maison Dom-Ino (Dom-ino House)'']] ]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Le Corbusier taught at his old school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds.

He had first discovered concrete working in the office of  [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of reinforced concrete architecture in Paris, but now wanted to use it in new ways.\n\n\"Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources,\" he wrote later, \"and variety, and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be rhythm of a palace, and a Pompieen tranquility.\"<ref>Letter to Auguste Perret (1915), cited in ''Lettres a ces Maitres'', vol. 1, p. 33.</ref>  This led him to his plan for the [[Dom-ino House|Dom-Ino House]] (1914\u201315). This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of three concrete slabs supported by six thin [[reinforced concrete column]]s, with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan.<ref name=\"Tim Benton\">Tim Benton, ''Les Villas de Le Corbusier 1920\u20131929'', Philippe Sers \u00e9d. Paris, 1987.</ref> The system was originally designed to provide large numbers of temporary residences after World War I, producing only slabs, columns and stairways, and residents could build exterior walls with the materials around the site. He described it in his patent application as \"a juxtiposable system of construction according to an infinite number of combinations of plans.  This would permit, he wrote, \"the construction of the dividing walls at any point on the fa\u00e7ade or the interior.\"\n\n[[File:CF05.jpg|thumb|The Anatole Schwob House in La-Chaux-de-Fonds (1916\u20131918)]]\n\nUnder this system, the structure of the house did not have to appear on the outside, but could be hidden behind a glass wall, and the interior could be arranged in any way the architect liked.<ref>cited by Turner, Paul, \"La Formation de Le Corbusier\", Paris, Macula, 1987, p. 218.</ref> After it was patented, Le Corbusier designed a number of houses according to the system, which were all white concrete boxes. Although some of these were never built, they illustrated his basic architectural ideas which would dominate his works throughout the 1920s. He refined the idea in his 1927 book on the ''Five Points of a New Architecture''. This design, which called for the disassociation of the structure from the walls, and the freedom of plans and fa\u00e7ades, became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50\u201351}}\n\nIn August 1916, Le Corbusier received his largest commission ever, to construct a villa for the Swiss watchmaker Anatole Schwob, for whom he had already completed several small remodeling projects. He was given a large budget and the freedom to design not only the house, but also to create the interior decoration and choose the furniture.  Following the precepts of Auguste Perret, he built the structure out of reinforced concrete and filled the gaps with brick. The center of the house is a large concrete box with two semicolumn structures on both sides, which reflects his ideas of pure geometrical forms. A large open hall with a chandelier occupied the center of the building.  \"You can see,\" he wrote to Auguste Perret in July 1916, \"that Auguste Perret left more in me than Peter Behrens.\"<ref>cited in ''Lettres a css maitres'', vol. 1, p. 181.</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier's grand ambitions collided with the ideas and budget of his client, and led to bitter conflicts.  Schwob went to court and denied Le Corbusier access to site, or the right to claim to be the architect. Le Corbusier responded, \"Whether you like it or not, my presence is inscribed in every corner of your house.\" Le Corbusier took great pride in the house, and reproduced pictures in several of his books.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50}}\n\n==Painting, Cubism, Purism and ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' (1918\u20131922)==\n[[File:Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte, oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Le Corbusier, 1921, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles Edouard Jeanneret), 1922, Nature morte verticale (Vertical Still Life), oil on canvas, 146.3 x 89.3 cm, Kunstmuseum, Basel.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, 1922, ''Nature morte verticale'' (''Vertical Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|146.3|x|89.3|cm|1|abbr=in}}, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]] ]]\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, Guitare verticale (2\u00e8me version), oil on canvas, 100 x 81 cm, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, 1920, ''Guitare verticale'' (2\u00e8me version), oil on canvas, {{convert|100|x|81|cm|0|abbr=on}}, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris]]\n\nLe Corbusier moved to Paris definitively in 1917 and began his own architectural practice with his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (1896\u20131967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the [[World War II]] years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Le_Corbusier/129220|title=Encyclop\u00e9die Larousse en ligne \u2013 Charles \u00c9douard Jeanneret dit Le Corbusier|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|date=|work=larousse.fr}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Le Corbusier met the [[Cubism|Cubist]] painter [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]], in whom he recognised a kindred spirit. Ozenfant encouraged him to paint, and the two began a period of collaboration. Rejecting Cubism as irrational and \"romantic\", the pair jointly published their manifesto, ''Apr\u00e8s le cubisme'' and established a new artistic movement, [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier began writing for a new journal,  ''[[L'Esprit Nouveau]]'', and promoted with energy and imagination his ideas of architecture.\n\nIn the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted '''Le Corbusier''' (an altered form of his maternal grandfather's name, Lecorb\u00e9sier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOKNzunERUwC&pg=PA161|title=Le Corbusier: choix de lettres|first1=Le|last1=Corbusier|first2=Jean|last2=Jenger|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|via=Google Books|isbn=9783764364557}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.asso.fr/repbio_us.htm Rep\u00e8res biographiques, Fondation Le Corbusier].

In 1922, he and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de S\u00e8vres.<ref name=\"Choay\"/>\nThey set up an architectural practice together.

This was refused by the Decorative Artists Committee. They resigned and founded the Union of Modern Artists (\u201c[[Union des artistes modernes]]\u201d: UAM).\n\nHis theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models. Among these, was the Maison \"Citrohan.\"  The project's name was a reference to the French [[Citro\u00ebn]] automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials Le Corbusier advocated using in the house's construction as well as the way in which he intended the homes would be consumed, similar to other commercial products, like the automobile.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anti-object : the dissolution and disintegration of architecture|last=Kuma, Kengo, 1954-|date=2008|publisher=Architectural Association|others=Architectural Association (Great Britain)|isbn=978-1-902902-52-4|location=London|oclc=67375498}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Maison Citrohan model, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor. The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace. On the exterior Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the fa\u00e7ades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames. Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs. Interior walls also were left white.\n\n==''Toward an Architecture'' (1920\u20131923)==\nIn 1922 and 1923, Le Corbusier devoted himself to advocating his new concepts of architecture and urban planning in a series of polemical articles published in ''L'Esprit Nouveau''. At the Paris Salon d'Automne in 1922, he presented his plan for the [[Ville Contemporaine]], a model city for three million people, whose residents would live and work in a group of identical sixty-story tall apartment buildings surrounded by lower zig-zag apartment blocks and a large park. In 1923, he collected his essays from ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' published his first and most influential book, ''[[Toward an Architecture|Towards an Architecture]]''. He presented his ideas for the future of architecture in a series of maxims, declarations, and exhortations. commencing with \"A grand epoch has just begun. There exists a new spirit. There already exist a crowd of works in the new spirit, they are found especially in industrial production. Architecture is suffocating in its current uses. \"Styles\" are a lie. Style is a unity of principles which animates all the work of a period and which result in a characteristic spirit...Our epoch determines each day its style..-Our eyes, unfortunately don't know how to see it yet,\" and his most famous maxim, \"A house is a machine to live in.\"  Most of the many photographs and drawings in the book came from outside the world of traditional architecture;   the cover showed the promenade deck of an ocean liner, while others showed racing cars, airplanes, factories, and the huge concrete and steel arches of [[zeppelin]] hangars.{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1923|pages=1\u2013150}}\n\n==L'Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1925)==\n[[File:Pavillon L'Esprit Nouveau.jpg|thumb|The Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau (1925)]]\n[[File:Plan Voisin model.jpg|thumb|The model of the [[Plan Voisin]] for the reconstruction of Paris displayed at the Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau]]\n\nAn important early work of Le Corbusier was the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, built for the 1925 Paris [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]], the event which later gave [[Art Deco]] its name. Le Corbusier built the pavilion in collaboration with [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]] and with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant had broken with [[Cubism]] and formed the [[Purism]] movement in 1918 and in 1920 founded their journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau''.  In his new journal, Le Corbusier vividly denounced the decorative arts:  \"Decorative Art, as opposed to the machine phenomenon, is the final twitch of the old manual modes, a dying thing.\"  To illustrate his ideas, he and Ozenfant decided to create small pavilion at the Exposition, representing his idea of the future urban housing unit. A house, he wrote, \"is a cell within the body of a city. The cell is made up of the vital elements which are the mechanics of a house...Decorative art is antistandarizational. Our pavilion will contain only standard things created by industry in factories and mass produced, objects truly of the style of today...my pavilion will therefore be a cell extracted from a huge apartment building.\"{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}\n\nLe Corbusier and his collaborators were given a plot of land located behind the [[Grand Palais]] in the center of the Exposition. The plot was forested, and exhibitors could not cut down trees, so Le Corbusier built his pavilion with a tree in the center, emerging through a hole in the roof. The building was a stark white box with an interior terrace and square glass windows. The interior was decorated with a few cubist paintings and with a few pieces of mass-produced commercially available furniture, entirely different from the expensive, one-of-a-kind pieces in the other pavilions.  The chief organizers of the Exposition were furious, and built a fence to partially hide the pavilion. Le Corbusier had to appeal to the Ministry of Fine Arts, which ordered that fence be taken down.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}\n\nBesides the furniture, the pavilion exhibited a model of his [[Plan Voisin]]  his provocative plan for rebuilding a large part of the centre of Paris. He proposed to bulldoze a large area north of the Seine and replace the narrow streets, monuments and houses with giant sixty-story cruciform towers placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favorable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs. The plan was never seriously considered, but it provoked discussion concerning how to deal with the overcrowded poor working-class neighborhoods of Paris, and it later saw partial realization in the housing developments built in the Paris suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe Pavilion was ridiculed by many critics, but Le Corbusier, undaunted, wrote:  \"Right now one thing is sure. 1925 marks the decisive turning point in the quarrel between the old and new. After 1925, the antique-lovers will have virtually ended their lives . . . Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the 'new'.\"{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=49}}\n\n==''The Decorative Art of Today'' (1925)==\nIn 1925, Le Corbusier combined a series of articles about decorative art from \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" into a book, ''L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'' (''The Decorative Art of Today'').<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif d\u2019aujourd'hui'', Paris, G.

His basic premise, repeated throughout the book, was: \"Modern decorative art has no decoration.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'', (originally 1925, Flammarion edition of 1996, ISBN+978-2-0812-2062-1.</ref>  He attacked with enthusiasm the styles presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts:  \"The desire to decorate everything about one is a false spirit and an abominable small perversion....The religion of beautiful materials is in its final death agony...The almost hysterical onrush in recent years toward this quasi-orgy of decor is only the last spasm of a death already predictable.\"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|page=98}} He cited the 1912 book of the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] \"Ornament and crime\", and quoted Loos's dictum, \"The more a people are cultivated, the more decor disappears.\"   He attacked the deco revival of classical styles, what he called \"Louis Philippe and Louis XVI moderne\";  he condemned the \"symphony of color\" at the Exposition, and called it \"the triumph of assemblers of colors and materials. They were swaggering in colors... They were making stews out of fine cuisine.\"   He condemned the exotic styles presented at the Exposition based on the art of China, Japan, India and Persia.  \"It takes energy today to affirm our western styles.\" He criticized the \"precious and useless objects that accumulated on the shelves\" in the new style. He attacked the \"rustling silks, the marbles which twist and turn, the vermilion whiplashes, the silver blades of Byzantium and the Orient\u2026Let's be done with it!\"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70\u201381}}\n\n\"Why call bottles, chairs, baskets and objects decorative?\" Le Corbusier asked. \"They are useful tools\u2026.Decor is not necessary. Art is necessary.\" He declared that in the future the decorative arts industry would produce only \"objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution, and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style.\"  He described the future of decoration in these terms:  \"The ideal is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign.\" He concluded by repeating \"Modern decoration has no decoration\".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70\u201381}}\n\nThe book became a manifesto for those who opposed the more traditional styles of the decorative arts;  In the 1930s, as Le Corbusier predicted, the modernized versions of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI furniture and the brightly colored wallpapers of stylized roses were replaced by a more sober, more streamlined style.  Gradually the modernism and functionality proposed by Le Corbusier overtook the more ornamental style.  The shorthand titles that Le Corbusier used in the book, ''1925 Expo: Arts Deco'' was adapted in 1966 by the art historian [[Bevis Hillier]] for a catalog of an exhibition on the style, and in 1968 in the title of a book, ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''. And thereafter the term \"Art Deco\" was commonly used as the name of the style.<ref>Benton, Charlotte, Benton, Tim, Wood, Ghislaine, ''Art D\u00e9co dans le monde- 1910\u201339'', 2010, Renaissance du Livre, {{ISBN|9782507003906}}, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Five Points of Architecture to Villa Savoye (1923\u20131931)==\n{{Main|Villa Savoye|Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa La Roche 2013.jpg|The Villa La Roche-Jeanneret (now [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]) in Paris (1923)\nFile:Weissenhofsiedlung.jpg|Corbusier Haus (right) and Citrohan Haus in Weissenhof, Stuttgart, Germany (1927)\nFile:VillaSavoye.jpg|The [[Villa Savoye]] in [[Poissy]] (1928\u20131931)\n</gallery>\n\nThe notoriety that Le Corbusier achieved from his writings and the Pavilion at the 1925 Exposition led to commissions to build a dozen residences in Paris and in the Paris region in his \"purist style.\" These included the [[Maison La Roche|Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret]] (1923\u20131925), which now houses the [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]; the [[Maison Guiette]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium (1926); a residence for [[Jacques Lipchitz]]; the [[Maison Cook]], and the [[Maison Planeix]].  In 1927, he was invited by the German [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] to build three houses in the model city of Weissenhof near [[Stuttgart]], based on the Citrohan House and other theoretical models he had published. He described this project in detail one of his best-known essays, the ''Five Points of Architecture''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=37}}\n\nThe following year he began the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928\u20131931), which became one of the most famous of Le Corbusier's works, and an icon of modernist architecture. Located in [[Poissy]], in a landscape surrounded by trees and large lawn, the house is an elegant white box poised on rows of slender pylons, surrounded by a horizontal band of windows which fill the structure with light. The service areas (parking, rooms for servants and laundry room)  are located under the house.  Visitors enter a vestibule from which a gentle ramp leads to the house itself.  The bedrooms and salons of the house are distributed around a suspended garden;  the rooms look both out at the landscape and into the garden, which provides additional light and air. Another ramp leads up to the roof, and a stairway leads down to the cellar under the pillars.\n\nVilla Savoye succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' and the book ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'', which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by ''[[piloti]]s'', reinforced concrete stilts. These ''pilotis'', in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free fa\u00e7ade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an [[free plan|open floor plan]], meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, and which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the [[roof garden]] to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for a [[promenade architecturale]] through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial \"ocean-liner\" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired.\n\nLe Corbusier was quite rhapsodic when describing the house in ''Pr\u00e9cisions'' in 1930: \"the plan is pure, exactly made for the needs of the house. It has its correct place in the rustic landscape of Poissy.  It is Poetry and lyricism, supported by technique.\"{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}  The house had its problems;  the roof persistently leaked, due to construction faults;  but it became a landmark of modern architecture and one of the best-known works of Le Corbusier.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}\n\n==League of Nations Competition and Pessac Housing Project (1926\u20131930)==\n[[File:Cit\u00e9 Frug\u00e8s, Pessac 03.jpg|thumb|Low-cost housing units built by Le Corbusier in the [[Cit\u00e9 Frug\u00e8s de Pessac|Cit\u00e9 Frug\u00e8s]] in [[Pessac]] (1926)]]\nThanks to his passionate articles in L'Esprit Nouveau, his participation in the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition and the conferences he gave on the new spirit of architecture, Le Corbusier had become well known in the architectural world, though he had only built residences for wealthy clients. In 1926, he entered the competition for the construction of a headquarters for the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva with a plan for an innovative lakeside complex of modernist white concrete office buildings and meeting halls. There were three-hundred thirty seven projects in competition.  It appeared that the Corbusier's project was the first choice of the architectural jury, but after much behind-the scenes maneuvering the jury declared it was unable to pick a single winner, and the project was given instead to the top five architects, who were all neoclassicists. Le Corbusier was not discouraged; he presented his own plans to the public in articles and lectures to show the opportunity that the League of Nations had missed.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=116}}\n\nIn 1927, Le Corbusier received the opportunity he had been looking for; he was commissioned by a Bordeaux industrialist, Henry Frug\u00e8s a fervent admirer of his ideas on urban planning, to build a complex of worker housing, the [[Quartiers Modernes Frug\u00e8s]], at [[Pessac]], near Bordeaux. Le Corbusier described Pessac as \"A little like a Balzac novel\", a chance to create a whole community for living and working. The Fruges quarter became his first laboratory for a residential housing;  a series of rectangular blocks composed of modular housing units located in a garden setting. Like the unit displayed at the 1925 Exposition, each housing unit had its own small terrace.  The earlier villas he constructed all had white exterior walls, but for Pessac, at the request of his clients, he added color; panels of brown, yellow and jade green, coordinated by Le Corbusier. Originally planned to have some two hundred units, it finally contained about fifty to seventy housing units, in eight buildings. Pessac became the model on a small scale for his later and much larger Cit\u00e9 Radieuse projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/arts/architecture-view-le-corbusier-s-housing-project-flexible-enough-endure-ada.html|title=Architecture View; Le Corbusier's Housing Project-Flexible Enough to Endure; by Ada Louise Huxtable|author=|date=15 March 1981|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Founding of CIAM (1928) and Athens Charter==\nIn 1928, Le Corbusier took a major step toward establishing modernist architecture as the dominant European style. Le Corbusier had met with many of the leading German and Austrian modernists during the competition for the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]]. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses;  Le Corbusier and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a ch\u00e2teau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland 26\u201328 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic \"Rational methods for groups of habitations\".  A third meeting, on \"The functional city\", was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Le Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1943 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84\u201385}}\n\n==Moscow projects (1928\u20131934)==\n{{Main|Le Corbusier in the USSR}}\n[[File:Centrosoyuz Moscow - Ak Sakharova view.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], headquarters of Soviet trade unions, Moscow (1928\u201334)]]\n\nLe Corbusier saw the new society founded in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution as a promising laboratory for his architectural ideas. He met the Russian architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] during the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and admired the construction of Melnikov's constructvist USSR pavilion, the only truly modernist building in the Exposition other than his own Esprit Nouveau pavilion. At Melnikov's invitation he traveled to Moscow, where found that his writings had been published in Russian; he gave lectures and interviews, and between 1928 and 1932 he constructed an office building for the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], the headquarters of Soviet trade unions.\n\nIn 1932, he was invited to take part in an international competition for the new [[Palace of the Soviets]] in Moscow, which was to be built on the site of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], demolished on Stalin's orders.  Le Corbusier contributed a highly original plan, a low-level complex of circular and rectangular buildings and a rainbow-like arch from which the roof of the main meeting hall was suspended. To Le Corbusier's distress, his plan was rejected by Stalin in favor of a plan for a massive neoclassical tower, the highest in Europe, crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin.  The Palace was never built;  construction was stopped by World War II, a swimming pool took its place;  and after the collapse of the USSR the cathedral was rebuilt on its original site.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=128}}\n\n==Cit\u00e9 Universitaire, Immeuble Clart\u00e9 and Cit\u00e9 de Refuge (1928\u20131933)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Geneve immeuble Clarte 2011-08-02 13 55 36 PICT3664.JPG|The [[Immeuble Clart\u00e9]] in [[Geneva]] (1930\u20131932)\nFile:La fondation suisse (Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris) n3.jpg|The Swiss Foundation in the [[Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris]] (1929\u20131933)\n</gallery>\nBetween 1928 and 1934, as Le Corbusier's reputation grew, he received commissions to construct a wide variety of buildings. In 1928 he received a commission from the Soviet government to construct the headquarters of the Tsentrosoyuz, or central office of trade unions, a large office building whose glass walls alternated with plaques of stone. He built the Villa de Madrot in [[Le Pradet]] (1929\u20131931); and an apartment in Paris for Charles de Bestigui at the top of an existing building on the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] 1929\u20131932, (later demolished). In 1929\u20131930 he constructed a floating homeless shelter for the Salvation Army on the left bank of the Seine at the [[Pont d'Austerlitz]]. Between 1929 and 1933, he built a larger and more ambitious project for the Salvation Army, the [[Cit\u00e9 de Refuge]], on rue Cantagrel in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.  He also constructed the Swiss Pavilion in the [[Cit\u00e9 Universitaire]] in Paris with 46 units of student housing, (1929\u201333).  He designed furniture to go with the building;  the main salon was decorated with a montage of black-and-white photographs of nature.  In 1948, he replaced this with a colorful mural he painted himself. In Geneva he built a glass-walled apartment building with forty-five units, the [[Immeuble Clart\u00e9]]. Between 1931 and 1945 he built an apartment building with fifteen units, including an apartment and studio for himself on the 6th and 7th floors, at 4 rue Nungesser-et-Coli in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. overlooking the [[Bois de Boulogne]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=210}}  His apartment and studio are owned today by the Fondation Le Corbusier, and can be visited.\n\n==Ville Contemporaine, Plan Voisin and Cit\u00e9 Radieuse (1922\u20131939)==\n{{See also|Unit\u00e9 d'habitation|Ville Radieuse}}\nAs the global [[Great Depression]] enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted more and more time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d'Automne in Paris.  His plan featured tall office towers with surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that \"analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it.\"{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=98}} The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and to replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do.  The plan included a multi-level transportation hub that included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: \"The center of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is in reality a diamond mine...To abandon the center of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy.\" {{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=100}}\n\nAs no doubt Le Corbusier expected, no one hurried to implement the Plan Voisin, but he continued working on variations of the idea and recruiting followers. In 1929, he traveled to Brazil where he gave conferences on his architectural ideas. He returned with drawings of his own vision for Rio de Janeiro; he sketched serpentine multi-story apartment buildings on pylons, like inhabited highways, winding through [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\nIn 1931, he developed a visionary plan for another city [[Algiers]], then part of France.  This plan, like his Rio Janeiro plan, called for the construction of an elevated viaduct of concrete, carrying residential units, which would run from one end of the city to the other. This plan, unlike his early Plan Voisin, was more conservative, because it did not call for the destruction of the old city of Algiers; the residential housing would be over the top of the old city.  This plan, like his Paris plans, provoked discussion, but never came close to realization.\n\nIn 1935, Le Corbusier made his first visit to the United States. He was asked by American journalists what he thought about New York City skyscrapers; he responded, characteristically, that he found them \"much too small\".<ref>Time Magazine, article on Man of the Year, 5 May 1961</ref>  He wrote a book describing his experiences in the States, ''Quand les Cath\u00e9drales etait blanc-  voyages au pays des timides'' (When Cathedrals were White; voyage to the land of the timid) whose title expressed his view of the lack of boldness in American architecture.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=218}}\n\nHe wrote a great deal but built very little in the late 1930s.  The titles of his books expressed the combined urgency and optimism of his messages: ''Cannons? Munitions? No thank you, Lodging please!'' (1938) and ''The lyricism of modern times and urbanism'' (1939).\n\nIn 1928, the French Minister of Labour, [[Louis Loucheur]], won the passage of a French law on public housing, calling for the construction of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project.  These units were {{convert|45|m2|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, made with metal frames, and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors.  The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the ''Ville Radieuse'' or \"radiant city\", in a new book which published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principle functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be clearly separated into their own neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.\n\n==World War II and Reconstruction; [[Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation]] in Marseille (1939\u20131952)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:M\u00f3dulo de vivienda tipo de Unit\u00e9 d\u00b4Habitation.jpg|The modular design of the apartments inserted into the building\nFile:Cit\u00e9 radieuse.

He moved to [[Vichy]] for a time, where the collaborationist government of Marshal [[Philippe Petain]] was located, offering his services for architectural projects, including his plan for the reconstruction of Algiers, but they were rejected. He continued writing, completing ''Sur les Quatres routes'' (On the Four Routes) in 1941. After 1942, Le Corbusier left Vichy for Paris.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|pages=244\u2013246}}  He became for a time a technical adviser at [[Alexis Carrel]]'s eugenic foundation, he resigned from this position on 20 April 1944.<ref name=Libe>{{cite journal|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/2015/03/18/le-corbusier-plus-facho-que-fada_1223411|title=Le Corbusier plus facho que fada|journal=Liberation|date= 18 March 2015|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref> In 1943, he founded a new association of modern architects and builders, the Ascoral, the Assembly of Constructors for a renewal of architecture, but there were no projects to build.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=215}}\n\nWhen the war ended, Le Corbusier was nearly sixty years old, and he had not had a single project realized in ten years. He tried, without success, to obtain commissions for several of the first large reconstruction projects, but his proposals for the reconstruction of the town of [[Saint-Di\u00e9]] and for [[La Rochelle]] were rejected. Still, he persisted; Le Corbusier finally found a willing partner in [[Raoul Dautry]], the new Minister of Reconstruction and Urbanism. Dautry agreed to fund one of his projects, a \"[[Unit\u00e9 d'habitation|Unit\u00e9 d'habitation de grandeur conforme]]\", or housing units of standard size, with the first one to be built in [[Marseille]], which had been heavily damaged during the war.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=143}}\n\nThis was his first public commission, and was a major breakthrough for Le Corbusier. He gave the building the name of his pre-war theoretical project, the ''Cit\u00e9 Radieuse'', and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, he proposed a giant reinforced concrete framework, into which modular apartments would be fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 people. Each module was three stories high, and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran from one side of the building to the other, and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the ventilator shafts on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.\n\nThe building was designed not just to be a residence, but to offer all the services needed for living. Every third floor, between the modules, there was a wide corridor, like an interior street, which ran the length of the building from one end of the building to the other. This served as a sort of commercial street, with shops, eating places, a nursery school and recreational facilities. A running track and small stage for theater performances was located in the roof. The building itself was surrounded by trees and a small park.\n\nLe Corbusier wrote later that the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation concept was inspired by the visit he had made to the [[Florence Charterhouse]] at [[Galluzzo]] in Italy, in 1907 and 1910 during his early travels. He wanted to recreate, he wrote, an ideal place \"for meditation and contemplation.\"  He also learned from the monastery, he wrote, that \"standardization led to perfection,\" and that \"all of his life a man labours under this impulse: to make the home the temple of the family.\"{{sfn|Journel|2015|page=139}}\n\nThe Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation marked a turning point in the career of Le Corbusier; in 1952, he was made a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour|L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] in a ceremony held on the roof of his new building. He had progressed from being an outsider and critic of the architectural establishment to its centre, as the most prominent French architect.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=152\u2013158}}\n\n==Postwar projects, United Nations headquarters (1947\u20131952)==\n[[File:67\u00ba Per\u00edodo de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|right|The [[headquarters of the United Nations]] designed by Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Wallace K.

In the post-Second World War decades Le Corbusier\u2019s fame moved beyond architectural and planning circles as he became one of the leading intellectual figures of the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=426}}</ref> \n\nIn early 1947 Le Corbusier submitted a design for the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], which was to be built beside the East River in New York. Instead of competition, the design was to be selected by a Board of Design Consultants composed of leading international architects nominated by member governments, including Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] of Brazil, [[Howard Robertson (architect)|Howard Robertson]] from Britain, Nikolai Bassov of the Soviet Union, and five others from around the world. The committee was under the direction of the American architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], who was also architect for the Rockefeller family, which had donated the site for the building.\n\nLe Corbusier had submitted his plan for the Secretariat, called Plan 23 of the 58 submitted. In Le Corbusier's plan offices, council chambers and General Assembly hall were in a single block in the center of the site.  He lobbied hard for his project, and asked the younger Brazilian architect, Niemeyer, to support and assist him on his plan. Niemeyer, to help Le Corbusier, refused to submit his own design and did not attend the meetings until the Director, Harrison, insisted. Niemeyer then submitted his plan, Plan 32, with the office building and councils and General Assembly in separate buildings. After much discussion, the Committee chose Niemeyer's plan, but suggested that he collaborate with Le Corbusier on the final project. Le Corbusier urged Niemeyer to put the General Assembly Hall in the center of the site, though this would eliminate Niemeyer's plan to have a large plaza in the center. Niemeyer agreed with Le Corbusier's suggestion, and the headquarters was built, with minor modifications, according to their joint plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archives.un.org/content/oscar-niemeyer-and-united-nations-headquarters |title=Oscar Niemeyer and the United Nations Headquarters (1947\u20131949) |work=[[United Nations]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Religious architecture (1950\u20131963)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:RonchampCorbu.jpg|The [[Notre Dame du Haut|chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] in [[Ronchamp]] (1950\u20131955)\nFile:Sainte Marie de La Tourette 2007.jpg|The convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] near [[Lyon]] (1953\u20131960)\nFile:Couvent de la Tourette - 11.JPG|Meeting room inside the Convent of Sainte Marie de la Tourette\nFile:EgliseSaintPierreLeCorbusierFirminy.jpg|[[Saint-Pierre, Firminy|Church of Saint-Pierre]], [[Firminy]] (1960\u20132006)\nFile:Church @ Firminy, France.jpg|Interior of the Church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy.

In the postwar years, he designed two important religious buildings; the [[Notre Dame du Haut|chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]] (1950\u20131955); and the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] (1953\u20131960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, P\u00e8re Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.\n\nLe Corbusier first visited the remote mountain site of Ronchamp in May 1950, saw the ruins of the old chapel, and drew sketches of possible forms. He wrote afterwards: \"In building this chapel, I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of prayer, of interior joy. The feeling of the sacred animated our effort.  Some things are sacred, others aren't, whether they're religious or not.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Ronchamp'', Hatje, Stuttgart, (1925), p. 25.</ref>\n\nThe second major religious project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in [[L'Arbresle]] in the Rhone Department (1953\u20131960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier to visit the starkly simple and imposing 12th\u201313th century [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns.  For the living space he used the same [[Modulor]] concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of {{convert|2.26|m|abbr=off}}; and width {{convert|1.83|m|abbr=off}}.{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|pages=154\u201355}}\n\nLe Corbusier used raw concrete to construct the convent, which is placed on the side of a hill.  The three blocks of dormitories U, closed by the chapel, with a courtyard in the center. The Convent has a flat roof, and is placed on sculpted concrete pillars. Each of the residential cells has small loggia with a concrete sunscreen looking out at the countryside.  The centerpiece of the convent is the chapel, a plain box of concrete, which he called his \"Box of miracles.\"  Unlike the highly finished fa\u00e7ade of the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation, the fa\u00e7ade of the chapel is raw, unfinished concrete. He described the building in a letter to [[Albert Camus]] in 1957: \"I'm taken with the idea of a \"box of miracles\"....as the name indicates, it is a rectangual box made of concrete. It doesn't have any of the traditional theatrical tricks, but the possibility, as its name suggests, to make miracles.\"<ref>Letter to Albert Camus, 13 February 1957, FLC (Fondation Le Corbusier), E1-12-154)</ref> The interior of the chapel is extremely simple, only benches in a plain, unfinished concrete box, with light coming through a single square in the roof and six small band on the sides. The Crypt beneath has intense blue, red and yellow walls, and illumination by sunlight channeled from above.  The monastery has other unusual features, including floor to ceiling panels of glass in the meeting rooms, window panels that fragmented the view into pieces, and a system of concrete and metal tubes like gun barrels which aimed sunlight through colored prisms and projected it onto the walls of sacristy and to the secondary altars of the crypt on the level below. These were whimsically termed the \"\"machine guns\" of the sacristy and the \"light cannons\" of the crypt.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=184\u2013185}}\n\nIn 1960, Le Corbusier began a third religious building, the Church of Saint Pierre in the new town of Firminy-Vert, where he had built a Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation and a cultural and sports centre. While he made the original design, construction did not begin until five years after his death, and work continued under different architects until it was completed in 2006. The most spectacular feature of the church is the sloping concrete tower that covers the entire interior. similar to that in the Assembly Building in his complex at [[Chandigarh]]. Windows high in the tower illuminate the interior. Le Corbusier originally proposed that tiny windows also project the form of a constellation on the walls. Later architects designed the church to project the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|page=165}}\n\n==Chandigarh (1951\u20131956)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chandigarh High Court.jpg|The High Court of Justice, Chandigarh (1951\u20131956)\nFile:Chandigarh Secretariat.jpg|Secretariat Building, Chandigarh (1952\u20131958)\nFile:Palace of Assembly Chandigarh 2006.jpg|[[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)]] (1952\u20131961)\nFile:Chandigarh High Court sun.jpg|[[Punjab and Haryana High Court|Chandigarh High Court]]\n</gallery>\nLe Corbusier's largest and most ambitious project was the design of [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] States of India, created after India received independence in 1947. Le Corbusier was contacted in 1950 by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and invited to propose a project. An American architect, [[Albert Mayer (planner)|Albert Mayer]], had made a plan in 1947 for a city of 150,000 inhabitants, but the Indian government wanted a grander and more monumental city. Corbusier worked on the plan with two British specialists in urban design and tropical climate architecture, [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], and with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, who moved to India and supervised the construction until his death.\n\nLe Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic about his project; \"It will be a city of trees,\" he wrote, \"of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those at the time of Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of mathematics will reign.\".<ref>Letter to his wife Yvonne, 27 February 1951, FLC-R1-12-87. Cited by Journel, p. 182.</ref>  His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and a transportation infrastructure.  In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}  From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, \"Like a forced laborer.\" He dismissed the earlier American plan as \"Faux-Moderne\" and overly filled with parking spaces roads. His intent was to present what he had learned in forty years of urban study, and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}} His design made use of many of his favorite ideas: an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the [[Modulor]] to give a correct human scale to each element; and his favourite symbol, the open hand (\"The hand is open to give and to receive\"). He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nLe Corbusier's design called for the use of raw concrete, whose surface not smoothed or polished and which showed the marks of the forms in which it dried. Pierre Jeanneret wrote to his cousin that he was in a continual battle with the construction workers, who could not resist the urge to smooth and finish the raw concrete, particularly when important visitors were coming to the site. At one point one thousand workers were employed on the site of the High Court of Justice.  Le Corbusier wrote to his mother, \"It is an architectural symphony which surpasses all my hopes, which flashes and develops under the light in a way which is unimaginable and unforgettable. From far, from up close, it provokes astonishment; all made with raw concrete and a cement cannon. Adorable, and grandiose. In all the centuries no one has seen that.\"<ref>letter to his mother, 19 November 1954, FLC-R2-103. Cited by Journlet, p. 184.</ref>\n\nThe High Court of Justice, begun in 1951, was finished in 1956. The building was radical in its design; a parallelogram topped with an inverted parasol.  Along the walls were high concrete grills {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=off}} thick which served as sunshades. The entry featured a monumental ramp and columns that allowed the air to circulate.  The pillars were originally white limestone, but in the 1960s they were repainted in bright colors, which better resisted the weather.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nThe Secretariat, the largest building that housed the government offices, was constructed between 1952 and 1958.  It is an enormous block {{convert|250|m|abbr=off}} long and eight levels high, served by a ramp which extends from the ground to the top level. The ramp was designed to be partly sculptural and partly practical. Since there were no modern building cranes at the time of construction, the ramp was the only way to get materials to the top of the construction site. The Secretariat had two features which were borrowed from his design for the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille: concrete grill sunscreens over the windows and a roof terrace.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nThe most important building of the capitol complex was the [[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)|Palace of Assembly]] (1952\u201361), which faced the High Court at the other end of a five hundred meter esplanade with a large reflecting pool in the front. This building features a central courtyard, over which is the main meeting hall for the Assembly.  On the roof on the rear of the building is a signature feature of Le Corbusier, a large tower, similar in form to the smokestack of a ship or the ventilation tower of a heating plant. Le Corbusier added touches of color and texture with an immense tapestry in the meeting hall and large gateway decorated with enamel.  He wrote of this building, \"A Palace magnificent in its effect, from the new art of raw concrete. It is magnificent and terrible; terrible meaning that there is nothing cold about it to the eyes.\"<ref>Letter to his brother Albert, 26 March 1961, FLC-R1-10-586, cited by Journel, p. 185.</ref>\n\n==Later life and work (1955\u20131965)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:National museum of western art05s3200.jpg|The [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo (1954\u20131959)\nFile:Carpenter center.jpg|[[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] (1960\u20131963)\nFile:Centre Le Corbusier - 'Teich' - Blatterwiese 2013-09-21 17-48-26.JPG|The [[Centre Le Corbusier]] in Z\u00fcrich (1962\u20131967)\n</gallery>\nThe 1950s and 1960s, were a difficult period for Le Corbusier's personal life;  his wife Yvonne died in 1957, and his mother, to whom he was closely attached, died in 1960. He remained active in a wide variety of fields; in 1955 he published ''Po\u00e9me de l'angle droits'', a portfolio of lithographs, published in the same collection as the book ''Jazz'' by [[Henri Matisse]]. In 1958 he collaborated with the composer [[Edgar Var\u00e8se]] on a work called ''Le [[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]]'', a show of sound and light, for the Philips Pavilion at the International Exposition in Brussels. In 1960 he published a new book, ''L'Atelier de la recherch\u00e9 patiente'' ''The workshop of patient research''), simultaneously published in four languages.  He received growing recognition for his pioneering work in modernist architecture;  in 1959, a successful international campaign was launched to have his Villa Savoye, threatened with demolition, declared an historic monument; it was the first time that a work by a living architect received this distinction.  In 1962, in the same year as the dedication of the Palace of the Assembly in Chandigarh, the first retrospective exhibit on his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1964, in a ceremony held in his atelier on rue de S\u00e8vres, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Culture Minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}\n\nHis later architectural work was extremely varied, and often based on designs of earlier projects. In 1952\u20131958, he designed a series of tiny vacation cabins, {{convert|2.26|x|2.26|x|2.6|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, for a site next to the Mediterranean at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]. He built a similar cabin for himself, but the rest of the project was not realized until after his death. In 1953\u20131957, he designed a residential building for Brazilian students for the Cit\u00e9 de la Universit\u00e9 in Paris. Between 1954 and 1959, he built the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo. His other projects included a cultural centre and stadium for the town of [[Firminy]], where he had built his first housing project (1955\u20131958); and a stadium in Baghdad, Iraq (much altered since its construction).  He also constructed three new ''Unit\u00e9s d'Habitation'', apartment blocks on the model of the original in Marseille, the first in Berlin (1956\u20131958), the second in Briey-en-For\u00eat in the [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] Department; and the third (1959\u20131967) in Firminy.  In 1960\u20131963, he built his only building in the United States; the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}\n\nAt the time of his death in 1965, several projects were on the drawing boards; the church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy, finally completed in modified form in 2006; a Palace of Congresses for Strasbourg (1962\u201365), and a hospital in Venice, (1961\u20131965) which were never built. Le Corbusier designed an art gallery beside the lake in Z\u00fcrich for gallery owner [[Heidi Weber]] in 1962\u20131967. Now called the [[Centre Le Corbusier]], it is one of his last finished works.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=212}}\n\n==Estate==\n[[File:Cabanon Le Corbusier.jpg|thumb|The holiday cabin where he spent his last days in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]]]\n\nThe Fondation Le Corbusier (FLC) functions as his official estate.<ref name=foundation>{{cite web|title=Foundation: History|url=http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysId=19&IrisObjectId=7778&sysLanguage=en-en&itemPos=1&sysParentId=19&clearQuery=1|publisher=Fondation Le Corbusier |accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> The US copyright representative for the Fondation Le Corbusier is the [[Artists Rights Society]].<ref name=rights>{{cite web|url=http://arsny.com/requested.html |title=Our Most Frequently Requested Prominent Artists |publisher=Artists Rights Society |year=2003 |accessdate=18 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131000000/http://arsny.com/requested.html |archivedate=31 January 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Ideas==\n===''The Five Points of a Modern Architecture''===\n{{Main|Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture}}\nLe Corbusier defined the principles of his new architecture in ''Les cinq points de l'architecture moderne'', published in 1927, and co-authored by his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]].  They summarized the lessons he had learned in the previous years, which he put literally into concrete form in his villas constructed of the late 1920s, most dramatically in the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928\u20131931)\n\nThe five points are:\n\n* The '''Pilotis''', or pylon. The building is raised up on reinforced concrete pylons, which allows for free circulation on the ground level, and eliminates dark and damp parts of the house.\n* The '''Roof Terrace'''. The sloping roof is replaced by a flat roof; the roof can be used as a garden, for promenades, sports or a swimming pool.\n* The '''Free Plan'''. Load-bearing walls are replaced by steel or reinforced concrete columns, so the interior can be freely designed, and interior walls can put anywhere, or left out entirely. The structure of the building is not visible from the outside.\n* The '''Ribbon Window'''. Since the walls do not support the house, the windows can run the entire length of the house, so all rooms can get equal light.\n* The '''Free Fa\u00e7ade'''. Since the building is supported by columns in the interior, the fa\u00e7ade can be much lighter and more open, or made entirely of glass. There is no need for lintels or other structure around the windows.\n\n===\"Architectural Promenade\"===\nThe \"Architectural Promenade\" was another idea dear to Le Corbusier, which he particularly put into play in his design of the [[Villa Savoye]]. In 1928, in ''Une Maison, un Palais'', he described it: \"Arab architecture gives us a precious lesson: it is best appreciated in walking, on foot. It is in walking, in going from one place to another, that you see develop the features of the architecture. In this house ([[Villa Savoye]]) you find a veritable architectural promenade, offering constantly varying aspects, unexpected, sometimes astonishing.\" The promenade at Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier wrote, both in the interior of the house and on the roof terrace, often erased the traditional difference between the inside and outside.<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Une maison \u2013 un palais'', G. Cr\u00e8s & Cie (1928), pp. 70\u201378</ref>\n\n===''Ville Radieuse'' and Urbanism===\nIn the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in ''[[Ville Radieuse|La Ville radieuse]]'' (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position.{{Sfn|Fishman|1982|p=231}} Some have read dark overtones into ''The Radiant City'': from the \"astonishingly beautiful assemblage of buildings\" that was Stockholm, for example, Le Corbusier saw only \"frightening chaos and saddening monotony.\" He dreamed of \"cleaning and purging\" the city, bringing \"a calm and powerful architecture\"\u2014referring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete. Although Le Corbusier's designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly \"destroyed\" the city with them.<ref name=dalrymple>{{cite journal|last=Dalrymple|first=Theodore|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian: Le Corbusier's baleful influence|journal=City Journal|date=Autumn 2009 |volume=19 |issue=4|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient [[Scientific management|Taylorist]] and [[Fordism|Fordist]] strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society. As Norma Evenson has put it, \"the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient.\"<ref name=evenson>{{cite book|last=Evenson|first=Norma|title=Le Corbusier: The Machine and the Grand Design|publisher=George Braziller|location=New York|year=1969|page=7}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier \"His ideas\u2014his urban planning and his architecture\u2014are viewed separately,\" Perelman noted, \"whereas they are one and the same thing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-books-claim-le-corbusier-fascist-289334|title=New Books Claim Le Corbusier Was a Fascist|last=Munro|first=Cait|date=17 April 2005|website=Artnet news|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn ''La Ville radieuse'', he conceived an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|page=228}}\n\nLe Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. There is a noteworthy resemblance between the concept of the unit\u00e9 and Fourier's [[phalanstery]].<ref name=serenyi>{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Serenyi|title=Le Corbusier, Fourier, and the Monastery of Ema|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=49|number=4|date=December 1967|page=282|doi=10.2307/3048487|jstor=3048487}}</ref> From Fourier, Le Corbusier adopted at least in part his notion of administrative, rather than political, government.\n\n===Modulor===\n{{Main|Modulor}}\n\nThe [[Modulor]] was a standard model of the human form which Le Corbusier devised to determine the correct amount of living space needed for residents in his buildings. It was also his rather original way of dealing with differences between the metric system and British or American system, since the Modulor was not attached to either one.\n\nLe Corbusier explicitly used the [[golden ratio]] in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s \"[[Vitruvian Man]]\", the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the [[golden ratio]], Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. Many scholars see the Modulor as a humanistic expression but it is also argued that: \"It's exactly the opposite (...) It's the mathematicization of the body, the standardization of the body, the rationalization of the body.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/arts/design/le-corbusiers-architecture-and-his-politics-are-revisited.html|title=New York Times|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=12 July 2015|website=nytimes.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHe took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.\n\nLe Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.<ref name=padovan>{{cite book|last=Padovan|first=Richard|title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture|date=2 November 1999|page=320|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-419-22780-9|quote=from Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.35: \"Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section.\"}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier placed systems of harmony and proportion at the centre of his design philosophy, and his faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden section and the Fibonacci series, which he described as \"rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in Man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages, and the learned.\"{{sfn|padovan|1999|page=316}}\n\n===Open Hand===\n[[File:Open Hand Monument in Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|''[[Open Hand Monument]]'' in Chandigarh, India]]\n\nThe Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\" The largest of the many Open Hand sculptures that Le Corbusier created is a {{convert|26|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} version in Chandigarh, India known as ''[[Open Hand Monument]]''.\n\n==Furniture==\n{{Main|Le Corbusier's Furniture}}\n\nLe Corbusier was an eloquent critic of the finely crafted, hand-made furniture, made with rare and exotic woods, inlays and coverings, presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts. Following his usual method, Le Corbusier first wrote a book with his theories of furniture, complete with memorable slogans.  In his 1925 book ''L'Art D\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'', he called for furniture that used inexpensive materials and could be mass-produced. Le Corbusier described three different furniture types: ''type-needs'', ''type-furniture'', and ''human-limb objects''. He defined human-limb objects as: \"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony\".  He further declared, \"Chairs are architecture, sofas are [[bourgeois]]\",\n[[File:LC4 Chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand 1927-28.jpg|thumb|Frame of an LC4 chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand (1927\u201328) at Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris]]\nLe Corbusier first relied on ready-made furniture from Thonet to furnish his projects, such as his pavilion at the 1925 Exposition.  In 1928, following the publication of his theories, he began experimenting with furniture design.  In 1928, he invited the architect [[Charlotte Perriand]] to join his studio as a furniture designer. His cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]], also collaborated on many of the designs. For the manufacture of his furniture, he turned to the German firm [[Gebr\u00fcder Thonet]], which had begun making chairs with tubular steel, a material originally used for bicycles, in the early 1920s. Le Corbusier admired the design of [[Marcel Breuer]] and the [[Bauhaus]], who in 1925 had begun making sleek modern tubular club chairs. [[Mies van der Rohe]] had begun making his own version in a sculptural curved form with a cane seat in 1927.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=382}}\n\nThe first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three types of chairs made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames: The [[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|LC4]], Chaise Longue, (1927\u201328), with a covering of cowhide, which gave it a touch of exoticism; the ''Fauteuil Grand Confort'' (LC3) (1928\u201329), a club chair with a tubular frame which resembled the comfortable Art Deco club chairs that became popular in the 1920s; and the ''Fauteuil \u00e0 dossier basculant'' (LC4) (1928\u201329), a low seat suspended in a tubular steel frame, also with a cowhide upholstery. These chairs were designed specifically for two of his projects, the ''Maison la Roche'' in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. All three clearly showed the influence of Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. The line of furniture was expanded with additional designs for Le Corbusier's 1929 ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' installation, 'Equipment for the Home'. Despite the intention of Le Corbusier that his furniture should be inexpensive and mass-produced, his pieces were originally costly to make and were not mass-produced until many years later, when he was famous. {{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=383}}\n\n==Politics==\nThe political views of Le Corbusier were rather variable over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In the 1920s, he co-founded and contributed articles about urbanism to the fascist journals ''Plans'', ''Pr\u00e9lude'' and ''L'Homme R\u00e9el''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brott|first=Simone|date=2013|title=In the Shadow of the Enlightenment Le Corbusier, Le Faisceau and Georges Valois|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand|volume=2|issue=30|pages=777\u2013789|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/63644/|quote=\"his contribution to three fascist revues: Plans, Pr\u00e9lude and L\u2019Homme R\u00e9el\"}}</ref><ref name=\"simone 2\">{{Cite journal |last=Brott |first=Simone |date=2017-12-08 |title=The Le Corbusier Scandal, or, was Le Corbusier a Fascist? |journal=Fascism |language=en |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=196\u2013227 |doi=10.1163/22116257-00602003 |issn=2211-6249|doi-access=free }}</ref> He also penned pieces in favour of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] for those journals, as well as \"hateful editorials\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11543431/Le-Corbusier-was-militant-fascist-two-new-books-on-French-architect-claim.html |title=Le Corbusier was 'militant fascist', two new books on French architect claim |last=Samuel |first=Henry |date=2015-04-16 |quote=\"Mr Jarcy said that in \"Plans\" Le Corbusier wrote in support of Nazi anti-Semitism and in \"Prelude\" co-wrote \"hateful editorials\"}}</ref> Between 1925 and 1928, Le Corbusier had connections to [[Le Faisceau]], a short-lived French fascist party led by [[Georges Valois]].

In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, particularly the redesign of [[Marseille]] after its Jewish population had been forcefully removed,<ref name=\"simone 2\" /> he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Alexis Carrel]], a [[eugenics|eugenicist]] surgeon, appointed Le Corbusier to the Department of Bio-Sociology of the ''Foundation for the Study of Human Problems'', an institute promoting eugenics policies under the Vichy regime.<ref name=\"simone 2\" />\n\nLe Corbusier has been accused of anti-semitism. He wrote to his mother in October 1940, prior to a referendum held by the Vichy government: \"The Jews are having a bad time. I occasionally feel sorry. But it appears their blind lust for money has rotted the country\". He was also accused of belittling the Muslim population of Algeria, then part of France. When Le Corbusier proposed a plan for the rebuilding of Algiers, he condemned the existing housing for European Algerians, complaining that it was inferior to that inhabited by indigenous Algerians: \"the civilized live like rats in holes\", while \"the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being.\"<ref name=celik>{{cite book|last=Celik|first=Zeynep|title=Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers under French Rule|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=28 July 1997|page=4|isbn=978-0520204577|accessdate=}}</ref>  His plan for rebuilding Algiers was rejected, and thereafter Le Corbusier mostly avoided politics.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Antliff|first=Mark |title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909\u20131939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADTdniFtnuwC|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-9047-3}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nFew other 20th-century architects were praised, or criticized, as much as Le Corbusier. In his eulogy to Le Corbusier at the memorial ceremony for the architect in the courtyard of the Louvre on 1 September 1965, French Culture Minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] declared, \"Le Corbusier had some great rivals, but none of them had the same significance in the revolution of architecture, because none bore insults so patiently and for so long.\"<ref>Andr\u00e9 Malraux, funeral oration for Le Corbusier, 1 September 1965, cited in Journal (2015), p. 3.1</ref>\n\nLater criticism of Le Corbusier was directed at his ideas of urban planning. In 1998 the architectural historian [[Witold Rybczynski]] wrote in ''Time'' magazine: <blockquote> \"He called it the Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City. Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic. Wherever it was tried\u2014in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers\u2014it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan, socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighborhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy.\"<ref>Rybcznski, Witold, ''Time'' magazine, 8 June 1998.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[:Category:Historians of technology|Technological historian]] and architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] wrote in ''Yesterday's City of Tomorrow'' that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier's skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities. The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter. By \"mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had, in fact, produced a sterile hybrid.\"\n\nThe public housing projects influenced by his ideas have been criticized for isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community's development. One of his most influential detractors has been [[Jane Jacobs]], who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier's urban design theories in her seminal work ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.\n\nFor some critics, the urbanism of Le Corbusier's was the model for a fascist state.<ref>{{Cite book\n            |chapter=La Cit\u00e9 francaise: George Valois, Le Corbusier, and Fascist Theories of Urbanism\n            |pages=134\u2013170\n            |last=Antliff\n            |first=Mark\n            |title=Fascist Visions: Art and Ideology in France and Italy\n            |editor1-last=Antliff\n            |editor1-first=Mark\n            |editor2-last=Affron\n            |editor2-first=Matthew\n            |publisher=Princeton University Press\n            |year=1997\n            |isbn=978-0-691027388\n            |location=\n            |via=}}</ref> These critics cited Le Corbusier himself when he wrote that \"not all citizens could become leaders.

He thought that industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape. He was a leader of the modernist movement to create better living conditions and a better society through housing. [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s ''Garden Cities of Tomorrow'' heavily influenced Le Corbusier and his contemporaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=FITTING|first=PETER|date=2002|title=Urban Planning/Utopian Dreaming: Le Corbusier's Chandigarh Today|journal=Utopian Studies|volume=13|issue=1|pages=69\u201393|issn=1045-991X|jstor=20718410}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier revolutionized [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/le-corbusier-1483|title=Le Corbusier (Charles-Edouard Jeanneret) 1887-1965|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref>  One of the first to realize how the [[automobile]] would change human society, Le Corbusier conceived the city of the future with large apartment buildings isolated in a park-like setting on [[piloti]]s.

In Great Britain urban planners turned to Le Corbusier's \"Cities in the Sky\" as a cheaper method of building public housing from the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pash-living.co.uk/blog/contemporary-designers/le-corbusier-enfant-terrible-of-modernist-architecture.html|title=Le Corbusier \u2013 enfant terrible of Modernist Architecture? / Pash Living Blog|author=|date=|work=pash-living.co.uk}}</ref> Le Corbusier criticized any effort at ornamentation of the buildings. The large spartan structures in cities, but not part of it, have been criticized for being boring and unfriendly to pedestrians.<ref>The Most Important People of the 20th Century (Part-II): Artists & Entertainers, Page 144</ref>\n\nSeveral of the many architects who worked for Le Corbusier in his studio became prominent, including painter-architect [[Nadir Afonso]], who absorbed Le Corbusier's ideas into his own aesthetics theory. [[L\u00facio Costa]]'s [[urban planning|city plan]] of [[Bras\u00edlia]] and the industrial city of [[Zl\u00edn]] planned by [[Franti\u0161ek Lydie Gahura]] in the Czech Republic are based on his ideas.  Le Corbusier's thinking had profound effects on city planning and architecture in the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivist]] era.\n\nLe Corbusier harmonized and lent credence to the idea of space as a set of destinations between which mankind moved continuously.  He gave credibility to the automobile as transporter, and to freeways in urban spaces. His philosophies were useful to urban real estate developers in the American post-World War II period because they justified and lent intellectual support to the desire to raze traditional urban space for high density, high profit urban concentration. The freeways connected this new urbanism to low density, low cost, highly profitable suburban locales available to be developed for middle class single-family housing.\n\nMissing from this scheme of movement was connectivity between isolated urban villages created for lower-middle and working classes, and the destination points in Le Corbusier's plan: suburban and rural areas, and urban commercial centers. The freeways as designed traveled over, at, or beneath grade levels of the living spaces of the urban poor, for example the [[Cabrini\u2013Green]] housing project in Chicago. Such projects with no freeway exit ramps, cut off by freeway rights-of-way, became isolated from jobs and services concentrated at Le Corbusier's nodal transportation end points. As jobs migrated to the suburbs, urban village dwellers found themselves without freeway access points in their communities or public mass transit that could economically reach suburban job centers. Late in the post-War period, suburban job centers found labor shortages to be such a critical problem that they sponsored urban-to-suburban shuttle bus services to fill vacant working class and lower-middle class jobs, which did not typically pay enough to afford car ownership.\n<!--NOTE: highly editorialized presentation (\"prophet who could do no wrong\", \"incompetence\", \"Machiavellian\", \"absurd\") -- use neutral tone and include citations or quotes if appropriate.. Le Corbusier deliberately created a myth about himself and was revered in his lifetime, and after death, by a generation of followers who believed Le Corbusier was a prophet who could do no wrong. But in the 1950s the first doubts began to appear, notably in some essays by his greatest admirers such as [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Colin Rowe]], who denounced as catastrophic his ideas on the city. Later critics revealed his technical incompetence as an architect. In his book ''Arm\u00e9e du Salut'', Brian Brace Taylor went into great detail about Le Corbusier's Machiavellian activities to create this commission for himself, his many ill-judged design decisions about building technologies, and the sometimes absurd solutions he then proposed. -->\n<!--NOTE: We cannot say \"more recently\" -- that's [[WP:DATED]]. We cannot says \"there has been much discussion\" -- we have to say WHO discussed this and GIVE A CITATION.   More recently still there has been much discussion about Le Corbusier's right-wing politics, and his open flirtation with Fascism in the 1930s, when he tried to persuade Benito Mussolini to commission him to design a new capital city for Ethiopia after Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935 using nerve-gas, in breach of League of Nations rules.-->\n\nLe Corbusier influenced architects and urbanists worldwide.

It now owns Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (which form the foundation's headquarters), as well as the apartment occupied by Le Corbusier from 1933 to 1965 at rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris 16e, and the \"Small House\" he built for his parents in [[Corseaux]] on the shores of [[Lac Leman]] (1924).\n\nMaison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (1923\u201324), also known as the La Roche-Jeanneret house, is a pair of semi-detached houses that was Le Corbusier's third commission in Paris. They are laid out at right angles to each other, with iron, concrete, and blank, white fa\u00e7ades setting off a curved two-story gallery space. Maison La Roche is now a museum containing about 8,000 original drawings, studies and plans by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with [[Pierre Jeanneret]] from 1922 to 1940), as well as about 450 of his paintings, about 30 enamels, about 200 other works on paper, and a sizable collection of written and photographic archives.

He was born in [[Switzerland]] and became a [[France|French citizen]] in 1930. His career spanned five decades, and he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, and North and South America.\n\nDedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM). Le Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of [[Chandigarh]] in [[India]], and contributed specific designs for several buildings there, specially the government buildings.\n\nOn 17 July 2016, seventeen projects by Le Corbusier in seven countries were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as [[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier|The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1528/|title=The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life (1887\u20131904)==\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, Still Life, oil on canvas, 80.9 x 99.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|80.9|x|99.7|cm|1|abbr=on}}, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]\n\nCharles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret was born on 6 October 1887 in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], a small city in the French-speaking [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel canton]] in north-western Switzerland, in the [[Jura mountains]], {{convert|5|km|mi}} across the border from France. It was an industrial town, devoted to manufacturing watches. (He adopted the pseudonym ''Le Corbusier'' in 1920.) His father was an artisan who enameled boxes and watches, and his mother taught piano. His elder brother Albert was an amateur violinist.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  He attended a kindergarten that used [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Fr\u00f6belian]] methods.<ref>Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier et l'urbain \u2013 la rectification du damier froebelien, pp. 93\u2013117.</ref><ref>Actes du colloque La ville et l'urbanisme apr\u00e8s Le Corbusier, \u00e9ditions d'en Haut 1993 \u2013 {{ISBN|2-88251-033-0}}.</ref><ref>Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier entre Raphael et Fr\u00f6bel, pp. 9\u201327, Journal d'histoire de l'architecture N\u00b01, Presses universitaires de Grenoble 1988 \u2013 {{ISBN|2-7061-0325-6}}.</ref>\n\nLike his contemporaries [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]], Le Corbusier lacked formal training as an architect.  He was attracted to the visual arts; at the age of fifteen he entered the municipal art school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds which taught the applied arts connected with watchmaking.  Three years later he attended the higher course of decoration, founded by the painter [[Charles L'Eplattenier]], who had studied in [[Budapest]] and Paris. Le Corbusier wrote later that L'Eplattenier had made him \"a man of the woods\" and taught him painting from nature.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  His father frequently took him into the mountains around the town.  He wrote later, \"we were constantly on mountaintops; we grew accustomed to a vast horizon.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourdhui'' (1925), p. 198.</ref> His architecture teacher in the Art School was architect Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier's earliest house designs.  He reported later that it was the art teacher L'Eplattenier who made him choose architecture. \"I had a horror of architecture and architects,\" he wrote. \"...I was sixteen, I accepted the verdict and I obeyed.  I moved into architecture.\"<ref>Cited by Jean Petit, ''Le Corbusier lui-meme'',  Rousseau, Geneva 1970, p. 28.</ref>\n\n==Travel and first houses (1905\u20131914)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Cdffallet.jpg|Le Corbusier's student project, the [[Villa Fallet]], a chalet in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland (1905)\nFile:Maison blanche 01.jpg|The \"Maison Blanche\", built for Le Corbusier's parents in La Chaux-de-Fonds (1912)\nFile:Maison blanche 05.jpg|Open Interior of the \"Maison Blanche\" (1912)\nFile:Villa Favre-Jacot 2.JPG|The Villa Favre-Jacot in [[Le Locle]], Switzerland (1912)\n</gallery>\n\nLe Corbusier began teaching himself by going to the library to read about architecture and philosophy, by visiting museums, by sketching buildings, and by constructing them.  In 1905, he and two other students, under the supervision of their teacher, Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, designed and built his first house, the [[Villa Fallet]], for the engraver Louis Fallet, a friend of his teacher Charles L'Eplattenier. Located on the forested hillside near Chaux-de-fonds, it was a large chalet with a steep roof in the local alpine style and carefully crafted colored geometric patterns on the fa\u00e7ade.  The success of this house led to his construction of two similar houses, the Villas Jacquemet and Stotzer, in the same area.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=49}}\n\nIn September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; then that winter traveling through Budapest to Vienna, where he stayed for four months and met [[Gustav Klimt]] and tried, without success, to meet [[Josef Hoffmann]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=48}}  In Florence, he visited the [[Florence Charterhouse]] in [[Galluzzo]], which made a lifelong impression on him. \"I would have liked to live in one of what they called their cells,\"  he wrote later. \"It was the solution for a unique kind of worker's housing, or rather for a terrestrial paradise.\"<ref>Letter to Eplattenier in Dumont, ''Le Corbusier, Lettres a ses maitres'', vol. 2, pp. 82\u201383.</ref>  He traveled to Paris, and during fourteen months between 1908 until 1910 he worked as a draftsman in the office of the architect [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of the use of reinforced [[concrete]] in residential construction and the architect of the [[Art Deco]] landmark [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]].  Two years later, between October 1910 and March 1911, he traveled to Germany and worked four months in the office [[Peter Behrens]], where [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]] were also working and learning.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1911, he traveled again with his friend [[August Klipstein]] for five months;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Klip and Corb on the road|last=\u017dakni\u0107|first=Ivan|publisher=Scheidegger & Spiess|year=2019|isbn=978-3-85881-817-1|location=Z\u00fcrich|pages=}}</ref> this time he journeyed to the [[Balkans]] and visited [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], as well as [[Pompeii]] and [[Rome]], filling nearly 80 sketchbooks with renderings of what he saw\u2014including many sketches of the [[Parthenon]], whose forms he would later praise in his work ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'' (1923).  He spoke of what he saw during this trip in many of his books, and it was the subject of his last book, ''Le Voyage d'Orient''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1912, he began his most ambitious project; a new house for his parents. also located on the forested hillside near La-Chaux-de-Fonds.  The Jeanneret-Perret house was larger than the others, and in a more innovative style; the horizontal planes contrasted dramatically with the steep alpine slopes, and the white walls and lack of decoration were in sharp contrast with the other buildings on the hillside. The interior spaces were organized around the four pillars of the salon in the center, foretelling the open interiors he would create in his later buildings.  The project was more expensive to build than he imagined; his parents were forced to move from the house within ten years, and relocate in a more modest house.  However, it led to a commission to build an even more imposing villa in the nearby village of [[Le Locle]]  for a wealthy watch manufacturer, Georges Favre-Jacot. Le Corbusier designed the new house in less than a month. The building was carefully designed to fit its hillside site, and interior plan was spacious and designed around a courtyard for maximum light, significant departure from the traditional house.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=48\u20139}}\n\n==Dom-ino House and Schwob House (1914\u20131918)==\n[[File:Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), 1914-15, Maison Dom-Ino.jpg|thumb|left|Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret, 1914\u201315, [[Dom-ino House|''Maison Dom-Ino (Dom-ino House)'']] ]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Le Corbusier taught at his old school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds.

He had first discovered concrete working in the office of  [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of reinforced concrete architecture in Paris, but now wanted to use it in new ways.\n\n\"Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources,\" he wrote later, \"and variety, and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be rhythm of a palace, and a Pompieen tranquility.\"<ref>Letter to Auguste Perret (1915), cited in ''Lettres a ces Maitres'', vol. 1, p. 33.</ref>  This led him to his plan for the [[Dom-ino House|Dom-Ino House]] (1914\u201315). This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of three concrete slabs supported by six thin [[reinforced concrete column]]s, with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan.<ref name=\"Tim Benton\">Tim Benton, ''Les Villas de Le Corbusier 1920\u20131929'', Philippe Sers \u00e9d. Paris, 1987.</ref> The system was originally designed to provide large numbers of temporary residences after World War I, producing only slabs, columns and stairways, and residents could build exterior walls with the materials around the site. He described it in his patent application as \"a juxtiposable system of construction according to an infinite number of combinations of plans.  This would permit, he wrote, \"the construction of the dividing walls at any point on the fa\u00e7ade or the interior.\"\n\n[[File:CF05.jpg|thumb|The Anatole Schwob House in La-Chaux-de-Fonds (1916\u20131918)]]\n\nUnder this system, the structure of the house did not have to appear on the outside, but could be hidden behind a glass wall, and the interior could be arranged in any way the architect liked.<ref>cited by Turner, Paul, \"La Formation de Le Corbusier\", Paris, Macula, 1987, p. 218.</ref> After it was patented, Le Corbusier designed a number of houses according to the system, which were all white concrete boxes. Although some of these were never built, they illustrated his basic architectural ideas which would dominate his works throughout the 1920s. He refined the idea in his 1927 book on the ''Five Points of a New Architecture''. This design, which called for the disassociation of the structure from the walls, and the freedom of plans and fa\u00e7ades, became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50\u201351}}\n\nIn August 1916, Le Corbusier received his largest commission ever, to construct a villa for the Swiss watchmaker Anatole Schwob, for whom he had already completed several small remodeling projects. He was given a large budget and the freedom to design not only the house, but also to create the interior decoration and choose the furniture.  Following the precepts of Auguste Perret, he built the structure out of reinforced concrete and filled the gaps with brick. The center of the house is a large concrete box with two semicolumn structures on both sides, which reflects his ideas of pure geometrical forms. A large open hall with a chandelier occupied the center of the building.  \"You can see,\" he wrote to Auguste Perret in July 1916, \"that Auguste Perret left more in me than Peter Behrens.\"<ref>cited in ''Lettres a css maitres'', vol. 1, p. 181.</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier's grand ambitions collided with the ideas and budget of his client, and led to bitter conflicts.  Schwob went to court and denied Le Corbusier access to site, or the right to claim to be the architect. Le Corbusier responded, \"Whether you like it or not, my presence is inscribed in every corner of your house.\" Le Corbusier took great pride in the house, and reproduced pictures in several of his books.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50}}\n\n==Painting, Cubism, Purism and ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' (1918\u20131922)==\n[[File:Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte, oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Le Corbusier, 1921, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles Edouard Jeanneret), 1922, Nature morte verticale (Vertical Still Life), oil on canvas, 146.3 x 89.3 cm, Kunstmuseum, Basel.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, 1922, ''Nature morte verticale'' (''Vertical Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|146.3|x|89.3|cm|1|abbr=in}}, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]] ]]\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, Guitare verticale (2\u00e8me version), oil on canvas, 100 x 81 cm, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, 1920, ''Guitare verticale'' (2\u00e8me version), oil on canvas, {{convert|100|x|81|cm|0|abbr=on}}, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris]]\n\nLe Corbusier moved to Paris definitively in 1917 and began his own architectural practice with his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (1896\u20131967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the [[World War II]] years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Le_Corbusier/129220|title=Encyclop\u00e9die Larousse en ligne \u2013 Charles \u00c9douard Jeanneret dit Le Corbusier|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|date=|work=larousse.fr}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Le Corbusier met the [[Cubism|Cubist]] painter [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]], in whom he recognised a kindred spirit. Ozenfant encouraged him to paint, and the two began a period of collaboration. Rejecting Cubism as irrational and \"romantic\", the pair jointly published their manifesto, ''Apr\u00e8s le cubisme'' and established a new artistic movement, [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier began writing for a new journal,  ''[[L'Esprit Nouveau]]'', and promoted with energy and imagination his ideas of architecture.\n\nIn the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted '''Le Corbusier''' (an altered form of his maternal grandfather's name, Lecorb\u00e9sier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOKNzunERUwC&pg=PA161|title=Le Corbusier: choix de lettres|first1=Le|last1=Corbusier|first2=Jean|last2=Jenger|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|via=Google Books|isbn=9783764364557}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.asso.fr/repbio_us.htm Rep\u00e8res biographiques, Fondation Le Corbusier].

In 1922, he and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de S\u00e8vres.<ref name=\"Choay\"/>\nThey set up an architectural practice together. From 1927 to 1937 they worked together with [[Charlotte Perriand]] at the Le Corbusier-Pierre Jeanneret studio.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Le Corbusier & Pierre Jeanneret - Restoration of the Clart\u00e9 Building|last=Office du patrimoine et des sites|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2016|isbn=978-3035607598|location=Geneva|pages=27}}</ref> In 1929 the trio prepared the \u201cHouse fittings\u201d section for the Decorative Artists Exhibition and asked for a group stand, renewing and widening the 1928 avant-garde group idea. This was refused by the Decorative Artists Committee. They resigned and founded the Union of Modern Artists (\u201c[[Union des artistes modernes]]\u201d: UAM).\n\nHis theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models. Among these, was the Maison \"Citrohan.\"  The project's name was a reference to the French [[Citro\u00ebn]] automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials Le Corbusier advocated using in the house's construction as well as the way in which he intended the homes would be consumed, similar to other commercial products, like the automobile.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anti-object : the dissolution and disintegration of architecture|last=Kuma, Kengo, 1954-|date=2008|publisher=Architectural Association|others=Architectural Association (Great Britain)|isbn=978-1-902902-52-4|location=London|oclc=67375498}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Maison Citrohan model, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor. The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace. On the exterior Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the fa\u00e7ades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames. Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs. Interior walls also were left white.\n\n==''Toward an Architecture'' (1920\u20131923)==\nIn 1922 and 1923, Le Corbusier devoted himself to advocating his new concepts of architecture and urban planning in a series of polemical articles published in ''L'Esprit Nouveau''. At the Paris Salon d'Automne in 1922, he presented his plan for the [[Ville Contemporaine]], a model city for three million people, whose residents would live and work in a group of identical sixty-story tall apartment buildings surrounded by lower zig-zag apartment blocks and a large park. In 1923, he collected his essays from ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' published his first and most influential book, ''[[Toward an Architecture|Towards an Architecture]]''. He presented his ideas for the future of architecture in a series of maxims, declarations, and exhortations. commencing with \"A grand epoch has just begun. There exists a new spirit. There already exist a crowd of works in the new spirit, they are found especially in industrial production. Architecture is suffocating in its current uses. \"Styles\" are a lie. Style is a unity of principles which animates all the work of a period and which result in a characteristic spirit...Our epoch determines each day its style..-Our eyes, unfortunately don't know how to see it yet,\" and his most famous maxim, \"A house is a machine to live in.\"  Most of the many photographs and drawings in the book came from outside the world of traditional architecture;   the cover showed the promenade deck of an ocean liner, while others showed racing cars, airplanes, factories, and the huge concrete and steel arches of [[zeppelin]] hangars.{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1923|pages=1\u2013150}}\n\n==L'Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1925)==\n[[File:Pavillon L'Esprit Nouveau.jpg|thumb|The Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau (1925)]]\n[[File:Plan Voisin model.jpg|thumb|The model of the [[Plan Voisin]] for the reconstruction of Paris displayed at the Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau]]\n\nAn important early work of Le Corbusier was the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, built for the 1925 Paris [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]], the event which later gave [[Art Deco]] its name. Le Corbusier built the pavilion in collaboration with [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]] and with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant had broken with [[Cubism]] and formed the [[Purism]] movement in 1918 and in 1920 founded their journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau''.  In his new journal, Le Corbusier vividly denounced the decorative arts:  \"Decorative Art, as opposed to the machine phenomenon, is the final twitch of the old manual modes, a dying thing.\"  To illustrate his ideas, he and Ozenfant decided to create small pavilion at the Exposition, representing his idea of the future urban housing unit. A house, he wrote, \"is a cell within the body of a city. The cell is made up of the vital elements which are the mechanics of a house...Decorative art is antistandarizational. Our pavilion will contain only standard things created by industry in factories and mass produced, objects truly of the style of today...my pavilion will therefore be a cell extracted from a huge apartment building.\"{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}\n\nLe Corbusier and his collaborators were given a plot of land located behind the [[Grand Palais]] in the center of the Exposition. The plot was forested, and exhibitors could not cut down trees, so Le Corbusier built his pavilion with a tree in the center, emerging through a hole in the roof. The building was a stark white box with an interior terrace and square glass windows. The interior was decorated with a few cubist paintings and with a few pieces of mass-produced commercially available furniture, entirely different from the expensive, one-of-a-kind pieces in the other pavilions.  The chief organizers of the Exposition were furious, and built a fence to partially hide the pavilion. Le Corbusier had to appeal to the Ministry of Fine Arts, which ordered that fence be taken down.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}\n\nBesides the furniture, the pavilion exhibited a model of his [[Plan Voisin]]  his provocative plan for rebuilding a large part of the centre of Paris. He proposed to bulldoze a large area north of the Seine and replace the narrow streets, monuments and houses with giant sixty-story cruciform towers placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favorable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs. The plan was never seriously considered, but it provoked discussion concerning how to deal with the overcrowded poor working-class neighborhoods of Paris, and it later saw partial realization in the housing developments built in the Paris suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe Pavilion was ridiculed by many critics, but Le Corbusier, undaunted, wrote:  \"Right now one thing is sure. 1925 marks the decisive turning point in the quarrel between the old and new. After 1925, the antique-lovers will have virtually ended their lives . . . Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the 'new'.\"{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=49}}\n\n==''The Decorative Art of Today'' (1925)==\nIn 1925, Le Corbusier combined a series of articles about decorative art from \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" into a book, ''L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'' (''The Decorative Art of Today'').<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif d\u2019aujourd'hui'', Paris, G.

His basic premise, repeated throughout the book, was: \"Modern decorative art has no decoration.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'', (originally 1925, Flammarion edition of 1996, ISBN+978-2-0812-2062-1.</ref>  He attacked with enthusiasm the styles presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts:  \"The desire to decorate everything about one is a false spirit and an abominable small perversion....The religion of beautiful materials is in its final death agony...The almost hysterical onrush in recent years toward this quasi-orgy of decor is only the last spasm of a death already predictable.\"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|page=98}} He cited the 1912 book of the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] \"Ornament and crime\", and quoted Loos's dictum, \"The more a people are cultivated, the more decor disappears.\"   He attacked the deco revival of classical styles, what he called \"Louis Philippe and Louis XVI moderne\";  he condemned the \"symphony of color\" at the Exposition, and called it \"the triumph of assemblers of colors and materials. They were swaggering in colors... They were making stews out of fine cuisine.\"   He condemned the exotic styles presented at the Exposition based on the art of China, Japan, India and Persia.  \"It takes energy today to affirm our western styles.\" He criticized the \"precious and useless objects that accumulated on the shelves\" in the new style. He attacked the \"rustling silks, the marbles which twist and turn, the vermilion whiplashes, the silver blades of Byzantium and the Orient\u2026Let's be done with it!\"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70\u201381}}\n\n\"Why call bottles, chairs, baskets and objects decorative?\" Le Corbusier asked. \"They are useful tools\u2026.Decor is not necessary. Art is necessary.\" He declared that in the future the decorative arts industry would produce only \"objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution, and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style.\"  He described the future of decoration in these terms:  \"The ideal is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign.\" He concluded by repeating \"Modern decoration has no decoration\".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70\u201381}}\n\nThe book became a manifesto for those who opposed the more traditional styles of the decorative arts;  In the 1930s, as Le Corbusier predicted, the modernized versions of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI furniture and the brightly colored wallpapers of stylized roses were replaced by a more sober, more streamlined style.  Gradually the modernism and functionality proposed by Le Corbusier overtook the more ornamental style.  The shorthand titles that Le Corbusier used in the book, ''1925 Expo: Arts Deco'' was adapted in 1966 by the art historian [[Bevis Hillier]] for a catalog of an exhibition on the style, and in 1968 in the title of a book, ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''. And thereafter the term \"Art Deco\" was commonly used as the name of the style.<ref>Benton, Charlotte, Benton, Tim, Wood, Ghislaine, ''Art D\u00e9co dans le monde- 1910\u201339'', 2010, Renaissance du Livre, {{ISBN|9782507003906}}, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Five Points of Architecture to Villa Savoye (1923\u20131931)==\n{{Main|Villa Savoye|Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa La Roche 2013.jpg|The Villa La Roche-Jeanneret (now [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]) in Paris (1923)\nFile:Weissenhofsiedlung.jpg|Corbusier Haus (right) and Citrohan Haus in Weissenhof, Stuttgart, Germany (1927)\nFile:VillaSavoye.jpg|The [[Villa Savoye]] in [[Poissy]] (1928\u20131931)\n</gallery>\n\nThe notoriety that Le Corbusier achieved from his writings and the Pavilion at the 1925 Exposition led to commissions to build a dozen residences in Paris and in the Paris region in his \"purist style.\" These included the [[Maison La Roche|Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret]] (1923\u20131925), which now houses the [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]; the [[Maison Guiette]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium (1926); a residence for [[Jacques Lipchitz]]; the [[Maison Cook]], and the [[Maison Planeix]].  In 1927, he was invited by the German [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] to build three houses in the model city of Weissenhof near [[Stuttgart]], based on the Citrohan House and other theoretical models he had published. He described this project in detail one of his best-known essays, the ''Five Points of Architecture''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=37}}\n\nThe following year he began the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928\u20131931), which became one of the most famous of Le Corbusier's works, and an icon of modernist architecture. Located in [[Poissy]], in a landscape surrounded by trees and large lawn, the house is an elegant white box poised on rows of slender pylons, surrounded by a horizontal band of windows which fill the structure with light. The service areas (parking, rooms for servants and laundry room)  are located under the house.  Visitors enter a vestibule from which a gentle ramp leads to the house itself.  The bedrooms and salons of the house are distributed around a suspended garden;  the rooms look both out at the landscape and into the garden, which provides additional light and air. Another ramp leads up to the roof, and a stairway leads down to the cellar under the pillars.\n\nVilla Savoye succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' and the book ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'', which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by ''[[piloti]]s'', reinforced concrete stilts. These ''pilotis'', in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free fa\u00e7ade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an [[free plan|open floor plan]], meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, and which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the [[roof garden]] to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for a [[promenade architecturale]] through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial \"ocean-liner\" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired.\n\nLe Corbusier was quite rhapsodic when describing the house in ''Pr\u00e9cisions'' in 1930: \"the plan is pure, exactly made for the needs of the house. It has its correct place in the rustic landscape of Poissy.  It is Poetry and lyricism, supported by technique.\"{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}  The house had its problems;  the roof persistently leaked, due to construction faults;  but it became a landmark of modern architecture and one of the best-known works of Le Corbusier.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}\n\n==League of Nations Competition and Pessac Housing Project (1926\u20131930)==\n[[File:File:Cit\u00e9 Frug\u00e8s, Pessac 03.jpg|thumb|Low-cost housing units built by Le Corbusier in the [[Cit\u00e9 Frug\u00e8s de Pessac|Cit\u00e9 Frug\u00e8s]] in [[Pessac]] (1926)]]\nThanks to his passionate articles in L'Esprit Nouveau, his participation in the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition and the conferences he gave on the new spirit of architecture, Le Corbusier had become well known in the architectural world, though he had only built residences for wealthy clients. In 1926, he entered the competition for the construction of a headquarters for the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva with a plan for an innovative lakeside complex of modernist white concrete office buildings and meeting halls. There were three-hundred thirty seven projects in competition.  It appeared that the Corbusier's project was the first choice of the architectural jury, but after much behind-the scenes maneuvering the jury declared it was unable to pick a single winner, and the project was given instead to the top five architects, who were all neoclassicists. Le Corbusier was not discouraged; he presented his own plans to the public in articles and lectures to show the opportunity that the League of Nations had missed.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=116}}\n\nIn 1927, Le Corbusier received the opportunity he had been looking for; he was commissioned by a Bordeaux industrialist, Henry Frug\u00e8s a fervent admirer of his ideas on urban planning, to build a complex of worker housing, the [[Quartiers Modernes Frug\u00e8s]], at [[Pessac]], near Bordeaux. Le Corbusier described Pessac as \"A little like a Balzac novel\", a chance to create a whole community for living and working. The Fruges quarter became his first laboratory for a residential housing;  a series of rectangular blocks composed of modular housing units located in a garden setting. Like the unit displayed at the 1925 Exposition, each housing unit had its own small terrace.  The earlier villas he constructed all had white exterior walls, but for Pessac, at the request of his clients, he added color; panels of brown, yellow and jade green, coordinated by Le Corbusier. Originally planned to have some two hundred units, it finally contained about fifty to seventy housing units, in eight buildings. Pessac became the model on a small scale for his later and much larger Cit\u00e9 Radieuse projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/arts/architecture-view-le-corbusier-s-housing-project-flexible-enough-endure-ada.html|title=Architecture View; Le Corbusier's Housing Project-Flexible Enough to Endure; by Ada Louise Huxtable|author=|date=15 March 1981|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Founding of CIAM (1928) and Athens Charter==\nIn 1928, Le Corbusier took a major step toward establishing modernist architecture as the dominant European style. Le Corbusier had met with many of the leading German and Austrian modernists during the competition for the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]]. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses;  Le Corbusier and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a ch\u00e2teau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland 26\u201328 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic \"Rational methods for groups of habitations\".  A third meeting, on \"The functional city\", was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Le Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1943 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84\u201385}}\n\n==Moscow projects (1928\u20131934)==\n{{Main|Le Corbusier in the USSR}}\n[[File:Centrosoyuz Moscow - Ak Sakharova view.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], headquarters of Soviet trade unions, Moscow (1928\u201334)]]\n\nLe Corbusier saw the new society founded in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution as a promising laboratory for his architectural ideas. He met the Russian architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] during the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and admired the construction of Melnikov's constructvist USSR pavilion, the only truly modernist building in the Exposition other than his own Esprit Nouveau pavilion. At Melnikov's invitation he traveled to Moscow, where found that his writings had been published in Russian; he gave lectures and interviews, and between 1928 and 1932 he constructed an office building for the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], the headquarters of Soviet trade unions.\n\nIn 1932, he was invited to take part in an international competition for the new [[Palace of the Soviets]] in Moscow, which was to be built on the site of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], demolished on Stalin's orders.  Le Corbusier contributed a highly original plan, a low-level complex of circular and rectangular buildings and a rainbow-like arch from which the roof of the main meeting hall was suspended. To Le Corbusier's distress, his plan was rejected by Stalin in favor of a plan for a massive neoclassical tower, the highest in Europe, crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin.  The Palace was never built;  construction was stopped by World War II, a swimming pool took its place;  and after the collapse of the USSR the cathedral was rebuilt on its original site.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=128}}\n\n==Cit\u00e9 Universitaire, Immeuble Clart\u00e9 and Cit\u00e9 de Refuge (1928\u20131933)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Geneve immeuble Clarte 2011-08-02 13 55 36 PICT3664.JPG|The [[Immeuble Clart\u00e9]] in [[Geneva]] (1930\u20131932)\nFile:La fondation suisse (Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris) n3.jpg|The Swiss Foundation in the [[Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris]] (1929\u20131933)\n</gallery>\nBetween 1928 and 1934, as Le Corbusier's reputation grew, he received commissions to construct a wide variety of buildings. In 1928 he received a commission from the Soviet government to construct the headquarters of the Tsentrosoyuz, or central office of trade unions, a large office building whose glass walls alternated with plaques of stone. He built the Villa de Madrot in [[Le Pradet]] (1929\u20131931); and an apartment in Paris for Charles de Bestigui at the top of an existing building on the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] 1929\u20131932, (later demolished). In 1929\u20131930 he constructed a floating homeless shelter for the Salvation Army on the left bank of the Seine at the [[Pont d'Austerlitz]]. Between 1929 and 1933, he built a larger and more ambitious project for the Salvation Army, the [[Cit\u00e9 de Refuge]], on rue Cantagrel in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.  He also constructed the Swiss Pavilion in the [[Cit\u00e9 Universitaire]] in Paris with 46 units of student housing, (1929\u201333).  He designed furniture to go with the building;  the main salon was decorated with a montage of black-and-white photographs of nature.  In 1948, he replaced this with a colorful mural he painted himself. In Geneva he built a glass-walled apartment building with forty-five units, the [[Immeuble Clart\u00e9]]. Between 1931 and 1945 he built an apartment building with fifteen units, including an apartment and studio for himself on the 6th and 7th floors, at 4 rue Nungesser-et-Coli in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. overlooking the [[Bois de Boulogne]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=210}}  His apartment and studio are owned today by the Fondation Le Corbusier, and can be visited.\n\n==Ville Contemporaine, Plan Voisin and Cit\u00e9 Radieuse (1922\u20131939)==\n{{See also|Unit\u00e9 d'habitation|Ville Radieuse}}\nAs the global [[Great Depression]] enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted more and more time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d'Automne in Paris.  His plan featured tall office towers with surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that \"analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it.\"{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=98}} The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and to replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do.  The plan included a multi-level transportation hub that included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: \"The center of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is in reality a diamond mine...To abandon the center of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy.\" {{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=100}}\n\nAs no doubt Le Corbusier expected, no one hurried to implement the Plan Voisin, but he continued working on variations of the idea and recruiting followers. In 1929, he traveled to Brazil where he gave conferences on his architectural ideas. He returned with drawings of his own vision for Rio de Janeiro; he sketched serpentine multi-story apartment buildings on pylons, like inhabited highways, winding through [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\nIn 1931, he developed a visionary plan for another city [[Algiers]], then part of France.  This plan, like his Rio Janeiro plan, called for the construction of an elevated viaduct of concrete, carrying residential units, which would run from one end of the city to the other. This plan, unlike his early Plan Voisin, was more conservative, because it did not call for the destruction of the old city of Algiers; the residential housing would be over the top of the old city.  This plan, like his Paris plans, provoked discussion, but never came close to realization.\n\nIn 1935, Le Corbusier made his first visit to the United States. He was asked by American journalists what he thought about New York City skyscrapers; he responded, characteristically, that he found them \"much too small\".<ref>Time Magazine, article on Man of the Year, 5 May 1961</ref>  He wrote a book describing his experiences in the States, ''Quand les Cath\u00e9drales etait blanc-  voyages au pays des timides'' (When Cathedrals were White; voyage to the land of the timid) whose title expressed his view of the lack of boldness in American architecture.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=218}}\n\nHe wrote a great deal but built very little in the late 1930s.  The titles of his books expressed the combined urgency and optimism of his messages: ''Cannons? Munitions? No thank you, Lodging please!'' (1938) and ''The lyricism of modern times and urbanism'' (1939).\n\nIn 1928, the French Minister of Labour, [[Louis Loucheur]], won the passage of a French law on public housing, calling for the construction of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project.  These units were {{convert|45|m2|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, made with metal frames, and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors.  The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the ''Ville Radieuse'' or \"radiant city\", in a new book which published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principle functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be clearly separated into their own neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.\n\n==World War II and Reconstruction; [[Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation]] in Marseille (1939\u20131952)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:M\u00f3dulo de vivienda tipo de Unit\u00e9 d\u00b4Habitation.jpg|The modular design of the apartments inserted into the building\nFile:Cit\u00e9 radieuse.

He moved to [[Vichy]] for a time, where the collaborationist government of Marshal [[Philippe Petain]] was located, offering his services for architectural projects, including his plan for the reconstruction of Algiers, but they were rejected. He continued writing, completing ''Sur les Quatres routes'' (On the Four Routes) in 1941. After 1942, Le Corbusier left Vichy for Paris.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|pages=244\u2013246}}  He became for a time a technical adviser at [[Alexis Carrel]]'s eugenic foundation, he resigned from this position on 20 April 1944.<ref name=Libe>{{cite journal|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/2015/03/18/le-corbusier-plus-facho-que-fada_1223411|title=Le Corbusier plus facho que fada|journal=Liberation|date= 18 March 2015|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref> In 1943, he founded a new association of modern architects and builders, the Ascoral, the Assembly of Constructors for a renewal of architecture, but there were no projects to build.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=215}}\n\nWhen the war ended, Le Corbusier was nearly sixty years old, and he had not had a single project realized in ten years. He tried, without success, to obtain commissions for several of the first large reconstruction projects, but his proposals for the reconstruction of the town of [[Saint-Di\u00e9]] and for [[La Rochelle]] were rejected. Still, he persisted; Le Corbusier finally found a willing partner in [[Raoul Dautry]], the new Minister of Reconstruction and Urbanism. Dautry agreed to fund one of his projects, a \"[[Unit\u00e9 d'habitation|Unit\u00e9 d'habitation de grandeur conforme]]\", or housing units of standard size, with the first one to be built in [[Marseille]], which had been heavily damaged during the war.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=143}}\n\nThis was his first public commission, and was a major breakthrough for Le Corbusier. He gave the building the name of his pre-war theoretical project, the ''Cit\u00e9 Radieuse'', and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, he proposed a giant reinforced concrete framework, into which modular apartments would be fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 people. Each module was three stories high, and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran from one side of the building to the other, and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the ventilator shafts on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.\n\nThe building was designed not just to be a residence, but to offer all the services needed for living. Every third floor, between the modules, there was a wide corridor, like an interior street, which ran the length of the building from one end of the building to the other. This served as a sort of commercial street, with shops, eating places, a nursery school and recreational facilities. A running track and small stage for theater performances was located in the roof. The building itself was surrounded by trees and a small park.\n\nLe Corbusier wrote later that the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation concept was inspired by the visit he had made to the [[Florence Charterhouse]] at [[Galluzzo]] in Italy, in 1907 and 1910 during his early travels. He wanted to recreate, he wrote, an ideal place \"for meditation and contemplation.\"  He also learned from the monastery, he wrote, that \"standardization led to perfection,\" and that \"all of his life a man labours under this impulse: to make the home the temple of the family.\"{{sfn|Journel|2015|page=139}}\n\nThe Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation marked a turning point in the career of Le Corbusier; in 1952, he was made a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour|L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] in a ceremony held on the roof of his new building. He had progressed from being an outsider and critic of the architectural establishment to its centre, as the most prominent French architect.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=152\u2013158}}\n\n==Postwar projects, United Nations headquarters (1947\u20131952)==\n[[File:67\u00ba Per\u00edodo de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|right|The [[headquarters of the United Nations]] designed by Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Wallace K.

In the post-Second World War decades Le Corbusier\u2019s fame moved beyond architectural and planning circles as he became one of the leading intellectual figures of the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=426}}</ref> \n\nIn early 1947 Le Corbusier submitted a design for the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], which was to be built beside the East River in New York. Instead of competition, the design was to be selected by a Board of Design Consultants composed of leading international architects nominated by member governments, including Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] of Brazil, [[Howard Robertson (architect)|Howard Robertson]] from Britain, Nikolai Bassov of the Soviet Union, and five others from around the world. The committee was under the direction of the American architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], who was also architect for the Rockefeller family, which had donated the site for the building.\n\nLe Corbusier had submitted his plan for the Secretariat, called Plan 23 of the 58 submitted. In Le Corbusier's plan offices, council chambers and General Assembly hall were in a single block in the center of the site.  He lobbied hard for his project, and asked the younger Brazilian architect, Niemeyer, to support and assist him on his plan. Niemeyer, to help Le Corbusier, refused to submit his own design and did not attend the meetings until the Director, Harrison, insisted. Niemeyer then submitted his plan, Plan 32, with the office building and councils and General Assembly in separate buildings. After much discussion, the Committee chose Niemeyer's plan, but suggested that he collaborate with Le Corbusier on the final project. Le Corbusier urged Niemeyer to put the General Assembly Hall in the center of the site, though this would eliminate Niemeyer's plan to have a large plaza in the center. Niemeyer agreed with Le Corbusier's suggestion, and the headquarters was built, with minor modifications, according to their joint plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archives.un.org/content/oscar-niemeyer-and-united-nations-headquarters |title=Oscar Niemeyer and the United Nations Headquarters (1947\u20131949) |work=[[United Nations]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Religious architecture (1950\u20131963)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:RonchampCorbu.jpg|The [[Notre Dame du Haut|chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] in [[Ronchamp]] (1950\u20131955)\nFile:Sainte Marie de La Tourette 2007.jpg|The convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] near [[Lyon]] (1953\u20131960)\nFile:Couvent de la Tourette - 11.JPG|Meeting room inside the Convent of Sainte Marie de la Tourette\nFile:EgliseSaintPierreLeCorbusierFirminy.jpg|[[Saint-Pierre, Firminy|Church of Saint-Pierre]], [[Firminy]] (1960\u20132006)\nFile:Church @ Firminy, France.jpg|Interior of the Church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy.

(1960\u20132006)\n</gallery>\nLe Corbusier was an avowed atheist, but he also had a strong belief in the ability of architecture to create a sacred and spiritual environment. In the postwar years, he designed two important religious buildings; the [[Notre Dame du Haut|chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]] (1950\u20131955); and the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] (1953\u20131960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, P\u00e8re Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.\n\nLe Corbusier first visited the remote mountain site of Ronchamp in May 1950, saw the ruins of the old chapel, and drew sketches of possible forms. He wrote afterwards: \"In building this chapel, I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of prayer, of interior joy. The feeling of the sacred animated our effort.  Some things are sacred, others aren't, whether they're religious or not.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Ronchamp'', Hatje, Stuttgart, (1925), p. 25.</ref>\n\nThe second major religious project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in [[L'Arbresle]] in the Rhone Department (1953\u20131960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier to visit the starkly simple and imposing 12th\u201313th century [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns.  For the living space he used the same [[Modulor]] concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of {{convert|2.26|m|abbr=off}}; and width {{convert|1.83|m|abbr=off}}.{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|pages=154\u201355}}\n\nLe Corbusier used raw concrete to construct the convent, which is placed on the side of a hill.  The three blocks of dormitories U, closed by the chapel, with a courtyard in the center. The Convent has a flat roof, and is placed on sculpted concrete pillars. Each of the residential cells has small loggia with a concrete sunscreen looking out at the countryside.  The centerpiece of the convent is the chapel, a plain box of concrete, which he called his \"Box of miracles.\"  Unlike the highly finished fa\u00e7ade of the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation, the fa\u00e7ade of the chapel is raw, unfinished concrete. He described the building in a letter to [[Albert Camus]] in 1957: \"I'm taken with the idea of a \"box of miracles\"....as the name indicates, it is a rectangual box made of concrete. It doesn't have any of the traditional theatrical tricks, but the possibility, as its name suggests, to make miracles.\"<ref>Letter to Albert Camus, 13 February 1957, FLC (Fondation Le Corbusier), E1-12-154)</ref> The interior of the chapel is extremely simple, only benches in a plain, unfinished concrete box, with light coming through a single square in the roof and six small band on the sides. The Crypt beneath has intense blue, red and yellow walls, and illumination by sunlight channeled from above.  The monastery has other unusual features, including floor to ceiling panels of glass in the meeting rooms, window panels that fragmented the view into pieces, and a system of concrete and metal tubes like gun barrels which aimed sunlight through colored prisms and projected it onto the walls of sacristy and to the secondary altars of the crypt on the level below. These were whimsically termed the \"\"machine guns\" of the sacristy and the \"light cannons\" of the crypt.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=184\u2013185}}\n\nIn 1960, Le Corbusier began a third religious building, the Church of Saint Pierre in the new town of Firminy-Vert, where he had built a Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation and a cultural and sports centre. While he made the original design, construction did not begin until five years after his death, and work continued under different architects until it was completed in 2006. The most spectacular feature of the church is the sloping concrete tower that covers the entire interior. similar to that in the Assembly Building in his complex at [[Chandigarh]]. Windows high in the tower illuminate the interior. Le Corbusier originally proposed that tiny windows also project the form of a constellation on the walls. Later architects designed the church to project the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|page=165}}\n\n==Chandigarh (1951\u20131956)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chandigarh High Court.jpg|The High Court of Justice, Chandigarh (1951\u20131956)\nFile:Chandigarh Secretariat.jpg|Secretariat Building, Chandigarh (1952\u20131958)\nFile:Palace of Assembly Chandigarh 2006.jpg|[[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)]] (1952\u20131961)\nFile:Chandigarh High Court sun.jpg|[[Punjab and Haryana High Court|Chandigarh High Court]]\n</gallery>\nLe Corbusier's largest and most ambitious project was the design of [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] States of India, created after India received independence in 1947. Le Corbusier was contacted in 1950 by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and invited to propose a project. An American architect, [[Albert Mayer (planner)|Albert Mayer]], had made a plan in 1947 for a city of 150,000 inhabitants, but the Indian government wanted a grander and more monumental city. Corbusier worked on the plan with two British specialists in urban design and tropical climate architecture, [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], and with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, who moved to India and supervised the construction until his death.\n\nLe Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic about his project; \"It will be a city of trees,\" he wrote, \"of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those at the time of Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of mathematics will reign.\".<ref>Letter to his wife Yvonne, 27 February 1951, FLC-R1-12-87. Cited by Journel, p. 182.</ref>  His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and a transportation infrastructure.  In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}  From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, \"Like a forced laborer.\" He dismissed the earlier American plan as \"Faux-Moderne\" and overly filled with parking spaces roads. His intent was to present what he had learned in forty years of urban study, and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}} His design made use of many of his favorite ideas: an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the [[Modulor]] to give a correct human scale to each element; and his favourite symbol, the open hand (\"The hand is open to give and to receive\"). He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nLe Corbusier's design called for the use of raw concrete, whose surface not smoothed or polished and which showed the marks of the forms in which it dried. Pierre Jeanneret wrote to his cousin that he was in a continual battle with the construction workers, who could not resist the urge to smooth and finish the raw concrete, particularly when important visitors were coming to the site. At one point one thousand workers were employed on the site of the High Court of Justice.  Le Corbusier wrote to his mother, \"It is an architectural symphony which surpasses all my hopes, which flashes and develops under the light in a way which is unimaginable and unforgettable. From far, from up close, it provokes astonishment; all made with raw concrete and a cement cannon. Adorable, and grandiose. In all the centuries no one has seen that.\"<ref>letter to his mother, 19 November 1954, FLC-R2-103. Cited by Journlet, p. 184.</ref>\n\nThe High Court of Justice, begun in 1951, was finished in 1956. The building was radical in its design; a parallelogram topped with an inverted parasol.  Along the walls were high concrete grills {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=off}} thick which served as sunshades. The entry featured a monumental ramp and columns that allowed the air to circulate.  The pillars were originally white limestone, but in the 1960s they were repainted in bright colors, which better resisted the weather.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nThe Secretariat, the largest building that housed the government offices, was constructed between 1952 and 1958.  It is an enormous block {{convert|250|m|abbr=off}} long and eight levels high, served by a ramp which extends from the ground to the top level. The ramp was designed to be partly sculptural and partly practical. Since there were no modern building cranes at the time of construction, the ramp was the only way to get materials to the top of the construction site. The Secretariat had two features which were borrowed from his design for the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille: concrete grill sunscreens over the windows and a roof terrace.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nThe most important building of the capitol complex was the [[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)|Palace of Assembly]] (1952\u201361), which faced the High Court at the other end of a five hundred meter esplanade with a large reflecting pool in the front. This building features a central courtyard, over which is the main meeting hall for the Assembly.  On the roof on the rear of the building is a signature feature of Le Corbusier, a large tower, similar in form to the smokestack of a ship or the ventilation tower of a heating plant. Le Corbusier added touches of color and texture with an immense tapestry in the meeting hall and large gateway decorated with enamel.  He wrote of this building, \"A Palace magnificent in its effect, from the new art of raw concrete. It is magnificent and terrible; terrible meaning that there is nothing cold about it to the eyes.\"<ref>Letter to his brother Albert, 26 March 1961, FLC-R1-10-586, cited by Journel, p. 185.</ref>\n\n==Later life and work (1955\u20131965)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:National museum of western art05s3200.jpg|The [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo (1954\u20131959)\nFile:Carpenter center.jpg|[[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] (1960\u20131963)\nFile:Centre Le Corbusier - 'Teich' - Blatterwiese 2013-09-21 17-48-26.JPG|The [[Centre Le Corbusier]] in Z\u00fcrich (1962\u20131967)\n</gallery>\nThe 1950s and 1960s, were a difficult period for Le Corbusier's personal life;  his wife Yvonne died in 1957, and his mother, to whom he was closely attached, died in 1960. He remained active in a wide variety of fields; in 1955 he published ''Po\u00e9me de l'angle droits'', a portfolio of lithographs, published in the same collection as the book ''Jazz'' by [[Henri Matisse]]. In 1958 he collaborated with the composer [[Edgar Var\u00e8se]] on a work called ''Le [[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]]'', a show of sound and light, for the Philips Pavilion at the International Exposition in Brussels. In 1960 he published a new book, ''L'Atelier de la recherch\u00e9 patiente'' ''The workshop of patient research''), simultaneously published in four languages.  He received growing recognition for his pioneering work in modernist architecture;  in 1959, a successful international campaign was launched to have his Villa Savoye, threatened with demolition, declared an historic monument; it was the first time that a work by a living architect received this distinction.  In 1962, in the same year as the dedication of the Palace of the Assembly in Chandigarh, the first retrospective exhibit on his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1964, in a ceremony held in his atelier on rue de S\u00e8vres, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Culture Minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}\n\nHis later architectural work was extremely varied, and often based on designs of earlier projects. In 1952\u20131958, he designed a series of tiny vacation cabins, {{convert|2.26|x|2.26|x|2.6|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, for a site next to the Mediterranean at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]. He built a similar cabin for himself, but the rest of the project was not realized until after his death. In 1953\u20131957, he designed a residential building for Brazilian students for the Cit\u00e9 de la Universit\u00e9 in Paris. Between 1954 and 1959, he built the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo. His other projects included a cultural centre and stadium for the town of [[Firminy]], where he had built his first housing project (1955\u20131958); and a stadium in Baghdad, Iraq (much altered since its construction).  He also constructed three new ''Unit\u00e9s d'Habitation'', apartment blocks on the model of the original in Marseille, the first in Berlin (1956\u20131958), the second in Briey-en-For\u00eat in the [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] Department; and the third (1959\u20131967) in Firminy.  In 1960\u20131963, he built his only building in the United States; the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}\n\nAt the time of his death in 1965, several projects were on the drawing boards; the church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy, finally completed in modified form in 2006; a Palace of Congresses for Strasbourg (1962\u201365), and a hospital in Venice, (1961\u20131965) which were never built. Le Corbusier designed an art gallery beside the lake in Z\u00fcrich for gallery owner [[Heidi Weber]] in 1962\u20131967.

They summarized the lessons he had learned in the previous years, which he put literally into concrete form in his villas constructed of the late 1920s, most dramatically in the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928\u20131931)\n\nThe five points are:\n\n* The '''Pilotis''', or pylon. The building is raised up on reinforced concrete pylons, which allows for free circulation on the ground level, and eliminates dark and damp parts of the house.\n* The '''Roof Terrace'''. The sloping roof is replaced by a flat roof; the roof can be used as a garden, for promenades, sports or a swimming pool.\n* The '''Free Plan'''. Load-bearing walls are replaced by steel or reinforced concrete columns, so the interior can be freely designed, and interior walls can put anywhere, or left out entirely. The structure of the building is not visible from the outside.\n* The '''Ribbon Window'''. Since the walls do not support the house, the windows can run the entire length of the house, so all rooms can get equal light.\n* The '''Free Fa\u00e7ade'''. Since the building is supported by columns in the interior, the fa\u00e7ade can be much lighter and more open, or made entirely of glass. There is no need for lintels or other structure around the windows.\n\n===\"Architectural Promenade\"===\nThe \"Architectural Promenade\" was another idea dear to Le Corbusier, which he particularly put into play in his design of the [[Villa Savoye]]. In 1928, in ''Une Maison, un Palais'', he described it: \"Arab architecture gives us a precious lesson: it is best appreciated in walking, on foot. It is in walking, in going from one place to another, that you see develop the features of the architecture. In this house ([[Villa Savoye]]) you find a veritable architectural promenade, offering constantly varying aspects, unexpected, sometimes astonishing.\" The promenade at Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier wrote, both in the interior of the house and on the roof terrace, often erased the traditional difference between the inside and outside.<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Une maison \u2013 un palais'', G. Cr\u00e8s & Cie (1928), pp. 70\u201378</ref>\n\n===''Ville Radieuse'' and Urbanism===\nIn the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in ''[[Ville Radieuse|La Ville radieuse]]'' (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position.{{Sfn|Fishman|1982|p=231}} Some have read dark overtones into ''The Radiant City'': from the \"astonishingly beautiful assemblage of buildings\" that was Stockholm, for example, Le Corbusier saw only \"frightening chaos and saddening monotony.\" He dreamed of \"cleaning and purging\" the city, bringing \"a calm and powerful architecture\"\u2014referring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete. Although Le Corbusier's designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly \"destroyed\" the city with them.<ref name=dalrymple>{{cite journal|last=Dalrymple|first=Theodore|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian: Le Corbusier's baleful influence|journal=City Journal|date=Autumn 2009 |volume=19 |issue=4|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient [[Scientific management|Taylorist]] and [[Fordism|Fordist]] strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society. As Norma Evenson has put it, \"the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient.\"<ref name=evenson>{{cite book|last=Evenson|first=Norma|title=Le Corbusier: The Machine and the Grand Design|publisher=George Braziller|location=New York|year=1969|page=7}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier \"His ideas\u2014his urban planning and his architecture\u2014are viewed separately,\" Perelman noted, \"whereas they are one and the same thing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-books-claim-le-corbusier-fascist-289334|title=New Books Claim Le Corbusier Was a Fascist|last=Munro|first=Cait|date=17 April 2005|website=Artnet news|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn ''La Ville radieuse'', he conceived an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|page=228}}\n\nLe Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. There is a noteworthy resemblance between the concept of the unit\u00e9 and Fourier's [[phalanstery]].<ref name=serenyi>{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Serenyi|title=Le Corbusier, Fourier, and the Monastery of Ema|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=49|number=4|date=December 1967|page=282|doi=10.2307/3048487|jstor=3048487}}</ref> From Fourier, Le Corbusier adopted at least in part his notion of administrative, rather than political, government.\n\n===Modulor===\n{{Main|Modulor}}\n\nThe [[Modulor]] was a standard model of the human form which Le Corbusier devised to determine the correct amount of living space needed for residents in his buildings. It was also his rather original way of dealing with differences between the metric system and British or American system, since the Modulor was not attached to either one.\n\nLe Corbusier explicitly used the [[golden ratio]] in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s \"[[Vitruvian Man]]\", the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the [[golden ratio]], Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. Many scholars see the Modulor as a humanistic expression but it is also argued that: \"It's exactly the opposite (...) It's the mathematicization of the body, the standardization of the body, the rationalization of the body.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/arts/design/le-corbusiers-architecture-and-his-politics-are-revisited.html|title=New York Times|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=12 July 2015|website=nytimes.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHe took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.\n\nLe Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.<ref name=padovan>{{cite book|last=Padovan|first=Richard|title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture|date=2 November 1999|page=320|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-419-22780-9|quote=from Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.35: \"Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section.\"}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier placed systems of harmony and proportion at the centre of his design philosophy, and his faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden section and the Fibonacci series, which he described as \"rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in Man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages, and the learned.\"{{sfn|padovan|1999|page=316}}\n\n===Open Hand===\n[[File:Open Hand Monument in Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|''[[Open Hand Monument]]'' in Chandigarh, India]]\n\nThe Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\" The largest of the many Open Hand sculptures that Le Corbusier created is a {{convert|26|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} version in Chandigarh, India known as ''[[Open Hand Monument]]''.\n\n==Furniture==\n{{Main|Le Corbusier's Furniture}}\n\nLe Corbusier was an eloquent critic of the finely crafted, hand-made furniture, made with rare and exotic woods, inlays and coverings, presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts. Following his usual method, Le Corbusier first wrote a book with his theories of furniture, complete with memorable slogans.  In his 1925 book ''L'Art D\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'', he called for furniture that used inexpensive materials and could be mass-produced. Le Corbusier described three different furniture types: ''type-needs'', ''type-furniture'', and ''human-limb objects''. He defined human-limb objects as: \"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony\".  He further declared, \"Chairs are architecture, sofas are [[bourgeois]]\",\n[[File:LC4 Chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand 1927-28.jpg|thumb|Frame of an LC4 chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand (1927\u201328) at Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris]]\nLe Corbusier first relied on ready-made furniture from Thonet to furnish his projects, such as his pavilion at the 1925 Exposition.  In 1928, following the publication of his theories, he began experimenting with furniture design.  In 1928, he invited the architect [[Charlotte Perriand]] to join his studio as a furniture designer. His cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]], also collaborated on many of the designs. For the manufacture of his furniture, he turned to the German firm [[Gebr\u00fcder Thonet]], which had begun making chairs with tubular steel, a material originally used for bicycles, in the early 1920s. Le Corbusier admired the design of [[Marcel Breuer]] and the [[Bauhaus]], who in 1925 had begun making sleek modern tubular club chairs. [[Mies van der Rohe]] had begun making his own version in a sculptural curved form with a cane seat in 1927.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=382}}\n\nThe first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three types of chairs made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames: The [[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|LC4]], Chaise Longue, (1927\u201328), with a covering of cowhide, which gave it a touch of exoticism; the ''Fauteuil Grand Confort'' (LC3) (1928\u201329), a club chair with a tubular frame which resembled the comfortable Art Deco club chairs that became popular in the 1920s; and the ''Fauteuil \u00e0 dossier basculant'' (LC4) (1928\u201329), a low seat suspended in a tubular steel frame, also with a cowhide upholstery. These chairs were designed specifically for two of his projects, the ''Maison la Roche'' in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. All three clearly showed the influence of Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. The line of furniture was expanded with additional designs for Le Corbusier's 1929 ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' installation, 'Equipment for the Home'. Despite the intention of Le Corbusier that his furniture should be inexpensive and mass-produced, his pieces were originally costly to make and were not mass-produced until many years later, when he was famous. {{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=383}}\n\n==Politics==\nThe political views of Le Corbusier were rather variable over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In the 1920s, he co-founded and contributed articles about urbanism to the fascist journals ''Plans'', ''Pr\u00e9lude'' and ''L'Homme R\u00e9el''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brott|first=Simone|date=2013|title=In the Shadow of the Enlightenment Le Corbusier, Le Faisceau and Georges Valois|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand|volume=2|issue=30|pages=777\u2013789|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/63644/|quote=\"his contribution to three fascist revues: Plans, Pr\u00e9lude and L\u2019Homme R\u00e9el\"}}</ref><ref name=\"simone 2\">{{Cite journal |last=Brott |first=Simone |date=2017-12-08 |title=The Le Corbusier Scandal, or, was Le Corbusier a Fascist? |journal=Fascism |language=en |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=196\u2013227 |doi=10.1163/22116257-00602003 |issn=2211-6249|doi-access=free }}</ref> He also penned pieces in favour of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] for those journals, as well as \"hateful editorials\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11543431/Le-Corbusier-was-militant-fascist-two-new-books-on-French-architect-claim.html |title=Le Corbusier was 'militant fascist', two new books on French architect claim |last=Samuel |first=Henry |date=2015-04-16 |quote=\"Mr Jarcy said that in \"Plans\" Le Corbusier wrote in support of Nazi anti-Semitism and in \"Prelude\" co-wrote \"hateful editorials\"}}</ref> Between 1925 and 1928, Le Corbusier had connections to [[Le Faisceau]], a short-lived French fascist party led by [[Georges Valois]].

In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, particularly the redesign of [[Marseille]] after its Jewish population had been forcefully removed,<ref name=\"simone 2\" /> he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Alexis Carrel]], a [[eugenics|eugenicist]] surgeon, appointed Le Corbusier to the Department of Bio-Sociology of the ''Foundation for the Study of Human Problems'', an institute promoting eugenics policies under the Vichy regime.<ref name=\"simone 2\" />\n\nLe Corbusier has been accused of anti-semitism. He wrote to his mother in October 1940, prior to a referendum held by the Vichy government: \"The Jews are having a bad time. I occasionally feel sorry. But it appears their blind lust for money has rotted the country\". He was also accused of belittling the Muslim population of Algeria, then part of France. When Le Corbusier proposed a plan for the rebuilding of Algiers, he condemned the existing housing for European Algerians, complaining that it was inferior to that inhabited by indigenous Algerians: \"the civilized live like rats in holes\", while \"the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being.\"<ref name=celik>{{cite book|last=Celik|first=Zeynep|title=Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers under French Rule|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=28 July 1997|page=4|isbn=978-0520204577|accessdate=}}</ref>  His plan for rebuilding Algiers was rejected, and thereafter Le Corbusier mostly avoided politics.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Antliff|first=Mark |title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909\u20131939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADTdniFtnuwC|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-9047-3}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nFew other 20th-century architects were praised, or criticized, as much as Le Corbusier. In his eulogy to Le Corbusier at the memorial ceremony for the architect in the courtyard of the Louvre on 1 September 1965, French Culture Minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] declared, \"Le Corbusier had some great rivals, but none of them had the same significance in the revolution of architecture, because none bore insults so patiently and for so long.\"<ref>Andr\u00e9 Malraux, funeral oration for Le Corbusier, 1 September 1965, cited in Journal (2015), p. 3.1</ref>\n\nLater criticism of Le Corbusier was directed at his ideas of urban planning. In 1998 the architectural historian [[Witold Rybczynski]] wrote in ''Time'' magazine: <blockquote> \"He called it the Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City. Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic. Wherever it was tried\u2014in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers\u2014it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan, socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighborhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy.\"<ref>Rybcznski, Witold, ''Time'' magazine, 8 June 1998.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[:Category:Historians of technology|Technological historian]] and architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] wrote in ''Yesterday's City of Tomorrow'' that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier's skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities. The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter. By \"mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had, in fact, produced a sterile hybrid.\"\n\nThe public housing projects influenced by his ideas have been criticized for isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community's development. One of his most influential detractors has been [[Jane Jacobs]], who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier's urban design theories in her seminal work ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.\n\nFor some critics, the urbanism of Le Corbusier's was the model for a fascist state.<ref>{{Cite book\n            |chapter=La Cit\u00e9 francaise: George Valois, Le Corbusier, and Fascist Theories of Urbanism\n            |pages=134\u2013170\n            |last=Antliff\n            |first=Mark\n            |title=Fascist Visions: Art and Ideology in France and Italy\n            |editor1-last=Antliff\n            |editor1-first=Mark\n            |editor2-last=Affron\n            |editor2-first=Matthew\n            |publisher=Princeton University Press\n            |year=1997\n            |isbn=978-0-691027388\n            |location=\n            |via=}}</ref> These critics cited Le Corbusier himself when he wrote that \"not all citizens could become leaders.

He thought that industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape. He was a leader of the modernist movement to create better living conditions and a better society through housing. [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s ''Garden Cities of Tomorrow'' heavily influenced Le Corbusier and his contemporaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=FITTING|first=PETER|date=2002|title=Urban Planning/Utopian Dreaming: Le Corbusier's Chandigarh Today|journal=Utopian Studies|volume=13|issue=1|pages=69\u201393|issn=1045-991X|jstor=20718410}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier revolutionized [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/le-corbusier-1483|title=Le Corbusier (Charles-Edouard Jeanneret) 1887-1965|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref>  One of the first to realize how the [[automobile]] would change human society, Le Corbusier conceived the city of the future with large apartment buildings isolated in a park-like setting on [[piloti]]s.

In Great Britain urban planners turned to Le Corbusier's \"Cities in the Sky\" as a cheaper method of building public housing from the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pash-living.co.uk/blog/contemporary-designers/le-corbusier-enfant-terrible-of-modernist-architecture.html|title=Le Corbusier \u2013 enfant terrible of Modernist Architecture? / Pash Living Blog|author=|date=|work=pash-living.co.uk}}</ref> Le Corbusier criticized any effort at ornamentation of the buildings. The large spartan structures in cities, but not part of it, have been criticized for being boring and unfriendly to pedestrians.<ref>The Most Important People of the 20th Century (Part-II): Artists & Entertainers, Page 144</ref>\n\nSeveral of the many architects who worked for Le Corbusier in his studio became prominent, including painter-architect [[Nadir Afonso]], who absorbed Le Corbusier's ideas into his own aesthetics theory. [[L\u00facio Costa]]'s [[urban planning|city plan]] of [[Bras\u00edlia]] and the industrial city of [[Zl\u00edn]] planned by [[Franti\u0161ek Lydie Gahura]] in the Czech Republic are based on his ideas.  Le Corbusier's thinking had profound effects on city planning and architecture in the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivist]] era.\n\nLe Corbusier harmonized and lent credence to the idea of space as a set of destinations between which mankind moved continuously.  He gave credibility to the automobile as transporter, and to freeways in urban spaces. His philosophies were useful to urban real estate developers in the American post-World War II period because they justified and lent intellectual support to the desire to raze traditional urban space for high density, high profit urban concentration. The freeways connected this new urbanism to low density, low cost, highly profitable suburban locales available to be developed for middle class single-family housing.\n\nMissing from this scheme of movement was connectivity between isolated urban villages created for lower-middle and working classes, and the destination points in Le Corbusier's plan: suburban and rural areas, and urban commercial centers. The freeways as designed traveled over, at, or beneath grade levels of the living spaces of the urban poor, for example the [[Cabrini\u2013Green]] housing project in Chicago. Such projects with no freeway exit ramps, cut off by freeway rights-of-way, became isolated from jobs and services concentrated at Le Corbusier's nodal transportation end points. As jobs migrated to the suburbs, urban village dwellers found themselves without freeway access points in their communities or public mass transit that could economically reach suburban job centers. Late in the post-War period, suburban job centers found labor shortages to be such a critical problem that they sponsored urban-to-suburban shuttle bus services to fill vacant working class and lower-middle class jobs, which did not typically pay enough to afford car ownership.\n<!--NOTE: highly editorialized presentation (\"prophet who could do no wrong\", \"incompetence\", \"Machiavellian\", \"absurd\") -- use neutral tone and include citations or quotes if appropriate.. Le Corbusier deliberately created a myth about himself and was revered in his lifetime, and after death, by a generation of followers who believed Le Corbusier was a prophet who could do no wrong. But in the 1950s the first doubts began to appear, notably in some essays by his greatest admirers such as [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Colin Rowe]], who denounced as catastrophic his ideas on the city. Later critics revealed his technical incompetence as an architect. In his book ''Arm\u00e9e du Salut'', Brian Brace Taylor went into great detail about Le Corbusier's Machiavellian activities to create this commission for himself, his many ill-judged design decisions about building technologies, and the sometimes absurd solutions he then proposed. -->\n<!--NOTE: We cannot say \"more recently\" -- that's [[WP:DATED]]. We cannot says \"there has been much discussion\" -- we have to say WHO discussed this and GIVE A CITATION.   More recently still there has been much discussion about Le Corbusier's right-wing politics, and his open flirtation with Fascism in the 1930s, when he tried to persuade Benito Mussolini to commission him to design a new capital city for Ethiopia after Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935 using nerve-gas, in breach of League of Nations rules.-->\n\nLe Corbusier influenced architects and urbanists worldwide.

The film stars [[Anna Faris]], [[Regina Hall]], [[Shawn Wayans]], and [[Marlon Wayans]] (all reprising their roles from the first film, despite their characters having seemingly been killed off), as well as [[Tim Curry]], [[Tori Spelling]], [[Chris Elliott]], [[Christopher Masterson|Chris Masterson]], [[Kathleen Robertson]], [[David Cross]], and [[James Woods]]. The film is the last in the series to feature the involvement of stars [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]] and [[Shawn Wayans]], and director [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]. Marlon would eventually go on to produce a similar horror-themed parody, ''[[A Haunted House]]'', and [[A Haunted House 2|its sequel]], both starring himself. In the latter film, Wayans pokes fun at the ''Scary Movie'' series' decline in quality after his family's departure.\n\nWhere the original film was mainly based on the [[slasher film]]s of the 1990s, ''Scary Movie 2'' parodies an array of supernatural and haunted house films from various decades, including ''[[The Haunting (1999)|The Haunting]]'' (1999), ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979), ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982), ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]'' (1973), ''House on Haunted Hill'' (both the [[House on Haunted Hill|1959]] and [[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|1999 versions]]), and ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' (1980). It also spoofs some contemporary films, such as ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001) and ''[[Hollow Man]]'' (2000).

At one point, former President [[Bill Clinton]], who had just left office the year the film came out (2001), was considered for the James Woods part. Because Miramax had not greenlit this sequel until the massive box office success of the original, the film faced a punishing production schedule that involved coming up with a script and tearing through production and post-production in a total of less than 9 months, roughly half the average time for all those steps to be completed on a standard Hollywood production in 2000\u20132001.\n\n==Plot==\nA teenage girl named Megan Voorhees ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane ([[Richard Moll]]), the house's previous owner. During a formal dinner party she emerges in her nightdress, insults her mother and the guests, then proceeds to urinate profusely on the floor. In response, Megan's mother ([[Veronica Cartwright]]) seeks help from two priests, Father McFeely ([[James Woods]]) and Father Harris ([[Andy Richter]]). After paying a trip to the bathroom, the men attempt to drive Hugh's ghost out, but the exorcism does not go as planned. After everyone vomits on each other, and one of the priests shows signs of [[pedophilia]] towards the girl, Megan insults Father McFeely's mother. He responds by pulling out a gun and shooting Megan.\n\nMeanwhile, Cindy Campbell ([[Anna Faris]]), Brenda Meeks ([[Regina Hall]]), Ray Wilkins ([[Shawn Wayans]]), and Shorty Meeks ([[Marlon Wayans]]) are at college, trying to live new lives since [[Scary Movie|having survived the events of the first film]]. Cindy and Brenda get tagged by a socially maladjusted girl, Alex ([[Tori Spelling]]). Shorty is still the same stoner he was before. Ray, still confused about his sexuality, has two new male friends, Tommy (James DeBello) and Buddy ([[Christopher Masterson]]). Buddy becomes romantically interested in Cindy, but she rebuffs him. Agreeing to become friends nonetheless, Buddy gives Cindy a not so friendly [[wedgie]], since he doesn\u2019t know how he should should treat a female friend.\n\nProfessor Oldman ([[Tim Curry]]) and his charming paraplegic assistant, Dwight Hartman ([[David Cross]]), plan to study the paranormal activity at a local [[Haunted house|haunted mansion]] called Hell House. They use Cindy and her friends as test subjects. At the mansion, Cindy encounters a foul-mouthed parrot and Hanson ([[Chris Elliott]]), the caretaker with a badly malformed hand. Later, the group is joined by newcomer hottie Theo ([[Kathleen Robertson]]). They sit down for dinner, but soon lose their appetite due to Hanson's repulsive antics, such as licking the turkey, and sticking his hands in all the food.\n\nLater that night, Cindy hears voices directing her to a secret room, where she and Buddy discover the diary of Hugh Kane's wife. Seeing her portrait, they note Cindy's resemblance to her. Meanwhile, other teens also experience bizarre encounters. Hugh Kane's invisible ghost has sex with Alex in her bedroom, and quickly leaves afterwards, since Alex shows signs of wanting to marry Huey. Cindy gets involved in a fistfight with the house cat, Mr. Kittles. When Cindy tries to tell the professor, he dismisses it, and sends Theo to take Cindy to bed, while hinting the girls should start \u201cexperimenting.\u201d Later, while Cindy is possessed by Huey Kane\u2019s wife, Cindy almost has sex with Oldman. Luckily she returns to normal, with no memory of the event. A toy clown ([[Suli McCullough]]) attempts to kill Ray, but in a strange turn of events, the clown doll gets [[rape]]d by Ray instead. A [[marijuana|weed-monster]] rolls Shorty into a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]]. It tries to smoke him (and succeeds, much to Shorty's enjoyment as he states: 'I'm getting as high as a motherf**ker!'), but gets distracted by [[Junk food|munchies]] and lets him escape. The next morning, Oldman tells Dwight no one is leaving the house, despite the attacks, and claims he is \u201cthis close to getting [[laid]].\u201d Dwight is given the only keys to get out of the house, and told to give them to nobody. Theo attempt to take the keys from Dwight by attempting to give him [[Oral sex|oral]] sex, but Dwight does it to himself, while a horrified Theo watches in disgust, then knocks him out.\n\nProfessor Oldman is seduced and killed by the ghost of Hugh's mistress. Shorty later encounters the same ghost, but seduces and has sex with her. After Dwight equips the teens with weapons that can injure their spectral enemy, they are pursued throughout the mansion, Alex attempts to win Huey\u2019s love, but is killed by Crane's ghost. Buddy and Cindy get locked in the walk-in freezer. Cindy gives Buddy a [[handjob]] and \"revives\" him, resulting in him releasing [[semen]] blasting Cindy to the door. Cindy then [[Hollow Man|uses a collection of random objects]] in the room to produce a [[Caterpillar tractor]] and escapes the freezer.\n\nHanson gets possessed by Kane and kidnaps Shorty, who is high on drugs. In the dining room, Hanson sets up a cooker and cuts off the top of Shorty's head. Instead of a brain, there is a small man rapping ([[Beetlejuice (entertainer)|Beetlejuice]]) inside. Cindy, Brenda, and Theo team up to fight the Kane-possessed Hanson using moves taken from ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', but ultimate wind up defeated. Dwight regroups with the teens. Cindy acts as bait to lure Kane into a device that will destroy him. The plan succeeds, freeing the group from the house's curse.\n\nTwo months later, Cindy and Buddy are in a relationship. They are out on a walk when Hanson shows up, closing in menacingly. Buddy disappears as Hanson gets hit by a car, driven by Shorty, who is receiving a [[blowjob]] from the ghost that he seduced earlier ([[Scary Movie|much like the opening and closing scenes of the previous movie]]).\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Cindy Campbell\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Shorty Meeks\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Brenda Meeks\n* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Ray Wilkins \n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Buddy Sanderson\n* [[Kathleen Robertson]] as Theo\n* [[David Cross]] as Dwight Hartman\n* [[James Woods]] as Father McFeely\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Professor Oldman\n* [[Tori Spelling]] as Alex Monday\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Hanson\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Father Harris\n* [[Richard Moll]] as Hugh Kane (Hell House Ghost)\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Mrs. Voorhees\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Megan Voorhees\n* [[Beetlejuice (entertainer)|Beetlejuice]] as Shorty's brain\n* [[Matthew Friedman|Matt Friedman]] (''voice'') as Polly the parrot \n* [[Vitamin C (singer)|Vitamin C]] (''voice'') as herself\n* [[Suli McCullough]] (''voice'') as Clown\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Parodies ==\n* ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959)\n* ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Rocky]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[Up in Smoke]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[The Changeling (film)|The Changeling]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Night of the Demons (1988 film)|Night of the Demons]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (film)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Hollow Man]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Save the Last Dance]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Rose Red (miniseries)|Rose Red]]'' (2002)\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nIn North America, the film grossed [[United States dollar|$]]71.3 million.

The film is the last in the series to feature the involvement of stars [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]] and [[Shawn Wayans]], and director [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]. Marlon would eventually go on to produce a similar horror-themed parody, ''[[A Haunted House]]'', and [[A Haunted House 2|its sequel]], both starring himself. In the latter film, Wayans pokes fun at the ''Scary Movie'' series' decline in quality after his family's departure.\n\nWhere the original film was mainly based on the [[slasher film]]s of the 1990s, ''Scary Movie 2'' parodies an array of supernatural and haunted house films from various decades, including ''[[The Haunting (1999)|The Haunting]]'' (1999), ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979), ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982), ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]'' (1973), ''House on Haunted Hill'' (both the [[House on Haunted Hill|1959]] and [[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|1999 versions]]), and ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' (1980).

The resulting offensive, planned for the spring of 1972, would be known as the [[Easter Offensive]] in the South and the Nguyen Hue Offensive in the North, Nguyen Hue being a hero of Vietnamese resistance against the Chinese in 1789. The Easter Offensive would make use of fourteen divisions and would be the largest in the war.<ref name=Fulghum>{{cite book|last1=Fulghum|first1=David|last2=Maitland|first2=Terrence|title=The Vietnam Experience: South Vietnam on Trial|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1984|isbn=9780939526109|page=116}}</ref>\n\nThe 1972 Easter Offensive/Nguyen Hue Campaign began with a massive attack on the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] with 30,000 [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) soldiers and more than 100 tanks. Two thrusts of equivalent size, one towards [[Saigon]] and a third to the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] and provincial capital of [[Kontum]] began soon after. The North Vietnamese knew that if they could capture Kontum and the Central Highlands, they would cut South Vietnam in half.<ref name=Sheehan>{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|title=A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam|publisher=Random House|year=1988|isbn=9780679724148|page=754}}</ref>\n\nThe Battle for Kontum would pit the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) [[22nd Division (South Vietnam)|22nd]] and (later) the [[23rd Division (South Vietnam)|23rd Divisions]] under the command of Lt.

First, due to President Nixon's [[Vietnamization]] policy, there were no American divisional forces in the Central Highlands, only advisers and U.S. aviation units including Air Cavalry helicopter units from the [[17th Cavalry Regiment|7/17 Air Cavalry Squadron]]. By June of that year there were less than 50,000 U.S. forces in all of Vietnam.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|23}}\n\nSecond, the North Vietnamese had persuaded the Soviets and Chinese to provide 400 [[PT-76]], [[T-34|T-34-85]], [[T-54/55|T-54s]], and [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tanks before the spring offensive.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|120}}\n\n==Background==\nNorth Vietnam had been using the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] along the border as a logistical artery for years. The mountainous terrain and the jungle were a shield against American air attack.\n\nThe ARVN bases at [[T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh Base Camp|T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh]] and [[\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4 Base Camp|\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4]], were protected by the 42nd Regiment of the 22nd Division. The 22nd also controlled five fire support bases (FSBs) that stretched south-west from Tan Canh towards Kontum along a backbone of mountains nicknamed '''Rocket Ridge'''.<ref name=Sheehan/>{{rp|755}}\n\n[[John Paul Vann]], the civilian \"general\" of [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]], had received intelligence that a major battle was coming. Lt. Gen. Du responded by gathering the 23rd Division into the Tan Canh/Kontum area. Vann also ordered increased [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] air attacks that February and March.\n\n===Attacks on the Fire Support Bases===\nOn 4 April 1972, the PAVN launched an early morning attack against [[Firebase Delta]]. Instead of the usual artillery fire from the jungle, elements of the PAVN 320th Infantry Division made a massed attack supported by artillery and rockets. For several days the PAVN hit FSB Delta and the other fire support bases along Rocket Ridge. Helicopters from the 52nd Combat Aviation operating out of [[Camp Holloway]] in Pleiku, were dispatched to provide support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebattleofkontum.com/phase1.html|publisher=Battle of Kontum website|accessdate=|title=The Battle of Kontum - Phase 1 - the Battle for the Fire Support Bases and Tan Canh}}</ref> The fireases were totally dependent on helicopter support for supplies and ammunition and in spite of the heavy anti-aircraft fire, the helicopters went on the offensive to provide fire support the FSBs. At one point, the northern part of Delta was overrun by elements of the 320th Division. John Paul Vann, already in the area for an air rescue, was able to direct attacks on the PAVN soldiers entering the base with [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|Cobra]] gunships. The PAVN attack was stopped in its tracks.<ref name=Sheehan/>{{rp|756-7}}\n\nOn 14 April, following a rocket and artillery barrage, the 320th Division attacked Firebase Charlie ({{Coord|14.576|N|107.778|E|display=inline}}) on the northern end of Rocket Ridge and 10km from Dak To. Despite airstrikes and helicopter gunship support the ARVN [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] defenders were forced to abandon the base that night. The attacks on the firebases continued as April wore on. Finally on April 21, FSB Delta was taken by the PAVN. Several of the other bases had to be given up soon after with heavy casualties.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ngo|first=Quang Truong|title=Indochina Monographs The Easter offensive of 1972|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History|year=1980|isbn=|pages=86-7}}</ref>\n\n===Loss of T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh and \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4===\nIn early 1972 the ARVN 42nd Regiment of the [[22nd Division (South Vietnam)|22nd Division]] was stationed at T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh.\n\nOn 7/8 February following intelligence showing a PAVN buildup in the area the 22nd Division forward command post, 47th Regiment and supporting units were moved from Ba Gi to the \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4/T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh area. Elements of the 19th Cavalry Regiment were attached to the Division to support its organic 14th Cavalry Regiment equipped with [[M41 Walker Bulldog|M-41 light tanks]]. The armored units would be deployed forward at [[Ben Het Camp]] which was regarded as the most likely direction of a PAVN armored attack.<ref name=MACV/>\n\nSince the start of the Easter Offensive at the end of March, the base areas had come under increasing PAVN artillery and rocket fire, which had gone from 20-50 rounds per day in March to up to 1000 per day by mid-April. During early April the 47th Regiment withdrew to \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4 II, while the 42nd Regiment and one Battalion of the 41st Regiment were at T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh supported by armor and artillery. In addition ARVN Airborne and [[Vietnamese Rangers|Rangers]] occupied a string of firebases along Rocket Ridge.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-6}} On 23 April, the PAVN [[2nd Division (Vietnam)|2nd Division]] started their attack on T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh by hitting the ARVN tanks with [[9M14 Malyutka|AT-3 missiles]] and this was followed by a direct hit on the 42nd Regiment command bunker injuring the senior U.S. Adviser and several of the ARVN commanders and severely undermining the confidence of Colonel Dat the 22nd Division commander. By midday all 5 of the M-41 tanks in the base and several more bunkers had been destroyed by the missiles. At 11:00 John Paul Vann landed to assess the situation and instructed the U.S. advisers to prepare to escape and evade from the camp. At 19:00 PAVN rocket fire ignited the base ammunition dump<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-7}}\n\nAt 21:00 a column of 18 PAVN tanks was spotted in the area, an Air Force [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]] gunship arrived at 23:00 and began to engage the [[T-54/55|T-54]] tanks with its 105mm cannon. Three T-54s were disabled but later recovered by the PAVN.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-7}} At midnight the tank column turned towards T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh and the ARVN artillery began firing on the column until stopped by PAVN counterbattery fire. Two bridges on the approach to T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh were abandoned without being destroyed. The ARVN organised hunter-killer teams and these destroyed two tanks.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-8}}\n\nJust before 06:00 on 24 April the PAVN tanks attacked T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh in two columns. One column of T-54s attacked the main gate, the other moving to secure the airstrip. The advance of the tanks caused the 900 support troops to panic. The new command bunker was hit by further artillery fire destroying the radio antennas. With the collapse of all command and control on the base, the American advisers abandoned the command bunker and moved to a new position to call in airstrikes, however fog made such airstrikes impossible.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-8}} At dawn Vann arrived over T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh in his [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa#OH-58A|OH-58A]] and made contact with the advisers who had escaped from the base perimeter. Vann landed and 6 advisers squeezed into the helicopter while frightened ARVN troops hung onto the skids. The helicopter flew to \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4 II to drop off the passengers and then flew back to T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh where they picked up the remaining 3 advisers, however the helicopter was swarmed by panicky ARVN and crashed on takeoff. Another helicopter came in and picked up Vann, his pilot and the 3 advisers and flew them to [[Pleiku]].<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-9}}\n\nOne hour after the main PAVN attack on T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh commenced, the PAVN began their attack on \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4. A [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1H]] helicopter #69-15715 landed to evacuate the 6 U.S. advisers who had been rescued from the T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh perimeter, this helicopter was hit by PAVN anti-aircraft fire and crashed, 5 passengers and crew were killed in the crash while 5 survived, evaded capture and were recovered up 13 days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vhpa.org/KIA/incident/72042410KIA.HTM|title=Information on Helicopter UH-1H 69-15715|publisher=Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> The PAVN penetrated the base perimeter suffering heavy losses, the remaining U.S. advisers called in airstrikes as the morning fog cleared but by 10am the 47th Regiment commander had lost contact with most of his subordinates and the command group evacuated the command bunker for a bunker in the inner perimeter.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-9}} A T-54 moved into the base and began direct fire on the command post, the two remaining M-41s engaged the T-54, however their 76mm guns had no apparent effect on the T-54 which quickly knocked out both M-41s. A relief column of M-41s supported by infantry arrived from Ben Het around this time, but all the M-41s were knocked out by [[RPG-2|B-40 rockets]] and recoilless rifle fire and the infantry dispersed. With the failure of this counterattack and the loss of command and control the ARVN forces began to evacuate the base towards the south. As the ARVN attempted to cross the Dak Poko river they came under intense PAVN fire and the senior U.S. adviser LTC Robert Brownlee disappeared during this engagement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miafacts.org/ssc%20report/apx%202j.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108084549/http://www.miafacts.org/ssc%20report/apx%202j.htm|url-status=dead|title=Report of the Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs: Appendix 2j|publisher=MIA Facts|accessdate=8 January 2015|archivedate=8 January 2015}}</ref> At 20:00 the 47th Regiment command group attempted to escape the base and by 04:30 on 25 April after losing several men to PAVN fire escaped the base perimeter and were recovered the following day.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-10}}\n\nOn 25 April the PAVN mopped up the remaining ARVN positions around T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh/\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4. The 22nd Division had ceased to exist as a fighting unit, the Division commander and his entire staff had disappeared and the PAVN had captured 23 105mm and 7 155mm howitzers and large supplies of ammunition and stores.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-11}} With the loss of the main camps, the remaining firebases along Rocket Ridge were abandoned and the PAVN had a clear approach to [[Kon Tum]].<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-12}}\n\n==Prelude==\nWith the loss of Tan Canh, little stood between the PAVN and Kontum. Whether because of logistical issues or lack of leadership, the PAVN did not pursue their advantage. Instead of refilling their tanks and traveling 25 miles to Kontum, the PAVN waited for almost three weeks.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|156}}\n\nJohn Vann took direct control of the ARVN II Corps forces. The remaining FSBs were evacuated. Lieutenant General Du was ordered to Saigon and replaced by Major General To\u00e0n.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-12}} John Vann also coordinated the replacement of the 22nd with the 23rd ARVN Division under the command of Colonel [[Ly Tong Ba]], an experienced commander. He also unified the 23rd with its organic regiments that had been stationed elsewhere.\n\nOn the ground in Kontum, Colonel John Truby, the acting Senior Advisor for the 23rd (awaiting the arrival of Col. Rhotenberry), had the task of tactical coordination of defense. Outlying units were brought into the city. A perimeter defense of the city and proper defence was implemented. The ARVN soldiers, believing that the T-54 tanks were unstoppable, were trained on how to attack them using [[M72 LAW]] missiles.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-14}}\n\nIn early May the PAVN turned their attention to the [[Polei Kleng Camp]] which blocked the avenue for attack on Kontum and to Ben Het Camp which threatened their supply lines. Polei Kleng had been subjected to artillery fire since 24 April, but from midday on 6 May the volume of fire increased dramatically with over 500 rounds systematically destroying the base bunkers and at 19:00 the two U.S. advisers at the base were evacuated by helicopter. The ARVN continued to hold for a further 3 days during which time U.S. airpower, including 16 B-52 strikes, was concentrated on the attacking PAVN. On the morning of 9 May the ARVN abandoned the base in the face of a PAVN tank and infantry assault.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-14}} At Ben Het on 9 May elements of the PAVN 203rd Armored Regiment assaulted the camp. ARVN Rangers destroyed the first three PT-76 tanks with [[BGM-71 TOW]] missiles, thereby breaking up the attack.<ref name=Starry>{{cite book|last=Starry|first=Donn|title=Mounted Combat In Vietnam Vietnam Studies|publisher=Department of the Army|year=1978|isbn=978-1780392462|pages=215\u2013217}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> The Rangers spent the rest of the day stabilising the perimeter ultimately destroying 11 tanks and killing over 100 PAVN.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-14}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Main action===\nOn 13 May 1st Combat Aerial TOW Team (''Hawk's Claw'') pilots noticed signs of a large buildup to the north. At 22:30 that night there were reports of lights moving down Route 14.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-15}}\n\nAs captured documents stated that the attack would take place at 04:00 on May 14, Col. Truby suggested to Vann that they order an air strike in preparation. However, the heavy PAVN artillery build up that had signalled attack at Tan Canh and the FSBs was absent. Even so, air support was requested. Another captured document indicated the attack had been moved back to 04:30, again, no attack occurred. Finally the defenders realized that PAVN intelligence would be operating on Hanoi time. At 05:30 as predicted, the attack began.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-15}}\n\nThe PAVN attacked Kontum without the heavy artillery preparation that had been used at Tan Canh and drove straight down Route 14. The 48th PAVN Regiment and 203rd Tank Regiment attacked the city from the northwest. The 28th PAVN Regiment came from the north and the 64th and 141st PAVN Regiments attacked from the south.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-15}} The ARVN artillery began targeting the T-54 tanks moving down Route 14. This targeting separated the supporting PAVN infantry from their tanks and allowed the ARVN tank killers to do their work. Two T-54s were destroyed by teams with LAWs. The sky was overcast and tactical air support was not able to operate, however, ''Hawk's Claw'' helicopters had arrived on the scene from [[Camp Holloway]]. Their helicopters and Jeeps had [[BGM-71 TOW]] missiles, which were powerful enough to penetrate a T-54. They found the PAVN tanks before they could find cover in the jungle and destroyed two more tanks. By 09:00 hours, the attack had been stopped.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-15}}\n\nThe PAVN continued their rocket and artillery fire throughout the day. Then at 20:00 on the 14th, the PAVN launched a second attack, putting heavy pressure on the north, west and south. There were two B-52 strikes scheduled and Col. Truby asked Vann if those strikes could be used to target the PAVN battalion that was already very close to their lines. The two forces were now close enough for hand-to-hand combat. Col. Truby called Lt. Col. Tom McKenna, senior advisor to the 44th ARVN Regiment, and told him to pull his men back and to have his troops find deep foxholes. As the hour for the B-52 strike approached, ARVN troops laid down cover fire to allow those in close proximity to the PAVN forces to be pulled back. At the same time the 44th Regiment was holding its own against the PAVN along its perimeter with the aid of AC-130s and helicopters. The two B-52 air strikes were close enough that as McKenna stated, \"it was like they [the bombs] came from the center of the earth \u2013 just like the bowels of the earth exploding.\"<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|156}} The PAVN forces pulled back having suffered significant casualties. On 15 May the PAVN attack continued, but the 44th held its positions assisted by tactical air support.\n\nOn the night of 16 May the PAVN pushed the 53rd from its positions and the perimeter was partially penetrated. Col. Ba blocked the nose of the penetration by ensuring that the 53rd's reserve force was put in proper location; but he did not want to move an additional blocking force through Kontum at night. There was considerable risk that enemy units would break through the lines and capture the city. A new B-52 strike was requested for the base of the penetration. This request was denied by the MACV staff because the intended strike area was too close to a small village shown on the map. After considerable debate and analysis by the advisory staff, Col. Truby remembered a technique taught at Ft. Leavenworth and suggested to Col. Ba that the troops at the nose of the penetration be withdrawn 500 yards despite the obvious difficulty of such a nighttime maneuver.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-17}} This would clear the threat to the town. Truby and Ba convinced Vann that if the ARVN forces could be pulled back during the cover of darkness, their safety concerns could be met.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-17}} The request was approved by II Corps and MACV and the new strike was adjusted by the B-52 in flight while ARVN artillery continued heavy fire to hold enemy forces in place. The strike was delivered on schedule with devastating results as PAVN forces had massed to break the perimeter defense. The attack had been stopped and numerous tanks destroyed.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-18}} The strike was decisive, for the first time since Tan Canh, the PAVN momentum had been broken. The three weakened PAVN divisions regrouped in the jungle surrounding Kontum.\n\n===Final attack on Kontum===\nThe strike was decisive for the battle, but the PAVN still had superior numbers and quickly began to regroup. During this period, Col. Rhotenberry, the advisor originally assigned to work with Col. Ba, arrived in country. Mr. Vann returned Col. Truby to his original job of overseeing other actions within II Corps.\n\nDuring the next two weeks, the ARVN and PAVN forces tested each other.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-19}} The ARVN forces responded to artillery attacks with their own artillery or by calling in ''Hawk's Claw'' helicopter fire. B-52 sorties were again used. However the PAVN had years of experience with the B-52s and knew not to mass troops as they had while trying to break the perimeter defense. At 03:45 on 20 May, the 53rd Regiment was attacked by the first of three all-out assaults from the north. On the third attack the 53rd was pushed from their positions. Throughout that day the 53rd tried to regain their position but the PAVN was now dug in. Col. Rhotenberry, the division's new senior adviser, and Col. Ba decided to pull up nine M-41 tanks and to direct all that fire to the enemy position along with helicopter gunships.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-19}} The front was restored. Three additional assaults were made in the early morning hours. Each was pushed back after fierce hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-20}}\n\nIn the early hours of 25 May, PAVN mortar and artillery fire increased enough to indicate preparation for a major attack. In the southern quadrant, the artillery fire kept the 23rd Division in their bunkers. Under the artillery cover, the PAVN sappers, some dressed in ARVN uniforms, moved into the buildings south of the [[Kontum Airfield]].<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-22}}\n\nIn the early morning of 26 May, the PAVN attacked the 23rd Division from the north with tank/infantry teams. At first light, ''Hawk's Claw'' was able to destroy nine tanks, two machine guns, and one truck. This effectively stopped the momentum of the attack.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-22}} Later in the day Col. Ba threw a battalion of the 44th Regiment into the fight. This limited the enemy penetration of the ARVN lines. After dark, attacks on the ARVN 45th and 53rd Regiments increased with the 45th facing the heaviest action. Tactical air support was diverted to supporting the regiment. Lt. Col. Grant and Col. Rhotenberry were able to divert two B-52 strikes scheduled for 02:30 on 27 May and this blunted the attack.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-22}} That same morning the 44th Regiment woke to discover PAVN tank and infantry within their perimeter. The area hadn't been properly secured and T-54 tanks were within 50 yards of the bunkers.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-23}} If these PAVN units breached the 44th's defenses, they could pour into the city. The defenders were able to use M-72 LAW fire to slow the tanks. By dawn, ''Hawk's Claw'' helicopters arrived from Pleiku. The dense smoke obscured the action but the ''Hawk's Claw'' crews were still able to destroy two T-54 tanks.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-23}} With helicopters to neutralize the tanks, the ARVN infantry was able to stop the advance of the PAVN.\n\nThe battle see-sawed back and forth on 28 May. The PAVN occupied bunkers and buildings in sections of the city and were too well fortified to be destroyed by air or artillery attacks.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-24}} However, their ability to launch a sustained attack seemed to be gone. With US and RVNAF air superiority, PAVN troops could not receiving adequate food and supplies from their bases in the jungle.\n\nOn 6 June, the PAVN's B3 Front Command mobilized their last reserve unit, the 66th Regiment to cover the withdrawal of all remaining within the town.\n\nFrom 29 May to 8 June the ARVN forces went bunker to bunker cleaning out the remaining PAVN forces. On 9 June the city of Kontum was declared fully secure by the 23rd Division Commander, Ly Tong Ba, who had been promoted to Brigadier General. The combined efforts of the ARVN troops and US aviation units had finally stopped the massive assault.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThat same night John Paul Vann and his pilot were flying through the mountains. The night was rainy and there were low clouds. The pilot didn't realize his altitude and flew into the hillside.<ref name=Sheehan/>{{rp|787}} A Vietnamese account stated that the helicopter carrying him was shot down. The purpose of the flight was to deliver a celebration cake to the advisers and ARVN commanders for the Kontum victory. John Paul Vann had been a key in developing a more subtle and flexible approach to the war, one based on winning over the hearts and minds of the local population while using the US military's traditional strengths. His death was a huge loss.\n\nThe Battle of Kontum, a key success during this period, was virtually ignored in the US. The victory was written off simply as an example of B-52 power. Certainly the hundreds of missions between February and June were a major element of the success, but the PAVN had neutralized this advantage in large part by using the jungle and attacking at night.\n\nThe other keys to success, in addition to the B-52 strikes, were the close integration of US advisers and their ARVN counterparts and the moment-to-moment edge provided by aviation units flying in support of the ARVN forces. If the ARVN forces had not been able to hold their ground, the battle would have been lost. The 23rd Division's determined defense under the leadership of Ly Tong Ba forced the PAVN forces to compensate by attempting a breakthrough of the perimeter. This exposed them to a decisive strike which killed a great many of their soldiers. Without these two elements, the 23rd Division might not have pulled itself together and successfully resisted three divisions of battle-hardened PAVN soldiers and armor units. Nevertheless, their capabilities and the leadership of Col. Ba were of primary importance\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Secondary Sources===\n* [[Thomas P.

The resulting offensive, planned for the spring of 1972, would be known as the [[Easter Offensive]] in the South and the Nguyen Hue Offensive in the North, Nguyen Hue being a hero of Vietnamese resistance against the Chinese in 1789. The Easter Offensive would make use of fourteen divisions and would be the largest in the war.<ref name=Fulghum>{{cite book|last1=Fulghum|first1=David|last2=Maitland|first2=Terrence|title=The Vietnam Experience: South Vietnam on Trial|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1984|isbn=9780939526109|page=116}}</ref>\n\nThe 1972 Easter Offensive/Nguyen Hue Campaign began with a massive attack on the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] with 30,000 [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) soldiers and more than 100 tanks. Two thrusts of equivalent size, one towards [[Saigon]] and a third to the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] and provincial capital of [[Kontum]] began soon after. The North Vietnamese knew that if they could capture Kontum and the Central Highlands, they would cut South Vietnam in half.<ref name=Sheehan>{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|title=A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam|publisher=Random House|year=1988|isbn=9780679724148|page=754}}</ref>\n\nThe Battle for Kontum would pit the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) [[22nd Division (South Vietnam)|22nd]] and (later) the [[23rd Division (South Vietnam)|23rd Divisions]] under the command of Lt.

First, due to President Nixon's [[Vietnamization]] policy, there were no American divisional forces in the Central Highlands, only advisers and U.S. aviation units including Air Cavalry helicopter units from the [[17th Cavalry Regiment|7/17 Air Cavalry Squadron]]. By June of that year there were less than 50,000 U.S. forces in all of Vietnam.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|23}}\n\nSecond, the North Vietnamese had persuaded the Soviets and Chinese to provide 400 [[PT-76]], [[T-34|T-34-85]], [[T-54/55|T-54s]], and [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tanks before the spring offensive.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|120}}\n\n==Background==\nNorth Vietnam had been using the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] along the border as a logistical artery for years. The mountainous terrain and the jungle were a shield against American air attack.\n\nThe ARVN bases at [[T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh Base Camp|T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh]] and [[\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4 Base Camp|\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4]], were protected by the 42nd Regiment of the 22nd Division. The 22nd also controlled five fire support bases (FSBs) that stretched south-west from Tan Canh towards Kontum along a backbone of mountains nicknamed '''Rocket Ridge'''.<ref name=Sheehan/>{{rp|755}}\n\n[[John Paul Vann]], the civilian \"general\" of [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]], had received intelligence that a major battle was coming. Lt. Gen. Du responded by gathering the 23rd Division into the Tan Canh/Kontum area. Vann also ordered increased [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] air attacks that February and March.\n\n===Attacks on the Fire Support Bases===\nOn the morning of 4 April 1972, an early morning attack was launched against [[Firebase Delta]]. Instead of the usual artillery fire from the jungle, elements of the PAVN 320th Infantry Division made a massed attack supported by artillery and rockets. For several days the PAVN hit FSB Delta and the other fire support bases along Rocket Ridge. Helicopters from the 52nd Combat Aviation operating out of [[Camp Holloway]] in Pleiku, were dispatched to provide support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebattleofkontum.com/phase1.html|publisher=Battle of Kontum website|accessdate=|title=The Battle of Kontum - Phase 1 - the Battle for the Fire Support Bases and Tan Canh}}</ref> The FSBs were totally dependent on helicopter support for supplies and ammunition and in spite of the heavy anti-aircraft fire, the helicopters went on the offensive to provide fire support the FSBs. At one point, the northern part of FSB Delta became overrun by elements of the 320th Division. John Paul Vann, already in the area for an air rescue, was able to direct attacks on the PAVN soldiers entering the base with [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|Cobra]] gunships. The PAVN attack was stopped in its tracks.<ref name=Sheehan/>{{rp|756-7}}\n\nOn 14 April, following a rocket and artillery barrage, the 320th Division attacked Firebase Charlie ({{Coord|14.576|N|107.778|E|display=inline}}) on the northern end of Rocket Ridge and 10km from Dak To. Despite airstrikes and helicopter gunship support the ARVN [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] defenders were forced to abandon the base that night. The attacks on the firebases continued as April wore on. Finally on April 21, FSB Delta was taken by the PAVN. Several of the other bases had to be given up soon after with heavy casualties.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ngo|first=Quang Truong|title=Indochina Monographs The Easter offensive of 1972|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History|year=1980|isbn=|pages=86-7}}</ref>\n\n===Loss of T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh and \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4===\nIn early 1972 the ARVN 42nd Regiment of the [[22nd Division (South Vietnam)|22nd Division]] was stationed at T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh.\n\nOn 7/8 February following intelligence showing a PAVN buildup in the area the 22nd Division forward command post, 47th Regiment and supporting units were moved from Ba Gi to the \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4/T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh area. Elements of the 19th Cavalry Regiment were attached to the Division to support its organic 14th Cavalry Regiment equipped with [[M41 Walker Bulldog|M-41 light tanks]]. The armored units would be deployed forward at [[Ben Het Camp]] which was regarded as the most likely direction of a PAVN armored attack.<ref name=MACV/>\n\nSince the start of the Easter Offensive at the end of March, the base areas had come under increasing PAVN artillery and rocket fire, which had gone from 20-50 rounds per day in March to up to 1000 per day by mid-April. During early April the 47th Regiment withdrew to \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4 II, while the 42nd Regiment and one Battalion of the 41st Regiment were at T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh supported by armor and artillery. In addition ARVN Airborne and [[Vietnamese Rangers|Rangers]] occupied a string of firebases along Rocket Ridge.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-6}} On 23 April, the PAVN [[2nd Division (Vietnam)|2nd Division]] started their attack on T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh by hitting the ARVN tanks with [[9M14 Malyutka|AT-3 missiles]] and this was followed by a direct hit on the 42nd Regiment command bunker injuring the senior U.S. Adviser and several of the ARVN commanders and severely undermining the confidence of Colonel Dat the 22nd Division commander. By midday all 5 of the M-41 tanks in the base and several more bunkers had been destroyed by the missiles. At 11:00 John Paul Vann landed to assess the situation and instructed the U.S. advisers to prepare to escape and evade from the camp. At 19:00 PAVN rocket fire ignited the base ammunition dump<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-7}}\n\nAt 21:00 a column of 18 PAVN tanks was spotted in the area, an Air Force [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]] gunship arrived at 23:00 and began to engage the [[T-54/55|T-54]] tanks with its 105mm cannon. Three T-54s were disabled but later recovered by the PAVN.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-7}} At midnight the tank column turned towards T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh and the ARVN artillery began firing on the column until stopped by PAVN counterbattery fire. Two bridges on the approach to T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh were abandoned without being destroyed. The ARVN organised hunter-killer teams and these destroyed two tanks.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-8}}\n\nJust before 06:00 on 24 April the PAVN tanks attacked T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh in two columns. One column of T-54s attacked the main gate, the other moving to secure the airstrip. The advance of the tanks caused the 900 support troops to panic. The new command bunker was hit by further artillery fire destroying the radio antennas. With the collapse of all command and control on the base, the American advisers abandoned the command bunker and moved to a new position to call in airstrikes, however fog made such airstrikes impossible.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-8}} At dawn Vann arrived over T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh in his [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa#OH-58A|OH-58A]] and made contact with the advisers who had escaped from the base perimeter. Vann landed and 6 advisers squeezed into the helicopter while frightened ARVN troops hung onto the skids. The helicopter flew to \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4 II to drop off the passengers and then flew back to T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh where they picked up the remaining 3 advisers, however the helicopter was swarmed by panicky ARVN and crashed on takeoff. Another helicopter came in and picked up Vann, his pilot and the 3 advisers and flew them to [[Pleiku]].<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-9}}\n\nOne hour after the main PAVN attack on T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh commenced, the PAVN began their attack on \u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4. A [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1H]] helicopter #69-15715 landed to evacuate the 6 U.S. advisers who had been rescued from the T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh perimeter, this helicopter was hit by PAVN anti-aircraft fire and crashed, 5 passengers and crew were killed in the crash while 5 survived, evaded capture and were recovered up 13 days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vhpa.org/KIA/incident/72042410KIA.HTM|title=Information on Helicopter UH-1H 69-15715|publisher=Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> The PAVN penetrated the base perimeter suffering heavy losses, the remaining U.S. advisers called in airstrikes as the morning fog cleared but by 10am the 47th Regiment commander had lost contact with most of his subordinates and the command group evacuated the command bunker for a bunker in the inner perimeter.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-9}} A T-54 moved into the base and began direct fire on the command post, the two remaining M-41s engaged the T-54, however their 76mm guns had no apparent effect on the T-54 which quickly knocked out both M-41s. A relief column of M-41s supported by infantry arrived from Ben Het around this time, but all the M-41s were knocked out by [[RPG-2|B-40 rockets]] and recoilless rifle fire and the infantry dispersed. With the failure of this counterattack and the loss of command and control the ARVN forces began to evacuate the base towards the south. As the ARVN attempted to cross the Dak Poko river they came under intense PAVN fire and the senior U.S. adviser LTC Robert Brownlee disappeared during this engagement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miafacts.org/ssc%20report/apx%202j.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108084549/http://www.miafacts.org/ssc%20report/apx%202j.htm|url-status=dead|title=Report of the Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs: Appendix 2j|publisher=MIA Facts|accessdate=8 January 2015|archivedate=8 January 2015}}</ref> At 20:00 the 47th Regiment command group attempted to escape the base and by 04:30 on 25 April after losing several men to PAVN fire escaped the base perimeter and were recovered the following day.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-10}}\n\nOn 25 April the PAVN mopped up the remaining ARVN positions around T\u00e2n C\u1ea3nh/\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4. The 22nd Division had ceased to exist as a fighting unit, the Division commander and his entire staff had disappeared and the PAVN had captured 23 105mm and 7 155mm howitzers and large supplies of ammunition and stores.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-11}} With the loss of the main camps, the remaining firebases along Rocket Ridge were abandoned and the PAVN had a clear approach to [[Kon Tum]].<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-12}}\n\n==Prelude==\nWith the loss of Tan Canh, little stood between the PAVN and Kontum. Whether because of logistical issues or lack of leadership, the PAVN did not pursue their advantage. Instead of refilling their tanks and traveling 25 miles to Kontum, the PAVN waited for almost three weeks.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|156}}\n\nJohn Vann took direct control of the ARVN II Corps forces. The remaining FSBs were evacuated. Lieutenant General Du was ordered to Saigon and replaced by Major General To\u00e0n.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-12}} John Vann also coordinated the replacement of the 22nd with the 23rd ARVN Division under the command of Colonel [[Ly Tong Ba]], an experienced commander. He also unified the 23rd with its organic regiments that had been stationed elsewhere.\n\nOn the ground in Kontum, Colonel John Truby, the acting Senior Advisor for the 23rd (awaiting the arrival of Col. Rhotenberry), had the task of tactical coordination of defense. Outlying units were brought into the city. A perimeter defense of the city and proper defence was implemented. The ARVN soldiers, believing that the T-54 tanks were unstoppable, were trained on how to attack them using [[M72 LAW]] missiles.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-14}}\n\nIn early May the PAVN turned their attention to the [[Polei Kleng Camp]] which blocked the avenue for attack on Kontum and to Ben Het Camp which threatened their supply lines. Polei Kleng had been subjected to artillery fire since 24 April, but from midday on 6 May the volume of fire increased dramatically with over 500 rounds systematically destroying the base bunkers and at 19:00 the two U.S. advisers at the base were evacuated by helicopter. The ARVN continued to hold for a further 3 days during which time U.S. airpower, including 16 B-52 strikes, was concentrated on the attacking PAVN. On the morning of 9 May the ARVN abandoned the base in the face of a PAVN tank and infantry assault.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-14}} At Ben Het on 9 May elements of the PAVN 203rd Armored Regiment assaulted the camp. ARVN Rangers destroyed the first three PT-76 tanks with [[BGM-71 TOW]] missiles, thereby breaking up the attack.<ref name=Starry>{{cite book|last=Starry|first=Donn|title=Mounted Combat In Vietnam Vietnam Studies|publisher=Department of the Army|year=1978|isbn=978-1780392462|pages=215\u2013217}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> The Rangers spent the rest of the day stabilising the perimeter ultimately destroying 11 tanks and killing over 100 PAVN.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-14}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Main action===\nOn 13 May 1st Combat Aerial TOW Team (''Hawk's Claw'') pilots noticed signs of a large buildup to the north. At 22:30 that night there were reports of lights moving down Route 14.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-15}}\n\nAs captured documents stated that the attack would take place at 04:00 on May 14, Col. Truby suggested to Vann that they order an air strike in preparation. However, the heavy PAVN artillery build up that had signalled attack at Tan Canh and the FSBs was absent. Even so, air support was requested. Another captured document indicated the attack had been moved back to 04:30, again, no attack occurred. Finally the defenders realized that PAVN intelligence would be operating on Hanoi time. At 05:30 as predicted, the attack began.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-15}}\n\nThe PAVN attacked Kontum without the heavy artillery preparation that had been used at Tan Canh and drove straight down Route 14. The 48th PAVN Regiment and 203rd Tank Regiment attacked the city from the northwest. The 28th PAVN Regiment came from the north and the 64th and 141st PAVN Regiments attacked from the south.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-15}} The ARVN artillery began targeting the T-54 tanks moving down Route 14. This targeting separated the supporting PAVN infantry from their tanks and allowed the ARVN tank killers to do their work. Two T-54s were destroyed by teams with LAWs. The sky was overcast and tactical air support was not able to operate, however, ''Hawk's Claw'' helicopters had arrived on the scene from [[Camp Holloway]]. Their helicopters and Jeeps had [[BGM-71 TOW]] missiles, which were powerful enough to penetrate a T-54. They found the PAVN tanks before they could find cover in the jungle and destroyed two more tanks. By 09:00 hours, the attack had been stopped.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-15}}\n\nThe PAVN continued their rocket and artillery fire throughout the day. Then at 20:00 on the 14th, the PAVN launched a second attack, putting heavy pressure on the north, west and south. There were two B-52 strikes scheduled and Col. Truby asked Vann if those strikes could be used to target the PAVN battalion that was already very close to their lines. The two forces were now close enough for hand-to-hand combat. Col. Truby called Lt. Col. Tom McKenna, senior advisor to the 44th ARVN Regiment, and told him to pull his men back and to have his troops find deep foxholes. As the hour for the B-52 strike approached, ARVN troops laid down cover fire to allow those in close proximity to the PAVN forces to be pulled back. At the same time the 44th Regiment was holding its own against the PAVN along its perimeter with the aid of AC-130s and helicopters. The two B-52 air strikes were close enough that as McKenna stated, \"it was like they [the bombs] came from the center of the earth \u2013 just like the bowels of the earth exploding.\"<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|156}} The PAVN forces pulled back having suffered significant casualties. On 15 May the PAVN attack continued, but the 44th held its positions assisted by tactical air support.\n\nOn the night of 16 May the PAVN pushed the 53rd from its positions and the perimeter was partially penetrated. Col. Ba blocked the nose of the penetration by ensuring that the 53rd's reserve force was put in proper location; but he did not want to move an additional blocking force through Kontum at night. There was considerable risk that enemy units would break through the lines and capture the city. A new B-52 strike was requested for the base of the penetration. This request was denied by the MACV staff because the intended strike area was too close to a small village shown on the map. After considerable debate and analysis by the advisory staff, Col. Truby remembered a technique taught at Ft. Leavenworth and suggested to Col. Ba that the troops at the nose of the penetration be withdrawn 500 yards despite the obvious difficulty of such a nighttime maneuver.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-17}} This would clear the threat to the town. Truby and Ba convinced Vann that if the ARVN forces could be pulled back during the cover of darkness, their safety concerns could be met.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-17}} The request was approved by II Corps and MACV and the new strike was adjusted by the B-52 in flight while ARVN artillery continued heavy fire to hold enemy forces in place. The strike was delivered on schedule with devastating results as PAVN forces had massed to break the perimeter defense. The attack had been stopped and numerous tanks destroyed.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-18}} The strike was decisive, for the first time since Tan Canh, the PAVN momentum had been broken. The three weakened PAVN divisions regrouped in the jungle surrounding Kontum.\n\n===Final attack on Kontum===\nThe strike was decisive for the battle, but the PAVN still had superior numbers and quickly began to regroup. During this period, Col. Rhotenberry, the advisor originally assigned to work with Col. Ba, arrived in country. Mr. Vann returned Col. Truby to his original job of overseeing other actions within II Corps.\n\nDuring the next two weeks, the ARVN and PAVN forces tested each other.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-19}} The ARVN forces responded to artillery attacks with their own artillery or by calling in ''Hawk's Claw'' helicopter fire. B-52 sorties were again used. However the PAVN had years of experience with the B-52s and knew not to mass troops as they had while trying to break the perimeter defense. At 03:45 on 20 May, the 53rd Regiment was attacked by the first of three all-out assaults from the north. On the third attack the 53rd was pushed from their positions. Throughout that day the 53rd tried to regain their position but the PAVN was now dug in. Col. Rhotenberry, the division's new senior adviser, and Col. Ba decided to pull up nine M-41 tanks and to direct all that fire to the enemy position along with helicopter gunships.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-19}} The front was restored. Three additional assaults were made in the early morning hours. Each was pushed back after fierce hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-20}}\n\nIn the early hours of 25 May, PAVN mortar and artillery fire increased enough to indicate preparation for a major attack. In the southern quadrant, the artillery fire kept the 23rd Division in their bunkers. Under the artillery cover, the PAVN sappers, some dressed in ARVN uniforms, moved into the buildings south of the [[Kontum Airfield]].<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-22}}\n\nIn the early morning of 26 May, the PAVN attacked the 23rd Division from the north with tank/infantry teams. At first light, ''Hawk's Claw'' was able to destroy nine tanks, two machine guns, and one truck. This effectively stopped the momentum of the attack.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-22}} Later in the day Col. Ba threw a battalion of the 44th Regiment into the fight. This limited the enemy penetration of the ARVN lines. After dark, attacks on the ARVN 45th and 53rd Regiments increased with the 45th facing the heaviest action. Tactical air support was diverted to supporting the regiment. Lt. Col. Grant and Col. Rhotenberry were able to divert two B-52 strikes scheduled for 02:30 on 27 May and this blunted the attack.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-22}} That same morning the 44th Regiment woke to discover PAVN tank and infantry within their perimeter. The area hadn't been properly secured and T-54 tanks were within 50 yards of the bunkers.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-23}} If these PAVN units breached the 44th's defenses, they could pour into the city. The defenders were able to use M-72 LAW fire to slow the tanks. By dawn, ''Hawk's Claw'' helicopters arrived from Pleiku. The dense smoke obscured the action but the ''Hawk's Claw'' crews were still able to destroy two T-54 tanks.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-23}} With helicopters to neutralize the tanks, the ARVN infantry was able to stop the advance of the PAVN.\n\nThe battle see-sawed back and forth on 28 May. The PAVN occupied bunkers and buildings in sections of the city and were too well fortified to be destroyed by air or artillery attacks.<ref name=MACV/>{{rp|K-24}} However, their ability to launch a sustained attack seemed to be gone. With US and RVNAF air superiority, PAVN troops could not receiving adequate food and supplies from their bases in the jungle.\n\nOn 6 June, the PAVN's B3 Front Command mobilized their last reserve unit, the 66th Regiment to cover the withdrawal of all remaining within the town.\n\nFrom 29 May to 8 June the ARVN forces went bunker to bunker cleaning out the remaining PAVN forces. On 9 June the city of Kontum was declared fully secure by the 23rd Division Commander, Ly Tong Ba, who had been promoted to Brigadier General. The combined efforts of the ARVN troops and US aviation units had finally stopped the massive assault.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThat same night John Paul Vann and his pilot were flying through the mountains. The night was rainy and there were low clouds. The pilot didn't realize his altitude and flew into the hillside.<ref name=Sheehan/>{{rp|787}} A Vietnamese account stated that the helicopter carrying him was shot down. The purpose of the flight was to deliver a celebration cake to the advisers and ARVN commanders for the Kontum victory. John Paul Vann had been a key in developing a more subtle and flexible approach to the war, one based on winning over the hearts and minds of the local population while using the US military's traditional strengths. His death was a huge loss.\n\nThe Battle of Kontum, a key success during this period, was virtually ignored in the US. The victory was written off simply as an example of B-52 power. Certainly the hundreds of missions between February and June were a major element of the success, but the PAVN had neutralized this advantage in large part by using the jungle and attacking at night.\n\nThe other keys to success, in addition to the B-52 strikes, were the close integration of US advisers and their ARVN counterparts and the moment-to-moment edge provided by aviation units flying in support of the ARVN forces. If the ARVN forces had not been able to hold their ground, the battle would have been lost. The 23rd Division's determined defense under the leadership of Ly Tong Ba forced the PAVN forces to compensate by attempting a breakthrough of the perimeter. This exposed them to a decisive strike which killed a great many of their soldiers. Without these two elements, the 23rd Division might not have pulled itself together and successfully resisted three divisions of battle-hardened PAVN soldiers and armor units. Nevertheless, their capabilities and the leadership of Col. Ba were of primary importance\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Secondary Sources===\n* [[Thomas P.

The town's main sources of employment are now the Godfrey Institute for Biomedical Technologies and Hemlock Acres Hospital. Heading the Institute\u2014which is rumored to conduct sinister experiments on a daily basis\u2014is the imposing Olivia Godfrey ([[Famke Janssen]]), while Hemlock Acres' lead psychiatrist is Olivia's dead husband's brother, Dr. Norman Godfrey ([[Dougray Scott]]).\n\nAs season one opens, the town's rumor mill turns even more twisted, as two teenage girls are brutally killed and their bodies left for unsuspecting people to find the next day. Peter Rumancek ([[Landon Liboiron]]) a 17-year-old [[Romani people|Romani]] boy, is suspected of the crimes by some of the townsfolk; he is also rumored to be a [[werewolf]]. Secretly, he is, in fact, a werewolf, and, along with the heir to the Godfrey estate, the troubled Roman Godfrey ([[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]]), he sets out to solve the mystery.\n\nRounding out the main cast of characters of the first season are Norman's daughter (Roman's cousin), the beautiful, Letha Godfrey ([[Penelope Mitchell]]) who claims the father of her unborn child is an angel from Heaven, and Christina Wendall ([[Freya Tingley]]), a lonely girl who becomes interested in Peter.\n\nFor season two, two former supporting characters were promoted to the main cast of characters: Peter's [[con-artist]] older cousin Destiny ([[Tiio Horn]]), who makes her living as a [[psychic medium]], and Dr. Johann Pryce ([[Joel de la Fuente]]), the lead scientist of the Godfrey Institute, a [[mad scientist|brilliant but ruthless man of science]], gifted with [[super-strength]]. A cult has arisen that is bent on destroying the supernatural creatures in Hemlock Grove by any means necessary. To make matters worse, both Peter and Roman struggle with their nature, as Peter risks becoming the same killer from the first season and Roman, after his full immersion with his true nature in the first season, has developed an insatiable hunger to kill. As they fight their enemies and deal with their situations, they must also deal with the monsters they are becoming, or have already become.\n{{:List of Hemlock Grove episodes}}\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Olivia Godfrey\n* [[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Roman Godfrey\n* [[Landon Liboiron]] as Peter Rumancek \n* [[Penelope Mitchell]] as Letha Godfrey (season 1)\n* [[Freya Tingley]] as Christina Wendall (season 1)\n* [[Kaniehtiio Horn]] as Destiny Rumancek (season 2\u20133; recurring season 1)\n* [[Joel de la Fuente]] as Dr. Johann Pryce (season 2\u20133; recurring season 1)\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Dr. Norman Godfrey (season 1\u20132)\n* Nicole Boivin (recurring season 1) and [[Madeleine Martin]] (season 3; recurring season 2),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/10/victoria-justice-in-eye-candy-madeleine-martin-boards-hemlock-grove-troy-garrity-in-hbo-pilot-ballers/#|title=Victoria Justice In \u2018Eye Candy\u2019, Madeleine Martin Boards \u2018Hemlock Grove\u2019, Troy Garity In HBO Pilot \u2018Ballers\u2019|first=The Deadline|last=Team|date=October 11, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}</ref> as Shelley Godfrey, Roman's heavily deformed but good-hearted sister.

The town is a mixture of extreme wealth and poverty, as the closing of the town's steel mill many years earlier caused many to lose their jobs. The town's main sources of employment are now the Godfrey Institute for Biomedical Technologies and Hemlock Acres Hospital. Heading the Institute\u2014which is rumored to conduct sinister experiments on a daily basis\u2014is the imposing Olivia Godfrey ([[Famke Janssen]]), while Hemlock Acres' lead psychiatrist is Olivia's dead husband's brother, Dr. Norman Godfrey ([[Dougray Scott]]).\n\nAs season one opens, the town's rumor mill turns even more twisted, as two teenage girls are brutally killed and their bodies left for unsuspecting people to find the next day. Peter Rumancek ([[Landon Liboiron]]) a 17-year-old [[Romani people|Romani]] boy, is suspected of the crimes by some of the townsfolk; he is also rumored to be a [[werewolf]]. Secretly, he is, in fact, a werewolf, and, along with the heir to the Godfrey estate, the troubled Roman Godfrey ([[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]]), he sets out to solve the mystery.\n\nRounding out the main cast of characters of the first season are Norman's daughter (Roman's cousin), the beautiful, Letha Godfrey ([[Penelope Mitchell]]) who claims the father of her unborn child is an angel from Heaven, and Christina Wendall ([[Freya Tingley]]), a lonely girl who becomes interested in Peter.\n\nFor season two, two former supporting characters were promoted to the main cast of characters: Peter's [[con-artist]] older cousin Destiny ([[Tiio Horn]]), who makes her living as a [[psychic medium]], and Dr. Johann Pryce ([[Joel de la Fuente]]), the lead scientist of the Godfrey Institute, a [[mad scientist|brilliant but ruthless man of science]], gifted with [[super-strength]]. A cult has arisen that is bent on destroying the supernatural creatures in Hemlock Grove by any means necessary. To make matters worse, both Peter and Roman struggle with their nature, as Peter risks becoming the same killer from the first season and Roman, after his full immersion with his true nature in the first season, has developed an insatiable hunger to kill. As they fight their enemies and deal with their situations, they must also deal with the monsters they are becoming, or have already become.\n{{:List of Hemlock Grove episodes}}\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Olivia Godfrey\n* [[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Roman Godfrey\n* [[Landon Liboiron]] as Peter Rumancek \n* [[Penelope Mitchell]] as Letha Godfrey (season 1)\n* [[Freya Tingley]] as Christina Wendall (season 1)\n* [[Kaniehtiio Horn]] as Destiny Rumancek (season 2\u20133; recurring season 1)\n* [[Joel de la Fuente]] as Dr. Johann Pryce (season 2\u20133; recurring season 1)\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Dr. Norman Godfrey (season 1\u20132)\n* Nicole Boivin (recurring season 1) and [[Madeleine Martin]] (season 3; recurring season 2),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/10/victoria-justice-in-eye-candy-madeleine-martin-boards-hemlock-grove-troy-garrity-in-hbo-pilot-ballers/#|title=Victoria Justice In \u2018Eye Candy\u2019, Madeleine Martin Boards \u2018Hemlock Grove\u2019, Troy Garity In HBO Pilot \u2018Ballers\u2019|first=The Deadline|last=Team|date=October 11, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}</ref> as Shelley Godfrey, Roman's heavily deformed but good-hearted sister.

After making his first film ''[[Nuts in May (film)|Nuts in May]]'', [[Universal Studios|Universal]] offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody ''[[Mud and Sand]]''.\n\nBy 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with [[Joe Rock]] for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native [[Australia]], which she accepted.<ref>Bergan 1992, p. 33.</ref> The 12 two-reel comedies were ''[[Mandarin Mix-Up]]'' (1924), ''[[Detained (film)|Detained]]'' (1924), ''[[Monsieur Don't Care]]'' (1924), ''[[West of Hot Dog]]'' (1924), ''[[Somewhere in Wrong]]'' (1925), ''[[Twins (1925 film)|Twins]]'' (1925), ''[[Pie-Eyed]]'' (1925), ''[[The Snow Hawk]]'' (1925), ''[[Navy Blue Days]]'' (1925), ''[[The Sleuth (1925 film)|The Sleuth]]'' (1925), ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1925) and ''[[Half a Man (film)|Half a Man]]'' (1925).\n\n==Laurel and Hardy==\n{{Main|Laurel and Hardy}}\n[[File:Laurel and Hardy in Lucky Dog.jpg|thumb|left|Laurel with Hardy in ''[[The Lucky Dog (1921 film)|The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921), long before they became a team.]]\nLaurel next signed with the [[Hal Roach]] studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]'' (in which [[Oliver Hardy]] had a part under the name \"Babe\" Hardy). It had been his intention to work primarily as a writer and director.\n\nThe same year, Hardy, a member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy ''All Star'' players, was injured in a kitchen mishap and hospitalised. Because he was unable to work on the scheduled film, ''Get 'Em Young'', Laurel was asked to return to acting to fill in. Starting early in 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in several short films, including ''[[Duck Soup (1927 film)|Duck Soup]]'', ''[[Slipping Wives]]'' and ''[[With Love and Hisses]]''. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios' supervising director [[Leo McCarey]] noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the ''[[Laurel and Hardy]]'' series later that year.\n\nTogether, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'', ''[[Should Married Men Go Home?]]'', ''[[Two Tars]]'', ''[[Be Big!]]'', ''[[Big Business (1929 film)|Big Business]]'', and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short ''[[Unaccustomed As We Are]]'' in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in [[Technicolor]]) musical feature ''[[The Rogue Song]]''. Their first starring feature ''[[Pardon Us]]'' was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler ''[[The Music Box (film)|The Music Box]],'' which won an [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject]].\n\n===Trouble at Roach Studio===\nDuring the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was \"teamed\" with [[Harry Langdon]] for the 1939 film ''[[Zenobia (film)|Zenobia]]''. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with [[Patsy Kelly]] to be called \"The Hardy Family.\" But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that [[Laurel and Hardy]] made after Laurel returned was ''[[A Chump at Oxford]]''. Subsequently, they made ''[[Saps at Sea]]'', which was their last film for Roach.\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:Stan in color.jpg|thumb|upright|Stan Laurel in a still from ''[[The Tree in a Test Tube]]'' (1943), a colour short made for the US Department of Agriculture]]\nIn 1941, [[Laurel and Hardy]] signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century-Fox|20th Century-Fox]] to make ten films over five years. Laurel found, to his shock, that he and Hardy were hired only as actors, and were not expected to contribute to the staging, writing, or editing of the productions. When the films proved very successful, Laurel and Hardy were granted more freedom and gradually added more of their own material. They had made six Fox features when the studio suddenly abandoned [[B-picture]] production in December 1944. The team had signed another contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1942, resulting in two more features.<ref>[[Scott MacGillivray|MacGillivray, Scott]].

The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled ''[[Atoll K]]''. (The film was entitled ''Utopia'' in the US and ''Robinson Crusoeland'' in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering.

Around the same time, he adopted the stage name of Laurel at Dahlberg's suggestion that his stage name Stan Jefferson was unlucky, due to it having thirteen letters.{{#tag:ref|Laurel disputed this and claimed that it just \"sounded good\".<ref>McCabe 1961, p. 18.</ref>|group=N}} The pair were performing together when Laurel was offered $75 a week to star in two-reel comedies. After making his first film ''[[Nuts in May (film)|Nuts in May]]'', [[Universal Studios|Universal]] offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody ''[[Mud and Sand]]''.\n\nBy 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with [[Joe Rock]] for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native [[Australia]], which she accepted.<ref>Bergan 1992, p. 33.</ref> The 12 two-reel comedies were ''[[Mandarin Mix-Up]]'' (1924), ''[[Detained (film)|Detained]]'' (1924), ''[[Monsieur Don't Care]]'' (1924), ''[[West of Hot Dog]]'' (1924), ''[[Somewhere in Wrong]]'' (1925), ''[[Twins (1925 film)|Twins]]'' (1925), ''[[Pie-Eyed]]'' (1925), ''[[The Snow Hawk]]'' (1925), ''[[Navy Blue Days]]'' (1925), ''[[The Sleuth (1925 film)|The Sleuth]]'' (1925), ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1925) and ''[[Half a Man (film)|Half a Man]]'' (1925).\n\n==Laurel and Hardy==\n{{Main|Laurel and Hardy}}\n[[File:Laurel and Hardy in Lucky Dog.jpg|thumb|left|Laurel with Hardy in ''[[The Lucky Dog (1921 film)|The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921), long before they became a team.]]\nLaurel next signed with the [[Hal Roach]] studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]'' (in which [[Oliver Hardy]] had a part under the name \"Babe\" Hardy). It had been his intention to work primarily as a writer and director.\n\nThe same year, Hardy, a member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy ''All Star'' players, was injured in a kitchen mishap and hospitalised. Because he was unable to work on the scheduled film, ''Get 'Em Young'', Laurel was asked to return to acting to fill in. Starting early in 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in several short films, including ''[[Duck Soup (1927 film)|Duck Soup]]'', ''[[Slipping Wives]]'' and ''[[With Love and Hisses]]''. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios' supervising director [[Leo McCarey]] noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the ''[[Laurel and Hardy]]'' series later that year.\n\nTogether, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'', ''[[Should Married Men Go Home?]]'', ''[[Two Tars]]'', ''[[Be Big!]]'', ''[[Big Business (1929 film)|Big Business]]'', and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short ''[[Unaccustomed As We Are]]'' in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in [[Technicolor]]) musical feature ''[[The Rogue Song]]''. Their first starring feature ''[[Pardon Us]]'' was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler ''[[The Music Box (film)|The Music Box]],'' which won an [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject]].\n\n===Trouble at Roach Studio===\nDuring the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was \"teamed\" with [[Harry Langdon]] for the 1939 film ''[[Zenobia (film)|Zenobia]]''. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with [[Patsy Kelly]] to be called \"The Hardy Family.\" But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that [[Laurel and Hardy]] made after Laurel returned was ''[[A Chump at Oxford]]''. Subsequently, they made ''[[Saps at Sea]]'', which was their last film for Roach.\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:Stan in color.jpg|thumb|upright|Stan Laurel in a still from ''[[The Tree in a Test Tube]]'' (1943), a colour short made for the US Department of Agriculture]]\nIn 1941, [[Laurel and Hardy]] signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century-Fox|20th Century-Fox]] to make ten films over five years. Laurel found, to his shock, that he and Hardy were hired only as actors, and were not expected to contribute to the staging, writing, or editing of the productions. When the films proved very successful, Laurel and Hardy were granted more freedom and gradually added more of their own material. They had made six Fox features when the studio suddenly abandoned [[B-picture]] production in December 1944. The team had signed another contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1942, resulting in two more features.<ref>[[Scott MacGillivray|MacGillivray, Scott]].

The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled ''[[Atoll K]]''. (The film was entitled ''Utopia'' in the US and ''Robinson Crusoeland'' in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering. In 1952, Laurel and Hardy toured Europe successfully, and they returned in 1953 for another tour of the continent. During this tour, Laurel fell ill and was unable to perform for several weeks.<ref>Bergen 1992, p. 118.</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, Hardy had a heart attack and cancelled the tour. In 1955, they were planning to do a television series called ''Laurel and Hardy's Fabulous Fables'' based on children's stories. The plans were delayed after Laurel suffered a [[stroke]] on 25 April 1955, from which he recovered.

It was filmed as part of the long-form video ''Rhythm Nation 1814 Film'' at a power plant located in [[Pasadena, California]]. The video is notable for its \"post-apocalyptic\" warehouse setting, the unisex black military-style uniforms in which Jackson and her dancers were outfitted, and its choreography, considered to \"set the template for hundreds of videos to come in the Nineties and aughts.\"\n\nThe video's outfit has received various tributes, being displayed at [[Walt Disney World]] theme park, [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]]'s \"Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power\" exhibit, and the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]]. A wax figure of Jackson wearing the outfit was also included in [[Madame Tussaud]]'s exhibits in [[Hollywood]] and [[New York City]], as well as Tussaud's [[Rock Circus]] exhibit in [[London]]. The song and choreography is also a mainstay at [[talent shows]] worldwide, and has been performed at ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'', and ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]'', with an [[Australia]]n music show also named after the song. Various actors and choreographers, including [[Wade Robson]] and [[Travis Payne]], have cited Jackson and the \"Rhythm Nation\" routine as a primary influence to their careers.\n\nIt won multiple accolades, including [[MTV]]'s [[Video Vanguard Award]] for Jackson's impact on entertainment. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' considered the video \"legendary,\" and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included it in a list of 10 Favorite Dancing Musicians, calling Jackson \"a brilliant dancer\" whom it said had \"arguably had a greater long-term impact on the choreography of contemporary music videos\" even than her own brother [[Michael Jackson]] had had.<ref name=entweekly/> The publication also titled it \"the gold standard for [[dystopia]]n dance pop music videos,\" featuring \"some of the most memorable choreography in pop video history.\"<ref name=bestapocalyptic/> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' considered Janet's choreography to be \"even more enthralling\" than those of her contemporaries.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-15/entertainment/ca-1888_1_janet-jackson/4|title=Janet Jackson Finally Learns to Say 'I'|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Hilburn, Robert|date=2015-04-90|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[black-and-white]], military-inspired \"Rhythm Nation\" video was directed by [[Dominic Sena]] in August 1989. It was the finale in the ''Rhythm Nation 1814 Film,'' following videos for \"[[Miss You Much]]\" and \"The Knowledge\", respectively. Known for its high-octane choreography in an abandoned factory, the video won an award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] and was nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]] at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], where Jackson also received the [[MTV Video Vanguard Award]].<ref>{{citation|title=MTV Video Music Awards nominees|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=20 September 5, 1990|page=5}}</ref><ref name=\"MTVMVA\">{{citation|author=Francesca Chapman|title=Sinead Takes MTV's Top Video Award|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|date=20 September 7, 1990|page=65}}</ref> \"Rhythm Nation\" ranked at thirty-seven on [[VH1]]'s \"Greatest 100 Videos\" and forty-four on [[MTV]]'s \"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\". The video features a young [[Tyrin Turner]]. The success of \"Rhythm Nation\" allowed Sena to direct such subsequent films as ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]],'' ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]],'' and ''[[Season of the Witch (2011 film)|Season of the Witch]].''\n\n==Development==\nThe \"Rhythm Nation\" video was filmed simultaneously with \"[[Miss You Much]]\" and \"The Knowledge,\" which were later combined to form the long-form music video ''Rhythm Nation 1814 Film.'' The video was filmed over a period of twenty days at the Pasadena Power Plant in [[Pasadena, California]], and served as the finale in the series.\n\nSpeaking to MTV, Jackson said, \"I knew who I wanted to direct \u2019Rhythm Nation,\u2019 that was simple: Dominic Sena. After working with him on \u2019[[Let's Wait Awhile]],\u2019 I absolutely fell in love with him. [...] Dominic understood story, and he could put onscreen, from front to back, the whole picture you had in your head.\" Deciphering the video's scenery, Jackson explained, \"the foggy, smoky street and the dark, black-and-white tone, that was all intentional. When you've done a lot of videos, it can be difficult to keep it fresh and new. You have to try something you've never done, in fear of looking like something you've already created.\"<ref name=video>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrBolXPYq40C&pg=RA4-PT179|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|publisher=Tannenbaum, Rob|page=179|date=October 11, 2027|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> The video was shot in black-and-white to locate everybody's skin tone within shades of grey, portraying the ''Rhythm Nation'''s slogan: ''\"We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rif of color-lines.\"''<ref>The Face Magazine, 1990.

Before, they really weren't. They play such an important part in the music business. The next is the live show. But the first they ever see of you is the video.\"<ref>[[British Vogue]], 1990. Page 578</ref> Describing Jackson on the set of the video, journalist [[David Ritz]] said \"Janet Jackson's mood seems retiring, but underneath, like so much else about her, there's more than meets the eye. For hours she obliges the camera during a grueling photography session on a sun-soaked day at the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] Power Plant, a central locale for her black-and-white-dance video, a mysterious and metaphorical work dramatizing the concerns of ''Rhythm Nation.\"'' Jackson's clothes were considered to reflect \"a quiet sadness,\" being \"cooperative to a fault, yet inwardly shy.\"<ref name=essence>Essence Magazine, March 1990. Page 54</ref>\n\nJackson was often questioned for her black attire and uniforms, saying \"A lady came up to me and asked, 'Why do you always wear so much black? Is it because it is slimming?'\"<ref name=ebony/> \"Wearing black shows that for once that you can represent something positive and not negative,\" she emphasized, and offered harsh words for those who equate negativity with the color black, referring to the day the [[stock market]] crashed being known as \"[[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]]\". Jackson responds. Jackson recalled being hurt over the comments of an [[African-American]] critic who considered her black attire \"drab,\" saying \"He's been brainwashed because he can't see what I'm trying to show - and that hurt me so bad. I would hope that everyone will understand that for once black represents something good.\"<ref name=ebony/> \"That's why I decided the color scheme for ''Rhythm Nation'' - the costumes, the cover art, the overall feeling - would be positively, uncompromisingly Black.\"<ref name=essence/> Several label executives reportedly told Jackson the album and video wouldn't have \"crossover\" appeal. With Jackson's persistence, the video became \"the most far-reaching single project the company has ever attempted.\"<ref name=ebony/> In a later interview, Jackson said \"The concept basically was very industrial [[black and white]], not wanting any color brought to it\" - \"no color lines is was it was, so everyone is all somewhat of the same kind of tone.\" \"Dominic Sena directed it, it was a twenty day shoot. A lot of work, long hours.\"<ref>http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/213453/on-the-rhythm-nation-video.jhtml On 'The 'Rhythm Nation' Video'</ref> Sena commented \"She's always out there trying to give people something different and fresh, and exciting to look at. If it's been done before she doesn't want anything to do with it, it's like 'let's start over'. Part of the reason she gravitated toward a new choreographer this time, a young guy who hadn't had that much experience, an amazing street dancer, and they developed a rapport and she said 'nobody's seen this guy's stuff before, I'll work with him. We'll develop these steps and give people something fresh to look at.\"<ref>Making of \"Rhythm Nation\", Rhythm Nation 1814 Film release</ref>\n\n==Choreography==\nThe video's choreography has been considered one of the most recognizable and imitated routines in pop culture.

It was filmed as part of the long-form video ''Rhythm Nation 1814 Film'' at a power plant located in [[Pasadena, California]]. The video is notable for its \"post-apocalyptic\" warehouse setting, the unisex black military-style uniforms in which Jackson and her dancers were outfitted, and its choreography, considered to \"set the template for hundreds of videos to come in the Nineties and aughts.\"\n\nThe video's outfit has received various tributes, being displayed at [[Walt Disney World]] theme park, [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]]'s \"Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power\" exhibit, and the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]]. A wax figure of Jackson wearing the outfit was also included in [[Madame Tussaud]]'s exhibits in [[Hollywood]] and [[New York City]], as well as Tussaud's [[Rock Circus]] exhibit in [[London]]. The song and choreography is also a mainstay at [[talent shows]] worldwide, and has been performed at ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'', and ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]'', with an [[Australia]]n music show also named after the song. Various actors and choreographers, including [[Wade Robson]] and [[Travis Payne]], have cited Jackson and the \"Rhythm Nation\" routine as a primary influence to their careers.\n\nIt won multiple accolades, including [[MTV]]'s [[Video Vanguard Award]] for Jackson's impact on entertainment. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' considered the video \"legendary,\" and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included it in a list of 10 Favorite Dancing Musicians, calling Jackson \"a brilliant dancer\" whom it said had \"arguably had a greater long-term impact on the choreography of contemporary music videos\" even than her own brother [[Michael Jackson]] had had.<ref name=entweekly/> The publication also titled it \"the gold standard for [[dystopia]]n dance pop music videos,\" featuring \"some of the most memorable choreography in pop video history.\"<ref name=bestapocalyptic/> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' considered Janet's choreography to be \"even more enthralling\" than those of her contemporaries.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-15/entertainment/ca-1888_1_janet-jackson/4|title=Janet Jackson Finally Learns to Say 'I'|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Hilburn, Robert|date=2015-04-90|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[black-and-white]], military-inspired \"Rhythm Nation\" video was directed by [[Dominic Sena]] in August 1989. It was the finale in the ''Rhythm Nation 1814 Film,'' following videos for \"[[Miss You Much]]\" and \"The Knowledge\", respectively. Known for its high-octane choreography in an abandoned factory, the video won an award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] and was nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]] at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], where Jackson also received the [[MTV Video Vanguard Award]].<ref>{{citation|title=MTV Video Music Awards nominees|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=20September 5, 1990|page=5}}</ref><ref name=\"MTVMVA\">{{citation|author=Francesca Chapman|title=Sinead Takes MTV's Top Video Award|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|date=20September 7, 1990|page=65}}</ref> \"Rhythm Nation\" ranked at thirty-seven on [[VH1]]'s \"Greatest 100 Videos\" and forty-four on [[MTV]]'s \"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\". The video features a young [[Tyrin Turner]]. The success of \"Rhythm Nation\" allowed Sena to direct such subsequent films as ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]],'' ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]],'' and ''[[Season of the Witch (2011 film)|Season of the Witch]].''\n\n==Development==\nThe \"Rhythm Nation\" video was filmed simultaneously with \"[[Miss You Much]]\" and \"The Knowledge,\" which were later combined to form the long-form music video ''Rhythm Nation 1814 Film.'' The video was filmed over a period of twenty days at the Pasadena Power Plant in [[Pasadena, California]], and served as the finale in the series.\n\nSpeaking to MTV, Jackson said, \"I knew who I wanted to direct \u2019Rhythm Nation,\u2019 that was simple: Dominic Sena. After working with him on \u2019[[Let's Wait Awhile]],\u2019 I absolutely fell in love with him. [...] Dominic understood story, and he could put onscreen, from front to back, the whole picture you had in your head.\" Deciphering the video's scenery, Jackson explained, \"the foggy, smoky street and the dark, black-and-white tone, that was all intentional. When you've done a lot of videos, it can be difficult to keep it fresh and new. You have to try something you've never done, in fear of looking like something you've already created.\"<ref name=video>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrBolXPYq40C&pg=RA4-PT179|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|publisher=Tannenbaum, Rob|page=179|date=October 11, 2027|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> The video was shot in black-and-white to locate everybody's skin tone within shades of grey, portraying the ''Rhythm Nation'''s slogan: ''\"We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rif of color-lines.\"''<ref>The Face Magazine, 1990.

Before, they really weren't. They play such an important part in the music business. The next is the live show. But the first they ever see of you is the video.\"<ref>[[British Vogue]], 1990. Page 578</ref> Describing Jackson on the set of the video, journalist [[David Ritz]] said \"Janet Jackson's mood seems retiring, but underneath, like so much else about her, there's more than meets the eye. For hours she obliges the camera during a grueling photography session on a sun-soaked day at the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] Power Plant, a central locale for her black-and-white-dance video, a mysterious and metaphorical work dramatizing the concerns of ''Rhythm Nation.\"'' Jackson's clothes were considered to reflect \"a quiet sadness,\" being \"cooperative to a fault, yet inwardly shy.\"<ref name=essence>Essence Magazine, March 1990. Page 54</ref>\n\nJackson was often questioned for her black attire and uniforms, saying \"A lady came up to me and asked, 'Why do you always wear so much black? Is it because it is slimming?'\"<ref name=ebony/> \"Wearing black shows that for once that you can represent something positive and not negative,\" she emphasized, and offered harsh words for those who equate negativity with the color black, referring to the day the [[stock market]] crashed being known as \"[[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]]\". Jackson responds. Jackson recalled being hurt over the comments of an [[African-American]] critic who considered her black attire \"drab,\" saying \"He's been brainwashed because he can't see what I'm trying to show - and that hurt me so bad. I would hope that everyone will understand that for once black represents something good.\"<ref name=ebony/> \"That's why I decided the color scheme for ''Rhythm Nation'' - the costumes, the cover art, the overall feeling - would be positively, uncompromisingly Black.\"<ref name=essence/> Several label executives reportedly told Jackson the album and video wouldn't have \"crossover\" appeal. With Jackson's persistence, the video became \"the most far-reaching single project the company has ever attempted.\"<ref name=ebony/> In a later interview, Jackson said \"The concept basically was very industrial [[black and white]], not wanting any color brought to it\" - \"no color lines is was it was, so everyone is all somewhat of the same kind of tone.\" \"Dominic Sena directed it, it was a twenty day shoot. A lot of work, long hours.\"<ref>http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/213453/on-the-rhythm-nation-video.jhtml On 'The 'Rhythm Nation' Video'</ref> Sena commented \"She's always out there trying to give people something different and fresh, and exciting to look at. If it's been done before she doesn't want anything to do with it, it's like 'let's start over'. Part of the reason she gravitated toward a new choreographer this time, a young guy who hadn't had that much experience, an amazing street dancer, and they developed a rapport and she said 'nobody's seen this guy's stuff before, I'll work with him. We'll develop these steps and give people something fresh to look at.\"<ref>Making of \"Rhythm Nation\", Rhythm Nation 1814 Film release</ref>\n\n==Choreography==\nThe video's choreography has been considered one of the most recognizable and imitated routines in pop culture.
