The complex is made up of over 50 buildings. These include a three-winged residential building with an attached chapel, four pavilions separated by a road, some smaller utility buildings, and a garden. It is noted for its fine Roccoco decoration and in particular its entrance staircase, which is regarded as one of the finest examples of its kind in any Baroque palace.\n\nThe palace was built in the first half of the 18th century by [[Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn]], [[Prince-Bishop of Speyer]]. Sch\u00f6nborn drew on family connections to recruit building staff and experts in the Baroque style, most notably [[Balthasar Neumann]]. Although intended to be the permanent residence of the Prince-Bishops, they occupied it for less than a century.\n\nOn 1 March 1945, only two months before the end of the [[Second World War]], much of the palace was destroyed in an American air raid directed against nearby railway installations. It has since been completely rebuilt in a restoration project that lasted until 1996. The interiors have been partly restored and the palace now houses two museums.\n\n==History==\n{{seealso|Prince-Bishopric of Speyer}}\n[[File:Udenheim-Philippsburg 1590 2.jpg|right|thumb|The Udenheim residence and castle at [[Philippsburg]], 1590]]\n\nFor much of its existence, and that of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the city of [[Speyer]] was both an [[Imperial city]] and the seat of a [[Prince-Bishopric of Speyer|Prince-Bishopric]]. The two entities quarreled throughout their own existences, but especially during the [[Reformation]].{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} As in some other German Bishopric seats, this conflict would force the Prince-Bishop to vacate the city.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=517}} The secondary residence of the Prince-Bishops was the fortress of Udenheim,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} purchased by Prince-Bishop {{ill|Emich von Leiningen|de}} in 1316.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: Findbuch 218}} Prince-Bishop [[Philipp Christoph von S\u00f6tern]] renamed that residence to the [[Philippsburg]] and began fortifying it in 1617 following the formation of the [[Protestant Union]].{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} In response, and with permission from the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Frederick V, Elector Palatinate]] and a force from the Palatinate, Speyer, and [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] destroyed Philippsburg in June 1618.{{sfn|Asbach|Schr\u00f6der|2016|p=34}}\n\nDuring the [[Nine Years' War]], French general [[Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac]] attacked and destroyed the Philippsburg and then Speyer,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}{{sfn|Mintzker|2012|pp=51\u201352}}{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=48}} on 1 June 1689,{{sfn|Lynn|2013|p=198}} razing the city and the {{ill|Episcopal Palace (Speyer)|de|Bischofspfalz Speyer|lt=Episcopal Palace}}. Speyer's burghers were entirely unwilling to allow the reconstruction of ecclesiastical property and even violently prevented it in 1716. Prince-Bishop {{ill|Heinrich Hartard von Rollingen|de}} moved his seat to [[Bruchsal]] and rebuilt a family residence located there. Rollingen's [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn]], and then Prince-Bishop with the former's death in 1719, desired to rebuild the Episcopal Palace in Speyer.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Damian Hugo was refused by the city,{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=229}}{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=354}} though by then he was taken by Bruchsal's landscape and decided to build a new palace north of the town's walls. He wrote to his uncle, [[Lothar Franz von Sch\u00f6nborn]], [[Elector of Mainz]], to request the services of his court architect, [[Maximilian von Welsch]]. The request was approved, and Welsch set to work with [[Friedrich Karl von Sch\u00f6nborn]], the Prince-Bishop's brother.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Welsch presented his plans to Damian Hugo in September 1720,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} while he was visiting his uncle's court at {{ill|Schloss Favorite (Mainz)|de|Lustschloss Favorite (Mainz)|lt=Schloss Favorite}} to review the plans. Impressed, the Prince-Bishop approved the start of construction and in 1721 recruited Johann Georg Seitz, a [[Construction foreman|foreman]] working for another Sch\u00f6nborn.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} The palace's [[cornerstone]] was laid on the north side of the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'' in what was to be the Chamber Wing (''Kammerfl\u00fcgel'') in 1722.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=354}}{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Stilgeschichte}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Bruchsal, Schloss, N\u00f6rdliche Orangerie 20170530 004.jpg|thumb|right|The north [[orangery]], built by Johann Rohrer in 1725]]\n\nThe Chamber Wing's foundations were finished by 1723, by which time the stables and roadside pavilions were completed. After two years of work, however, Seitz departed for his original workplace, [[Wiesentheid]]. Damian Hugo fought to keep Seitz until June of that year, when he relented and hired {{ill|Johann Michael Ludwig Rohrer|de}}.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Rohrer was a master mason from [[Rastatt]],{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} employed at the court of [[Duchess Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg|Sibylla Augusta of Baden-Baden]], who was not only in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer]], but also a personal friend.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Damian Hugo von Sch\u00f6nborn}} Over 1724, Rohrer built the complex's [[orangeries]] and the [[Long gallery|gallery]] connecting the ''corps de logis'' to the Church Wing, itself completed in 1725. The Prince-Bishop moved into the Chamber Wing the next year and would remain there until the ''[[beletage]]'' was finished in 1730.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe final plan for the ''corps de logis'' was only drawn up in 1725 by Rohrer and Welsch, with some input by the latter's young student, [[Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn]].{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Over that year, Groenesteyn replaced Rohrer as the primary architect and constructed the ''corps de logis''{{'}}s first floor. Damian Hugo, however, realized that with the existing plan he would not have room for his dressing rooms nor for servants' quarters. In 1726, while Groenesteyn was absent from court,{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Treppenhaus}} the Prince-Bishop had a [[mezzanine floor]] constructed between the designed first and second floors. This addition made Groenesteyn's plan for the staircase impossible and, when he could not devise a new plan, he resigned.{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}}{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Treppenhaus}} He was soon followed by Rohrer, who had fallen ill and out of Damian Hugo's favor in 1727, and [[Antonio Gresta]], charged with painting the Hofkirche's frescoes, who also grew sick in 1727 and died soon thereafter. Construction of the rest of the palace continued according to Rohrer's plans, but under the direction of an architect named Johann Georg Stahl, previously a master carpenter.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nDamian Hugo complained to [[Lothar Franz von Sch\u00f6nborn]] of the situation. In Lothar Franz's employ was an architect named [[Balthasar Neumann]], who had just completed an expansion of [[Schloss Wei\u00dfenstein]]'s gardens.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Damian Hugo hired Neumann as his new master architect in 1728,{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} but he couldn't actually take charge because of the ascension of Friedrich Karl von Sch\u00f6nborn to the [[Prince-Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg]] and his employment at the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]]. Meanwhile, and again acting on a recommendation from Sibylla of Baden-Baden,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Cosmas Damian Asam}} Damian Hugo hired Italian painter [[Cosmas Damian Asam]] in May 1728 to replace Gresta.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Sch\u00f6nborn und der Maler}} In October of that year, Asam requested leave to go home for the winter. In the seven weeks he had been at work, Asam changed Gresta's design on the assumption that those changes had been approved by Damian Hugo. This was in error. The Prince-Bishop, assuming Asam had not managed much in the time he had been at work, has surprised to see the opposite. Though initially angry, the Prince-Bishop forgave Asam as he was impressed with the painter's ability and rewarded his labor with a hunt.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Sch\u00f6nborn und der Maler}} Another painter, {{ill|Judas Thadd\u00e4us Sichelbein|de}}, was not so lucky and was dismissed on 1732.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} When Neumann finally arrived at Bruchsal in March 1731,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} he was tasked first and foremost with designing a new staircase. He accomplished this in 1731\u201332,{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} creating one of the world's most famous staircases.{{sfn|Pevsner|1948|pp=141, 146}} In July 1732, Damian Hugo hired {{ill|Giovanni Francesco Marchini|de}} to paint the exteriors of the other buildings of the palace complex with faux masonry. Marchini also painted the frescoes of the Entrada and the grotto behind it. From 1737 to 1743, Neumann and Stahl built the guardhouse, hunting office, arsenal, and the tower attached to the Hofkirche. The Hofkirche itself was finished in 1739.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe ''corps de logis'' was completed in 1743, but Damian Hugo died that very same year.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} He was succeeded by {{ill|Franz Christoph von Hutten zum Stolzenberg|de|lt=Franz Christoph von Hutten}},{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Franz Christoph von Hutten}} who found the Chamber Wing still unfinished. Neumann and Stahl, now being succeeded by his son Leonhard, continued to work at Bruchsal under Hutten.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Hutten ordered the renovation of much of the ''corps de logis'' in the [[Rococo]] style beginning in 1751 and lasting to 1754.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Schloss und Garten}}{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Beletage}} In 1751, [[Johannes Zick]] was hired by Hutten following a recommendation from Neumann, for whom Zick had worked at W\u00fcrzburg, to paint the dome above Neumann's staircase. Another employee of Neumann's, [[Johann Michael Feuchtmayer]], was hired in 1752 to create the Rococo [[stucco]]work Hutten desired. He and Zick worked together until 1756, for example producing the Marble Hall.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\n[[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]], [[Maria Anna Mozart|Maria Anna]], and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] visited Bruchsal Palace in July 1763 to begin a tour up the [[Rhine]]. Leopold wrote of the palace on 19 July, \"The Residence of Bruchsal is worth seeing, its rooms being in the very best taste, not numerous, but so noble, indescribably charming and precious.\"{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Franz Christoph von Hutten}}{{sfn|Heartz|2009|pp=680\u201381}}\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Georg Maria Eckert - Schloss Bruchsal, Pagenzimmer 1870.jpg|thumb|right|alt=1870 photograph of Bruchsal Palace's interior|An 1870 photograph of the palace interior]]\n\nAs a result of the [[Coalition Wars]], the Prince-Bishopric of Speyer and the neighboring [[Margraviate of Baden]] had been forced to cede their territory on the [[left bank of the Rhine]] to France.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: S\u00e4kularisation}} Per the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], Baden was to be compensated with new territory, and this was effected. Baden was given seven times the amount of land it had lost,{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=579, 621}} at the expense of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] of ecclesiastical states such as the Prince-Bishopric of Speyer.{{sfn|Lefebvre|2010|p=149}} This concession was confirmed in February 1803 by the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'',{{sfn|Brose|2013|p=38}} though Baden was soon raised to a [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Grand Duchy]].{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=622}} Baden's ruler, [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick]], summarily occupied Bruchsal and forced the departure of the last Prince-Bishop, [[Wilderich of Walderdorf|Philipp Franz von Walderdorf]]. Charles Frederick dissolved the \"Principality\" of Speyer and removed much of Bruchsal Palace's furnishings to [[Karlsruhe]], though he awarded Walderdorf a pension of 200,000 [[guilders]] and allowed him to reside at Bruchsal in the winters.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: S\u00e4kularisation}}{{efn|[[Wilderich of Walderdorf|Philipp Franz von Walderdorf]]'s summer residence post-secularization was the {{ill|Wagh\u00e4usel Hermitage|de|Eremitage (Wagh\u00e4usel)}}.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: S\u00e4kularisation}}}}\n\nWhen Charles Frederick died in 1806, Walderdorf shared Bruchsal with the Grand Duke's widow, [[Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt]] with her unmarried daughter, {{ill|Amalie Christiane von Baden|de}}, who had been replaced at court by [[St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: F\u00fcrstliche Langeweile}} Amalie spent three to four months of every summer at the palace,{{sfn|Hirsch|1906|p=2}} time she spent in a constant monotony that she often took vacations to escape.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: F\u00fcrstliche Langeweile}} Amalie's household at Bruchsal and its upkeep was at her own expense.{{sfn|Hirsch|1906|p=3}} The early 19th century traveler Charles Edward Dodd, who visited the palace around 1818, described its \"deserted splendour\" wherein \"the gay ladies of [Princess Amalie's] court complain bitterly of its magnificent dreariness.\"{{sfn|Dodd|1818|pp=163\u201364}} Two other contemporary visitors, [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Elizabeth of Russia]], also noted the droll state of Bruchsal Palace.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: F\u00fcrstliche Langeweile}} Bruchsal's citizenry adored Amalie, though, and mourned her death on 27 July 1832.{{sfn|Hirsch|1906|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nFollowing Amalie von Baden's death, Bruchsal Palace was used for myriad purposes while it steadily deteriorated.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Verlassene Schloss}} In 1849, during the [[Baden Revolution]], the ground floor of the ''corps de logis'' was used for a [[barrack]] and later a [[military hospital]] for Prussian soldiers.{{Sfn|Hirsch|1906|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nIn 1869, two years before the palace vanished from guide books in Germany, the Grand Duchy of Baden's Ministry of the Interior made plans to move a Catholic seminary into the palace. A major renovation was planned to fit the school, but were short lived. A decade later in 1880, the court jeweler of the Landgrave of Hesse wrote to the Badener government on behalf of the Vicomte de Montfort, a Parisian aristocrat. The Vicomte desired to reside at the palace and renovate it, but his request was rejected.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Verlassene Schloss}} Beginning at this time, hundreds of high-quality photographs were made of the palace's interiors.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Zerst\u00f6rung und Wiederaufbau}}\n\nA restoration of the palace grounds was carried out at Bruchsal from 1900 to 1909 under the direction of German art historian Fritz Hirsch.{{Sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] was dissolved on 9 November 1918 and was followed by Grand Duke [[Frederick II, Grand Duke of Baden|Frederick II]]'s abdication on 22 November.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Das Ende der Monarchie}}\n\nThe ''beletage'' was opened to the public as a permanent exhibit of the palace's treasures in the 1920s.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Das Ende der Monarchie}}\n\n===Destruction and restoration===\n[[File:Schloss Bruchsal Corps de Logis 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of Bruchsal Palace in 1945]]\n\nIn the closing days of the [[Second World War]], the [[American Army Air Force]] bombed [[Bruchsal]] to disable its railway facilities. In one raid on 1 March 1945, the [[379th Expeditionary Operations Group]] attacked and destroyed the city's [[marshaling yard]].{{sfn|Banks|2000|p=338}} 80% of the city was destroyed, as was Bruchsal Palace, incinerated to just the staircase and some of the facade. Reconstruction, aided by the pictures taken in the late 19th century, began the next year with some of the minor buildings put back together to provide administrative offices and temporary housing.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Zerst\u00f6rung und Wiederaufbau}} In 1947, work on the residential structure began in the Chamber Wing. The shell of the ''corps de logis'' was rebuilt from 1953 to 1956, though conversely the church wing was demolished in 1959.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe palace was reopened on 28 February 1975,{{sfn|City of Bruchsal: Schloss Bruchsal}} though reconstruction on the facades lasted two more years.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} The reconstitution of the palace's many frescoes continued until 1996.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Zerst\u00f6rung und Wiederaufbau}}\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the [[France\u2013Germany relations#Friendship|Franco-German friendship]], French President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] and German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] met at Bruchsal Palace on 12 November 1987.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Mitterand und Kohl}}\n\nThe 12th DiGA Garden Festival was held here from 25 to 27 May 2018.{{sfn|City of Bruchsal: DiGA - Die Gartenmesse}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Bruchsal, Schloss, Corps de Logis, Kammerfl\u00fcgel, von S\u00fcdosten 20170530 001.jpg|thumb|right|The ''corps de logis'' and the Chamber Wing]]\n\nSometimes called the Damiansburg (''Damian's Castle''), after [[Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn|Damian Hugo von Sch\u00f6nborn]], who built the palace with unconventional methods and purpose. Damian Hugo built the palace with careful financing and a reliance on local industry, which allowed him to maintain a positive annual income despite the cost of construction. Additionally, the palace was built of [[brick]] in response to the French destruction by fire of the {{ill|Episcopal Palace (Speyer)|de|Bischofspfalz Speyer|lt=Episcopal Palace in Speyer}}.{{sfn|Kaufmann|1995|p=319}}\n\nThe exteriors of several of the palace complex's brick buildings are painted to appear to be made of masonry.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Stilgeschichte}} The facades of the two wings off the ''corps de logis'' are defined by ''[[risalit]]e'', made up of a [[balcony]] atop a door, and are discriminated by [[pilasters]] that also form the buildings' corners.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=354}}\n\nDespite Damian Hugo's love of the Viennese Baroque aesthetic and the work of [[Balthasar Neumann]], Bruchsal Palace bears Westphalian and Dutch influence, thanks to [[Johann Conrad Schlaun]].{{sfn|Kaufmann|1995|p=319}} Damian Hugo began with a French-style plan in 1720, but changed his plans after [[Papal conclave, 1721|the next year's Papal Conclave]] and incorporated Italian, Dutch, and English influences in addition.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=229}} The interiors of Bruchsal Palace share many similarities with the W\u00fcrzburg Residence. The stucco ornamentation within, mostly of the Rococo style, is French-influenced.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=356}}\n\nTo save money, Damian Hugo used the same architects as at other Sch\u00f6nborn family projects.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Damian Hugo von Sch\u00f6nborn}} One of these was [[Balthasar Neumann]], author of the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]], the palace of Damian Hugo's brothers. Neumann worked at Bruchsal as chief architect from 1731 until his death in 1753.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Architekt Balthasar Neumann}} The frugal Damian Hugo was succeeded by Hutten, who brought pomp and chic to Bruchsal.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Franz Christoph von Hutten}} He renovated the second floor in the [[Rococo]] style from 1751 to 1754.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Stilgeschichte}}{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Beletage}} When [[Leopold Mozart]] visited in 1763, he described Bruchsal as being of \"the very best taste\".{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Franz Christoph von Hutten}}\n\nDamian Hugo personally knew virtually none of the artisans that worked at Bruchsal Palace and relied on recommendations from family and friends like [[Duchess Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg|Sibylla Augusta of Baden-Baden]], the Margravine of Baden. Johann Rohrer, Cosmas Damian Asam, and [[Egid Quirin Asam]] were among the men recommended to Damian Hugo by the Margravine.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nFrom 1725 to his dismissal in 1727, Rohrer prepared 717 plans for Bruchsal Palace, 63 of which were for the Hofkirche alone.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nNeumann worked at Bruchsal on and off with Johann Georg Stahl from 1731 to his death in 1753.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe chamber music hall, decorated in the [[Louis XVI style]], represents an experiment in early [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Stilgeschichte}}\n\nRenovations in the 1970s revealed the original Baroque frescoes of the \"leaf room\" (''Laubenzimmer''). They are thought to have been painted by Marchini, as they resemble his work from Damian Hugo at [[Schloss Favorite (Rastatt)|Schloss Favorite in Rastatt]] in 1718. The design itself, wooden lattices interlaced with vines and birds, is an Italianate design that originated in the 16th and 17th centuries.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Laubenzimmer}}\n\nThe German art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]] extensively praised the artifice of Bruchsal Palace in his 1889 work ''History of the Baroque and Rococo Styles in Germany''.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=356}}\n\n===Ground floor===\nForming the entrance to the palace is an entrance hall called the Intrada, containing a ceiling [[fresco]] of personifications of the [[seven virtues]] defeating the [[Seven deadly sins|seven sins]] by {{ill|Giovanni Francesco Marchini|de}}, who was responsible for most of the paintings on the ground floor. Above the pillars are windowed galleries into the servant quarters, which were not in the plans of the palace and were forced by [[Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn]] in 1726 and forced a redesign of the staircase.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Erdgeschoss}}\n\nEnclosed by [[Balthasar Neumann]]'s grand staircase is the Grotto, dimly lit in imitation of a cave and decorated by Marchini with murals of plantlife, shells, and river deities beneath a ceiling fresco of a bird-filled sky. Marchini's work in the Grotto, although still reddened by fire, was restored after [[World War II]] but not in the neighboring Garden Hall, which survived the war but suffered water and frost damage. The ceiling fresco remains unrestored in a permanent exhibition of the palace's destruction in 1945.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Erdgeschoss}}\n\n===Staircase===\n[[File:BruchsalSchlossTreppe1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photo of Bruchsal Palace's staircase|The base of the two arms of the palace staircase.]]\n\nEntered from the back of the Intrada and wrapping around the Grotto is the Staircase, built by [[Balthasar Neumann]] from 1731 to 1732.{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} [[Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn]]'s 1725 plan for the palace was ordinary,{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Treppenhaus}} perhaps inspired by the [[Palazzo Carignano]],{{sfn|Templer|1995|p=150}} but Prince-Bishop Damian Hugo added a [[mezzanine]] between the first and second floors to make room for his dressing rooms and quarters for his servant staff. In doing so, the designed staircase was now too short to reach the second floor and Groenesteyn could not amend the issue. In 1731, Balthasar Neumann set to work to fill the gap,{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Treppenhaus}} drawing up a design for a [[spiral staircase]] \u2013 a feature that had not been common in German architecture since the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Kaufmann|1995|pp=387-388}} Neumann also extended the upper landing to connect the ''[[beletage]]''{{'}}s two state rooms and thereby formed an oval that was then wrapped with a pair of staircases.

Zick's fresco documents and glorifies the construction projects of Prince-Bishops Damian Hugo von Sch\u00f6nborn and Franz Christoph von Hutten. Male figures in the fresco represent architecture and construction, while female figures represent painting and sculpture.

The other hall, to the north, is the Marble Hall. It features a massive ceiling fresco painted by Johannes Zick and his son [[Januarius Zick|Januarius]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Fest\u00e4le}} The stucco and fireplace and mirrors of the Prince's Hall are French in nature, resembling the interior of the [[H\u00f4tel de Soubise]], but also Austria's [[St. Florian Monastery]].{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=356}}\n\nThe apartments on the south side of the main building were remodeled by Johann Michael Feuchtmayer for Hutten in the 1760s. Walderdorff lived in them from his abdication as Prince-Bishop in 1802 until his death.{{Sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Beletage}} The southern state apartment opens with an [[antechamber]] containing some surviving examples of original Rococo stucco, furniture by [[Abraham Roentgen]], and some of the oldest tapestries in the palace's collection. Next is the Prince-Bishop's audience chamber, also housing original furnishings removed from the palace in 1939. Among these items is a life-size portrait of Hutten painted by Johann Nikolaus Treu. Past the [[bedroom]] are the Watteau Cabinet, used as a [[wardrobe]] and destroyed during WWII, and the room of the Prince-Bishop's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: S\u00fcdliche Staatsappartement}}\n\nThe private apartments of the last Prince-Bishop are comparatively modest compared to the other ''beletage'' [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilades]]. The most private rooms were marked by [[still life]], [[Landscape painting|landscape]], or [[Genre painting|genre]] overdoor paintings, such as the still life overdoors in the dining hall. On display in the gallery room are a number of paintings and furnishings owned by the Prince-Bishop until their relocation in the 19th century. The last of this suite's rooms is the Blue Room, decorated in 1810 with blue silks for [[Frederica of Baden]]. The room houses two tapestries from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', depicting [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]].{{Sfn|Bruchsal Palace: F\u00fcrstbisch\u00f6fliche Privatr\u00e4ume}}\n\nThe northern state apartment also starts with an antechamber attached to the Marble Hall, adorned with stucco reliefs of hunting and fishing. This room also houses the ''Groteskenfolge'',{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: N\u00f6rdliche Staatsappartement}} a six-part tapestry series made from 1685 to 1717 by the Philippe Behagle manufactury in [[Beauvais]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Tapisserien}} The succeeding room is similarly ornamented, but with musical instruments and an [[overdoor]] painting depicting the tale of [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]. The largest room in the suite is the [[throne room]], decorated with more tapestries. In between the throne room and suite's bedroom is a chapel.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: N\u00f6rdliche Staatsappartement}}\n\nAmalie von Baden had her apartment renovated in 1806 in the [[Empire style]]. Her antechamber contains four tapestries of [[exoticism|exotic]] settings made by the [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson manufactory]]. Adjoining this is Amalie's audience room, containing more paintings from the original palace collection, and French-made furniture. Next is the Yellow Room, a [[living room]] containing more tapestries, made in [[Brussels]] between 1550 and 1575. The last room in Amalie's apartment is her bedroom, which furnished from 1810 to 1815 in high Empire style fashion.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Appartement der Amalie von Baden}}\n\n===Hofkirche===\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Bruchsal, Schlosskirche, Int\u00e9rieur-Dia 247-05275.tif|thumb|right|The Hofkirche in 1930]]\n\nThe Hofkirche is connected to the palace's left wing by a narrow hall. It was designed by Balthasar Neumann in 1740 and painted by [[Cosmas Damian Asam]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Hofkirche}} Asam was appointed in 1728 following the sudden death of the painter previously contracted to create the fresco, [[Antonio Gresta]]. Despite some animosity from Damian Hugo toward him,{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Sch\u00f6nborn und der Maler}} Asam painted the ceiling with images of [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Saints Cosmas, Damian]], and [[Hugh of Ch\u00e2teauneuf|Hugh]] in light pastels, impressing the Prince-Bishop. The Hofkirche was destroyed in World War II and a new church was built in its place from 1960 to 1966, with work by [[Fritz Wotruba]] and [[HAP Grieshaber]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Hofkirche}}\n\nNine bronze statuettes of the [[Twelve Apostles]], made in [[Augsburg]] around 1593, were recovered from the post-1945 wreckage of the Hofkirche and are today on display in the modern chapel.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Hofkirche}}\n\n===North wing===\nThe [[chamber music]] hall, ''Kammermusiksaal'', was designed and decorated by {{ill|Joachim G\u00fcnther (sculptor)|de|Joachim G\u00fcnther (Bildhauer)|lt=Joachim G\u00fcnther}} for [[August Philip of Limburg Stirum]] in 1776. The room was originally two stories high, but a fake roof was put in place during G\u00fcnther's renovation. Its yellow walls are covered in vibrant early [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] stucco of floral friezes and [[garland]]s of wind instruments. The Kammermusiksaal was the significant first room in the palace to be fully restored, being completed in 1955.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Kammermusiksaal}}\n\n==Grounds and gardens==\n[[File:Plan-Schloss-Bruchsal.png|thumb|right|Plan of Bruchsal Palace's grounds.

The original plan, with the exception of the ''corps de logis'' survived into the existing structure. It placed the palace complex on a right-angle to the road leading from Bruchsal's north-east gate, {{convert|1000|ft|m|sp=us}} distant.

'''''Damiansburg''''', is a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] palace complex located in [[Bruchsal]], [[Germany]]. The complex is made up of over 50 buildings. These include a three-winged residential building with an attached chapel, four pavilions separated by a road, some smaller utility buildings, and a garden. It is noted for its fine Roccoco decoration and in particular its entrance staircase, which is regarded as one of the finest examples of its kind in any Baroque palace.\n\nThe palace was built in the first half of the 18th century by [[Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn]], [[Prince-Bishop of Speyer]]. Sch\u00f6nborn drew on family connections to recruit building staff and experts in the Baroque style, most notably [[Balthasar Neumann]]. Although intended to be the permanent residence of the Prince-Bishops, they occupied it for less than a century.\n\nOn 1 March 1945, only two months before the end of the [[Second World War]], much of the palace was destroyed in an American air raid directed against nearby railway installations. It has since been completely rebuilt in a restoration project that lasted until 1996. The interiors have been partly restored and the palace now houses two museums.\n\n==History==\n{{seealso|Prince-Bishopric of Speyer}}\n[[File:Udenheim-Philippsburg 1590 2.jpg|right|thumb|The Udenheim residence and castle at [[Philippsburg]], 1590]]\n\nFor much of its existence, and that of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the city of [[Speyer]] was both an [[Imperial city]] and the seat of a [[Prince-Bishopric of Speyer|Prince-Bishopric]]. The two entities quarreled throughout their own existences, but especially during the [[Reformation]].{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} As in some other German Bishopric seats, this conflict would force the Prince-Bishop to vacate the city.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=517}} The secondary residence of the Prince-Bishops was the fortress of Udenheim,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} purchased by Prince-Bishop {{ill|Emich von Leiningen|de}} in 1316.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: Findbuch 218}} Prince-Bishop [[Philipp Christoph von S\u00f6tern]] renamed that residence to the [[Philippsburg]] and began fortifying it in 1617 following the formation of the [[Protestant Union]].{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} In response, and with permission from the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Frederick V, Elector Palatinate]] and a force from the Palatinate, Speyer, and [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] destroyed Philippsburg in June 1618.{{sfn|Asbach|Schr\u00f6der|2016|p=34}}\n\nDuring the [[Nine Years' War]], French general [[Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac]] attacked and destroyed the Philippsburg and then Speyer,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}{{sfn|Mintzker|2012|pp=51\u201352}}{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=48}} on 1 June 1689,{{sfn|Lynn|2013|p=198}} razing the city and the {{ill|Episcopal Palace (Speyer)|de|Bischofspfalz Speyer|lt=Episcopal Palace}}. Speyer's burghers were entirely unwilling to allow the reconstruction of ecclesiastical property and even violently prevented it in 1716. Prince-Bishop {{ill|Heinrich Hartard von Rollingen|de}} moved his seat to [[Bruchsal]] and rebuilt a family residence located there. Rollingen's [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn]], and then Prince-Bishop with the former's death in 1719, desired to rebuild the Episcopal Palace in Speyer.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Damian Hugo was refused by the city,{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=229}}{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=354}} though by then he was taken by Bruchsal's landscape and decided to build a new palace north of the town's walls. He wrote to his uncle, [[Lothar Franz von Sch\u00f6nborn]], [[Elector of Mainz]], to request the services of his court architect, [[Maximilian von Welsch]]. The request was approved, and Welsch set to work with [[Friedrich Karl von Sch\u00f6nborn]], the Prince-Bishop's brother.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Welsch presented his plans to Damian Hugo in September 1720,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} while he was visiting his uncle's court at {{ill|Schloss Favorite (Mainz)|de|Lustschloss Favorite (Mainz)|lt=Schloss Favorite}} to review the plans. Impressed, the Prince-Bishop approved the start of construction and in 1721 recruited Johann Georg Seitz, a [[Construction foreman|foreman]] working for another Sch\u00f6nborn.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} The palace's [[cornerstone]] was laid on the north side of the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'' in what was to be the Chamber Wing (''Kammerfl\u00fcgel'') in 1722.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=354}}{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Stilgeschichte}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Bruchsal, Schloss, N\u00f6rdliche Orangerie 20170530 004.jpg|thumb|right|The north [[orangery]], built by Johann Rohrer in 1725]]\n\nThe Chamber Wing's foundations were finished by 1723, by which time the stables and roadside pavilions were completed. After two years of work, however, Seitz departed for his original workplace, [[Wiesentheid]]. Damian Hugo fought to keep Seitz until June of that year, when he relented and hired {{ill|Johann Michael Ludwig Rohrer|de}}.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Rohrer was a master mason from [[Rastatt]],{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} employed at the court of [[Duchess Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg|Sibylla Augusta of Baden-Baden]], who was not only in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer]], but also a personal friend.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Damian Hugo von Sch\u00f6nborn}} Over 1724, Rohrer built the complex's [[orangeries]] and the [[Long gallery|gallery]] connecting the ''corps de logis'' to the Church Wing, itself completed in 1725. The Prince-Bishop moved into the Chamber Wing the next year and would remain there until the ''[[beletage]]'' was finished in 1730.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe final plan for the ''corps de logis'' was only drawn up in 1725 by Rohrer and Welsch, with some input by the latter's young student, [[Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn]].{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Over that year, Groenesteyn replaced Rohrer as the primary architect and constructed the ''corps de logis''{{'}}s first floor. Damian Hugo, however, realized that with the existing plan he would not have room for his dressing rooms nor for servants' quarters. In 1726, while Groenesteyn was absent from court,{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Treppenhaus}} the Prince-Bishop had a [[mezzanine floor]] constructed between the designed first and second floors. This addition made Groenesteyn's plan for the staircase impossible and, when he could not devise a new plan, he resigned.{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}}{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Treppenhaus}} He was soon followed by Rohrer, who had fallen ill and out of Damian Hugo's favor in 1727, and [[Antonio Gresta]], charged with painting the Hofkirche's frescoes, who also grew sick in 1727 and died soon thereafter. Construction of the rest of the palace continued according to Rohrer's plans, but under the direction of an architect named Johann Georg Stahl, previously a master carpenter.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nDamian Hugo complained to [[Lothar Franz von Sch\u00f6nborn]] of the situation. In Lothar Franz's employ was an architect named [[Balthasar Neumann]], who had just completed an expansion of [[Schloss Wei\u00dfenstein]]'s gardens.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Damian Hugo hired Neumann as his new master architect in 1728,{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} but he couldn't actually take charge because of the ascension of Friedrich Karl von Sch\u00f6nborn to the [[Prince-Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg]] and his employment at the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]]. Meanwhile, and again acting on a recommendation from Sibylla of Baden-Baden,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Cosmas Damian Asam}} Damian Hugo hired Italian painter [[Cosmas Damian Asam]] in May 1728 to replace Gresta.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Sch\u00f6nborn und der Maler}} In October of that year, Asam requested leave to go home for the winter. In the seven weeks he had been at work, Asam changed Gresta's design on the assumption that those changes had been approved by Damian Hugo. This was in error. The Prince-Bishop, assuming Asam had not managed much in the time he had been at work, has surprised to see the opposite. Though initially angry, the Prince-Bishop forgave Asam as he was impressed with the painter's ability and rewarded his labor with a hunt.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Sch\u00f6nborn und der Maler}} Another painter, {{ill|Judas Thadd\u00e4us Sichelbein|de}}, was not so lucky and was dismissed on 1732.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} When Neumann finally arrived at Bruchsal in March 1731,{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} he was tasked first and foremost with designing a new staircase. He accomplished this in 1731\u201332,{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} creating one of the world's most famous staircases.{{sfn|Pevsner|1948|pp=141, 146}} In July 1732, Damian Hugo hired {{ill|Giovanni Francesco Marchini|de}} to paint the exteriors of the other buildings of the palace complex with faux masonry. Marchini also painted the frescoes of the Entrada and the grotto behind it. From 1737 to 1743, Neumann and Stahl built the guardhouse, hunting office, arsenal, and the tower attached to the Hofkirche. The Hofkirche itself was finished in 1739.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe ''corps de logis'' was completed in 1743, but Damian Hugo died that very same year.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} He was succeeded by {{ill|Franz Christoph von Hutten zum Stolzenberg|de|lt=Franz Christoph von Hutten}},{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Franz Christoph von Hutten}} who found the Chamber Wing still unfinished. Neumann and Stahl, now being succeeded by his son Leonhard, continued to work at Bruchsal under Hutten.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} Hutten ordered the renovation of much of the ''corps de logis'' in the [[Rococo]] style beginning in 1751 and lasting to 1754.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Schloss und Garten}}{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Beletage}} In 1751, [[Johannes Zick]] was hired by Hutten following a recommendation from Neumann, for whom Zick had worked at W\u00fcrzburg, to paint the dome above Neumann's staircase. Another employee of Neumann's, [[Johann Michael Feuchtmayer]], was hired in 1752 to create the Rococo [[stucco]]work Hutten desired. He and Zick worked together until 1756, for example producing the Marble Hall.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\n[[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]], [[Maria Anna Mozart|Maria Anna]], and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] visited Bruchsal Palace in July 1763 to begin a tour up the [[Rhine]]. Leopold wrote of the palace on 19 July, \"The Residence of Bruchsal is worth seeing, its rooms being in the very best taste, not numerous, but so noble, indescribably charming and precious.\"{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Franz Christoph von Hutten}}{{sfn|Heartz|2009|pp=680\u201381}}\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Georg Maria Eckert - Schloss Bruchsal, Pagenzimmer 1870.jpg|thumb|right|alt=1870 photograph of Bruchsal Palace's interior|An 1870 photograph of the palace interior]]\n\nAs a result of the [[Coalition Wars]], the Prince-Bishopric of Speyer and the neighboring [[Margraviate of Baden]] had been forced to cede their territory on the [[left bank of the Rhine]] to France.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: S\u00e4kularisation}} Per the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], Baden was to be compensated with new territory, and this was effected. Baden was given seven times the amount of land it had lost,{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=579, 621}} at the expense of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] of ecclesiastical states such as the Prince-Bishopric of Speyer.{{sfn|Lefebvre|2010|p=149}} This concession was confirmed in February 1803 by the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'',{{sfn|Brose|2013|p=38}} though Baden was soon raised to a [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Grand Duchy]].{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=622}} Baden's ruler, [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick]], summarily occupied Bruchsal and forced the departure of the last Prince-Bishop, [[Wilderich of Walderdorf|Philipp Franz von Walderdorf]]. Charles Frederick dissolved the \"Principality\" of Speyer and removed much of Bruchsal Palace's furnishings to [[Karlsruhe]], though he awarded Walderdorf a pension of 200,000 [[guilders]] and allowed him to reside at Bruchsal in the winters.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: S\u00e4kularisation}}{{efn|[[Wilderich of Walderdorf|Philipp Franz von Walderdorf]]'s summer residence post-secularization was the {{ill|Wagh\u00e4usel Hermitage|de|Eremitage (Wagh\u00e4usel)}}.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: S\u00e4kularisation}}}}\n\nWhen Charles Frederick died in 1806, Walderdorf shared Bruchsal with the Grand Duke's widow, [[Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt]] with her unmarried daughter, {{ill|Amalie Christiane von Baden|de}}, who had been replaced at court by [[St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: F\u00fcrstliche Langeweile}} Amalie spent three to four months of every summer at the palace,{{sfn|Hirsch|1906|p=2}} time she spent in a constant monotony that she often took vacations to escape.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: F\u00fcrstliche Langeweile}} Amalie's household at Bruchsal and its upkeep was at her own expense.{{sfn|Hirsch|1906|p=3}} The early 19th century traveler Charles Edward Dodd, who visited the palace around 1818, described its \"deserted splendour\" wherein \"the gay ladies of [Princess Amalie's] court complain bitterly of its magnificent dreariness.\"{{sfn|Dodd|1818|pp=163\u201364}} Two other contemporary visitors, [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Elizabeth of Russia]], also noted the droll state of Bruchsal Palace.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: F\u00fcrstliche Langeweile}} Bruchsal's citizenry adored Amalie, though, and mourned her death on 27 July 1832.{{sfn|Hirsch|1906|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nFollowing Amalie von Baden's death, Bruchsal Palace was used for myriad purposes while it steadily deteriorated.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Verlassene Schloss}} In 1849, during the [[Baden Revolution]], the ground floor of the ''corps de logis'' was used for a [[barrack]] and later a [[military hospital]] for Prussian soldiers.{{Sfn|Hirsch|1906|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nIn 1869, two years before the palace vanished from guide books in Germany, the Grand Duchy of Baden's Ministry of the Interior made plans to move a Catholic seminary into the palace. A major renovation was planned to fit the school, but were short lived. A decade later in 1880, the court jeweler of the Landgrave of Hesse wrote to the Badener government on behalf of the Vicomte de Montfort, a Parisian aristocrat. The Vicomte desired to reside at the palace and renovate it, but his request was rejected.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Verlassene Schloss}} Beginning at this time, hundreds of high-quality photographs were made of the palace's interiors.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Zerst\u00f6rung und Wiederaufbau}}\n\nA restoration of the palace grounds was carried out at Bruchsal from 1900 to 1909 under the direction of German art historian Fritz Hirsch.{{Sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] was dissolved on 9 November 1918 and was followed by Grand Duke [[Frederick II, Grand Duke of Baden|Frederick II]]'s abdication on 22 November.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Das Ende der Monarchie}}\n\nThe ''beletage'' was opened to the public as a permanent exhibit of the palace's treasures in the 1920s.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Das Ende der Monarchie}}\n\n===Destruction and restoration===\n[[File:Schloss Bruchsal Corps de Logis 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of Bruchsal Palace in 1945]]\n\nIn the closing days of the [[Second World War]], the [[American Army Air Force]] bombed [[Bruchsal]] to disable its railway facilities. In one raid on 1 March 1945, the [[379th Expeditionary Operations Group]] attacked and destroyed the city's [[marshaling yard]].{{sfn|Banks|2000|p=338}} 80% of the city was destroyed, as was Bruchsal Palace, incinerated to just the staircase and some of the facade. Reconstruction, aided by the pictures taken in the late 19th century, began the next year with some of the minor buildings put back together to provide administrative offices and temporary housing.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Zerst\u00f6rung und Wiederaufbau}} In 1947, work on the residential structure began in the Chamber Wing. The shell of the ''corps de logis'' was rebuilt from 1953 to 1956, though conversely the church wing was demolished in 1959.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe palace was reopened on 28 February 1975,{{sfn|City of Bruchsal: Schloss Bruchsal}} though reconstruction on the facades lasted two more years.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}} The reconstitution of the palace's many frescoes continued until 1996.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Zerst\u00f6rung und Wiederaufbau}}\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the [[France\u2013Germany relations#Friendship|Franco-German friendship]], French President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] and German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] met at Bruchsal Palace on 12 November 1987.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Mitterand und Kohl}}\n\nThe 12th DiGA Garden Festival was held here from 25 to 27 May 2018.{{sfn|City of Bruchsal: DiGA - Die Gartenmesse}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Bruchsal, Schloss, Corps de Logis, Kammerfl\u00fcgel, von S\u00fcdosten 20170530 001.jpg|thumb|right|The ''corps de logis'' and the Chamber Wing]]\n\nSometimes called the Damiansburg (''Damian's Castle''), after [[Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn|Damian Hugo von Sch\u00f6nborn]], who built the palace with unconventional methods and purpose. Damian Hugo built the palace with careful financing and a reliance on local industry, which allowed him to maintain a positive annual income despite the cost of construction. Additionally, the palace was built of [[brick]] in response to the French destruction by fire of the {{ill|Episcopal Palace (Speyer)|de|Bischofspfalz Speyer|lt=Episcopal Palace in Speyer}}.{{sfn|Kaufmann|1995|p=319}}\n\nThe exteriors of several of the palace complex's brick buildings are painted to appear to be made of masonry.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Stilgeschichte}} The facades of the two wings off the ''corps de logis'' are defined by ''[[risalit]]e'', made up of a [[balcony]] atop a door, and are discriminated by [[pilasters]] that also form the buildings' corners.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=354}}\n\nDespite Damian Hugo's love of the Viennese Baroque aesthetic and the work of [[Balthasar Neumann]], Bruchsal Palace bears Westphalian and Dutch influence, thanks to [[Johann Conrad Schlaun]].{{sfn|Kaufmann|1995|p=319}} Damian Hugo began with a French-style plan in 1720, but changed his plans after [[Papal conclave, 1721|the next year's Papal Conclave]] and incorporated Italian, Dutch, and English influences in addition.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=229}} The interiors of Bruchsal Palace share many similarities with the W\u00fcrzburg Residence. The stucco ornamentation within, mostly of the Rococo style, is French-influenced.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=356}}\n\nTo save money, Damian Hugo used the same architects as at other Sch\u00f6nborn family projects.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Damian Hugo von Sch\u00f6nborn}} One of these was [[Balthasar Neumann]], author of the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]], the palace of Damian Hugo's brothers. Neumann worked at Bruchsal as chief architect from 1731 until his death in 1753.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Architekt Balthasar Neumann}} The frugal Damian Hugo was succeeded by Hutten, who brought pomp and chic to Bruchsal.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Franz Christoph von Hutten}} He renovated the second floor in the [[Rococo]] style from 1751 to 1754.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Stilgeschichte}}{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Beletage}} When [[Leopold Mozart]] visited in 1763, he described Bruchsal as being of \"the very best taste\".{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Franz Christoph von Hutten}}\n\nDamian Hugo personally knew virtually none of the artisans that worked at Bruchsal Palace and relied on recommendations from family and friends like [[Duchess Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg|Sibylla Augusta of Baden-Baden]], the Margravine of Baden. Johann Rohrer, Cosmas Damian Asam, and [[Egid Quirin Asam]] were among the men recommended to Damian Hugo by the Margravine.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nFrom 1725 to his dismissal in 1727, Rohrer prepared 717 plans for Bruchsal Palace, 63 of which were for the Hofkirche alone.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nNeumann worked at Bruchsal on and off with Johann Georg Stahl from 1731 to his death in 1753.{{sfn|S\u00fcddeutscher Barock: Bruchsal}}\n\nThe chamber music hall, decorated in the [[Louis XVI style]], represents an experiment in early [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Stilgeschichte}}\n\nRenovations in the 1970s revealed the original Baroque frescoes of the \"leaf room\" (''Laubenzimmer''). They are thought to have been painted by Marchini, as they resemble his work from Damian Hugo at [[Schloss Favorite (Rastatt)|Schloss Favorite in Rastatt]] in 1718. The design itself, wooden lattices interlaced with vines and birds, is an Italianate design that originated in the 16th and 17th centuries.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Laubenzimmer}}\n\nThe German art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]] extensively praised the artifice of Bruchsal Palace in his 1889 work ''History of the Baroque and Rococo Styles in Germany''.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=356}}\n\n===Ground floor===\nForming the entrance to the palace is an entrance hall called the Intrada, containing a ceiling [[fresco]] of personifications of the [[seven virtues]] defeating the [[Seven deadly sins|seven sins]] by {{ill|Giovanni Francesco Marchini|de}}, who was responsible for most of the paintings on the ground floor. Above the pillars are windowed galleries into the servant quarters, which were not in the plans of the palace and were forced by [[Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn]] in 1726 and forced a redesign of the staircase.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Erdgeschoss}}\n\nEnclosed by [[Balthasar Neumann]]'s grand staircase is the Grotto, dimly lit in imitation of a cave and decorated by Marchini with murals of plantlife, shells, and river deities beneath a ceiling fresco of a bird-filled sky. Marchini's work in the Grotto, although still reddened by fire, was restored after [[World War II]] but not in the neighboring Garden Hall, which survived the war but suffered water and frost damage. The ceiling fresco remains unrestored in a permanent exhibition of the palace's destruction in 1945.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Erdgeschoss}}\n\n===Staircase===\n[[File:BruchsalSchlossTreppe1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photo of Bruchsal Palace's staircase|The base of the two arms of the palace staircase.]]\n\nEntered from the back of the Intrada and wrapping around the Grotto is the Staircase, built by [[Balthasar Neumann]] from 1731 to 1732.{{sfn|Hempel|1965|p=158}} [[Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn]]'s 1725 plan for the palace was ordinary,{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Treppenhaus}} perhaps inspired by the [[Palazzo Carignano]],{{sfn|Templer|1995|p=150}} but Prince-Bishop Damian Hugo added a [[mezzanine]] between the first and second floors to make room for his dressing rooms and quarters for his servant staff. In doing so, the designed staircase was now too short to reach the second floor and Groenesteyn could not amend the issue. In 1731, Balthasar Neumann set to work to fill the gap,{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Treppenhaus}} drawing up a design for a [[spiral staircase]] \u2013 a feature that had not been common in German architecture since the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Kaufmann|1995|pp=387-388}} Neumann also extended the upper landing to connect the ''[[beletage]]''{{'}}s two state rooms and thereby formed an oval that was then wrapped with a pair of staircases. This staircase has, since its construction, been the object of much praise.{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=354}}{{sfn|Hempel|1965|pp=158\u201359}}{{sfn|Templer|1995|pp=127, 150}}{{sfn|Eberle|2008|p=3}} Noted historian of art and architecture [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] held Bruchsal Palace, and especially its staircase, in high regard.

Zick's fresco documents and glorifies the construction projects of Prince-Bishops Damian Hugo von Sch\u00f6nborn and Franz Christoph von Hutten. Male figures in the fresco represent architecture and construction, while female figures represent painting and sculpture. To the left of von Hutten are thought to be the two foremen of the palace's construction, Johann Georg Stahl and his son, Johann Leonhard.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Deckenfresko}}\n\nThe entrance to the second floor is a large chamber and dome at the top of the stairs{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=354}} decorated by artists who had previously worked at the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]]. Woodcarver {{ill|Ferdinand Hundt|de}} created the paneling, [[Johann Michael Feuchtmayer]] produced the stucco, and [[Johannes Zick]] painted the [[fresco]]es. Zick's ceiling fresco depicts the history of the [[Bishopric of Speyer|Bishops of Speyer]], beginning with Jesse in the 4th century and ending with Damian Hugo and Hutten, who are portrayed as patrons of the arts and architecture.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Fest\u00e4le}}\n\nThe Prince's Hall ({{lang-de|F\u00fcrstensaal}}) is one of two [[ballroom]]s on the ''[[beletage]]''; it is the southern of the two. The hall also functions as an [[ahnentafel]], bearing portraits of the Prince-Bishops from {{ill|Eberhard von Dienheim|de}} to [[Wilderich of Walderdorf]], the final Prince-Bishop. The other hall, to the north, is the Marble Hall. It features a massive ceiling fresco painted by Johannes Zick and his son [[Januarius Zick|Januarius]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Fest\u00e4le}} The stucco and fireplace and mirrors of the Prince's Hall are French in nature, resembling the interior of the [[H\u00f4tel de Soubise]], but also Austria's [[St. Florian Monastery]].{{sfn|Gurlitt|1889|p=356}}\n\nThe apartments on the south side of the main building were remodeled by Johann Michael Feuchtmayer for Hutten in the 1760s. Walderdorff lived in them from his abdication as Prince-Bishop in 1802 until his death.{{Sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Beletage}} The southern state apartment opens with an [[antechamber]] containing some surviving examples of original Rococo stucco, furniture by [[Abraham Roentgen]], and some of the oldest tapestries in the palace's collection. Next is the Prince-Bishop's audience chamber, also housing original furnishings removed from the palace in 1939. Among these items is a life-size portrait of Hutten painted by Johann Nikolaus Treu. Past the [[bedroom]] are the Watteau Cabinet, used as a [[wardrobe]] and destroyed during WWII, and the room of the Prince-Bishop's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: S\u00fcdliche Staatsappartement}}\n\nThe private apartments of the last Prince-Bishop are comparatively modest compared to the other ''beletage'' [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilades]]. The most private rooms were marked by [[still life]], [[Landscape painting|landscape]], or [[Genre painting|genre]] overdoor paintings, such as the still life overdoors in the dining hall. On display in the gallery room are a number of paintings and furnishings owned by the Prince-Bishop until their relocation in the 19th century. The last of this suite's rooms is the Blue Room, decorated in 1810 with blue silks for [[Frederica of Baden]]. The room houses two tapestries from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', depicting [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]].{{Sfn|Bruchsal Palace: F\u00fcrstbisch\u00f6fliche Privatr\u00e4ume}}\n\nThe northern state apartment also starts with an antechamber attached to the Marble Hall, adorned with stucco reliefs of hunting and fishing. This room also houses the ''Groteskenfolge'',{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: N\u00f6rdliche Staatsappartement}} a six-part tapestry series made from 1685 to 1717 by the Philippe Behagle manufactury in [[Beauvais]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Tapisserien}} The succeeding room is similarly ornamented, but with musical instruments and an [[overdoor]] painting depicting the tale of [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]. The largest room in the suite is the [[throne room]], decorated with more tapestries. In between the throne room and suite's bedroom is a chapel.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: N\u00f6rdliche Staatsappartement}}\n\nAmalie von Baden had her apartment renovated in 1806 in the [[Empire style]]. Her antechamber contains four tapestries of [[exoticism|exotic]] settings made by the [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson manufactory]]. Adjoining this is Amalie's audience room, containing more paintings from the original palace collection, and French-made furniture. Next is the Yellow Room, a [[living room]] containing more tapestries, made in [[Brussels]] between 1550 and 1575. The last room in Amalie's apartment is her bedroom, which furnished from 1810 to 1815 in high Empire style fashion.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Appartement der Amalie von Baden}}\n\n===Hofkirche===\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Bruchsal, Schlosskirche, Int\u00e9rieur-Dia 247-05275.tif|thumb|right|The Hofkirche in 1930]]\n\nThe Hofkirche is connected to the palace's left wing by a narrow hall. It was designed by Balthasar Neumann in 1740 and painted painted by [[Cosmas Damian Asam]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Hofkirche}} Asam was appointed in 1728 following the sudden death of the painter previously contracted to create the fresco, [[Antonio Gresta]]. Despite some animosity from Damian Hugo toward him,{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Sch\u00f6nborn und der Maler}} Asam painted the ceiling with images of [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Saints Cosmas, Damian]], and [[Hugh of Ch\u00e2teauneuf|Hugh]] in light pastels, impressing the Prince-Bishop. The Hofkirche was destroyed in World War II and a new church was built in its place from 1960 to 1966, with work by [[Fritz Wotruba]] and [[HAP Grieshaber]].{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Hofkirche}}\n\nNine bronze statuettes of the [[Twelve Apostles]], made in [[Augsburg]] around 1593, were recovered from the post-1945 wreckage of the Hofkirche and are today on display in the modern chapel.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Hofkirche}}\n\n===North wing===\nThe [[chamber music]] hall, ''Kammermusiksaal'', was designed and decorated by {{ill|Joachim G\u00fcnther (sculptor)|de|Joachim G\u00fcnther (Bildhauer)|lt=Joachim G\u00fcnther}} for [[August Philip of Limburg Stirum]] in 1776. The room was originally two stories high, but a fake roof was put in place during G\u00fcnther's renovation. Its yellow walls are covered in vibrant early [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] stucco of floral friezes and [[garland]]s of wind instruments. The Kammermusiksaal was the significant first room in the palace to be fully restored, being completed in 1955.{{sfn|Bruchsal Palace: Kammermusiksaal}}\n\n==Grounds and gardens==\n[[File:Plan-Schloss-Bruchsal.png|thumb|right|Plan of Bruchsal Palace's grounds.

The original plan, with the exception of the ''corps de logis'' survived into the existing structure. It placed the palace complex on a right-angle to the road leading from Bruchsal's north-east gate, {{convert|1000|ft|m|sp=us}} distant.

It hosted a major [[Singapore Naval Base|naval base]] and port facilities since the early 20th century, and continues to handle regular shipping traffic today along its wharves.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest reference to Sembawang is found in [[Jackson Plan|Franklin and Jackson's 1830 ''Map of Singapore'']], which refers to the River Tambuwang. The place is said to have got its name from the ''pokok sembawang'' ([[Malay language|Malay]] for the [[Kayea ferruginea|''kayae ferruginea'']]''),'' which has been renamed ''[[Mesua ferruginea]]'' from 1980.

During the [[History of Singapore#Singapore as a Crown colony .281867 .E2.80.93 1941.29|colonial times]], Sembawang was home to a major British naval base, its construction of which began in 1928 and was completed in 1938.<ref name=\"bartleby.com\">[http://www.bartleby.com/65/si/Singapor.html Singapore.

The Naval Base has since been handed over to the [[Government of Singapore|Singapore government]], which in 1968 converted it into a commercial dockyard (as Sembawang Shipyard, now part of [[Singapore Exchange]]-[[Companies listed on the Singapore Exchange#S|listed]] [[SembCorp Marine]]) that went on to become SembCorp, a major state-owned industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]].\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Singapore strategy|Singapore Naval Base|Sembawang Air Base}}\n{{See also|Battle of Singapore|Japanese occupation of Singapore|Bombing of Singapore (8 December 1941)|Bombing of Singapore (1944\u20131945)}}\n[[File:Singapore Naval Base June 1953.jpg|thumb|A flight of [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[Avro Lincoln]] bombers overflying Singapore Naval Base, June 1953.]]\n{{externalimage\n|topic=Sembawang Naval Pier\n|width=\n|align=right\n|image1=[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/images/singapore-basina.jpg Sembawang Naval Pier, circa 1990s]\n}}\n\nThe completion of [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Singapore Naval Base]] (also known as HMS Sembawang) in 1938 and [[Sembawang Air Base|RAF Sembawang (also known as HMS Simbang)]] in March 1940 marked the start of military presence in Sembawang. In February 1942, both bases were partially torched and wrecked by the retreating British forces during the [[Battle of Singapore]] to deny their use by units of the advancing [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. After the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, both bases were reverted to British control and would eventually go on to play an important part in Britain's continued military presence in the Far East (along with the three other RAF bases in Singapore: [[Changi Air Base|RAF Changi]], [[Seletar Airport|RAF Seletar]] and [[Tengah Air Base|RAF Tengah]]) during the critical period of [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948\u20131960), the [[Brunei Revolt]] in 1962 and during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] (1962\u20131966).\n\nDespite the [[East of Suez|withdrawal of British forces from Singapore in 1971]] and the handover of the Singapore Naval Base to the Singapore Government in 1968, the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence (MoD)]] continues to maintain a small logistics base at Sembawang wharf to control most of the foreign military activities there, which includes repair, refuel and resupply for ships of the Australian, British and New Zealand navies as well as those from other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] under the auspices of [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] (FPDA).<ref name=\"DFG\">[https://theparc-canberraec.com/]</ref> This special arrangement was also extended to the United States Navy since early 1960s to support the American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"DFG\"/>{{dead link|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs part of a 1990 agreement between Singapore and the United States, [[United States armed forces|American military forces]] (primarily [[United States Navy|naval]] and [[United States Air Force|air force]]) have been making use of Sembawang's base facilities. The [[Task Force 73]] (and Commander Logistic Group Western Pacific), part of [[US 7th Fleet]], has been headquartered in Sembawang since 1992.<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/singapore.htm Global Security article on the US military in Singapore]</ref>\n\n====Sembawang Camp====\nThe Sembawang Camp is a [[Singapore Armed Forces]] military base on Admiralty Road, open only to military personnel on official business. The camp houses the 1st and 3rd Transport Battalion of the [[Singapore Army]], as well as the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]'s [[Naval Diving Unit (Singapore)|Naval Diving Unit (NDU)]]. Also, the compound housing the Naval Diving Unit was previously known as Terror Camp in deference to the old admin and Officers club section of the Royal Naval facility which was called HMS Terror.\n\n===Land reclamation===\nExtensive [[land reclamation]] throughout Singapore has left Sembawang with one of the country's last natural beaches,<ref name=\"singapore-window.org\">[http://www.singapore-window.org/sw05/050414re.htm Singapore finds it hard to expand without sand]</ref><ref name=\"Ruminations: A trip to Sembawang\">[http://www.jeremybwilliams.net/ruminations/archives/000191.html Ruminations: A trip to Sembawang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218082417/http://www.jeremybwilliams.net/ruminations/archives/000191.html |date=18 February 2009 }}</ref> the Wak Hassan Beach located at [[Sembawang Park]]. Today, the vegetable farms, rubber [[plantation]]s and Chinese graveyards surrounding the former naval base have given way to modern housing, especially in the 1990s during the development of a [[New town|New Town]] by the Singapore [[Housing and Development Board]]. The town remains a major port, with Sembawang [[Wharve]]s handling a high volume of bulk [[commodities]] cargo, such as timber and rubber.<ref name=\"Singapore \u2013 Sea\">[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-11865.html Singapore \u2013 Sea]</ref>\n\n===Roads and waterways===\n\nSembawang Road is one of the key roads built to connect the naval base to the city centre in the South. This road began as a track in the 1920s and was officially named Sembawang Road in 1938. Buses operated by various private companies were then the main mode of transport. The thoroughfare was also dotted with many villages along its length: Chye Kay Village, Sungei Simpang Village, Chong Pang Village, Sembawang Village. Most of these villages were cleared during the 1970s{{ndash}}1990s to make way for [[Yishun]] and Sembawang New Towns. The last of the villages, [[kampung|Kampong]] Wak Hassan, was cleared in 1998. Present day Sembawang Road is a major arterial road linking the Northern and Central portion of Singapore.\n\nMany other roads in Sembawang are named after various [[Royal Navy]] dockyards, [[warship]]s, [[admiral]]s, countries and cities. Examples include [[Wellington]], [[Canberra]], Canada, [[Gibraltar]], [[Kenya]] and [[Falkland Islands|Falkland]]. These names were given during the previous British administration, and reflect the town's history as a British [[naval base]].\n\nThe main river running through Sembawang, the {{convert|4|km|adj=on}} long Sungei Sembawang, flowed along a winding route and ended to the west of Sembawang Shipyard. Its middle section was diverted in the 1920s to provide the land needed for the British Naval Base. During the 1970s, the Northern portions of the river was straightened and [[River engineering#Canalization of rivers|canalized]]. The Southern portions of the river, which consisted of [[mangrove]]s, ponds and grassland, was filled in during the 1990s in preparation for the development of Sembawang New Town.\n\n==Modern history==\nThe planning of Sembawang New Town started in 1996 where the Woodlands MRT Extension was opened, and [[Sembawang MRT station]] was also opened at the same time. When the station was opened, the area was undeveloped except the Canberra Road and the then-developing Sembawang New Town.

In February 1942, both bases were partially torched and wrecked by the retreating British forces during the [[Battle of Singapore]] to deny their use by units of the advancing [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. After the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, both bases were reverted to British control and would eventually go on to play an important part in Britain's continued military presence in the Far East (along with the three other RAF bases in Singapore: [[Changi Air Base|RAF Changi]], [[Seletar Airport|RAF Seletar]] and [[Tengah Air Base|RAF Tengah]]) during the critical period of [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948\u20131960), the [[Brunei Revolt]] in 1962 and during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] (1962\u20131966).\n\nDespite the [[East of Suez|withdrawal of British forces from Singapore in 1971]] and the handover of the Singapore Naval Base to the Singapore Government in 1968, the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence (MoD)]] continues to maintain a small logistics base at Sembawang wharf to control most of the foreign military activities there, which includes repair, refuel and resupply for ships of the Australian, British and New Zealand navies as well as those from other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] under the auspices of [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] (FPDA).<ref name=\"DFG\">[https://theparc-canberraec.com/]</ref> This special arrangement was also extended to the United States Navy since early 1960s to support the American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"DFG\"/>{{dead link|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs part of a 1990 agreement between Singapore and the United States, [[United States armed forces|American military forces]] (primarily [[United States Navy|naval]] and [[United States Air Force|air force]]) have been making use of Sembawang's base facilities.

This road began as a track in the 1920s and was officially named Sembawang Road in 1938. Buses operated by various private companies were then the main mode of transport. The thoroughfare was also dotted with many villages along its length: Chye Kay Village, Sungei Simpang Village, Chong Pang Village, Sembawang Village. Most of these villages were cleared during the 1970s{{ndash}}1990s to make way for [[Yishun]] and Sembawang New Towns. The last of the villages, [[kampung|Kampong]] Wak Hassan, was cleared in 1998. Present day Sembawang Road is a major arterial road linking the Northern and Central portion of Singapore.\n\nMany other roads in Sembawang are named after various [[Royal Navy]] dockyards, [[warship]]s, [[admiral]]s, countries and cities. Examples include [[Wellington]], [[Canberra]], Canada, [[Gibraltar]], [[Kenya]] and [[Falkland Islands|Falkland]]. These names were given during the previous British administration, and reflect the town's history as a British [[naval base]].\n\nThe main river running through Sembawang, the {{convert|4|km|adj=on}} long Sungei Sembawang, flowed along a winding route and ended to the west of Sembawang Shipyard. Its middle section was diverted in the 1920s to provide the land needed for the British Naval Base.

The Southern portions of the river, which consisted of [[mangrove]]s, ponds and grassland, was filled in during the 1990s in preparation for the development of Sembawang New Town.\n\n==Modern history==\nThe planning of Sembawang New Town started in 1996 where the Woodlands MRT Extension was opened, and [[Sembawang MRT station]] was also opened at the same time.

Mexican actor [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] plays Ren\u00e9, an in-demand advertising man working in Chile in the late 1980s. The film captures the advertising tactics in the political campaigns for the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|1988 plebiscite]], when the Chilean citizenry decided whether or not dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] should stay in power for another eight years. At the [[85th Academy Awards]] the film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film Oscar]].<ref name=\"OscarNom\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20959604 |title=Oscars: Hollywood announces 85th Academy Award nominations |accessdate=10 January 2013 |work=BBC News |date=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter fifteen years of military dictatorship and facing considerable international pressure, Chile's government asks the public of Chile to vote in the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|national plebiscite of 1988]] on whether General [[Augusto Pinochet]] should stay in power for another eight years, or whether there should be an open democratic presidential election the following year.\n\nRen\u00e9 Saavedra, a successful advertisement creator, is approached by the \"No\" side to consult on their proposed advertising. Behind the back of his politically conservative boss, Saavedra agrees to participate and finds that the advertising is a dourly unappealing litany of the regime's abuses created by an organization that has no confidence in its efforts. Enticed by the marketing challenge and his own loathing of Pinochet's tyranny, he proposes to the advertising subcommittee that they take a lighthearted, upbeat promotional approach stressing abstract concepts like \"joy\" to challenge concerns that voting in a referendum under a notoriously brutal [[military junta]] would be politically meaningless and dangerous.\n\nWhile the unorthodox marketing theme is dismissed by some \"No\" members as a facile dismissal of the regime's horrific abuses, the proposal is approved for the campaign. Saavedra, his son, and his comrades are eventually targeted and intimidated by the authorities. Eventually, Saavedra's boss Lucho finds out about his employee's activities, but when Saavedra refuses an offer to become a partner if he withdraws, Lucho goes to head the \"Yes\" campaign as a matter of survival.\n\nThe historic campaign took place in 27 nights of television advertisements, in which each side had 15 minutes per night to present its point of view. During that month, the \"No\" campaign, created by the majority of Chile's artistic community, proved effective with a series of entertaining and insightful presentations that had an irresistible cross-demographic appeal. By contrast, the \"Yes\" campaign's advertising, with only dry positive economic data in its favor and few creative personnel on call, was derided even by government officials as crass and heavy-handed.\n\nAlthough the government tries to interfere with the \"No\" side with further intimidation and blatant censorship, Rene and his team use those tactics to their favor in their marketing, and public sympathy shifts to them.

The film is based on the unpublished play ''El Plebiscito'', written by [[Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta]]. Mexican actor [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] plays Ren\u00e9, an in-demand advertising man working in Chile in the late 1980s. The film captures the advertising tactics in the political campaigns for the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|1988 plebiscite]], when the Chilean citizenry decided whether or not dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] should stay in power for another eight years. At the [[85th Academy Awards]] the film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film Oscar]].<ref name=\"OscarNom\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20959604 |title=Oscars: Hollywood announces 85th Academy Award nominations |accessdate=10 January 2013 |work=BBC News |date=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter fifteen years of military dictatorship and facing considerable international pressure, Chile's government asks the public of Chile to vote in the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|national plebiscite of 1988]] on whether General [[Augusto Pinochet]] should stay in power for another eight years, or whether there should be an open democratic presidential election the following year.\n\nRen\u00e9 Saavedra, a successful advertisement creator, is approached by the \"No\" side to consult on their proposed advertising. Behind the back of his politically conservative boss, Saavedra agrees to participate and finds that the advertising is a dourly unappealing litany of the regime's abuses created by an organization that has no confidence in its efforts. Enticed by the marketing challenge and his own loathing of Pinochet's tyranny, he proposes to the advertising subcommittee that they take a lighthearted, upbeat promotional approach stressing abstract concepts like \"joy\" to challenge concerns that voting in a referendum under a notoriously brutal [[military junta]] would be politically meaningless and dangerous.\n\nWhile the unorthodox marketing theme is dismissed by some \"No\" members as a facile dismissal of the regime's horrific abuses, the proposal is approved for the campaign. Saavedra, his son, and his comrades are eventually targeted and intimidated by the authorities. Eventually, Saavedra's boss Lucho finds out about his employee's activities, but when Saavedra refuses an offer to become a partner if he withdraws, Lucho goes to head the \"Yes\" campaign as a matter of survival.\n\nThe historic campaign took place in 27 nights of television advertisements, in which each side had 15 minutes per night to present its point of view. During that month, the \"No\" campaign, created by the majority of Chile's artistic community, proved effective with a series of entertaining and insightful presentations that had an irresistible cross-demographic appeal. By contrast, the \"Yes\" campaign's advertising, with only dry positive economic data in its favor and few creative personnel on call, was derided even by government officials as crass and heavy-handed.\n\nAlthough the government tries to interfere with the \"No\" side with further intimidation and blatant censorship, Rene and his team use those tactics to their favor in their marketing, and public sympathy shifts to them. As the campaign heats up in the concluding days with international Hollywood celebrity spots and wildly popular street concert rallies of the \"No\" campaign, while the \"Yes\" side is reduced to desperately parodying the \"No\" ads.\n\nOn the day of the referendum, it momentarily appears that the \"Yes\" vote has the lead, but the final result turns out to be firmly on the \"No\" side. The final proof only comes when the troops surrounding the No headquarters withdraw, as the news of the Chilean senior military command forcing Pinochet to concede comes through. After the success, Saavedra and his boss resume their normal advertising business with a new Chile being born.\n\nThe film ends with historical footage of Pinochet handing over power to newly elected president [[Patricio Aylwin]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as Ren\u00e9 Saavedra\n* [[Alfredo Castro (actor)|Alfredo Castro]] as Luis \"Lucho\" Guzm\u00e1n\n* [[Luis Gnecco]] as Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Urrutia\n* [[Antonia Zegers]] as Ver\u00f3nica Carvajal\n* [[Marcial Tagle]] as Costa\n* [[N\u00e9stor Cantillana]] as Fernando Arancibia\n* [[Jaime Vadell]] as Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez\n* Pascal Montero as Sim\u00f3n Saavedra\n* [[Diego Mu\u00f1oz]] as Carlos\n* Paloma Moreno as Francisca\n* [[Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez (actor)|Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez]]\n* [[Alejandro Goic (actor)|Alejandro Goic]] as Ricardo\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Christopher Reeve]], and [[Augusto Pinochet]] as themselves in [[archive footage]]\n* [[Patricio Aylwin]], [[Patricio Ba\u00f1ados]], [[Carlos Caszely]] and [[Florcita Motuda]] acting as themselves and also appearing in archival footage\n\n==Release==\nAt the [[Telluride Film Festival]], the film was shown outdoors and was rained on.<ref>{{cite news|last=Feinberg|first=Scott|title=Telluride 2012: Gael Garcia Bernal Reminds Chileans to Just Say 'No' in Cannes Carryover|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/telluride-2012-gael-garcia-bernal-no-pablo-larrain-chile-augusto-pinochet-367445|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2 September 2012}}</ref> It was also screened at the [[Locarno Film Festival]] in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Locarno Film Festival focuses on Chile in 2013|url=http://www.thisischile.cl/8211/2/locarno-film-festival-focuses-on-chile-in-2013/News.aspx|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=This is Chile|date=18 October 2012}}</ref> ''No'' played as a Spotlight selection at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Crystal Fairy and Il Futuro fly flag for Chile at Sundance|url=http://www.thisischile.cl/8319/2/crystal-fairy-and-il-futuro-fly-flag-for-chile-at-sundance/News.aspx|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=This is Chile|date=4 December 2012}}</ref> Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal attended the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] where ''No'' was screened.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chilean filmmakers gain warm reception at Toronto Film Festival|url=http://www.thisischile.cl/8136/2/chilean-filmmakers-gain-warm-reception-at-toronto-film-festival/News.aspx|publisher=This is Chile|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> The film was released in the UK by [[Network Distributing|Network Releasing]] on 8 February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Launching Films|url=http://www.launchingfilms.com/release-schedule?distributor=168&sort=dist|publisher=Film Distributors Association|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Praise===\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 93% rating based on 117 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/no_2012/ | title = No (2013) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] }}</ref>\n\nWriting in May 2012, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] New York'' critic David Fear called ''No'' \"the closest thing to a masterpiece that I've seen so far here in Cannes\".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer Leslie Felperin felt the film had the \"potential to break out of the usual ghettos that keep Latin American cinema walled off from non-Hispanic territories. ....with the international success of ''[[Mad Men]]'', marketing campaigners should think about capitalizing on viewers\u2019 fascination everywhere with portraits of the advertising industry itself, engagingly scrutinized here with a delicious, [[Matthew Weiner]]-style eye for period detail.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last= Felperin |first= Leslie |date=18 May 2012 | url= https://variety.com/2012/film/reviews/no-1117947569/ |title= Review: \u2018No\u2019 |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne of the unique features of the film was Larra\u00edn's decision to use \u00be inch Sony [[U-matic]] magnetic tape, which was widely used by television news in the 80s.

A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in [[Beijing]] who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

Following the success of the first series, four TV specials and a second series of 13 episodes were produced during the 1990s. Here, Pat had a family shown on screen for the first time (though his wife had been mentioned in a number of episodes<ref>Series one - Episode 3 - Postman Pat's Birthday</ref>). A new version of the series was produced by [[Cosgrove Hall Films]] from 2003, which expanded on many aspects of the original series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Postman Pat episodes}}\nEach episode follows the adventures of Pat Clifton, a friendly country postman, and his \"black and white cat\" Jess, as he delivers the post through the valley of Greendale. Although he initially concentrates on delivering his letters, he nearly always becomes distracted by a concern of one of the villagers, and is always keen to help resolve their problems. Notable villagers include the [[postmaster|postmistress]], Mrs. Goggins; Alf and Dorothy Thompson, the farmer; PC Selby, the police constable; Pat and Sara Clifton; Jeff Pringles, the teacher; Ajay Bains, driver of the Greendale Rocket and Pencaster Flyer; Nisha Bains, the owner of the cafe; and the local [[handyman]] and inventor, Ted Glen.\n\n==Setting==\n''Postman Pat'' is set in the fictional village of Greendale and the nearby town of Pencaster, on the border between [[Cumbria]] and [[North Yorkshire]].\n\nGreendale is a big, busy village situated in the heart of the Cumbrian countryside. Running through the centre of the village is the High Street, home to Mrs Goggins' Post Office and shop, an unofficial meeting house for the residents. Located on the edge of the village is the railway station, home to the Greendale Rocket. Nisha Bains runs a popular caf\u00e9 there with Sara while her husband Ajay runs a regular schedule on the Greendale Rocket to the nearby town of Pencaster. In the original series (1 and 2), Greendale was much smaller and presented a gentle pace of lifestyle.  It had winding roads, along with the trademark bridge, and a smaller population, which allowed Pat plenty of time to enjoy the countryside as he passed through, or even stop on 'quiet' days to have a picnic. \n\nPencaster is a large, bustling, modern town located within easy commuting distance for the villagers of Greendale.  Situated on the waterfront, Pencaster is a hive of activity, boasting a market square in the centre surrounded by shops, houses, a large railway station, state-of-the-art buildings, and a boat jetty.  It bears some resemblance to [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], the county town of [[Lancashire]], which likewise is a short commute from [[Longsleddale]], the area used as the inspiration for Greendale.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn the second series of the show from the mid-90s, the area is referred to as Garner Bridge, and is located in Greendale. For example, in the episode \"Postman Pat and the Suit of Armour\", Greendale Post Office is referred to as \"Garner Bridge Post Office\".\n\nIngledale is another large, busy village town situated in the heart of the North Yorkshire countryside, only seen once in a special in 1991, set to make a second appearance in the revival.\n\n==Inspiration==\nCunliffe, interviewed about the series, has said that he chose the character of a postman since he needed a character who could visit the countryside and interact with many different people.<ref name=\"Postman Pat's creator looks back at its conception\">{{cite web|title=Postman Pat's creator looks back at its conception|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14939816|website=BBC News|accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Postman Pat's creator John Cunliffe has been at a school in Kendal\">{{cite web|title=Postman Pat's creator John Cunliffe has been at a school in Kendal|url=http://www.itv.com/news/border/2012-04-18/postman-pats-creator-john-cunliffe-has-been-at-a-school-in-kendal/|website=ITV|accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"The Selling of Postman Pat\" />\n\nThe inspiration for the post office itself comes from one located on the Kendal street where Cunliffe lived when he was writing the original treatment. The post office, at 10 Greenside, closed in 2003.<ref>[http://www.visitcumbria.com/kendal/kendal-beastbanks.htm Visit Cumbria \u2013 Beast Banks Post Office, Kendal]. Retrieved 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nCunliffe did not retain rights to the character, and was disappointed by some of the tie-in media later released. He wrote the stories to the series ''[[Rosie and Jim]]'', which he also presented, as a show which he could have tighter control of.<ref name=\"The Selling of Postman Pat\">{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Nick|title=The Selling of Postman Pat|url=http://www.nickdavies.net/1994/02/01/the-selling-of-postman-pat/|website=nickdavies.net|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile Cunliffe visited post offices for inspiration, he has said that the character and village was not based on any one place or person. He commented in 2015 that \"I got maybe half a dozen people last year saying they were the inspiration.\"<ref name=\"Arisaig villagers shocked after author kills legend that kids' cartoon favourite was based on Highland postie\">{{cite web|title=Arisaig villagers shocked after author kills legend that kids' cartoon favourite was based on Highland postie|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/tv/arisaig-villagers-shocked-after-author-5032063|website=Daily Record|accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lewis MacLeod (actor)|Lewis MacLeod]] as Postman Pat (series 2), Ben Taylor, Robot 1, Sat Nav, Alf Thompson (series 2), Sean McGuinness\n* [[Ken Barrie]] as Postman Pat (series 1), Matt Clifton, Mrs. Goggins (series 1), Ted Glen (series 1), Alf Thompson (series 1), Dorothy Thompson (series 1), Bill Thompson (series 1), Peter Timms (series 1), Julia Pottage (series 1), Katy Pottage (series 1), Tom Pottage (series 1), Arthur Selby (series 1), Lucy Selby (series 1), Sylvia Gilbertson (series 1), Sarah Gilbertson (series 1), Jeff Pringle, Charlie Pringle (series 1), Rebecca Hubbard (series 1), Sam Waldron, Granny Dryden, Peter Fogg, Major Forbes, George Lancaster, Santa Claus, Train Inspector, Pumpkin Wrigglesworth, Narrator, Radio Greendale Speaker, John, George, Countdown Sequence Voice\n* [[Carole Boyd]] as Sara Clifton, Julian Clifton (series 2), Mrs. Goggins (series 2), Dorothy Thompson (series 2), Bill Thompson (series 2), Julia Pottage (series 2), Katy Pottage (series 2), Tom Pottage (series 2), Betty Pottage, Lucy Selby (series 2), Sylvia Gilbertson (series 2), Sarah Gilbertson (series 2), Jackie Gilbertson, Charlie Pringle (series 2), Rebecca Hubbard (series 2), George's Wife, Radio Weather Woman\n* [[Kulvinder Ghir]] as Bill Thompson (series 3), Tom Pottage (series 3), Ajay Bains, Bessie Thompson, Michael Lam, Robot 2, Grizzly, Shopper-Bot 3000\n* Janet James as Julian Clifton (series 2), Lucy Selby (series 3), Lauren Taylor\n* [[Archie Panjabi]] as Katy Pottage (series 3), Nisha Bains, Meera Bains\n* Melissa Sinden as Jess Clifton, Polly Clifton, Dotty Pringle, Bonnie Goggins\n* Anji Kreft as Additional Voices (series 2?)\n* [[Angela Griffin]] as Amy Wrigglesworth, Lizzy Taylor, Flora, Rowena Roberts, Duchess of Pencaster\n* Jimmy Hibbert as Additional Voices (series 2)\n* Bradley Clarkson as Ted Glen (series 2), Arthur Selby (series 2), Ned Glen\n* [[Dan Milne]] as Peter Timms (series 2)\n* Joel Trill as Chris Beacon\n* Professor [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] as Professor Ryan Farrow\n\n==''Postman Pat Special Delivery Service''==\nIn the spin-off series, ''Postman Pat Special Delivery Service'' (originally ''Postman Pat: SDS''), Postman Pat has been promoted to Head of the SDS and is now called upon to deliver anything. Each episode follows Postman Pat on a Special Delivery mission, from rescuing a runaway cow to delivering a giant ice cube.  In his new role, Postman Pat commutes to the nearby town of Pencaster where he collects his special deliveries from the Pencaster Mail Centre. Postman Pat now has a new fleet of vehicles including a helicopter, 4x4 Jeep and motorbike, complete with side-car for Jess.<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/01/postman_pat_makeover/ \"Postman Pat goes postal\"], ''The Register''.</ref>  He has a new boss, Ben, who tends to give him instructions (whereas he was his own master before the \"promotion\"). Pat also seems to make more mistakes in his work since moving to SDS, largely because the new format is always based on one delivery, which has to go wrong somehow (thus often because of Pat's errors).\n\nThe series features an expanded and diverse cast, a fleet of new vehicles, a world full of [[gadgets]] and the new town of Pencaster. ''Postman Pat Special Delivery Service'' first screened on BBC2 on 29 September 2008. The new series was commissioned by the BBC and produced by Entertainment Rights and [[Cosgrove Hall Films]].\n\nA new series aired in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/watch/postman-pat-trail|title=Postman Pat \u2013 Postman Pat Trailer|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115143915/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/watch/postman-pat-trail|archivedate=15 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Outside the main broadcast series==\n===Film===\n''[[Postman Pat: The Movie]]'', a British-American 3D computer-animated comedy children's feature film version of the British stop-motion animated children's television show, was theatrically released on 23 May 2014 in the United Kingdom. The film was distributed and produced by [[Lionsgate]] and [[Icon Productions]] and animated by [[Rubicon Group Holding]]. The story revolves around Pat entering a talent show audition which leads to robots taking over his postal service whilst he is away. The film stars [[Stephen Mangan]] as the voice of Pat and also features [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Rupert Grint]], [[David Tennant]], [[Ronan Keating]], [[Susan Duerden]], Sandra Teles, [[TJ Ramini]] and [[Peter Woodward]].\n\n===Spin-off===\nA [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] spin-off to the series was made called ''[[Guess with Jess]]'' which follows Pat's cat Jess now with the ability to talk and his adventures with the farm animals. The series debuted on 9 November 2009 and ended in 2013.\n\n===Music===\nMusic for the original 1981 series was by Bryan Daly,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bryan DALY Obituary|url=http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary.aspx?n=bryan-daly&pid=155548215|accessdate=20 January 2012|newspaper=The Times|date=20 January 2012}}</ref> who wrote a number of songs including the well-known theme tune. For the 2003 series, pop writer Simon Woodgate scored the show and wrote new songs, including a new closing theme \"What's in His Bag?\". The theme tune \"Postman Pat &  His Black and White Cat\" was sung by [[Ken Barrie]] for the original series in the 1980s and '90s. An extended version of the tune was released as a single in the UK where it reached number 44 in the charts in July 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Official Charts Company |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Postman%20Pat |accessdate=24 March 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe theme tune and songs for ''Postman Pat Special Delivery Service'' (including \"Special Delivery Service, What's It Going to Be Today?\"), was recorded by Simon Woodgate at Echobass Studios.\n\nIn 2013 Classic Media released ''Postman Pat SDS'' series 2.

In the opening titles, Pratt can be seen driving a familiar (though yellow in colour) van along country roads before running over a black and white cat.  Pratt likes to clear his workload as quickly as he can by dumping the post rather than delivering it. He is portrayed as a student who is lazy and rude.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0149509|title=Postman Pat}}\n* {{tv.com show|postman-pat}}\n*

and it was directed by animator [[Ivor Wood]], who also worked on ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]'', ''[[The Wombles (1973 TV series)|The Wombles]]'', ''[[Paddington (TV series)|Paddington Bear]]'', and ''[[The Herbs]]''. Following the success of the first series, four TV specials and a second series of 13 episodes were produced during the 1990s. Here, Pat had a family shown on screen for the first time (though his wife had been mentioned in a number of episodes<ref>Series one - Episode 3 - Postman Pat's Birthday</ref>). A new version of the series was produced by [[Cosgrove Hall Films]] from 2003, which expanded on many aspects of the original series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Postman Pat episodes}}\nEach episode follows the adventures of Pat Clifton, a friendly country postman, and his \"black and white cat\" Jess, as he delivers the post through the valley of Greendale. Although he initially concentrates on delivering his letters, he nearly always becomes distracted by a concern of one of the villagers, and is always keen to help resolve their problems. Notable villagers include the [[postmaster|postmistress]], Mrs. Goggins; Alf and Dorothy Thompson, the farmer; PC Selby, the police constable; Pat and Sara Clifton; Jeff Pringles, the teacher; Ajay Bains, driver of the Greendale Rocket and Pencaster Flyer; Nisha Bains, the owner of the cafe; and the local [[handyman]] and inventor, Ted Glen.\n\n==Setting==\n''Postman Pat'' is set in the fictional village of Greendale and the nearby town of Pencaster, on the border between [[Cumbria]] and [[North Yorkshire]].\n\nGreendale is a big, busy village situated in the heart of the Cumbrian countryside. Running through the centre of the village is the High Street, home to Mrs Goggins' Post Office and shop, an unofficial meeting house for the residents. Located on the edge of the village is the railway station, home to the Greendale Rocket. Nisha Bains runs a popular caf\u00e9 there with Sara while her husband Ajay runs a regular schedule on the Greendale Rocket to the nearby town of Pencaster. In the original series (1 and 2), Greendale was much smaller and presented a gentle pace of lifestyle.  It had winding roads, along with the trademark bridge, and a smaller population, which allowed Pat plenty of time to enjoy the countryside as he passed through, or even stop on 'quiet' days to have a picnic. \n\nPencaster is a large, bustling, modern town located within easy commuting distance for the villagers of Greendale.  Situated on the waterfront, Pencaster is a hive of activity, boasting a market square in the centre surrounded by shops, houses, a large railway station, state-of-the-art buildings, and a boat jetty.  It bears some resemblance to [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], the county town of [[Lancashire]], which likewise is a short commute from [[Longsleddale]], the area used as the inspiration for Greendale.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn the second series of the show from the mid-90s, the area is referred to as Garner Bridge, and is located in Greendale. For example, in the episode \"Postman Pat and the Suit of Armour\", Greendale Post Office is referred to as \"Garner Bridge Post Office\".\n\nIngledale is another large, busy village town situated in the heart of the North Yorkshire countryside, only seen once in a special in 1991, set to make a second appearance in the revival.\n\n==Inspiration==\nCunliffe, interviewed about the series, has said that he chose the character of a postman since he needed a character who could visit the countryside and interact with many different people.<ref name=\"Postman Pat's creator looks back at its conception\">{{cite web|title=Postman Pat's creator looks back at its conception|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14939816|website=BBC News|accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Postman Pat's creator John Cunliffe has been at a school in Kendal\">{{cite web|title=Postman Pat's creator John Cunliffe has been at a school in Kendal|url=http://www.itv.com/news/border/2012-04-18/postman-pats-creator-john-cunliffe-has-been-at-a-school-in-kendal/|website=ITV|accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"The Selling of Postman Pat\" />\n\nThe inspiration for the post office itself comes from one located on the Kendal street where Cunliffe lived when he was writing the original treatment. The post office, at 10 Greenside, closed in 2003.<ref>[http://www.visitcumbria.com/kendal/kendal-beastbanks.htm Visit Cumbria \u2013 Beast Banks Post Office, Kendal]. Retrieved 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nCunliffe did not retain rights to the character, and was disappointed by some of the tie-in media later released. He wrote the stories to the series ''[[Rosie and Jim]]'', which he also presented, as a show which he could have tighter control of.<ref name=\"The Selling of Postman Pat\">{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Nick|title=The Selling of Postman Pat|url=http://www.nickdavies.net/1994/02/01/the-selling-of-postman-pat/|website=nickdavies.net|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile Cunliffe visited post offices for inspiration, he has said that the character and village was not based on any one place or person.

Each episode follows Postman Pat on a Special Delivery mission, from rescuing a runaway cow to delivering a giant ice cube.  In his new role, Postman Pat commutes to the nearby town of Pencaster where he collects his special deliveries from the Pencaster Mail Centre. Postman Pat now has a new fleet of vehicles including a helicopter, 4x4 Jeep and motorbike, complete with side-car for Jess.<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/01/postman_pat_makeover/ \"Postman Pat goes postal\"], ''The Register''.</ref>  He has a new boss, Ben, who tends to give him instructions (whereas he was his own master before the \"promotion\"). Pat also seems to make more mistakes in his work since moving to SDS, largely because the new format is always based on one delivery, which has to go wrong somehow (thus often because of Pat's errors).\n\nThe series features an expanded and diverse cast, a fleet of new vehicles, a world full of [[gadgets]] and the new town of Pencaster. ''Postman Pat Special Delivery Service'' first screened on BBC2 on 29 September 2008. The new series was commissioned by the BBC and produced by Entertainment Rights and [[Cosgrove Hall Films]].\n\nA new series aired in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/watch/postman-pat-trail|title=Postman Pat \u2013 Postman Pat Trailer|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115143915/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/watch/postman-pat-trail|archivedate=15 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Outside the main broadcast series==\n===Film===\n''[[Postman Pat: The Movie]]'', a British-American 3D computer-animated comedy children's feature film version of the British stop-motion animated children's television show, was theatrically released on 23 May 2014 in the United Kingdom. The film was distributed and produced by [[Lionsgate]] and [[Icon Productions]] and animated by [[Rubicon Group Holding]]. The story revolves around Pat entering a talent show audition which leads to robots taking over his postal service whilst he is away. The film stars [[Stephen Mangan]] as the voice of Pat and also features [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Rupert Grint]], [[David Tennant]], [[Ronan Keating]], [[Susan Duerden]], Sandra Teles, [[TJ Ramini]] and [[Peter Woodward]].\n\n===Spin-off===\nA [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] spin-off to the series was made called ''[[Guess with Jess]]'' which follows Pat's cat Jess now with the ability to talk and his adventures with the farm animals. The series debuted on 9 November 2009 and ended in 2013.\n\n===Music===\nMusic for the original 1981 series was by Bryan Daly,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bryan DALY Obituary|url=http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary.aspx?n=bryan-daly&pid=155548215|accessdate=20 January 2012|newspaper=The Times|date=20 January 2012}}</ref> who wrote a number of songs including the well-known theme tune. For the 2003 series, pop writer Simon Woodgate scored the show and wrote new songs, including a new closing theme \"What's in His Bag?\". The theme tune \"Postman Pat &  His Black and White Cat\" was sung by [[Ken Barrie]] for the original series in the 1980s and '90s. An extended version of the tune was released as a single in the UK where it reached number 44 in the charts in July 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Official Charts Company |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Postman%20Pat |accessdate=24 March 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe theme tune and songs for ''Postman Pat Special Delivery Service'' (including \"Special Delivery Service, What's It Going to Be Today?\"), was recorded by Simon Woodgate at Echobass Studios.\n\nIn 2013 Classic Media released ''Postman Pat SDS'' series 2. The new 26-episode series retained Bryan Daly's original theme tune and Simon Woodgate's closing song, however new character themes and incidental music was composed by Sandy Nuttgens.\n\nThere is also an album called ''Postman Pat: Songs and Music From the TV Series'', released by Post Music in 1982.\n\nThe theme song has undergone several adaptations; from 1994 to 1996, the theme tune had additional instruments such as synthesised strings and a tambourine. A similar edit was made to the 1995 album version, which was an edit of the original 1982 album version.\n\n===Books===\nAs of 2009, over 12 million books, including storybooks, integrated learning books, colouring books, and multi-character magazines, have been sold worldwide.<ref name=TelegraphGreendale>{{cite news|last1=CHappet|first1=Marie-Claire|title=Postman Pat: from Greendale to Hollywood|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8768822/Postman-Pat-from-Greendale-to-Hollywood.html|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Advertising===\n\nThe ''Postman Pat'' characters and setting have also been used in the UK and Australia in television advertisements for the company [[Specsavers]].\n\n===US VHS releases===\n'''[[Celebrity Home Entertainment]] (1999)'''\n\nTitles include:\n* Vol.1 Postman Pat takes the Bus 16\n* Vol.2 Postman Pat and the Tuba 18\n'''Strand Home Video (1990)'''\n\nTitles Include:\n* Postman Pat's ABC Story Episode 14\n* Postman Pat's 123 Story Episode 15\n* Read Along With Postman Pat Episode 20\n* The First Season was released on 13 separate VHS tapes: 1 episode per tape.

It is believed by many historians that the name 'Esan' (originally, 'E san fia') owes its origin to Bini (meaning, 'they have fled' or 'they jumped away'). 'Ishan' is an Anglicized form of 'Esan', the result of colonial Britain's inability to properly pronounce the name of this ethnic group. It is believed that similar corruption has affected such Esan names as ubh\u1eb9kh\u1eb9 (now 'obeche' tree), uloko (now 'iroko' tree), Abhuluim\u1eb9n (now 'Aburime'), etc. Efforts have however been made to return to status quo ante.\n\nFor academic purpose, Esan refers to\n# the ethnic group that occupies central Edo State;\n# (''plural'' unchanged) a person or the people collectively from this ethnic group;\n# the language of these people which, linguistically, is of the Kwa subdivision of the Niger-Congo language family;\n# something of, related to, or having Esan origin e.g. uro Esan (=Esan language), ot\u1ecd Esan (=Esan land), \u1ecdgh\u1eb9d\u1eb9 Esan (=Esan banana).\nIn the pre-colonial era, Esans carried a crow's foot tribal scar below their eyes.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/anthropologicalr00thom |last=Thomas |first=Northcote Whitridge|location=London |publisher=Harrison |title= Anthropological Report on the Edo-Speaking Peoples of Nigeria (1910) |access-date=10 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Esanland}}\n{{Further|Esanland#History}}\n\n===Pre-historical/classical period===\nAccording to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah-forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years ago.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalarchae0000unse_g7b0 |url-access=registration |location=Asmara, Trenton |publisher=Africa World Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicalarchae0000unse_g7b0/page/178 178]\u2013180 |isbn=978-0-865-43610-7 |access-date=7 April 2015|title=Historical Archaeology in Nigeria |year=1998 }}</ref> These people were likely associated with the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests.

In 1460, [[Oba Ewuare]] passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking. These laws proved too restrictive for many citizens, and these citizens fled the kingdom to Esanland. This exodus shaped Esanland\u2019s modern cultural identity and gave rise to the term \"Esan,\" or \"refugee.\" Oral tradition has heavily supported this theory. Prominent Esan and Edo historians have collected stories about this migration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esancongress.org/enc.html/|title=Welcome /Obo'khian to the Esan World Congress|publisher=Esan World Congress|website=Esan World Congress |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Rolle |first=Nicholas |title=Linguistic evidence for heterogeneous origins of modern Esan language and identity |url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~nicholasrolle/Rolle%20-%202013.04.19%20-%20CAS%20Research%20Forum%20-%20Esan%20History%20-%20Audience.pdf |date=19 April 2013|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Pre-colonization ===\nEsan kingdoms had a varying degree of autonomy, but were ultimately controlled by the Benin Empire. The Oba approved the enijie of Esanland, and Esan kingdoms paid tribute to Benin. Yet, several wars between Esan kingdoms and Benin were recorded. This was due to the Oba, at ascension on the throne, sending white chalk to the Esans as a term of friendship. If the chalk was rejected, then the Oba would try to invade Esanland. The varying political stabilities of Benin and the Esan kingdoms also led to warfare. Such warfare was so common that there is no recorded history of peace between all of the Esan kingdoms and Benin.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nEsanland was extensively involved in world trade. Benin\u2019s sovereignty over Esanland enabled it to send long-distant traders, or ''ekhen.'' ''Ekhen'' procured cloth, ivory, peppers, and slaves for European merchants in [[Yorubaland]], Esanland, and [[Afenmai]]. Portugal primarily received blue cloth, or ''ukpon ododo'' from Esanland in exchange for tobacco, brandy, mirror, beads, and firearms, primarily through ''ekhen''.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Uzea War occurred. This war was between the Uromi Kingdom and the Benin Kingdom. The war lasted from 1502 to 1503, and resulted from a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba of Uromi. The war ended at the town of Uzea, when both leaders were killed. However, in peaceful times Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and the sacking of Akure in 1823.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4852/5de30ab1be92ffa6f60947c0d6419899bfd4.pdf}}</ref>\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, northern Esanland was continually attacked and sacked by the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Nupe people]] in the hunt for slaves and converts to Islam, having previously taken over the [[Kukuruku people]]s\u2019 lands. Many Esan kingdoms from the south helped in the battle to fend off the Nupes. The battles came into the Esans\u2019 favor; several Nupe and [[Etsako people|Etsako]] warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. \nThe nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Esan warfare and colonization ===\n[[File:KingOgbidiOkojie.JPG|thumb|[[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]] and his entourage.]]\nIn 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland proved to be harder to conquer than the [[Benin Kingdom]] because of its strong autonomy: Kingdoms chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by [[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]], was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThis process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued geurilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain\u2019s part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[File:Modern-Agogo.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The logo of the Esan Voice Association.|The traditional [[Agog\u00f4|agogo]] bell.

The Esan have prominent traditional rulers who keep order in a society where beauty and manners are intertwined. Despite the long-term impact of Christianity, the Esan are largely traditional and a large number practice traditional beliefs in the form of worship of ancestral spirits and other gods. A large percentage of Esan are Christians, mostly Catholic and recently of other denominations. Esan has various dialects all of which stem from [[Bini people|Bini]] and there is still close affinity between the Esan and the [[Bini people|Bini]], which leads to the common saying \"Esan ii gbi \u1eb8do\" meaning, Esan does not harm the \u1eb8do (i.e. Bini). There have been other translation of that saying, Esan gbe Edo which means Esan have conquered Bini.\n\nTraditional Esan religion has many similarities to traditional Edo religion, due to the Esan migration to the northeast during the 15th century from the [[Benin Empire]]. There are many deities of the Esan religion:\n* [[Osanobua]], the main Edo-Esan god. This name for God was brought over to Christianity and its missionaries, and thus the translation for God in Esanland is [[Osanobua]].\n* [[Olokun]]\n* [[Eshu|Esu]], the Esan trickster god. This god is shared with Yoruba and Edo myth. The name Esu was used as a translation for [[Satan]] by Christian missionaries.\n* [[Osun]], the Esan god of medicine.

It is believed by many historians that the name 'Esan' (originally, 'E san fia') owes its origin to Bini (meaning, 'they have fled' or 'they jumped away'). 'Ishan' is an Anglicized form of 'Esan', the result of colonial Britain's inability to properly pronounce the name of this ethnic group. It is believed that similar corruption has affected such Esan names as ubh\u1eb9kh\u1eb9 (now 'obeche' tree), uloko (now 'iroko' tree), Abhuluim\u1eb9n (now 'Aburime'), etc. Efforts have however been made to return to status quo ante.\n\nFor academic purpose, Esan refers to\n# the ethnic group that occupies central Edo State;\n# (''plural'' unchanged) a person or the people collectively from this ethnic group;\n# the language of these people which, linguistically, is of the Kwa subdivision of the Niger-Congo language family;\n# something of, related to, or having Esan origin e.g. uro Esan (=Esan language), ot\u1ecd Esan (=Esan land), \u1ecdgh\u1eb9d\u1eb9 Esan (=Esan banana).\nIn the pre-colonial era, Esans carried a crow's foot tribal scar below their eyes.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/anthropologicalr00thom |last=Thomas |first=Northcote Whitridge|location=London |publisher=Harrison |title= Anthropological Report on the Edo-Speaking Peoples of Nigeria (1910) |access-date=10 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Esanland}}\n{{Further|Esanland#History}}\n\n===Pre-historical/classical period===\nAccording to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah-forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years ago.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalarchae0000unse_g7b0 |url-access=registration |location=Asmara, Trenton |publisher=Africa World Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicalarchae0000unse_g7b0/page/178 178]\u2013180 |isbn=978-0-865-43610-7 |access-date=7 April 2015|title=Historical Archaeology in Nigeria |year=1998 }}</ref> These people were likely associated with the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests.

In 1460, [[Oba Ewuare]] passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking. These laws proved too restrictive for many citizens, and these citizens fled the kingdom to Esanland. This exodus shaped Esanland\u2019s modern cultural identity and gave rise to the term \"Esan,\" or \"refugee.\" Oral tradition has heavily supported this theory.

The Oba approved the enijie of Esanland, and Esan kingdoms paid tribute to Benin. Yet, several wars between Esan kingdoms and Benin were recorded. This was due to the Oba, at ascension on the throne, sending white chalk to the Esans as a term of friendship. If the chalk was rejected, then the Oba would try to invade Esanland. The varying political stabilities of Benin and the Esan kingdoms also led to warfare. Such warfare was so common that there is no recorded history of peace between all of the Esan kingdoms and Benin.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nEsanland was extensively involved in world trade. Benin\u2019s sovereignty over Esanland enabled it to send long-distant traders, or ''ekhen.'' ''Ekhen'' procured cloth, ivory, peppers, and slaves for European merchants in [[Yorubaland]], Esanland, and [[Afenmai]]. Portugal primarily received blue cloth, or ''ukpon ododo'' from Esanland in exchange for tobacco, brandy, mirror, beads, and firearms, primarily through ''ekhen''.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Uzea War occurred. This war was between the Uromi Kingdom and the Benin Kingdom. The war lasted from 1502 to 1503, and resulted from a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba of Uromi. The war ended at the town of Uzea, when both leaders were killed. However, in peaceful times Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and the sacking of Akure in 1823.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4852/5de30ab1be92ffa6f60947c0d6419899bfd4.pdf}}</ref>\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, northern Esanland was continually attacked and sacked by the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Nupe people]] in the hunt for slaves and converts to Islam, having previously taken over the [[Kukuruku people]]s\u2019 lands. Many Esan kingdoms from the south helped in the battle to fend off the Nupes. The battles came into the Esans\u2019 favor; several Nupe and [[Etsako people|Etsako]] warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. \nThe nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Esan warfare and colonization ===\n[[File:KingOgbidiOkojie.JPG|thumb|[[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]] and his entourage.]]\nIn 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland proved to be harder to conquer than the [[Benin Kingdom]] because of its strong autonomy: Kingdoms chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by [[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]], was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThis process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued geurilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain\u2019s part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[File:Modern-Agogo.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The logo of the Esan Voice Association.|The traditional [[Agog\u00f4|agogo]] bell.

The Esan have prominent traditional rulers who keep order in a society where beauty and manners are intertwined. Despite the long-term impact of Christianity, the Esan are largely traditional and a large number practice traditional beliefs in the form of worship of ancestral spirits and other gods. A large percentage of Esan are Christians, mostly Catholic and recently of other denominations. Esan has various dialects all of which stem from [[Bini people|Bini]] and there is still close affinity between the Esan and the [[Bini people|Bini]], which leads to the common saying \"Esan ii gbi \u1eb8do\" meaning, Esan does not harm the \u1eb8do (i.e. Bini). There have been other translation of that saying, Esan gbe Edo which means Esan have conquered Bini.\n\nTraditional Esan religion has many similarities to traditional Edo religion, due to the Esan migration to the northeast during the 15th century from the [[Benin Empire]]. There are many deities of the Esan religion:\n* [[Osanobua]], the main Edo-Esan god. This name for God was brought over to Christianity and its missionaries, and thus the translation for God in Esanland is [[Osanobua]].\n* [[Olokun]]\n* [[Eshu|Esu]], the Esan trickster god. This god is shared with Yoruba and Edo myth. The name Esu was used as a translation for [[Satan]] by Christian missionaries.\n* [[Osun]], the Esan god of medicine.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 4 April, there have been 136 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 2 people have died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 4 April, there have been 136 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 2 people have died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.

It is named after the American [[nuclear chemist]] [[Glenn T. Seaborg]]. As a [[synthetic element]], it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. It is also [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], <sup>269</sup>Sg, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 14&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=PuCa2017 />\n\nIn the [[periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 6 elements]] as the fourth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that seaborgium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[tungsten]] in group 6. The chemical properties of seaborgium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 6 elements.\n\nIn 1974, a few atoms of seaborgium were produced in laboratories in the [[Soviet Union]] and in the United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the [[Transfermium Wars|naming of the element was disputed]] between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) established seaborgium as the official name for the element. It is one of only two elements named after a living person at the time of naming, the other being [[oganesson]], element 118.\n\n==History==\nFollowing claims of the observation of elements [[rutherfordium|104]] and [[dubnium|105]] in 1970 by [[Albert Ghiorso]] et al. at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], a search for element 106 using oxygen-18 projectiles and the previously used californium-249 target was conducted.<ref name=Transuraniumppl /> Several 9.1 MeV [[alpha decay]]s were reported and are now thought to originate from element 106, though this was not confirmed at the time. In 1972, the HILAC accelerator received equipment upgrades, preventing the team from repeating the experiment, and data analysis was not done during the shutdown.<ref name=Transuraniumppl>{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=D.C |last2=Ghiorso|first2=A.|last3=Seaborg|first3=G.T.|title=The Transuranium People: The Inside Story |publisher=Imperial College Press|date=2000|isbn=978-1-86094-087-3|pages=300\u2013327}}</ref> This reaction was tried again several years later, in 1974, and the Berkeley team realized that their new data agreed with their 1971 data, to the astonishment of Ghiorso. Hence, element 106 could have actually been discovered in 1971 if the original data was analyzed more carefully.<ref name=Transuraniumppl />\n\nTwo groups claimed [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the element]]. Unambiguous evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in [[Dubna]] led by [[Yuri Oganessian]], in which targets of [[lead-208]] and [[lead-207]] were bombarded with accelerated ions of [[chromium-54]]. In total, fifty-one [[spontaneous fission]] events were observed with a half-life between four and ten [[milliseconds]]. After having ruled out nucleon [[Nuclear reaction#Transfer reactions|transfer reactions]] as a cause for these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.<ref name=\"93TWG\">{{Cite journal\n|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757\n|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements.

The dispute on discovery, however, dragged on until 1992, when the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG), formed to put an end to the controversy by making conclusions regarding discovery claims for elements 101 to [[copernicium|112]], concluded that the Soviet synthesis of seaborgium-260 was not convincing enough, \"lacking as it is in yield curves and angular selection results\", whereas the American synthesis of seaborgium-263 was convincing due to its being firmly anchored to known daughter nuclei. As such, the TWG recognised the Berkeley team as official discoverers in their 1993 report.<ref name=93TWG/>\n\n[[File:Seaborg in lab - restoration.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Element 106 was named after [[Glenn T.

However, due to the worsening relations between the competing teams after the publication of the TWG report (because the Berkeley team vehemently disagreed with the TWG's conclusions, especially regarding element 104), this proposal was dropped from consideration by the Berkeley team.<ref name=transuranium>Hoffman, D.C., Ghiorso, A., Seaborg, G.

They have a right to suggest a name. And, of course, we didn't infringe on that at all.\" However, Seaborg responded:\n\n{{quotation|This would be the first time in history that the acknowledged and uncontested discoverers of an element are denied the privilege of naming it.<ref name=vanderkrogt/>|author=Glenn Seaborg}}\n\nBowing to public pressure, IUPAC proposed a different compromise in August 1995, in which the name ''seaborgium'' was reinstated for element 106 in exchange for the removal of all but one of the other American proposals, which met an even worse response. Finally, IUPAC rescinded these previous compromises and made a final, new recommendation in August 1997, in which the American and German proposals for elements 104 to 109 were all adopted, including ''seaborgium'' for element 106, with the single exception of element 105, named ''dubnium'' to recognise the contributions of the Dubna team to the experimental procedures of transactinide synthesis. This list was finally accepted by the American Chemical Society, which wrote:<ref name=transuranium/>\n\n{{quotation|In the interest of international harmony, the Committee reluctantly accepted the name 'dubnium' for element 105 in place of 'hahnium' [the American proposal], which has had long-standing use in literature.

They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in [[metallic bonding]].<ref name=Greenwood>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|pages=1002\u201339}}</ref> As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable, and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for seaborgium.<ref name=Haire/>\n\nThis stabilisation of the highest oxidation state occurs in the early 6d elements because of the similarity between the energies of the 6d and 7s orbitals, since the 7s orbitals are relativistically stabilised and the 6d orbitals are relativistically destabilised. This effect is so large in the seventh period that seaborgium is expected to lose its 6d electrons before its 7s electrons (Sg, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>4</sup>7s<sup>2</sup>; Sg<sup>+</sup>, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>3</sup>7s<sup>2</sup>; Sg<sup>2+</sup>, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>3</sup>7s<sup>1</sup>; Sg<sup>4+</sup>, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>2</sup>; Sg<sup>6+</sup>, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>). Because of the great destabilisation of the 7s orbital, Sg<sup>IV</sup> should be even more unstable than W<sup>IV</sup> and should be very readily oxidised to Sg<sup>VI</sup>. The predicted ionic radius of the hexacoordinate Sg<sup>6+</sup> ion is 65&nbsp;pm, while the predicted atomic radius of seaborgium is 128&nbsp;pm. Nevertheless, the stability of the highest oxidation state is still expected to decrease as Lr<sup>III</sup> &gt; Rf<sup>IV</sup> &gt; Db<sup>V</sup> &gt; Sg<sup>VI</sup>. Some predicted [[standard reduction potential]]s for seaborgium ions in aqueous acidic solution are as follows:<ref name=Haire/>\n\n{|\n|-\n| 2 SgO<sub>3</sub> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> || {{eqm}} Sg<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || E<sup>0</sup> = \u22120.046 V\n|-\n| Sg<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> || {{eqm}} 2 SgO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || E<sup>0</sup> = +0.11 V\n|-\n| SgO<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>\u2212</sup> || {{eqm}} Sg<sup>3+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O || E<sup>0</sup> = \u22121.34 V\n|-\n| Sg<sup>3+</sup> + e<sup>\u2212</sup> || {{eqm}} Sg<sup>2+</sup> || E<sup>0</sup> = \u22120.11 V\n|-\n| Sg<sup>3+</sup> + 3 e<sup>\u2212</sup> || {{eqm}} Sg || E<sup>0</sup> = +0.27 V\n|}\n\nSeaborgium should form a very volatile [[hexafluoride]] (SgF<sub>6</sub>) as well as a moderately volatile hexachloride (SgCl<sub>6</sub>), pentachloride (SgCl<sub>5</sub>), and oxychlorides SgO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and SgOCl<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=BFricke/> SgO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> is expected to be the most stable of the seaborgium oxychlorides and to be the least volatile of the group 6 oxychlorides, with the sequence MoO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> &gt; WO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> &gt; SgO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=Haire/> The volatile seaborgium(VI) compounds SgCl<sub>6</sub> and SgOCl<sub>4</sub> are expected to be unstable to decomposition to seaborgium(V) compounds at high temperatures, analogous to MoCl<sub>6</sub> and MoOCl<sub>4</sub>; this should not happen for SgO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> due to the much higher energy gap between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] and lowest unoccupied [[molecular orbital]]s, despite the similar Sg\u2013Cl bond strengths (similarly to molybdenum and tungsten).<ref name=\"Kratz\">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1351/pac200375010103 |url =https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.2003.75.issue-1/pac200375010103/pac200375010103.pdf |title = Critical evaluation of the chemical properties of the transactinide elements (IUPAC Technical Report) |date = 2003 |last1 = Kratz |first1 = J.

In experiments conducted in 1997 and 1998, seaborgium was eluted from cation-exchange resin using a HNO<sub>3</sub>/HF solution, most likely as neutral SgO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> or the anionic complex ion [SgO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> rather than {{chem|SgO|4|2-}}. In contrast, in 0.1 M [[nitric acid]], seaborgium does not elute, unlike molybdenum and tungsten, indicating that the hydrolysis of [Sg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>6+</sup> only proceeds as far as the cationic complex [Sg(OH)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>2+</sup> or [Sg(OH)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, while that of molybdenum and tungsten proceeds to neutral [MO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>)].<ref name=Haire/>\n\nThe only other oxidation state known for seaborgium other than the group oxidation state of +6 is the zero oxidation state. Similarly to its three lighter congeners, forming [[chromium hexacarbonyl]], [[molybdenum hexacarbonyl]], and [[tungsten hexacarbonyl]], seaborgium has been shown in 2014 to also form seaborgium [[metal carbonyl|hexacarbonyl]], Sg(CO)<sub>6</sub>.

It is named after the American [[nuclear chemist]] [[Glenn T. Seaborg]]. As a [[synthetic element]], it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. It is also [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], <sup>269</sup>Sg, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 14&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=PuCa2017 />\n\nIn the [[periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 6 elements]] as the fourth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that seaborgium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[tungsten]] in group 6. The chemical properties of seaborgium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 6 elements.\n\nIn 1974, a few atoms of seaborgium were produced in laboratories in the [[Soviet Union]] and in the United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the [[Transfermium Wars|naming of the element was disputed]] between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) established seaborgium as the official name for the element. It is one of only two elements named after a living person at the time of naming, the other being [[oganesson]], element 118.\n\n==History==\nFollowing claims of the observation of elements [[rutherfordium|104]] and [[dubnium|105]] in 1970 by [[Albert Ghiorso]] et al. at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], a search for element 106 using oxygen-18 projectiles and the previously used californium-249 target was conducted.<ref name=Transuraniumppl /> Several 9.1 MeV [[alpha decay]]s were reported and are now thought to originate from element 106, though this was not confirmed at the time. In 1972, the HILAC accelerator received equipment upgrades, preventing the team from repeating the experiment, and data analysis was not done during the shutdown.<ref name=Transuraniumppl>{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=D.C |last2=Ghiorso|first2=A.|last3=Seaborg|first3=G.T.|title=The Transuranium People: The Inside Story |publisher=Imperial College Press|date=2000|isbn=978-1-86094-087-3|pages=300\u2013327}}</ref> This reaction was tried again several years later, in 1974, and the Berkeley team realized that their new data agreed with their 1971 data, to the astonishment of Ghiorso. Hence, element 106 could have actually been discovered in 1971 if the original data was analyzed more carefully.<ref name=Transuraniumppl />\n\nTwo groups claimed [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the element]]. Unambiguous evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in [[Dubna]] led by [[Yuri Oganessian]], in which targets of [[lead-208]] and [[lead-207]] were bombarded with accelerated ions of [[chromium-54]]. In total, fifty-one [[spontaneous fission]] events were observed with a half-life between four and ten [[milliseconds]]. After having ruled out nucleon [[Nuclear reaction#Transfer reactions|transfer reactions]] as a cause for these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.<ref name=\"93TWG\">{{Cite journal\n|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757\n|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements.

The dispute on discovery, however, dragged on until 1992, when the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG), formed to put an end to the controversy by making conclusions regarding discovery claims for elements 101 to [[copernicium|112]], concluded that the Soviet synthesis of seaborgium-260 was not convincing enough, \"lacking as it is in yield curves and angular selection results\", whereas the American synthesis of seaborgium-263 was convincing due to its being firmly anchored to known daughter nuclei. As such, the TWG recognised the Berkeley team as official discoverers in their 1993 report.<ref name=93TWG/>\n\n[[File:Seaborg in lab - restoration.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Element 106 was named after [[Glenn T.

They have a right to suggest a name.

Finally, IUPAC rescinded these previous compromises and made a final, new recommendation in August 1997, in which the American and German proposals for elements 104 to 109 were all adopted, including ''seaborgium'' for element 106, with the single exception of element 105, named ''dubnium'' to recognise the contributions of the Dubna team to the experimental procedures of transactinide synthesis.

A few singular chemistry-related properties properties have been measured, but properties of seaborgium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.\n\n===Physical===\nSeaborgium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] tungsten.<ref name=bcc/> It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 35.0&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which would be the fourth-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower only than [[bohrium]] (37.1&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), [[meitnerium]] (37.4&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and [[hassium]] (41&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), the three following elements in the periodic table.<ref name=Haire/> In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. This results from seaborgium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough seaborgium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.<ref name=Haire/>\n\n===Chemical===\nSeaborgium is the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of [[group 6 element|group 6]] in the periodic table, below [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], and [[tungsten]]. All the members of the group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in [[metallic bonding]].<ref name=Greenwood>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|pages=1002\u201339}}</ref> As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable, and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for seaborgium.<ref name=Haire/>\n\nThis stabilisation of the highest oxidation state occurs in the early 6d elements because of the similarity between the energies of the 6d and 7s orbitals, since the 7s orbitals are relativistically stabilised and the 6d orbitals are relativistically destabilised. This effect is so large in the seventh period that seaborgium is expected to lose its 6d electrons before its 7s electrons (Sg, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>4</sup>7s<sup>2</sup>; Sg<sup>+</sup>, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>3</sup>7s<sup>2</sup>; Sg<sup>2+</sup>, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>3</sup>7s<sup>1</sup>; Sg<sup>4+</sup>, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>2</sup>; Sg<sup>6+</sup>, [Rn]5f<sup>14</sup>). Because of the great destabilisation of the 7s orbital, Sg<sup>IV</sup> should be even more unstable than W<sup>IV</sup> and should be very readily oxidised to Sg<sup>VI</sup>. The predicted ionic radius of the hexacoordinate Sg<sup>6+</sup> ion is 65&nbsp;pm, while the predicted atomic radius of seaborgium is 128&nbsp;pm. Nevertheless, the stability of the highest oxidation state is still expected to decrease as Lr<sup>III</sup> &gt; Rf<sup>IV</sup> &gt; Db<sup>V</sup> &gt; Sg<sup>VI</sup>.

In experiments conducted in 1997 and 1998, seaborgium was eluted from cation-exchange resin using a HNO<sub>3</sub>/HF solution, most likely as neutral SgO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> or the anionic complex ion [SgO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> rather than {{chem|SgO|4|2-}}. In contrast, in 0.1 M [[nitric acid]], seaborgium does not elute, unlike molybdenum and tungsten, indicating that the hydrolysis of [Sg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>6+</sup> only proceeds as far as the cationic complex [Sg(OH)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>2+</sup> or [Sg(OH)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, while that of molybdenum and tungsten proceeds to neutral [MO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>)].<ref name=Haire/>\n\nThe only other oxidation state known for seaborgium other than the group oxidation state of +6 is the zero oxidation state. Similarly to its three lighter congeners, forming [[chromium hexacarbonyl]], [[molybdenum hexacarbonyl]], and [[tungsten hexacarbonyl]], seaborgium has been shown in 2014 to also form seaborgium [[metal carbonyl|hexacarbonyl]], Sg(CO)<sub>6</sub>.
