Most players play more than the MP3 file format, such as [[Windows Media Audio]] (WMA), [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC), [[Vorbis]], [[FLAC]], [[Speex]] and [[Ogg]].\n\n==History==\n===Digital audio player===\n{{See|Portable media player}}\n\nIn 1981, [[Kane Kramer]] filed for a UK patent for the [[IXI (digital audio player)|IXI]], the first Digital Audio Player.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/09/briton-invented/ |title=Briton Invented iPod, DRM and On-Line Music in 1979 |website=Wired.com |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2017-04-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327175756/https://www.wired.com/2008/09/briton-invented/ |archivedate=2017-03-27 }}</ref> UK patent 2115996 was issued in 1985, and U.S. Patent 4,667,088 was issued in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US4667088 |title=Patent US4667088 - Portable data processing and storage system - Google Patents |website=Google.com |date=1983-07-01 |accessdate=2017-04-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229103622/https://www.google.com/patents/US4667088 |archivedate=2016-12-29 }}</ref> The player was as big as a credit card and had a small [[LCD]] screen, navigation and volume buttons and would have held at least 8MB of data in a solid-state bubble memory chip with a capacity of 3\u00bd minutes' worth of audio.

Later Kramer set up a company to promote the IXI and five working prototypes were produced with 16-bit sampling at 44.1 kilohertz with the pre-production prototype being unveiled at the APRS Audio/Visual trade exhibition in October 1986. However, in 1988 Kramer's failure to raise the \u00a360,000 required to renew the patent meant it entering the public domain, but he still owns the designs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1053152/Apple-admit-Briton-DID-invent-iPod-hes-getting-money.html |title=Apple admit Briton DID invent iPod, but he's still not getting any money |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2017-04-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629013155/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1053152/Apple-admit-Briton-DID-invent-iPod-hes-getting-money.html |archivedate=2012-06-29 }}</ref>\nIn 1987 a German research institute, part of the [[Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]], started the research program for coding music with the high quality and low bit-rate sampling at its institute.

It retailed for $599 and was a commercial failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/10/ft_first_mp3_player/|title=Ten years old: the world's first MP3 player|author=|date=10 March 2008|website=theregister.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> The first handheld portable MP3 player released on the American market was the Eiger Labs F10, a 32MB imported version of the MPMan F10 that appeared in the summer of 1998. It was a very basic unit and wasn't user-expandable, though owners could upgrade the memory to 64MB by sending the player back to Eiger Labs with a check for $69.00 plus $7.95 shipping.\n\nAnother early MP3 player needed was the [[Rio PMP300]] from [[Diamond Multimedia]], introduced in September 1998. The Rio was a big success during the Christmas 1998 season as sales significantly exceeded expectations, spurring interest and investment in digital music. The [[RIAA]] soon filed a lawsuit alleging that the device abetted illegal copying of music, but Diamond won a legal victory on the shoulders of ''[[Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'' and MP3 players were ruled legal devices. Eiger Labs and Diamond and went on to establish a new segment in the portable audio player market and the following year saw several new manufacturers enter this market.\n\nOther early MP3 portables include Sensory Science's Rave MP2100, the I-Jam IJ-100 and the Creative Labs Nomad. These portables were small and light, but only held enough memory to hold around 7 to 20 songs at normal 128kbit/s compression rates. They also used slower parallel port connections to transfer files from PC to player, necessary as most PCs then used the [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT|NT]] operating systems, which did not support the then newer [[USB]] connections, at least well. As more users migrated to [[Windows 98]] by 2000, all players went USB.\n\nAt the end of 1999, a company called Remote Solutions significantly broke that barrier by utilizing a laptop drive for song storage rather than low capacity flash memory. The [[Personal Jukebox]] (PJB-100) had 4.8GB, which held about 1,200 songs, and invented what would be called the jukebox segment of digital music portables. This segment eventually became the dominant type of digital music player.\n\nAlso at the end of 1999 the first in-dash MP3 player appeared. The [[Empeg Car]] and Rio Car (renamed after it was acquired by SONICblue and added to its Rio line of MP3 products) offered players in several capacities ranging from 5GB to 28GB. The unit didn't catch on as SONICblue had hoped, though, and was discontinued in the fall of 2001.\n\nThere are several types of MP3 players:\n* Devices that play [[Compact disc|CDs]]. Often, they can be used to play both audio CDs and homemade data CDs containing MP3 or other digital audio files.\n* Pocket devices. These are solid-state devices that hold digital audio files on internal or external media, such as [[memory card]]s. These are generally low-storage devices, typically ranging from 128MB to 1GB, which can often be extended with additional memory. As they are solid state and do not have moving parts, they can be very resilient. Such players are generally integrated into USB [[keydrive]]s.\n* Devices that read digital audio files from a [[hard drive]]. These players have higher capacities, ranging from 1.5GB to 100GB, depending on the hard drive technology. At typical encoding rates, this means that thousands of songs\u2014perhaps an entire music collection\u2014can be stored in one MP3 player. Apple's popular [[iPod]] player is the best-known example.\n\n==Equipment==\nGenerally speaking, MP3 players are portable, employing internal or replaceable [[Electric battery|batteries]] and [[headphones]], and may be connected to [[Vehicle audio|car]] and home [[High fidelity|stereos]] via a [[wireless]] connection such as [[bluetooth]]. Some MP3 players also include [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[Tuner (radio)|radio tuners]].\n\nMany MP3 players can [[data compression|encode]] directly to MP3 or other digital audio format directly from a line in audio signal (radio, voice, etc.).\n\nDevices such as [[CD player]]s can be connected to the MP3 player (using the USB port) in order to directly play music from the memory of the player without the use of a computer.\n\n[[Modular]] MP3 [[keydrive]] players are composed of two [[wiktionary:detachable|detachable]] parts: the head (or reader/writer) and the body (the memory). They can be independently obtained and upgradable (one can change the head or the body; i.e. to add more memory).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Compact disc]]\n* [[High fidelity]]\n* [[Home cinema]]\n* [[ID3]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n[[Category:Digital audio]]\n[[Category:South Korean inventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Electronic device that can play digital audio files}}\n{{Distinguish|MP4 player}}\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2016}}\n[[Image:Usb mp3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[Creative MuVo]] (2002\u20132009), a small solid-state MP3 player in a USB Flashdrive form-factor]]\n\nAn '''MP3 player''' is an electronic device that can play [[MP3]] [[digital audio]] files.

Nimbuzz made Skype available to [[BlackBerry]] users and Fring provided mobile video calling over Skype as well as support for the Android platform.

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

It is then edited and broadcast first on Friday evening at 18:30, then repeated on the Saturday lunchtime. The final 28 minute show is significantly shorter than the original recording.  In 2012 the BBC began making an extended version for [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]].\n\nEach week, four panellists appear on the show. They are usually either [[comedian]]s or [[journalists]], and sometimes [[politicians]]. Journalists predominated in the early years. The ostensible purpose of the show is to test contestants' knowledge of the events of the previous week by asking questions which are usually oblique references to those events.  However this has given way to a general free-for-all where panellists chime in with their own humorous and satirical remarks once the question has been answered. The participants frequently wander off topic. The host ends the discussion of each question with a summary of the events it refers to, usually with a scripted comic punchline, before asking the next question. It is not uncommon for the show to get through only two rounds of the panel before the final section is reached. Before the host announces the largely symbolic scores, the panellists read out statements from newspapers and other media which they find amusing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/radio/the_news_quiz/|title=The News Quiz -

It is then edited and broadcast first on Friday evening at 18:30, then repeated on the Saturday lunchtime. The final 28 minute show is significantly shorter than the original recording.  In 2012 the BBC began making an extended version for [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]].\n\nEach week, four panellists appear on the show. They are usually either [[comedian]]s or [[journalists]], and sometimes [[politicians]]. Journalists predominated in the early years. The ostensible purpose of the show is to test contestants' knowledge of the events of the previous week by asking questions which are usually oblique references to those events.  However this has given way to a general free-for-all where panellists chime in with their own humorous and satirical remarks once the question has been answered. The participants frequently wander off topic. The host ends the discussion of each question with a summary of the events it refers to, usually with a scripted comic punchline, before asking the next question. It is not uncommon for the show to get through only two rounds of the panel before the final section is reached. Before the host announces the largely symbolic scores, the panellists read out statements from newspapers and other media which they find amusing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/radio/the_news_quiz/|title=The News Quiz -

Every year is made up of two musical seasons starting in February and September. Each culminates in a large London concert and the choir have performed in venues such as Cadogan Hall, Hackney Empire, The Troxy.<ref>http://www.pinksingers.co.uk/tickets/</ref> The choir also undertakes multiple public and private performances<ref>http://www.pinksingers.co.uk/category/see-hear/</ref> at large events, campaigns, corporate events, weddings and civil partnerships.<ref>http://www.pinksingers.co.uk/hire-us/</ref>\n\nEach season starts with anyone with an interest in joining being invited to try out a few rehearsals so they can feel the social as well as musical make up of the choir, which is then followed by an audition. The Pink Singers are a fully mixed choir of varying abilities, ages, genders, and offer all members an opportunity to either learn new, or further develop existing musical abilities over a wide variety of genres and styles.\n\nThe choice of music sung by the choir is as eclectic as the membership makeup itself, everything from pop to classical to jazz, folk and show tunes. Variety in a single show can range from [[Elgar]] to [[Ellie Goulding]], or from [[Mozart]] to [[Massive Attack]]. There are multiple choreographed numbers each season also, adding a visual spectacle to the musical.\n\n==Structure==\nThe choir's singing members are split across 8 voices, upper and lower registers each for [[Soprano]], [[Alto]], [[Tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]] sections respectively. This vocal range gives the choir great flexibility in musical pieces tackled over the years, from simple 2 part harmonies through to full 12 part splits when including semi-chorus parts.\n\nMusical seasons in the past few years have all had a theme for the final concert. Choir members offer up fresh themes each season, which are decided on by a musical team made up of both paid and volunteer members, led by the Musical and Artistic Directors who also run each rehearsal.\n\nThe Pink Singers is a registered UK [[Charitable organization|charity]] (1151365)<ref>http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/</ref> and is run entirely through a volunteer committee. The choir also employs the professional support of a Musical Director and a trained accompanist.\n\n==Historic overview==\nThe choir was founded by [[Brian Kennedy (journalist)|Brian Kennedy]] and [http://www.markbunyan.com Mark Bunyan] in 1983. Kennedy, author of ''Kennedy's Gay Guide to London'' was inspired by the large gay choruses which had taken off in the USA. He persuaded Bunyan, a cabaret artiste making a name for himself, to take the reins of the musical direction for the first few months. The first public performance was at [[Pride London|London Pride]] in 1983.<ref>Mark Bunyan's speech at the 25th anniversary concert</ref> The LGBT landscape in the UK then was substantially different to today: the age of consent was unequal, AIDS had barely reached the political agenda, Britain had not yet had appointed an openly gay MP, and any form of legally-recognised partnership between same-sex couples seemed like a pipe dream. The choir was established to be a counterpart to the choruses which had emerged in the US and one of its first actions was to provide music at that year's Lesbian & Gay Pride march, in support of the political changes happening at the time.\n\nAs more freedoms and rights have been granted to LGBT individuals and partners the principal aims of the choir have also evolved, which were codified when the choir became a UK charity:\n* To promote, improve, develop and maintain appreciation of and education of the public, in particular but not exclusively the LGBT community, in the art and science of music in all its aspects by any means the management committee sees fit, including through the presentation of public concerts and recitals to the highest possible standard.\n* To promote equality and diversity for the public benefit with particular reference to the LGBT community and in particular but not exclusively by:\n# advancing education and raising awareness in equality and diversity;\n# promoting activities to foster understanding between people from diverse backgrounds;\n# cultivating a sentiment in favour of equality and diversity in particular through celebrating the diversity of the LGBT community.\n\nUnder these aims the Pink Singers have performed all over the constituent countries of the UK, as well as in the past in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Iceland]], [[Portugal]], [[Finland]], [[Mallorca]], [[Greece]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]] the [[United States]] & [[India]]. As the longest running LGBT choir in Europe the Pink Singers have also built up long lasting relationships with other LGBT choirs and choruses worldwide, and has been instrumental in helping smaller UK based choirs grow and develop. The Pink Singers have in the past been joint hosts of the Various Voices choral festival<ref>http://www.pinksingers.co.uk/blog/2009/05/12/various-voices-2009-london-sings-out</ref> and as part of the choir's 30th anniversary celebrations held a full day festival and concert for 17 of the UK's LGBT music groups, 'Hand in Hand'.<ref>http://30.pinksingers.co.uk/</ref>\n\n==Online presence==\nIn addition to its website, The Pink Singers has a wide online presence with a Twitter account [https://twitter.com/pinksingers @pinksingers], Instagram [https://instagram.com/pinksingers @pinksingers] YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/user/pinksingers/featured channel], Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/pinksingers fan page] and flickr [https://www.flickr.com/photos/pinksingers/ photo albums].\n\nThe Pink Singers is a member of the UK network of choirs, [http://uk-ireland.proudvoices.org  Proud Voices]. As part of their ongoing work to help spread and grow the tradition of LGBT choral music the Pink Singers were instrumental in setting up a sister organisation, [http://asia.proudvoices.org  Proud Voices Asia], who hosted Asia's first ever LGBT choral festival in 2015.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===By Special Arrangement (2016)===\n\nAll tracks on ''By Special Arrangement'' were arranged by past or present choir members.

The first Hand in Hand was held at The Troxy in east London. It brought members of 23 LGBT choirs from Britain and Ireland together to take part in musical workshops. Twelve choirs performed in the evening concert. The Pink Singers debuted 'The Great Choir of London', a two-part composition that was written for them by [[Richard Thomas (musician)|Richard Thomas]]. The Pink Singers opened the festival by performing the first part, '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2DBnp-X32s I, Choir]', alone. The second part, 'Earth, Wind and Choir' was sung by all of the choirs taking part in the festival.\n\nThe second Hand in Hand festival was hosted in Brighton 12\u201314 June 2015, jointly hosted by [http://www.brightongmc.org/ Brighton Gay Men's Chorus] and the [http://www.rainbowchorus.org.uk/ Rainbow Chorus]. In 2017 Hand in Hand was hosted by the [http://mlgc.org.uk/ Manchester Lesbian and Gay Chorus]. The 4th Hand in Hand festival was held in Cardiff in August 2019, hosted by the South Wales Gay Men's Chorus and the Songbirds.\n\nThe festival title references the song, 'Hand in Hand', composed by Dawn Rogers and Tricia Walker. Hand in Hand is almost certainly the Pink Singers\u2019 most frequently performed song. On their second trip to the US in 1992, they were invited to take part in the GALA Choruses Festival in Denver. At the Festival, the Tampa Bay Gay Men's Chorus closed their set with 'Hand In Hand' \u2013 that was the first time the choir had heard it \u2013 and they sang it jointly with them the next time they returned to the US, to Florida in 1996. They used it as the title of their first CD and performed it at the Memorial Service for the victims of the Admiral Duncan bombing in 1999. When Pride London was set up in 2004, they opened and closed the Trafalgar Square rally with it.<ref>Information taken from the Pink Singers' programme from their 30th anniversary concert, 'P.S.

Every year is made up of two musical seasons starting in February and September. Each culminates in a large London concert and the choir have performed in venues such as Cadogan Hall, Hackney Empire,The Troxy.<ref>http://www.pinksingers.co.uk/tickets/</ref> The choir also undertakes multiple public and private performances<ref>http://www.pinksingers.co.uk/category/see-hear/</ref> at large events, campaigns, corporate events, weddings and civil partnerships.<ref>http://www.pinksingers.co.uk/hire-us/</ref>\n\nEach season starts with anyone with an interest in joining being invited to try out a few rehearsals so they can feel the social as well as musical make up of the choir, which is then followed by an audition. The Pink Singers are a fully mixed choir of varying abilities, ages, genders, and offer all members an opportunity to either learn new, or further develop existing musical abilities over a wide variety of genres and styles.\n\nThe choice of music sung by the choir is as eclectic as the membership makeup itself, everything from pop to classical to jazz, folk and show tunes. Variety in a single show can range from [[Elgar]] to [[Ellie Goulding]], or from [[Mozart]] to [[Massive Attack]]. There are multiple choreographed numbers each season also, adding a visual spectacle to the musical.\n\n==Structure==\nThe choir's singing members are split across 8 voices, upper and lower registers each for [[Soprano]], [[Alto]], [[Tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]] sections respectively. This vocal range gives the choir great flexibility in musical pieces tackled over the years, from simple 2 part harmonies through to full 12 part splits when including semi-chorus parts.\n\nMusical seasons in the past few years have all had a theme for the final concert. Choir members offer up fresh themes each season, which are decided on by a musical team made up of both paid and volunteer members, led by the Musical and Artistic Directors who also run each rehearsal.\n\nThe Pink Singers is a registered UK [[Charitable organization|charity]] (1151365)<ref>http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/</ref> and is run entirely through a volunteer committee. The choir also employs the professional support of a Musical Director and a trained accompanist.\n\n==Historic overview==\nThe choir was founded by [[Brian Kennedy (journalist)|Brian Kennedy]] and [http://www.markbunyan.com Mark Bunyan] in 1983. Kennedy, author of ''Kennedy's Gay Guide to London'' was inspired by the large gay choruses which had taken off in the USA. He persuaded Bunyan, a cabaret artiste making a name for himself, to take the reins of the musical direction for the first few months. The first public performance was at [[Pride London|London Pride]] in 1983.<ref>Mark Bunyan's speech at the 25th anniversary concert</ref> The LGBT landscape in the UK then was substantially different to today: the age of consent was unequal, AIDS had barely reached the political agenda, Britain had not yet had appointed an openly gay MP, and any form of legally-recognised partnership between same-sex couples seemed like a pipe dream. The choir was established to be a counterpart to the choruses which had emerged in the USA and one of its first actions was to provide music at that year\u2019s Lesbian & Gay Pride march, in support of the political changes happening at the time.\n\nAs more freedoms and rights have been granted to LGBT individuals and partners the principal aims of the choir have also evolved, which were codified when the choir became a UK charity:\n* To promote, improve, develop and maintain appreciation of and education of the public, in particular but not exclusively the LGBT community, in the art and science of music in all its aspects by any means the management committee sees fit, including through the presentation of public concerts and recitals to the highest possible standard.\n* To promote equality and diversity for the public benefit with particular reference to the LGBT community and in particular but not exclusively by:\n# advancing education and raising awareness in equality and diversity;\n# promoting activities to foster understanding between people from diverse backgrounds;\n# cultivating a sentiment in favour of equality and diversity in particular through celebrating the diversity of the LGBT community.\n\nUnder these aims the Pink Singers have performed all over the constituent countries of the UK, as well as in the past in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Iceland]], [[Portugal]], [[Finland]], [[Mallorca]], [[Greece]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]] the [[United States]] & [[India]]. As the longest running LGBT choir in Europe the Pink Singers have also built up long lasting relationships with other LGBT choirs and choruses worldwide, and has been instrumental in helping smaller UK based choirs grow and develop.

The first Hand in Hand was held at The Troxy in east London. It brought members of 23 LGBT choirs from Britain and Ireland together to take part in musical workshops. Twelve choirs performed in the evening concert. The Pink Singers debuted 'The Great Choir of London', a two-part composition that was written for them by [[Richard Thomas (musician)|Richard Thomas]]. The Pink Singers opened the festival by performing the first part, '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2DBnp-X32s I, Choir]', alone. The second part, 'Earth, Wind and Choir' was sung by all of the choirs taking part in the festival.\n\nThe second Hand in Hand festival was hosted in Brighton 12\u201314 June 2015, jointly hosted by [http://www.brightongmc.org/ Brighton Gay Men's Chorus] and the [http://www.rainbowchorus.org.uk/ Rainbow Chorus]. In 2017 Hand in Hand was hosted by the [http://mlgc.org.uk/ Manchester Lesbian and Gay Chorus]. The 4th Hand in Hand festival was held in Cardiff in August 2019, hosted by the South Wales Gay Men's Chorus and the Songbirds.\n\nThe festival title references the song, 'Hand in Hand', composed by Dawn Rogers and Tricia Walker. Hand in Hand is almost certainly the Pink Singers\u2019 most frequently performed song. On their second trip to the USA in 1992, they were invited to take part in the GALA Choruses Festival in Denver. At the Festival, the Tampa Bay Gay Men\u2019s Chorus closed their set with 'Hand In Hand' \u2013 that was the first time the choir had heard it \u2013 and they sang it jointly with them the next time they returned to the USA, to Florida in 1996. They used it as the title of their first CD and performed it at the Memorial Service for the victims of the Admiral Duncan bombing in 1999. When Pride London was set up in 2004, they opened and closed the Trafalgar Square rally with it.<ref>Information taken from the Pink Singers' programme from their 30th anniversary concert, 'P.S.
