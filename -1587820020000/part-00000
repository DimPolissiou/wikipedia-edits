The 1992 Super NES version of the game shows the characters heading back towards the Twin Towers in the ending cutscene.\n* ''[[Streets of Rage]]'', a game released in 1991 on the [[Sega Genesis]], features at the end credits the Twin Towers in the background of the final boss battle, which occurs in one of the buildings surrounding the towers.\n* ''[[Two Crude]]'' (1991) was a beat 'em up set in NYC in the year '2010 AD'. The Twin Towers are depicted in the intro about a post-apocalyptic New York in control by a criminal gang with bio hazard weapons plus are a focal point in the start screen.\n* ''[[Streets of Rage 2]]'' (1992), sequel to ''[[Streets of Rage]]'', features the World Trade Center in the opening scene of the game.\n* ''[[King of the Monsters 2]]'' (1992) for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] has the Twin Towers in the first level, there is a bonus for destroying them.\n* ''[[Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (video game)|''Cadillacs and Dinosaurs'' (arcade game)]]'' (1993) The game begins with a panoramic view of New York in the year 2513 about where you can see the World Trade Center in the background.\n* The 1993 arcade game ''Zero Team'' features the World Trade Center at the end of the first level.\n* In ''[[Aero Fighters 2]]'' (1994) for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]], the first half of the U.S. level takes place in New York City, featuring the World Trade Center in the background. The player is able to destroy the buildings, along with all others in New York City.\n* The 1994 action game ''[[Urban Strike]]'', the third in the [[Strike (video game series)|''Strike'' series]], features a scene where a giant [[laser]] deflects from a [[satellite]], hitting the World Trade Center's Twin Towers.  Further missions take place involving the effects of this, at the World Trade Center.  Ironically, the game takes place in a fictional/alternate 2001 timeline.\n* ''[[Tekken 2]]'' (1995) for the [[Arcade game|arcade]] and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] features the World Trade Center in Paul Phoenix's stage.\n* ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'' (1998), set within [[Manhattan]] and making direct remarks to areas such as [[Central Park]], features 1 and 2 World Trade Center in its opening FMV shot, as the camera slowly pulls out of a close-up of the [[Statue of Liberty]].<ref>http://i.imgur.com/KuJGK7C.png</ref>\n* In the 1998 [[Nintendo 64]] game ''[[Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA]]'', the entire World Trade Center complex is featured on the 'New York: Downtown' track. Buildings 1\u20136, and the western pedestrian bridge are all accessible to drive around. The stairways on both sides of the complex double as jumps for the racers.\n* The 1999 PC game ''[[Sim City 3000]]'' features the North and South Towers as buildable landmarks. Both towers appear to be the South Tower, however, as both have the South Tower's observation deck, and the North Tower lacks the antenna.\n* In ''[[Hybrid Heaven]]'' (1999), for the [[Nintendo 64]], in the main title screen, it shows the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] at [[New York City]] at night time.\n* ''[[Driver (video game)|Driver]]'' (1999) features 1 and 2 World Trade Center, and [[The Sphere]], in its depiction of New York \u2013 the final city unlocked.  On \"Take a Ride\" mode, the player starts on a road just south of (and facing) the South Tower. On original issues of the game, the box art showed the twin towers. In later issues of the game released after 9/11, the twin towers were removed from the box art.\n* The Twin Towers appear briefly in the first level of the arcade video game ''[[18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker]]'' (2000). The [[PlayStation 2]] version, released after September 11, 2001, has the towers omitted.\n* The first level of the 2000 video game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', set in 2052, encompasses [[Liberty Island]] and a bombed [[Statue of Liberty]]. The section of the New York City skyline containing the Twin Towers is absent, to reduce memory requirements for the map. The reason that the developers gave, if anyone asked, was that they had been destroyed by terrorists: ''\"We just said that the Towers had been destroyed too, and this was way before 9/11\u2026 years. That's kind of freaky.\"''<ref>[http://pc.ign.com/articles/386/386515p3.html IGN: DX: Visible Interview]</ref>\n* ''[[Midnight Club: Street Racing]]'' (2000) features the entire complex, where players can drive into the Austin Tobin Plaza in between the Twin Towers. They can also gain access to the underground parking garage beneath the World Trade Center (the site of the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|February 26, 1993 bombing]]).\n* Shortly after the attacks, the now defunct [[Westwood Studios]] pulled all remaining copies of the 2000 [[real-time strategy]] game ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2]]'', whose box contained artwork of New York City under attack by invading Soviet forces; notable landmarks depicted under attack included the World Trade Center and the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The single player campaign of the game also contains a pair of missions in which the player was instructed to destroy [[The Pentagon]] and capture the World Trade Center as well as being able to destroy it.  Westwood retooled the box art before re-releasing the game.<ref name=\"hr-09192001\"/>\n* ''[[Propeller Arena]]'' (2001) was a cancelled Dreamcast aerial dogfight game, since leaked on the internet, that features a Twin Towers style building.\n* ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' (2001) features the World Trade Center in several billboards for the fictional company \"Aesir\" and during the graphic novel cutscenes. They are also visible in the background in the beginning of the mission \"The American Dream\". The buildings were visible in the PC version of the game, however they were removed from the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] ports of the game, which were released in December 2001.\n* In ''Trade Center Defender'' (2001), a [[flash game|flash]]-[[arcade game]] released on September 12, 2001, players had to [[Shoot 'em up|shoot down]] planes that were heading towards the towers. If an aircraft managed to get through the buildings, the towers would pulverize. On September 13, the game was removed from sale over the internet. [[Lycos]] apologized for the game and pulled it from [[Angelfire]] arcade.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/sep/13/games.terrorismandthemedia Microsoft game taken off shelves]</ref> By late September, the game was [[Video game remake|remade]] by a French website ''Uzinagaz'' and was titled ''New York Defender''. Unlike in the original game, the burning towers in the remake were made to look more realistic and similar to how they were destroyed during the actual disaster. ''New York Defender'' can still be found today in arcade and flash gaming websites.<ref name=\"Jahn-SudmannStockmann2008\">{{cite book|author1=A. Jahn-Sudmann|author2=R.

The level involved battling Hyper-[[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and the antenna atop the North Tower was crucial in defeating the villain.  The game was originally released in North America on August 26, 2001, though the game was pulled after the attacks and re-released on October 17, 2001, with a modified final stage so that the buildings less resemble the Twin Towers.<ref name=\"hr-09192001\">{{cite news |title=Game makers blot out signs of WTC tragedy |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=September 19, 2001}}</ref>  The [[PAL region|PAL]] version of the game was never released prior to the attacks.\n* In response to the events of September 11, [[Microsoft]] announced that future versions of ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'' would not include the Twin Towers in the game's [[New York City]] skyline. A patch was also made available to remove the World Trade Center buildings from the existing versions of the simulator.<ref name=\"hr-09192001\"/>\n* In ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' (2001), it is believed the World Trade Center was to make an appearance. Due to the city (Liberty City) being based on New York and the game being intended to be released in the fall of 2001, the game at one time may have contained the World Trade Center. It was reported that the World Trade Center was entirely deleted, flight paths in game for the scripted plane AI were altered to fly farther away from the downtown area, and a mission ark and character involving terrorism was removed. Users on a GTA forum online were able to conclude that the World Trade Center was once occupying the \"Love Media Building\"`s site, but that it was replaced with a new unrelated tower.\n* The 2004 video game ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'', the game adaptation of the film, features a virtual Manhattan which included a large plaza, bearing resemblance to the [[Tribute in Light]] memorial, on the World Trade Center site.\n* The 2005 video game ''[[True Crime: New York City]]'' features a fenced-off \"Ground Zero\".\n* In ''[[Tycoon City: New York]]'' (2006), the World Trade Center is paid tribute to in the form of two very tall trees standing side by side, representing the Towers. Further into the park, there is a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]-shaped base, with the [[American flag]] at half mast. An inscription on the side reads ''We Will Never Forget''.\n* ''[[Driver: Parallel Lines]]'' (2006) features a slightly modified World Trade Center complex in the game's depiction of New York City in 1978, lacking the [[Marriott World Trade Center (hotel)|Marriott World Trade Center hotel]] and [[7 World Trade Center]] (since both were completed in the 1980s).  The complex also features ''[[The Sphere]]'' sculpture, though unlike the real World Trade Center, a road divides the complex in two.  In the latter half of the game, set in 2006, the entire area is replaced by a fenced-off building site.\n* In ''[[World in Conflict]]'' (2007), the teaser trailer for the game prominently features the [[skyline of New York City]] during a U.S. Ranger assault on Governor's Island, which has been occupied by the Soviets in an alternate timeline in which the [[Cold War]] culminates into [[World War III]] between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]]. The game is set in an alternate 1989, 12 years before 9/11. In the tenth level, \"Liberty Lost\", the World Trade Center is featured prominently in the background during the player's efforts to recapture Governor's, Ellis, and Liberty Islands.\n\n==See also==\n* [[7 World Trade Center]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Film and Television After 9/11 |author=Dixon, Wheeler Winston |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8093-2556-X}}\n* {{cite book |title=Celluloid Skyline: New York and the Movies |author=Sanders, James |publisher=Knopf |year=2001 |isbn=0-394-57062-6}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.celluloidskyline.com/main/home.html Celluloid Skyline], [[James Sanders (architect)|James Sanders]]\n* [http://jerz.setonhill.edu/design/WTC/index.html World Trade Center \u2013 Literary and Cultural Reflections], Dennis G.

An iconic feature of the [[List of buildings in New York City|New York City]] skyline for nearly three decades, the World Trade Center has been featured in cartoons, comic books, computer games, video games, television, films, photographs, artwork and music videos.\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Books===\n* In [[Richard Martin Stern]]'s novel ''[[The Tower (novel)|The Tower]]'' (1973), a breeches buoy line shot from a helicopter is used to link the World Trade Center North Tower and the fictional World Tower Building.

The World Trade Center complex was featured in numerous other comics, as well.\n* In 1985 ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #189 continued the alternate vision of the future first seen in the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' storyline. [[Rachel Summers]] (who came from the future), while describing the dire future of the early 21st century, says \"The Twin Towers of World Trade Center lie in ruins. Thousands are dead, many more injured\". The accompanying image is of a somewhat futuristic Twin Towers smouldering after having been hit by an unknown attack.\n* The 1986 [[graphic novel]] ''Rebel,'' by [[Pepe Moreno]], depicted the two towers being destroyed in a post-apocalyptic 2002 setting.\n* In the 1989 ''[[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]]'', the Twin Towers were damaged when a giant robot fell on them. Damage Control, a construction company that specialized in repairing [[superhero]]-related damage, had the towers repaired (although visibly crooked) by the end of the issue.\n* In the 1992 [[Mort & Phil]] comic ''El 35 aniversario'' (The 35th Anniversary) appears an image of a plane that crashes into the WTC.<ref name=\"DarkRoasted\">''[http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2007/09/september-11-premonitions.html September 11 Premonitions]'', ''Dark Roasted Blend'' (blog), September 10, 2007.</ref>\n* ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #596 was coincidentally released one day after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

Homer, desperately needing to use the restroom, pushes people out of his way to get a ticket to the elevator into the towers. After pushing other people out of the elevator line to get to the top of the South Tower, Homer discovers the only working bathroom is in the North Tower. Also in the episode, two men in opposite towers begin arguing with each other, and one proclaims \"Sorry, they put all the jerks in Tower One\", a line which the show's creators expressed deep regret at during the post-9/11 episode commentary on the season 9 box set. This episode has been banned in many countries (including some American affiliates around the time of the 9/11 attacks, though others have aired the episode with many edits to remove the scenes and verbal references to the World Trade Center), but is included in the season 9 box set. Some [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates continue to show the episode in syndication, including New York City's own [[WNYW|WNYW Fox 5]], airing the unaltered episode less than two weeks after the towers collapsed.\n** In the episode \"[[New Kids on the Blecch]]\", the towers can be seen as L.T Smash steers a battleship into New York Harbor intending to blow up MAD Magazine.

During the musical, Peter jumps off one of the towers and goes into match cut, singing with ''T Series''.\n** In the episode \"[[Baby Not on Board]]\", Peter and the family visit [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]].\n** In the 2002 episode \"[[Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows]]\", Brian performs a musical number to Pearl about how America has changed since the 1950s. Many cut scenes show places around the United States, including a shot of the Twin Towers. When the episode aired in 2002 on Fox, the two towers were digitally altered to look like generic buildings. Other airings of this episode (including the DVD release of ''Family Guy'''s third season) have shown the Twin Towers intact.\n** In the episode \"[[Hannah Banana]]\", the September 11 attacks are seen as an Islamic man crashing a bicycle into one of the Twin Towers.\n** In the episode \"[[Back to the Pilot]]\", Brian informs his past self from 1999 of the attacks on the WTC, allowing his past self to prevent them and, consequently, prevent [[George W. Bush]] from winning the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 U.S. Presidential election]]. The latter then reformed the [[Confederate States of America|confederacy]] while based in [[Texas]]; as a result, eight southern states joined and initiated a [[Second American Civil War]].\n\n===Live action television===\n* In the TV series ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1984\u20131989), the Twin Towers are seen in the background of the pilot episode \"[[Brother's Keeper (Miami Vice)|Brother's Keeper]]\" in Ricardo Tubbs' flashback. In the first episode of Season 2 \"The Prodigal Son\", the Twin Towers can be seen during the New York montage, and the shootout at the end of the episode was shot at the World Trade Center around [[The Sphere]], Crockett then chases a drug dealer down and shoots down a helicopter with the Twin Towers seen in the background. \n* In the TV sitcom ''[[Barney Miller]]''  (1975\u20131982), the Twin Towers were depicted in its intro before the opening credits from season 2 until the end of the series.\n*The exterior and interior of the Twin Towers are featured prominently, along with other New York City landmarks, in the opening montage of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' from 1987 to 1992.\n* The TV series ''[[Third Watch]]'' (1999\u20132005), set in New York, featured many shots of the Towers during the show's first 2 seasons. One final shot appeared in the episode ''September 10'', set the day before the attacks.\n* The pilot of the TV series ''[[The Lone Gunmen]]'', first aired March 4, 2001, had the gunmen thwarting a plot to fly a jet into the World Trade Center. In the episode, a faction of the U.S. government is behind the plot; they hope to blame the attack on another country's dictator and use it as an excuse to start a war with him.<ref>[http://www.insidethex.co.uk/transcrp/tlg179.htm Transcript of pilot episode]</ref>\n* In the first and second intro of ''[[Power Rangers: Time Force]]'' (2001), the Time Shadow was seen standing on the Twin Towers, just before the title of the show appears. After the events of 9/11, Fox Kids chose to remove the towers from the intro.\n* The third season of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The West Wing]]'' was postponed; instead, a special episode called \"[[The West Wing (season 3)|Isaac and Ishmael]]\" was run. The episode started with the main characters paying tribute to the victims of 9/11, and dealt mainly with terrorism.\n* In ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (2001\u20132005), an image of the Twin Towers burning was visible in a panorama of historical images present in the timestream, when Daniels informed Jonathan Archer that time had been altered and set back on course. The episode is a two-parter called \"[[Storm Front (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Storm Front]].\"\n* The 2005\u201306 Portuguese soap opera ''[[:pt:Tempo de Viver|Tempo de Viver]]'' devoted its entire first episode to a diamond heist in a South Tower corporate office. A subsequent confrontation as the would-be thief is caught is violently interrupted by Flight 11 crashing into the North Tower. The characters involved then scramble to leave the South Tower after it is also struck. Fictional footage of the attack as seen from the interior of the office was digitally created, but stock footage was also used for other scenes and later flashbacks.\n* The 2003 [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[Angels in America (miniseries)|Angels in America]]'' (which takes place in the late 1980s) is noteworthy as being the first major post-9/11 production to digitally insert the towers in the New York City skyline.\n* In a 2005 episode of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' the Twin Towers are seen out of the window of a New York solicitor's office. They were digitally inserted to show the time frame of the episode.\n* From 2007\u20132009, 7 World Trade Center's facade is used as the preface to scenes in ABC's ''[[Dirty Sexy Money]]'' for the office of Patrick \"Tripp\" Darling III.\n* Shots of New York's skyline and well known locations, including some featuring the World Trade Center, were regularly used between scenes during ''[[Friends]]''' run (1994\u20132004). Those featuring the towers were retired after the attacks.\n* On ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'':\n** During the final scene of the season one finale of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', the World Trade Center is seen intact in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] of New York City. The main character, Olivia Dunham, is revealed to be in an office in the South Tower in an alternate reality of 2009, in which the World Trade Center was not destroyed on September 11, 2001.  A newspaper headline reading \"[[Family of Barack Obama|OBAMAS]] SET TO MOVE INTO NEW WHITE HOUSE\" suggests that the [[White House]] was destroyed on September 11 in this alternate timeline instead of the Towers, and has just recently been rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web|last=McNutt|first=Myles|title=Season Finale: Fringe \u2013 There's More Than One of Everything|url=http://memles.wordpress.com/2009/05/12/season-finale-fringe-theres-more-than-one-of-everything/|publisher=Cultural Learnings|date=May 12, 2009|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}</ref>\n*** The pan shot uses both real footage and CGI. As the shot pans out, it is visually clear that the Twin Towers are CGI, as the darker \"bands\" (the Skylobbies) are not visible. After sun flashes onto the screen, the Towers are less dark and have darker \"bands.\"\n** Following that episode, the show uses the Twin Towers as a frequent point of reference to indicate when a certain scene takes place in the parallel universe.\n** 2011 \u2013 [[Peter Bishop]] appears 15 years into the future in [[Fringe (season 3)|Season 3]], standing outside of One World Trade Center.\n** From 2008\u2013present, ''Fringe'' depicts the rebuilt [[7 World Trade Center]] as the headquarters of commercial conglomerate Massive Dynamic, and the Twin Towers still standing as of 2011 ([[Fringe (season 4)|Season 4]]) in a parallel universe. Massive Dynamic was also headquartered in the World Trade Center's [[Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] in the episode \"[[Brown Betty (Fringe)|Brown Betty]]\".\n* In a first-season episode of ''[[Journeyman (TV series)|Journeyman]]'' the Twin Towers are seen in picture on the front page of a [[San Francisco]] newspaper when the main character goes back in time before the terrorist attacks.\n* ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'': in several episodes throughout the series, the World Trade Center can be seen in various stages of construction. The opening credits of Seasons 1 and 2 show both towers still under construction.  During a scene on a ferry in the season three episode titled \"A Little Plot At Tranquil Valley\", a completed North Tower and a partially constructed South Tower can be seen in the background.  The towers also appeared in the opening credits of later seasons when McCloud was carried by a helicopter across Manhattan.\n* The TV series ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'''s seventh-season episode \"Where Were You When...?\" features a quick shot of the burning towers.\n* In the first season of ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'' (2004\u20132011), the main character of [[Tommy Gavin]] has several flashbacks to 9/11, both before and after the towers fall. 9/11 is mentioned through the entire season featuring four firefighters who were lost on that day. One of them appears in almost every episode as a vision to Tommy. ''Rescue Me'' was the first TV show to show a dramatized depiction of the events of 9/11.\n* As construction of the World Trade Center progressed, it began appearing in later seasons of the [[Marlo Thomas]] series ''[[That Girl]]''.\n* In the pilot episode of [[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|the US version of ''Life on Mars'']], a shot of the Twin Towers with the upper floors still under construction is used to show the character is presumed back in time, to the year 1973.\n\n===Televised advertisements===\n* An [[Anheuser-Busch]] advertisement for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] beer features the company's signature [[Clydesdale (breed)|Clydesdale]] horses appearing to pay their respects to the tower-less New York skyline. It was aired during [[NFL on Fox|Fox Sports]]'s TV broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in 2002, as well as on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, during that day's [[National Football League]] (NFL) games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4798706279384185174 |accessdate=August 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204053156/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4798706279384185174 |archivedate=December 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The Twin Towers had appeared on the cityscape graphic that appeared on cans of [[Chock full o'Nuts]] coffee. The graphic was later revamped with the towers removed after 9/11.\n* In [[Eurosport]]'s ''Olympic Magazine'' commercial, a few seconds of the beginning of the North Tower collapse are shown.\n\n==Music==\n* The cover of the US version of the album ''[[Stars on Long Play III]]'' features a woman wearing [[3-D glasses]] in front of the towers with three stars.\n* The cover of the album ''[[Breakfast in America]]'' by [[Supertramp]] features the New York City skyline and the twin towers, portrayed as common kitchen items, from the view of an airplane window.\n* The towers feature at the beginning of the [[Spice Girls]] music video \"[[2 Become 1]]\" from 1996, with the group appearing in various locations around the city.\n* The towers were featured in [[Limp Bizkit]]'s music video \"[[Rollin' (Limp Bizkit song)|Rollin']]\" from 2000 starring the band members performing on top of the South Tower.\n* A French promotional video for [[Depeche Mode]]'s song \"[[Enjoy the Silence]]\" was filmed at the World Trade Center. The video features the members on top of the South Tower lip-syncing to the song, with views of the North Tower in the background.\n* The towers are featured in the opening shot of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s music video for the song [[Heart of Glass (song)|\"Heart of Glass\"]].\n* The towers are featured in the opening shot of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s music video for the song [[Like a Virgin (song)|\"Like a Virgin\"]].\n* The towers were featured in the closing shot of [[Demi Lovato]]'s lyric video for the song \"[[I Love Me (song)|I Love Me]]\".\n* The towers are featured in the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"[[Paradise City]]\" when band member [[Duff McKagan]] is seen taking a boat ride on the [[East River]].\n\n==Video games==\n* The [[laser disc]] arcade game ''[[Cobra Command]]'' (1984) features the Twin Towers prominently in the New York City level. It is possible for the player to crash a helicopter into one of the towers.\n* The 1988 arcade game ''[[Vigilante (video game)|Vigilante]]'' features a panoramic shot of New York City on the title screen, including the World Trade Center. This same title screen was included in the [[TurboGrafx-16]] version. In the background during gameplay is the New York skyline, including the World Trade Center's twin towers.\n* ''[[Manhunter: New York]]'' (1988) features establishing shots of the city, including the Twin Towers, still standing in an alternate future where the world is taken over by the Orbs.\n* The 1990 arcade game ''[[The Combatribes]]'' features the World Trade Center Towers on the title screen as the game's action takes place across New York.  The 1992 Super NES version of the game shows the characters heading back towards the Twin Towers in the ending cutscene.\n* ''[[Streets of Rage]]'', a game released in 1991 on the [[Sega Genesis]], features at the end credits the Twin Towers in the background of the final boss battle, which occurs in one of the buildings surrounding the towers.\n* ''[[Two Crude]]'' (1991) was a beat 'em up set in NYC in the year '2010 AD'. The Twin Towers are depicted in the intro about a post-apocalyptic New York in control by a criminal gang with bio hazard weapons plus are a focal point in the start screen.\n* ''[[Streets of Rage 2]]'' (1992), sequel to ''[[Streets of Rage]]'', features the World Trade Center in the opening scene of the game.\n* ''[[King of the Monsters 2]]'' (1992) for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] has the Twin Towers in the first level, there is a bonus for destroying them.\n* ''[[Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (video game)|''Cadillacs and Dinosaurs'' (arcade game)]]'' (1993) The game begins with a panoramic view of New York in the year 2513 about where you can see the World Trade Center in the background.\n* The 1993 arcade game ''Zero Team'' features the World Trade Center at the end of the first level.\n* In ''[[Aero Fighters 2]]'' (1994) for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]], the first half of the U.S. level takes place in New York City, featuring the World Trade Center in the background. The player is able to destroy the buildings, along with all others in New York City.\n* The 1994 action game ''[[Urban Strike]]'', the third in the [[Strike (video game series)|''Strike'' series]], features a scene where a giant [[laser]] deflects from a [[satellite]], hitting the World Trade Center's Twin Towers.  Further missions take place involving the effects of this, at the World Trade Center.  Ironically, the game takes place in a fictional/alternate 2001 timeline.\n* ''[[Tekken 2]]'' (1995) for the [[Arcade game|arcade]] and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] features the World Trade Center in Paul Phoenix's stage.\n* ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'' (1998), set within [[Manhattan]] and making direct remarks to areas such as [[Central Park]], features 1 and 2 World Trade Center in its opening FMV shot, as the camera slowly pulls out of a close-up of the [[Statue of Liberty]].<ref>http://i.imgur.com/KuJGK7C.png</ref>\n* In the 1998 [[Nintendo 64]] game ''[[Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA]]'', the entire World Trade Center complex is featured on the 'New York: Downtown' track. Buildings 1\u20136, and the western pedestrian bridge are all accessible to drive around. The stairways on both sides of the complex double as jumps for the racers.\n* The 1999 PC game ''[[Sim City 3000]]'' features the North and South Towers as buildable landmarks. Both towers appear to be the South Tower, however, as both have the South Tower's observation deck, and the North Tower lacks the antenna.\n* In ''[[Hybrid Heaven]]'' (1999), for the [[Nintendo 64]], in the main title screen, it shows the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] at [[New York City]] at night time.\n* ''[[Driver (video game)|Driver]]'' (1999) features 1 and 2 World Trade Center, and [[The Sphere]], in its depiction of New York \u2013 the final city unlocked.  On \"Take a Ride\" mode, the player starts on a road just south of (and facing) the South Tower. On original issues of the game, the box art showed the twin towers. In later issues of the game released after 9/11, the twin towers were removed from the box art.\n* The Twin Towers appear briefly in the first level of the arcade video game ''[[18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker]]'' (2000). The [[PlayStation 2]] version, released after September 11, 2001, has the towers omitted.\n* The first level of the 2000 video game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', set in 2052, encompasses [[Liberty Island]] and a bombed [[Statue of Liberty]]. The section of the New York City skyline containing the Twin Towers is absent, to reduce memory requirements for the map. The reason that the developers gave, if anyone asked, was that they had been destroyed by terrorists: ''\"We just said that the Towers had been destroyed too, and this was way before 9/11\u2026 years. That's kind of freaky.\"''<ref>[http://pc.ign.com/articles/386/386515p3.html IGN: DX: Visible Interview]</ref>\n* ''[[Midnight Club: Street Racing]]'' (2000) features the entire complex, where players can drive into the Austin Tobin Plaza in between the Twin Towers. They can also gain access to the underground parking garage beneath the World Trade Center (the site of the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|February 26, 1993 bombing]]).\n* Shortly after the attacks, the now defunct [[Westwood Studios]] pulled all remaining copies of the 2000 [[real-time strategy]] game ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2]]'', whose box contained artwork of New York City under attack by invading Soviet forces; notable landmarks depicted under attack included the World Trade Center and the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The single player campaign of the game also contains a pair of missions in which the player was instructed to destroy [[The Pentagon]] and capture the World Trade Center as well as being able to destroy it.  Westwood retooled the box art before re-releasing the game.<ref name=\"hr-09192001\"/>\n* ''[[Propeller Arena]]'' (2001) was a cancelled Dreamcast aerial dogfight game, since leaked on the internet, that features a Twin Towers style building.\n* ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' (2001) features the World Trade Center in several billboards for the fictional company \"Aesir\" and during the graphic novel cutscenes. They are also visible in the background in the beginning of the mission \"The American Dream\". The buildings were visible in the PC version of the game, however they were removed from the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] ports of the game, which were released in December 2001.\n* In ''Trade Center Defender'' (2001), a [[flash game|flash]]-[[arcade game]] released on September 12, 2001, players had to [[Shoot 'em up|shoot down]] planes that were heading towards the towers. If an aircraft managed to get through the buildings, the towers would pulverize. On September 13, the game was removed from sale over the internet. [[Lycos]] apologized for the game and pulled it from [[Angelfire]] arcade.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/sep/13/games.terrorismandthemedia Microsoft game taken off shelves]</ref> By late September, the game was [[Video game remake|remade]] by a French website ''Uzinagaz'' and was titled ''New York Defender''. Unlike in the original game, the burning towers in the remake were made to look more realistic and similar to how they were destroyed during the actual disaster. ''New York Defender'' can still be found today in arcade and flash gaming websites.<ref name=\"Jahn-SudmannStockmann2008\">{{cite book|author1=A. Jahn-Sudmann|author2=R.

The building was cut from the game, delaying both games' releases.<ref name=\"hr-09192001\"/>\n* ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'' (2001), featured the roofs of both towers in the final stage.  The level involved battling Hyper-[[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and the antenna atop the North Tower was crucial in defeating the villain.  The game was originally released in North America on August 26, 2001, though the game was pulled after the attacks and re-released on October 17, 2001, with a modified final stage so that the buildings less resemble the Twin Towers.<ref name=\"hr-09192001\">{{cite news |title=Game makers blot out signs of WTC tragedy |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=September 19, 2001}}</ref>  The [[PAL region|PAL]] version of the game was never released prior to the attacks.\n* In response to the events of September 11, [[Microsoft]] announced that future versions of ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'' would not include the Twin Towers in the game's [[New York City]] skyline. A patch was also made available to remove the World Trade Center buildings from the existing versions of the simulator.<ref name=\"hr-09192001\"/>\n* In ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' (2001), it is believed the World Trade Center was to make an appearance. Due to the city (Liberty City) being based on New York and the game being intended to be released in the fall of 2001, the game at one time may have contained the World Trade Center. It was reported that the World Trade Center was entirely deleted, flight paths in game for the scripted plane AI were altered to fly farther away from the downtown area, and a mission ark and character involving terrorism was removed. Users on a GTA forum online were able to conclude that the World Trade Center was once occupying the \"Love Media Building\"`s site, but that it was replaced with a new unrelated tower.\n* The 2004 video game ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'', the game adaptation of the film, features a virtual Manhattan which included a large plaza, bearing resemblance to the [[Tribute in Light]] memorial, on the World Trade Center site.\n* The 2005 video game ''[[True Crime: New York City]]'' features a fenced-off \"Ground Zero\".\n* In ''[[Tycoon City: New York]]'' (2006), the World Trade Center is paid tribute to in the form of two very tall trees standing side by side, representing the Towers. Further into the park, there is a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]-shaped base, with the [[American flag]] at half mast. An inscription on the side reads ''We Will Never Forget''.\n* ''[[Driver: Parallel Lines]]'' (2006) features a slightly modified World Trade Center complex in the game's depiction of New York City in 1978, lacking the [[Marriott World Trade Center (hotel)|Marriott World Trade Center hotel]] and [[7 World Trade Center]] (since both were completed in the 1980s).  The complex also features ''[[The Sphere]]'' sculpture, though unlike the real World Trade Center, a road divides the complex in two.  In the latter half of the game, set in 2006, the entire area is replaced by a fenced-off building site.\n* In ''[[World in Conflict]]'' (2007), the teaser trailer for the game prominently features the [[skyline of New York City]] during a U.S. Ranger assault on Governor's Island, which has been occupied by the Soviets in an alternate timeline in which the [[Cold War]] culminates into [[World War III]] between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]]. The game is set in an alternate 1989, 12 years before 9/11. In the tenth level, \"Liberty Lost\", the World Trade Center is featured prominently in the background during the player's efforts to recapture Governor's, Ellis, and Liberty Islands.\n\n==See also==\n* [[7 World Trade Center]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Film and Television After 9/11 |author=Dixon, Wheeler Winston |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8093-2556-X}}\n* {{cite book |title=Celluloid Skyline: New York and the Movies |author=Sanders, James |publisher=Knopf |year=2001 |isbn=0-394-57062-6}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.celluloidskyline.com/main/home.html Celluloid Skyline], [[James Sanders (architect)|James Sanders]]\n* [http://jerz.setonhill.edu/design/WTC/index.html World Trade Center \u2013 Literary and Cultural Reflections], Dennis G.
