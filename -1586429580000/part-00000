He previously managed [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] from November 2018 to August 2019. A [[centre back]], he had a 20-year career playing in the [[Premier League]] and an 11-year international career with the [[England national football team|England national team]].\n\nBorn in [[North East (London sub region)|east London]] to Jamaican parents, Campbell began his career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in December 1992. He spent nine years at Spurs, scoring 10 goals in 255 appearances, and [[captain (association football)|captaining]] the team to victory in the [[1999 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. In 2001, he joined Tottenham's [[North London derby|North London rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a free transfer, and as a result has remained a deeply unpopular figure amongst Spurs supporters. In his five years and 195 appearances at Arsenal, he won two Premier League winners medals and two [[FA Cup]] winners medals, encompassing the 2001\u201302 league and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|double]], and being part of the team that became known as ''[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]'' for their undefeated [[2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season|2003\u201304 Premier League campaign]]. He scored Arsenal's only goal in their 2\u20131 defeat to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. In August 2006, he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a free transfer. His three years with the club included captaining them to victory in the [[2008 FA Cup Final]]. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he made the surprise move of dropping down three levels of the [[English football league system|English football pyramid]] to join League Two side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on a free transfer. He left the club by mutual consent in September 2009, having played just one match for the club. The next year, he made a brief return to Arsenal before ending his career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nHaving already won caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21s]] and [[England national football B team|England B team]], Campbell gained his first of 73 full caps for England aged 21. In May 1998, Campbell became what was then England's second-youngest captain, after [[Bobby Moore]], aged 23 years 248 days. In 2006, he became the only player to have represented England in six consecutive major tournaments, playing in the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]], [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] [[UEFA European Championship]]s; and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. He was named in the Teams of the Tournament for the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2004. Other honours in the game include being in the [[PFA Team of the Year]] three times, in 1999, 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn February 2015, Campbell announced an (ultimately unsuccessful) ambition to become the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] nominee for [[Mayor of London]] in the [[2016 London mayoral election|2016 election]].<ref name=\"independent1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/sol-campbell-confirms-intentions-to-run-for-london-mayor-i-have-got-so-much-to-offer-10071666.html|title=Sol Campbell confirms his intentions to run for this high-powered political role|date=26 February 2015|website=The Independent|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCampbell was born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], London, to Jamaican parents Sewell and Wihelmina.<ref>{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=5}}</ref> He was the youngest of twelve children, nine of whom were boys.<ref name=\"page 2\">{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=2}}</ref> His father Sewell was a railway worker and his mother Wihelmina was a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory worker.<ref name=\"page 2\"/> Despite growing up in a rough neighbourhood to a family with very little money, Campbell veered away from a life of crime due to his strict parents.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"><!--?REPEAT1?-->{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/inside-the-mind-of-sol-campbell-411153.html |title=Inside the mind of Sol Campbell |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2010 |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"I became a recluse within my own house.

He previously managed [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] from November 2018 to August 2019. A [[centre back]], he had a 20-year career playing in the [[Premier League]] and an 11-year international career with the [[England national football team|England national team]].\n\nBorn in [[North East (London sub region)|east London]] to Jamaican parents, Campbell began his career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in December 1992. He spent nine years at Spurs, scoring 10 goals in 255 appearances, and [[captain (association football)|captaining]] the team to victory in the [[1999 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. In 2001, he joined Tottenham's [[North London derby|North London rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a free transfer, and as a result has remained a deeply unpopular figure amongst Spurs supporters. In his five years and 195 appearances at Arsenal, he won two Premier League winners medals and two [[FA Cup]] winners medals, encompassing the 2001\u201302 league and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|double]], and being part of the team that became known as ''[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]'' for their undefeated [[2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season|2003\u201304 Premier League campaign]]. He scored Arsenal's only goal in their 2\u20131 defeat to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. In August 2006, he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a free transfer. His three years with the club included captaining them to victory in the [[2008 FA Cup Final]]. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he made the surprise move of dropping down three levels of the [[English football league system|English football pyramid]] to join League Two side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on a free transfer. He left the club by mutual consent in September 2009, having played just one match for the club. The next year, he made a brief return to Arsenal before ending his career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nHaving already won caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21s]] and [[England national football B team|England B team]], Campbell gained his first of 73 full caps for England aged 21. In May 1998, Campbell became what was then England's second-youngest captain, after [[Bobby Moore]], aged 23 years 248 days. In 2006, he became the only player to have represented England in six consecutive major tournaments, playing in the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]], [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] [[UEFA European Championship]]s; and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. He was named in the Teams of the Tournament for the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2004. Other honours in the game include being in the [[PFA Team of the Year]] three times, in 1999, 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn February 2015, Campbell announced an (ultimately unsuccessful) ambition to become the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] nominee for [[Mayor of London]] in the [[2016 London mayoral election|2016 election]].<ref name=\"independent1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/sol-campbell-confirms-intentions-to-run-for-london-mayor-i-have-got-so-much-to-offer-10071666.html|title=Sol Campbell confirms his intentions to run for this high-powered political role|date=26 February 2015|website=The Independent|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCampbell was born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], London, to Jamaican parents Sewell and Wihelmina.<ref>{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=5}}</ref> He was the youngest of twelve children, nine of whom were boys.<ref name=\"page 2\">{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=2}}</ref> His father Sewell was a railway worker and his mother Wihelmina was a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory worker.<ref name=\"page 2\"/> Despite growing up in a rough neighbourhood to a family with very little money, Campbell veered away from a life of crime due to his strict parents.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"><!--?REPEAT1?-->{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/inside-the-mind-of-sol-campbell-411153.html |title=Inside the mind of Sol Campbell |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2010 |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"I became a recluse within my own house.

{"title_page": "Dialect levelling", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date = April 2019}}\n{{incomplete|Russian language|date=June 2019}}\n{{Short description|the means by which dialect differences decrease}}\n\n'''Dialect levelling''' or '''leveling''' is the process of an overall reduction in the variation or diversity of features in one or more dialects. Typically, this comes about through assimilation, mixture, and merging of certain [[dialect]]s, often by [[standard language|language standardization]]. It has been observed in most languages with large numbers of speakers after industrialisation and modernisation of the areas in which they are spoken.\n\n==Definition==\nDialect levelling has been defined as the process by which structural variation in [[dialect]]s is reduced,<ref>Hinskens, 1996:3</ref> \"the process of eliminating prominent stereotypical features of differences between dialects\",<ref>Dillard 1972:300</ref> \"a social process [that] consists in negotiation between speakers of different dialects aimed at setting the properties of, for example, a lexical entry\",<ref>Lefebvre 1998:393</ref> \"the reduction of variation between dialects of the same language in situations where speakers of these dialects are brought together\",<ref>Lefebvre 1998:46</ref> \"the eradication of socially or locally marked variants (both within and between linguistic systems) in conditions of social or geographical mobility and resultant dialect contact\",<ref>Milroy 2002:7</ref> and the \"reduction... of structural similarities between languages in contact\", of which \"interference and convergence are really two manifestations\".<ref>Mougeon et al. 1985:480</ref>\n\n[[Leonard Bloomfield]] implicitly distinguished between the short-term process of [[communication accommodation theory|accommodation]] between speakers and the long-term process of levelling between varieties and between the social and the geographical dimensions.<ref>Bloomfield</ref> On the geographical dimension, levelling may disrupt the regularity that is the result of the application of [[sound change|sound laws]]. It operates in waves but may leave behind relic forms. Dialect levelling and ''Mischung'', or dialect mixing, have been suggested as the key mechanisms that destroy regularity and the alleged exceptionlessness of sound laws.<ref>Bloomfield, Wrede (1919, 10:13), Frings</ref>\n\nDialect levelling is triggered by contact between dialects, often because of migration, and it has been observed in most languages with large numbers of speakers after the [[industrialisation]] and the [[modernisation]] of the area or areas in which they are spoken. It results in unique features of dialects being eliminated and \"may occur over several generations until a stable compromise dialect develops\".<ref>Siegel 1997:128 referenced in Lefebvre</ref><ref>Hinskens 1998:35</ref> It is separate from the levelling of variation between dialectal or vernacular versions of a language and standard versions.<ref>Hinskens 1998:35</ref>\n\n==Motivations==\nContact leading to dialect levelling can stem from geographical and social mobility, which brings together speakers from different regions and social levels. Adolescents can drive levelling, as they adapt their speech under the influence of their peers, rather than their parents.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://aggslanguage.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/dialect-levelling/ |title=Dialect Levelling &#124; i love english language |publisher=Aggslanguage.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 20th-century [[British English]], dialect levelling was caused by social upheaval leading to larger social networks. Agricultural advancements caused movement from rural to urban areas, and the construction of suburbs caused city-dwellers to return to former rural areas. The World Wars brought women into the workforce and men into contact with more diverse backgrounds.<ref>Kerswill</ref>\n\n==Role in creole formation==\nIt has been suggested that dialect levelling plays a role in the formation of [[creole language|creoles]]. It is responsible for standardising the multiple language variants that are produced by the [[relexification]] of substrate languages with words from the lexifier language. Features that are not common to all of the substrata and so are different across the varieties of the emerging creole tend to be eliminated. The process begins \"when the speakers of the creole community stop targeting the lexifier language and start targeting the relexified lexicons, that is, the early creole\".<ref>Lefebvre 1998:46</ref> Dialect levelling in such a situation may not be complete, however. Variation that remains after dialect levelling may result in the \"reallocation\" of surviving variants to \"new functions, such as stylistic or social markers\".<ref>Siegel, 127</ref> Also, differences between substrata, including between dialects of a single substratum, may not be levelled at all but instead persist, as differences between dialects of the creole.<ref>Lefebvre 1998:47</ref>\n\n==Case studies==\n===In New Zealand English===\n{{Main|New Zealand English}}\n[[New Zealand English]] is a relatively new native variety of [[English language|English]]. The English language was brought to the islands in 1800 but became influential only in the 1840s because of large-scale migration from Britain (citation needed). The most distinctive part of the language is the formation of the accent that has developed through complex series of processes involving dialect contact between different varieties of [[British English]], followed by dialect mixture. Although New Zealand English sounds very similar to Australian English, it is not a direct transplant, as Australians were only 7% of the immigrants before 1881, and the majority of the linguistic change in New Zealand English happened between 1840 and 1880. The speed with which New Zealand English became a unique, independent form of English can be attributed to the diversity of speakers who came into contact through colonisation. Features from all over the [[British Isles]] and the [[M\u0101ori people]], who had inhabited the island for 600 years prior to colonisation, can be identified in the form that New Zealand English has taken.\n\nRudimentary levelling in New Zealand English occurred around 1860, the result of contact between adult speakers of different regional and social varieties and the accommodation that was required from the speakers in face-to-face interaction. Settlements attracted people from all walks of life and created highly-diverse [[variation (linguistics)|linguistic variation]], but there were still families that lived in almost total isolation. Thus, the children did not gain the dialect of their peers, as was normally expected, but instead maintained the dialect of their parents. Speakers who grow up in that type of situation are more likely to demonstrate intra-individual variability than speakers whose main source of influence is their peers. When the emerging dialect stabilises, it is the result of a focusing process, which allowed for a very small amount of regional variation.<ref>Trudgill, Peter, Elizabeth Gordon, Gillian Lewis and Margaret MacLagan. 2000. Determinism in new-dialect formation and the genesis of New Zealand English. Journal of Linguistics 36 (2). 299-318. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nNew Zealand English is largely based around the typology and forms of southeastern England because of the levelling out of demographic minority dialect forms. Trudgill (1986) suggests that situations that involve transplantation and contact between mutually-intelligible dialects lead to the development of new dialects by focusing on specific qualities from the variants of the different dialects and reducing them until only one feature remains from each variable. The process may take an extended length of time. Reduction then takes place as the result of group accommodation between speakers in face-to-face interaction. Accommodation may also lead to the development of interdialectal forms, forms that are not present in contributing dialects but may be the result of hyperadaption.\n\n====Vowels====\n:* Variables have been maintained through the process of levelling, such as the vowels of ''foot'' and ''strut'' indicate a system of five, rather than six, short checked vowels, a feature common in working-class accents in most of England north of the [[Bristol Channel]], an area that encompasses about half of England's geography and population. However, only one consultant had the feature, indicating that it was likely a minority feature in adults and was then exposed to children.\n:* /a:/ has levelled from realisations all over an utterance to being found in front realisations only.\n:* Closed variants [i, e, \u025b] (typical of 19th-century Southern England) are more common in the recordings, rather than the open variants of Northern England, Scotland and Ireland [\u025b, \u00e6]. The fact that the close variants have survived suggests an influence from southeastern England, Australia and Scotland.\n:* Diphthong shift is equivalent to diphthongs from Southern England to the West Midlands. Most of diphthong shift happens along /au/, starting at a point that is close to [\u00e6] or /ai/ starting farther back than /a:/\n:* New Zealand rounding patterns are highly characterised by the rounding tendencies in Southern England (for example, the unrounded vowel found in ''lot'' is [\u0251], as opposed to [\u0252], and the fact that the rounded version has disappeared is credited to the fact that those who used the rounded variant were a small majority.\n\n====Consonants====\n:* /h/-dropping did not survive in New Zealand English, and the merger of /w/ and /\u028d/ is only now beginning to emerge.{{when|date=May 2013}}\n:* [[Irish English]] dental /t/ and /d/ have been levelled out in New Zealand English, in favour of /\u03b8/ and /\u00f0/.\n\n===In Limburg===\nIn this case study, Hinskens (1998) researches dialect levelling in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Province of Limburg (1815\u20131839)|Limburg]].<ref>Hinskens, Frans. 1998. Dialect Levelling: A Two-dimensional Process. Folia Linguistica 32 (1-2). 35-52.</ref> Based on his findings, he argues that dialect levelling does not necessarily lead to convergence towards the standard language. The research for this case study takes place in [[Rimburg]], a small village on the southeast of Limburg, where [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian dialects]] are spoken. The southeast area of Limburg experienced rapid industrialisation at the turn of the 20th century with the largescale development of [[coal mining]]. That created job opportunities, which led to considerable immigration to the area (Hinskens:38), which, in turn, led to [[language contact]] and a diversification of language varieties. It is the area that most of the dialect levelling occurred.\n\nGeographically, the dialects of Limburg are divided into three zones. The westernmost zone (C-zone) features East-Limburg dialects, the easternmost zone (A-zone) Ripuarian dialects, with the central zone (B-zone) being a transition zone between the two varieties. As one travels from west to east, the dialect features deviate more and more from the standard language. Additionally, the dialect features accumulate from west to east and features found in East-Limburg dialects are also found in Ripuarian dialects but not the other way around (Hinskens 1998:37).\n\nThe study analysed dialect features from all three zones, among which are the following:\n \n:*  /t/ deletion is typical to all three zones\n:*  derivational suffix -l\u026a\u0263 marks the A/B-zone dialects; C-zone dialects and the standard language have -l\u026ak\n:*  postlexical \u0263-weakening is typical of the dialects in the A-zone\n \nThe study found that \"the ratio of dialect features showing overall loss to dialect features investigated decreases with increasing geographical distribution\" (Hinskens:43).\n\nIn other words, the wider the distribution of the dialectal feature, the less likely that it will level with the standard language. For example, dialectal features found in all three zones, such as /t/ deletion, were maintained, and features such as the postlexical \u0263-weakening, which occurs only in the Ripuarian dialects (A-zone), were lost.\n\nOf the 21 features that are analysed, 14 resulted in a loss of a dialect feature. Some of the features that were levelled did not lead to convergence toward the standard language and, in some cases, there was even divergence (Hinksens:45).\n\nOne feature that is a marker for only the Rimburg dialect, which occurs in the A-zone, is the non-palatalisation of the epenthetic /s/ in the diminutive suffix:\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Rimburg dialect !! B-zone !! Standard Dutch !! gloss\n|-\n| dijisko || dijijko || dingetje || 'thing'-DIM\n|-\n| k\u028cksk\u0259 || k\u028ck\u0283k\u0259 || koekje || 'cookie' \n|-\n| k\u0280e\u02d0\u0259\u00e7sk\u0259 || k\u0280e\u02d0\u0259\u00e7\u0283k\u0259 || kraagje || 'collar'-DIM\n|}\n\n\"Rimburg dialect is in the process of adopting the morpho-phonemics of the surrounding B-zone dialects,\" rather than Standard Dutch (Hinskens:27). Dialect levelling in this case cannot be explained in terms of convergence with the standard language.\n\nThe study concludes that dialect levelling resulted from accommodation. \"Accommodation and dialect levelling should be understood in the light of the continuous struggle between... the tendencies towards unification on the one hand and those towards particularism and cultural fragmentation on the other\" (Hinskens:42). Those who spoke the same dialect were part of the in-group, and those who spoke a different variety were part of the out-group. Based on conversation data, Hinskens found that \"the more typical/unique a dialect feature is for a speaker's dialect, the larger the relative number of linguistic conditions in which the use of this dialect feature is suppressed in out-group contact situations\". (Hinskens:41). Accommodation, or suppression of dialect features, then facilitates mutual comprehension and results in the convergence of dialect features.\n\n===Standard German===\n<ref>Twaddell, William. F. 1959. Standard German: Urbanization and Standard Language: A Symposium Presented at the 1958 Meetings of the American Anthropological Association. Anthropological Linguistics 1(3). 1-7.</ref> The emergence of [[Standard German]] was a complicated process because no German dialect had significantly more prestige than any other. Only relatively recently has a dialect attained sufficient prestige for it to be widely adopted.\n\nStandardization didn't get fully underway until 13th-century Franciscans began a push to establish a literate public; however, at this time, 70% of the materials produced were in [[Latin]], as opposed to [[German language|German]]. 14th-century city-dwellers were far more parochial than their poetic forebears, but there were some linguistic links within the realm of [[commerce]], as newer cities would look to established cities for law codes and the [[Hanseatic League]], in the north of modern Germany, developed a form of German specifically for business. However, as the Hanseatic League began to weaken by the 16th century, its potential to drive linguistic unity was reduced.\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, the language underwent a massive phonological shift, and these changes are still visible linguistic features today. Eastern Central Germany was at the center of the changes and became a linguistically uniform area, which set it apart from other parts of the German-speaking world that remained linguistically diverse. The Viennese imperial chancellery introduced influential spelling reforms, but most regions maintain their own systems, which resulted in five varieties of \"printer's language\" being used in publications.\n\nThe largest influence in the 16th century was [[Martin Luther]]. He did not create a new dialect; most of his work was written in the language of Upper Saxony's chancellery, which was very close to his native dialect. Due to the [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] of that language, his work was more widely accepted. He was also able to influence the lexicon, both in choice of vocabulary and semantic selections. Since so many people read his work, orthography began to stabilize and with a canonical Standard German corpus of sorts being developed, although this was largely limited to the Protestant north. Despite the religious differences between the north and south of Germany, it was the existence of Eastern Central German that prevented the initial spread of Luther's linguistic forms. This divide was overcome in the Protestant parts of Central Germany as the prestige of Luther's dialect assured the acceptance of features from Eastern Central German. The differences were further reduced, as the need for coherent written communication became paramount and Eastern Central German, now highly identified with Luther, became the linguistic medium of the north. [[Low German]], once the first language of the region and a subject of instruction, was displaced and restricted to use in comedic theater, and even there, it was used only by important figures.\n\nThis shift allowed \"language societies\" to modify the language further in the 17th century by translating Latinate compounds using German [[morpheme]]s, which could be understood by any German-speaking child. Grammarians developed a body of usage within the canonical corpus, which was evaluated to monitor the use of the language. It was then that the ''ge''-prefix for non-auxiliary past participles was regularized.\n\nThe middle of the 18th century produced a slew of northern writers, who would ultimately shape the interaction between Catholic Germany, which had resisted Luther's linguistic influence, and the rest of the German-speaking world, directing the path the language's development path. The south did not have any comparable literary innovators to counterbalance the sudden emergence of standardized language in the north, so for two generations, the south's most influential literary minds spoke Lutheran-influenced dialects. In 1871, after centuries of highly-variable spelling and punctuation, a conference was held to create a uniform framework for German spelling, steered by the publication of a Bavarian dictionary in 1879 and a Prussian dictionary in 1880.\n\n[[Jakob Grimm]] and [[Rudolf von Raumer]] created controversy in the 19th century, as they proposed conflicting criteria for defining spelling. Grimm argued that history and [[etymology]] should determine spelling, but van Raumer claimed that spelling should be based on pronunciation. Grimm's historical case found its way into orthography, with two different spellings of final /p, t, t-x/, depending on the surrounding environments. Any sort of standard pronunciation, therefore, was heavily reliant on standard writing.\n\n===In Denmark and Sweden===\nKristensen and Thelander<ref>Kristensen, Kjeld and Mats Thelander. 1984. On dialect levelling in Denmark and Sweden. Folia Linguistica 28(1/2). 223-246.</ref> discuss two socio-dialectal investigations, one [[Danish language|Danish]] and one [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The paper suggests that the development of urban society and an increasing degree of publicness were mentioned as important non-linguistic causes of the accelerating dialect levelling. For example, heavy migration from the countryside to towns and cities, increased traffic and trade, longer schooling within a more centralized system of education and the spread of [[mass media]] and other kinds of [[technology|technological development]] may all be factors that explain why the process has been more rapid during the 20th century than it was in the 19th or why levelling hits dialects of certain regions more than dialects elsewhere.\n\n===In African American Vernacular English (AAVE)===\nIn this case study, Anderson (2002)<ref>Anderson, Bridget. 2002. Dialect leveling and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} monophthongization among African American Detroiters. Journal of Sociolinguistics 6(1). 86-98.</ref> discusses dialect levelling of [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) spoken in [[Detroit]]. In her research, she analyzes a very particular linguistic variable, the [[monophthongization]] of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiceless [[obstruent]]s. While monophthongization of the diphthong {{IPA|/a\u026a > a\u02d0/}} is common in AAVE, it generally occurs in the environment of voiced, not voiceless, obstruents. For example, a southern speaker of AAVE would pronounce the word ''tide'' (voiced obstruent) as {{IPA|[ta\u02d0d]}} and pronounce the word ''tight'' (voiceless obstruent) as {{IPA|[ta\u026at]}}, but some southern white speakers would pronounce it as {{IPA|[ta\u02d0t]}}.\n\nThe monophthongization of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiceless obstruents is a salient characteristic of southern white dialects such as Appalachian and Texas varieties of English, and in the southern states, it indexes group membership with southern white people. To the north, however, in Detroit, the linguistic feature does not mark group membership with white people.\n\nAnderson presents evidence that this linguistic marker has been adopted among speakers of AAVE in Detroit, in part because of contact with white Appalachian immigrants. In other words, the diphthongization of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiced obstruents, which is a common feature of AAVE, has been levelled with that of southern white dialects and is now then being pronounced as a monophthong.\n\nIn order to understand why this levelling has taken place, it is important to understand the demographics and social dynamics of Detroit. In her article, Anderson reports that black and white segregation in Detroit is higher than in any other American city. She describes the demographics stating that the overwhelming majority of white people have moved to the suburbs and most local black people live in the [[inner city]] of Detroit (pp: 87-88). White Appalachians who have migrated to Detroit have found refuge in the inner city and have maintained close ties with black people. That is partly because of their cultural orientation to the South but also because both groups have been marginalised and have been subject to discrimination.\n\nThe contact among them has led to the levelling of AAVE with a southern white variety in which speakers of AAVE have adopted the monophthongization of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiceless obstruents. In the South, the linguistic marker indexes group membership between black people and white people, but in the North, the linguistic marker no longer works since white Detroiters do not use this feature in their speech. Anderson concludes that \"the overall effect is that Detroit AAVE aligns with a Southern vowel system for the {{IPA|/ai/}} vowel variable, including that of the Detroit Southern White community, while indexing an opposition with Northern Whites\" (pp: 95).\n\n===Mandarin tonal levelling in Taiwan===\nA study of [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] leveling in [[Taiwan]] investigated the tonal leveling of Mandarin between [[Mainland Chinese|Mandarin-Waishengren]] and Holo-Benshengren in Taiwan.<ref>Hsu, Hui-ju and John Kwock-ping Tse. The Tonal Leveling of Taiwan Mandarin: A Study in Taipei. Concentric: Studies in Linguistics 35, no. 2 (2009): 225-244.</ref> The results indicated that the tonal leveling of Mandarin between these two ethnic groups started one generation earlier than the general patterns suggested by Trudgill.<ref>Trudgill 1986, 2004</ref> This leveling has nearly reached its completion in the following generation, taking approximately 30 years.\n\nFour factors were proposed to interpret the rapidity of this dialectal leveling:\n# The intensiveness of immigration to Taiwan\n# The exclusive Mandarin-only language policy\n# The pre-established social order and infrastructure during the Japanese colonial period\n# The frequent contacts between Waishengren and Benshengren.\n\n===In Britain===\n{{main|Dialect levelling in Britain}}\n\n==Related terms==\n===Language convergence===\nLanguage convergence refers to what can happen linguistically when speakers adapt 'to the speech of others to reduce differences\".<ref>Siegel 1985: 367</ref> As such, it is a type of accommodation (modification), namely the opposite of divergence, which is the exploitation and making quantitatively more salient of differences.<ref>Mougeon et al. 1985: 479</ref> One can imagine this to be a long-term effect of interspeaker accommodation.\n\nUnlike convergence, dialect levelling in the sense used in this study{{huh|date=September 2013}} (a) is not only a performance phenomenon, but (b) also refers to what ultimately happens at the level of the 'langue', and (c) though in the long-term meaning it comes down to dissimilar varieties growing more similar, it does not necessarily come about by mutually or one-sidedly taking over characteristics of the other variety.\n\nLike interference, dialect levelling is a contact phenomenon. However, it cannot be considered to be a type of interference according to Weinreich (1953), since (a) it is not a concomitant of [[bilingualism]], and (b) it is not merely a performance phenomenon. Dialect leveling need not produce a new usage, but it may very well result in qualitative changes.\n\n===Geographical diffusion===\nGeographical diffusion is the process by which linguistic features spread out from a populous and economically and culturally dominant centre.<ref>Trudgill 1982b: 52\u201387; Britain 2002</ref> The spread is generally wave-like, but modified by the likelihood that nearby towns and cities will adopt the feature before the more rural parts in between. At the individual level in such a diffusion model, speakers are in face-to-face contact with others who have already adopted the new feature, and (for various reasons) they are motivated to adopt it themselves. The reduction or attrition of marked variants in this case brings about levelling.\n\n===Mutual accommodation===\nKerswill mentions that standardisation does not necessarily follow from dialect levelling; it is perfectly possible for dialects to converge without getting closer to the standard, which does happen in some situations.\n\nThe mechanism for standardisation lies in the kinds of [[social networks]] people have. People with more broadly based (more varied) networks will meet people with a higher\n[[social status]]. They will accommodate to them<ref>Giles & Powesland (1975)</ref><ref>Giles & Smith 1979</ref> in a phenomenon known as upward convergence. The opposite, downward convergence, where a higher-status person accommodates to a lower status person, is much rarer. This accommodation is thought to happen mainly among adults in Western societies, not children or adolescents, because in those societies children and adolescents have much more self-centred, narrower peer groups. In societies where standardisation is generally something that adults do, children and adolescents perform other kinds of levelling.\n\nAccommodation between individual speakers of different dialects takes place with respect to features that are salient, displaying phonetic or surface phonemic contrasts between the dialects. This process is mostly limited to salient features, geographical (distance), and demographic (population size) factors.<ref>Trudgill (1986:11, 37)</ref><ref>Chambers and Trudgill, 1980:84-86</ref> Accommodation is not the same thing as levelling, but it can be its short-term preamble.\n\n===Koin\u00e9ization===\n[[Koin\u00e9isation]], unlike dialect levelling, 'involves the mixing of features of different dialects, and leads to a new, compromised dialect'. It results from 'integration or unification of the speakers of the varieties in contact'.<ref>Siegel 1985: 365, 369</ref> Clearly, dialect levelling is not strictly synonymous with koin\u00e9isation. First, dialect levelling does not merely take place in the space between dialects; it may also occur between a dialect and a standard language. Second, its end product cannot be equated with that of koin\u00e9isation, a koin\u00e9 being the structurally stabilized and sociologically more or less standard product of heavy intermixture.\n\nAccording to Milroy (2002), the difference between dialect levelling and koin\u00e9ization is that dialect levelling involves the eradication of linguistic variants due to language contact while koin\u00e9ization involves the creation of a new linguistic variety based on language contact.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Language death]]\n* [[Language shift]]\n* [[Lingua franca]]\n* [[Linguistic discrimination]]\n* [[Linguistic prescription]]\n* [[Linguistic purism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n==Bibliography==\n* Anderson, Bridget. 2002.

Typically, this comes about through assimilation, mixture, and merging of certain [[dialect]]s, often by [[standard language|language standardization]]. It has been observed in most languages with large numbers of speakers after industrialisation and modernisation of the areas in which they are spoken.\n\n==Definition==\nDialect levelling has been defined as the process by which structural variation in [[dialect]]s is reduced,<ref>Hinskens, 1996:3</ref> \"the process of eliminating prominent stereotypical features of differences between dialects\",<ref>Dillard 1972:300</ref> \"a social process [that] consists in negotiation between speakers of different dialects aimed at setting the properties of, for example, a lexical entry\",<ref>Lefebvre 1998:393</ref> \"the reduction of variation between dialects of the same language in situations where speakers of these dialects are brought together\",<ref>Lefebvre 1998:46</ref> \"the eradication of socially or locally marked variants (both within and between linguistic systems) in conditions of social or geographical mobility and resultant dialect contact\",<ref>Milroy 2002:7</ref> and the \"reduction... of structural similarities between languages in contact\", of which \"interference and convergence are really two manifestations\".<ref>Mougeon et al. 1985:480</ref>\n\n[[Leonard Bloomfield]] implicitly distinguished between the short-term process of [[communication accommodation theory|accommodation]] between speakers and the long-term process of levelling between varieties and between the social and the geographical dimensions.<ref>Bloomfield</ref> On the geographical dimension, levelling may disrupt the regularity that is the result of the application of [[sound change|sound laws]]. It operates in waves but may leave behind relic forms. Dialect levelling and ''Mischung'', or dialect mixing, have been suggested as the key mechanisms that destroy regularity and the alleged exceptionlessness of sound laws.<ref>Bloomfield, Wrede (1919, 10:13), Frings</ref>\n\nDialect levelling is triggered by contact between dialects, often because of migration, and it has been observed in most languages with large numbers of speakers after the [[industrialisation]] and the [[modernisation]] of the area or areas in which they are spoken. It results in unique features of dialects being eliminated and \"may occur over several generations until a stable compromise dialect develops\".<ref>Siegel 1997:128 referenced in Lefebvre</ref><ref>Hinskens 1998:35</ref> It is separate from the levelling of variation between dialectal or vernacular versions of a language and standard versions.<ref>Hinskens 1998:35</ref>\n\n==Motivations==\nContact leading to dialect levelling can stem from geographical and social mobility, which brings together speakers from different regions and social levels. Adolescents can drive levelling, as they adapt their speech under the influence of their peers, rather than their parents.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://aggslanguage.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/dialect-levelling/ |title=Dialect Levelling &#124; i love english language |publisher=Aggslanguage.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 20th-century [[British English]], dialect levelling was caused by social upheaval leading to larger social networks. Agricultural advancements caused movement from rural to urban areas, and the construction of suburbs caused city-dwellers to return to former rural areas. The World Wars brought women into the workforce and men into contact with more diverse backgrounds.<ref>Kerswill</ref>\n\n==Role in creole formation==\nIt has been suggested that dialect levelling plays a role in the formation of [[creole language|creoles]]. It is responsible for standardising the multiple language variants that are produced by the [[relexification]] of substrate languages with words from the lexifier language. Features that are not common to all of the substrata and so are different across the varieties of the emerging creole tend to be eliminated. The process begins \"when the speakers of the creole community stop targeting the lexifier language and start targeting the relexified lexicons, that is, the early creole\".<ref>Lefebvre 1998:46</ref> Dialect levelling in such a situation may not be complete, however. Variation that remains after dialect levelling may result in the \"reallocation\" of surviving variants to \"new functions, such as stylistic or social markers\".<ref>Siegel, 127</ref> Also, differences between substrata, including between dialects of a single substratum, may not be levelled at all but instead persist, as differences between dialects of the creole.<ref>Lefebvre 1998:47</ref>\n\n==Case studies==\n===In New Zealand English===\n{{Main|New Zealand English}}\n[[New Zealand English]] is a relatively new native variety of [[English language|English]]. The English language was brought to the islands in 1800 but became influential only in the 1840s because of large-scale migration from Britain (citation needed). The most distinctive part of the language is the formation of the accent that has developed through complex series of processes involving dialect contact between different varieties of [[British English]], followed by dialect mixture. Although New Zealand English sounds very similar to Australian English, it is not a direct transplant, as Australians were only 7% of the immigrants before 1881, and the majority of the linguistic change in New Zealand English happened between 1840 and 1880. The speed with which New Zealand English became a unique, independent form of English can be attributed to the diversity of speakers who came into contact through colonisation. Features from all over the [[British Isles]] and the [[M\u0101ori people]], who had inhabited the island for 600 years prior to colonisation, can be identified in the form that New Zealand English has taken.\n\nRudimentary levelling in New Zealand English occurred around 1860, the result of contact between adult speakers of different regional and social varieties and the accommodation that was required from the speakers in face-to-face interaction. Settlements attracted people from all walks of life and created highly-diverse [[variation (linguistics)|linguistic variation]], but there were still families that lived in almost total isolation. Thus, the children did not gain the dialect of their peers, as was normally expected, but instead maintained the dialect of their parents. Speakers who grow up in that type of situation are more likely to demonstrate intra-individual variability than speakers whose main source of influence is their peers. When the emerging dialect stabilises, it is the result of a focusing process, which allowed for a very small amount of regional variation.<ref>Trudgill, Peter, Elizabeth Gordon, Gillian Lewis and Margaret MacLagan. 2000. Determinism in new-dialect formation and the genesis of New Zealand English. Journal of Linguistics 36 (2). 299-318. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nNew Zealand English is largely based around the typology and forms of southeastern England because of the levelling out of demographic minority dialect forms. Trudgill (1986) suggests that situations that involve transplantation and contact between mutually-intelligible dialects lead to the development of new dialects by focusing on specific qualities from the variants of the different dialects and reducing them until only one feature remains from each variable. The process may take an extended length of time. Reduction then takes place as the result of group accommodation between speakers in face-to-face interaction. Accommodation may also lead to the development of interdialectal forms, forms that are not present in contributing dialects but may be the result of hyperadaption.\n\n====Vowels====\n:* Variables have been maintained through the process of levelling, such as the vowels of ''foot'' and ''strut'' indicate a system of five, rather than six, short checked vowels, a feature common in working-class accents in most of England north of the [[Bristol Channel]], an area that encompasses about half of England's geography and population. However, only one consultant had the feature, indicating that it was likely a minority feature in adults and was then exposed to children.\n:* /a:/ has levelled from realisations all over an utterance to being found in front realisations only.\n:* Closed variants [i, e, \u025b] (typical of 19th-century Southern England) are more common in the recordings, rather than the open variants of Northern England, Scotland and Ireland [\u025b, \u00e6]. The fact that the close variants have survived suggests an influence from southeastern England, Australia and Scotland.\n:* Diphthong shift is equivalent to diphthongs from Southern England to the West Midlands. Most of diphthong shift happens along /au/, starting at a point that is close to [\u00e6] or /ai/ starting farther back than /a:/\n:* New Zealand rounding patterns are highly characterised by the rounding tendencies in Southern England (for example, the unrounded vowel found in ''lot'' is [\u0251], as opposed to [\u0252], and the fact that the rounded version has disappeared is credited to the fact that those who used the rounded variant were a small majority.\n\n====Consonants====\n:* /h/-dropping did not survive in New Zealand English, and the merger of /w/ and /\u028d/ is only now beginning to emerge.{{when|date=May 2013}}\n:* [[Irish English]] dental /t/ and /d/ have been levelled out in New Zealand English, in favour of /\u03b8/ and /\u00f0/.\n\n===In Limburg===\nIn this case study, Hinskens (1998) researches dialect levelling in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Province of Limburg (1815\u20131839)|Limburg]].<ref>Hinskens, Frans. 1998. Dialect Levelling: A Two-dimensional Process. Folia Linguistica 32 (1-2). 35-52.</ref> Based on his findings, he argues that dialect levelling does not necessarily lead to convergence towards the standard language. The research for this case study takes place in [[Rimburg]], a small village on the southeast of Limburg, where [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian dialects]] are spoken. The southeast area of Limburg experienced rapid industrialisation at the turn of the 20th century with the largescale development of [[coal mining]]. That created job opportunities, which led to considerable immigration to the area (Hinskens:38), which, in turn, led to [[language contact]] and a diversification of language varieties. It is the area that most of the dialect levelling occurred.\n\nGeographically, the dialects of Limburg are divided into three zones. The westernmost zone (C-zone) features East-Limburg dialects, the easternmost zone (A-zone) Ripuarian dialects, with the central zone (B-zone) being a transition zone between the two varieties. As one travels from west to east, the dialect features deviate more and more from the standard language. Additionally, the dialect features accumulate from west to east and features found in East-Limburg dialects are also found in Ripuarian dialects but not the other way around (Hinskens 1998:37).\n\nThe study analysed dialect features from all three zones, among which are the following:\n \n:*  /t/ deletion is typical to all three zones\n:*  derivational suffix -l\u026a\u0263 marks the A/B-zone dialects; C-zone dialects and the standard language have -l\u026ak\n:*  postlexical \u0263-weakening is typical of the dialects in the A-zone\n \nThe study found that \"the ratio of dialect features showing overall loss to dialect features investigated decreases with increasing geographical distribution\" (Hinskens:43).\n\nIn other words, the wider the distribution of the dialectal feature, the less likely that it will level with the standard language. For example, dialectal features found in all three zones, such as /t/ deletion, were maintained, and features such as the postlexical \u0263-weakening, which occurs only in the Ripuarian dialects (A-zone), were lost.\n\nOf the 21 features that are analysed, 14 resulted in a loss of a dialect feature. Some of the features that were levelled did not lead to convergence toward the standard language and, in some cases, there was even divergence (Hinksens:45).\n\nOne feature that is a marker for only the Rimburg dialect, which occurs in the A-zone, is the non-palatalisation of the epenthetic /s/ in the diminutive suffix:\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Rimburg dialect !! B-zone !! Standard Dutch !! gloss\n|-\n| dijisko || dijijko || dingetje || 'thing'-DIM\n|-\n| k\u028cksk\u0259 || k\u028ck\u0283k\u0259 || koekje || 'cookie' \n|-\n| k\u0280e\u02d0\u0259\u00e7sk\u0259 || k\u0280e\u02d0\u0259\u00e7\u0283k\u0259 || kraagje || 'collar'-DIM\n|}\n\n\"Rimburg dialect is in the process of adopting the morpho-phonemics of the surrounding B-zone dialects,\" rather than Standard Dutch (Hinskens:27). Dialect levelling in this case cannot be explained in terms of convergence with the standard language.\n\nThe study concludes that dialect levelling resulted from accommodation. \"Accommodation and dialect levelling should be understood in the light of the continuous struggle between... the tendencies towards unification on the one hand and those towards particularism and cultural fragmentation on the other\" (Hinskens:42). Those who spoke the same dialect were part of the in-group, and those who spoke a different variety were part of the out-group. Based on conversation data, Hinskens found that \"the more typical/unique a dialect feature is for a speaker's dialect, the larger the relative number of linguistic conditions in which the use of this dialect feature is suppressed in out-group contact situations\". (Hinskens:41). Accommodation, or suppression of dialect features, then facilitates mutual comprehension and results in the convergence of dialect features.\n\n===Standard German===\n<ref>Twaddell, William. F. 1959. Standard German: Urbanization and Standard Language: A Symposium Presented at the 1958 Meetings of the American Anthropological Association. Anthropological Linguistics 1(3). 1-7.</ref> The emergence of [[Standard German]] was a complicated process because no German dialect had significantly more prestige than any other. Only relatively recently has a dialect attained sufficient prestige for it to be widely adopted.\n\nStandardization didn't get fully underway until 13th-century Franciscans began a push to establish a literate public; however, at this time, 70% of the materials produced were in [[Latin]], as opposed to [[German language|German]]. 14th-century city-dwellers were far more parochial than their poetic forebears, but there were some linguistic links within the realm of [[commerce]], as newer cities would look to established cities for law codes and the [[Hanseatic League]], in the north of modern Germany, developed a form of German specifically for business. However, as the Hanseatic League began to weaken by the 16th century, its potential to drive linguistic unity was reduced.\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, the language underwent a massive phonological shift, and these changes are still visible linguistic features today. Eastern Central Germany was at the center of the changes and became a linguistically uniform area, which set it apart from other parts of the German-speaking world that remained linguistically diverse. The Viennese imperial chancellery introduced influential spelling reforms, but most regions maintain their own systems, which resulted in five varieties of \"printer's language\" being used in publications.\n\nThe largest influence in the 16th century was [[Martin Luther]]. He did not create a new dialect; most of his work was written in the language of Upper Saxony's chancellery, which was very close to his native dialect. Due to the [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] of that language, his work was more widely accepted. He was also able to influence the lexicon, both in choice of vocabulary and semantic selections. Since so many people read his work, orthography began to stabilize and with a canonical Standard German corpus of sorts being developed, although this was largely limited to the Protestant north. Despite the religious differences between the north and south of Germany, it was the existence of Eastern Central German that prevented the initial spread of Luther's linguistic forms. This divide was overcome in the Protestant parts of Central Germany as the prestige of Luther's dialect assured the acceptance of features from Eastern Central German. The differences were further reduced, as the need for coherent written communication became paramount and Eastern Central German, now highly identified with Luther, became the linguistic medium of the north. [[Low German]], once the first language of the region and a subject of instruction, was displaced and restricted to use in comedic theater, and even there, it was used only by important figures.\n\nThis shift allowed \"language societies\" to modify the language further in the 17th century by translating Latinate compounds using German [[morpheme]]s, which could be understood by any German-speaking child. Grammarians developed a body of usage within the canonical corpus, which was evaluated to monitor the use of the language. It was then that the ''ge''-prefix for non-auxiliary past participles was regularized.\n\nThe middle of the 18th century produced a slew of northern writers, who would ultimately shape the interaction between Catholic Germany, which had resisted Luther's linguistic influence, and the rest of the German-speaking world, directing the path the language's development path. The south did not have any comparable literary innovators to counterbalance the sudden emergence of standardized language in the north, so for two generations, the south's most influential literary minds spoke Lutheran-influenced dialects. In 1871, after centuries of highly-variable spelling and punctuation, a conference was held to create a uniform framework for German spelling, steered by the publication of a Bavarian dictionary in 1879 and a Prussian dictionary in 1880.\n\n[[Jakob Grimm]] and [[Rudolf von Raumer]] created controversy in the 19th century, as they proposed conflicting criteria for defining spelling. Grimm argued that history and [[etymology]] should determine spelling, but van Raumer claimed that spelling should be based on pronunciation. Grimm's historical case found its way into orthography, with two different spellings of final /p, t, t-x/, depending on the surrounding environments. Any sort of standard pronunciation, therefore, was heavily reliant on standard writing.\n\n===In Denmark and Sweden===\nKristensen and Thelander<ref>Kristensen, Kjeld and Mats Thelander. 1984. On dialect levelling in Denmark and Sweden. Folia Linguistica 28(1/2). 223-246.</ref> discuss two socio-dialectal investigations, one [[Danish language|Danish]] and one [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The paper suggests that the development of urban society and an increasing degree of publicness were mentioned as important non-linguistic causes of the accelerating dialect levelling. For example, heavy migration from the countryside to towns and cities, increased traffic and trade, longer schooling within a more centralized system of education and the spread of [[mass media]] and other kinds of [[technology|technological development]] may all be factors that explain why the process has been more rapid during the 20th century than it was in the 19th or why levelling hits dialects of certain regions more than dialects elsewhere.\n\n===In African American Vernacular English (AAVE)===\nIn this case study, Anderson (2002)<ref>Anderson, Bridget. 2002. Dialect leveling and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} monophthongization among African American Detroiters. Journal of Sociolinguistics 6(1). 86-98.</ref> discusses dialect levelling of [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) spoken in [[Detroit]]. In her research, she analyzes a very particular linguistic variable, the [[monophthongization]] of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiceless [[obstruent]]s. While monophthongization of the diphthong {{IPA|/a\u026a > a\u02d0/}} is common in AAVE, it generally occurs in the environment of voiced, not voiceless, obstruents. For example, a southern speaker of AAVE would pronounce the word ''tide'' (voiced obstruent) as {{IPA|[ta\u02d0d]}} and pronounce the word ''tight'' (voiceless obstruent) as {{IPA|[ta\u026at]}}, but some southern white speakers would pronounce it as {{IPA|[ta\u02d0t]}}.\n\nThe monophthongization of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiceless obstruents is a salient characteristic of southern white dialects such as Appalachian and Texas varieties of English, and in the southern states, it indexes group membership with southern white people. To the north, however, in Detroit, the linguistic feature does not mark group membership with white people.\n\nAnderson presents evidence that this linguistic marker has been adopted among speakers of AAVE in Detroit, in part because of contact with white Appalachian immigrants. In other words, the diphthongization of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiced obstruents, which is a common feature of AAVE, has been levelled with that of southern white dialects and is now then being pronounced as a monophthong.\n\nIn order to understand why this levelling has taken place, it is important to understand the demographics and social dynamics of Detroit. In her article, Anderson reports that black and white segregation in Detroit is higher than in any other American city. She describes the demographics stating that the overwhelming majority of white people have moved to the suburbs and most local black people live in the [[inner city]] of Detroit (pp: 87-88). White Appalachians who have migrated to Detroit have found refuge in the inner city and have maintained close ties with black people. That is partly because of their cultural orientation to the South but also because both groups have been marginalised and have been subject to discrimination.\n\nThe contact among them has led to the levelling of AAVE with a southern white variety in which speakers of AAVE have adopted the monophthongization of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiceless obstruents. In the South, the linguistic marker indexes group membership between black people and white people, but in the North, the linguistic marker no longer works since white Detroiters do not use this feature in their speech. Anderson concludes that \"the overall effect is that Detroit AAVE aligns with a Southern vowel system for the {{IPA|/ai/}} vowel variable, including that of the Detroit Southern White community, while indexing an opposition with Northern Whites\" (pp: 95).\n\n===Mandarin tonal levelling in Taiwan===\nA study of [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] leveling in [[Taiwan]] investigated the tonal leveling of Mandarin between [[Mainland Chinese|Mandarin-Waishengren]] and Holo-Benshengren in Taiwan.<ref>Hsu, Hui-ju and John Kwock-ping Tse. The Tonal Leveling of Taiwan Mandarin: A Study in Taipei. Concentric: Studies in Linguistics 35, no. 2 (2009): 225-244.</ref> The results indicated that the tonal leveling of Mandarin between these two ethnic groups started one generation earlier than the general patterns suggested by Trudgill.<ref>Trudgill 1986, 2004</ref> This leveling has nearly reached its completion in the following generation, taking approximately 30 years.\n\nFour factors were proposed to interpret the rapidity of this dialectal leveling:\n# The intensiveness of immigration to Taiwan\n# The exclusive Mandarin-only language policy\n# The pre-established social order and infrastructure during the Japanese colonial period\n# The frequent contacts between Waishengren and Benshengren.\n\n===In Britain===\n{{main|Dialect levelling in Britain}}\n\n==Related terms==\n===Language convergence===\nLanguage convergence refers to what can happen linguistically when speakers adapt 'to the speech of others to reduce differences\".<ref>Siegel 1985: 367</ref> As such, it is a type of accommodation (modification), namely the opposite of divergence, which is the exploitation and making quantitatively more salient of differences.<ref>Mougeon et al. 1985: 479</ref> One can imagine this to be a long-term effect of interspeaker accommodation.\n\nUnlike convergence, dialect levelling in the sense used in this study{{huh|date=September 2013}} (a) is not only a performance phenomenon, but (b) also refers to what ultimately happens at the level of the 'langue', and (c) though in the long-term meaning it comes down to dissimilar varieties growing more similar, it does not necessarily come about by mutually or one-sidedly taking over characteristics of the other variety.\n\nLike interference, dialect levelling is a contact phenomenon. However, it cannot be considered to be a type of interference according to Weinreich (1953), since (a) it is not a concomitant of [[bilingualism]], and (b) it is not merely a performance phenomenon. Dialect leveling need not produce a new usage, but it may very well result in qualitative changes.\n\n===Geographical diffusion===\nGeographical diffusion is the process by which linguistic features spread out from a populous and economically and culturally dominant centre.<ref>Trudgill 1982b: 52\u201387; Britain 2002</ref> The spread is generally wave-like, but modified by the likelihood that nearby towns and cities will adopt the feature before the more rural parts in between. At the individual level in such a diffusion model, speakers are in face-to-face contact with others who have already adopted the new feature, and (for various reasons) they are motivated to adopt it themselves. The reduction or attrition of marked variants in this case brings about levelling.\n\n===Mutual accommodation===\nKerswill mentions that standardisation does not necessarily follow from dialect levelling; it is perfectly possible for dialects to converge without getting closer to the standard, which does happen in some situations.\n\nThe mechanism for standardisation lies in the kinds of [[social networks]] people have. People with more broadly based (more varied) networks will meet people with a higher\n[[social status]]. They will accommodate to them<ref>Giles & Powesland (1975)</ref><ref>Giles & Smith 1979</ref> in a phenomenon known as upward convergence. The opposite, downward convergence, where a higher-status person accommodates to a lower status person, is much rarer. This accommodation is thought to happen mainly among adults in Western societies, not children or adolescents, because in those societies children and adolescents have much more self-centred, narrower peer groups. In societies where standardisation is generally something that adults do, children and adolescents perform other kinds of levelling.\n\nAccommodation between individual speakers of different dialects takes place with respect to features that are salient, displaying phonetic or surface phonemic contrasts between the dialects. This process is mostly limited to salient features, geographical (distance), and demographic (population size) factors.<ref>Trudgill (1986:11, 37)</ref><ref>Chambers and Trudgill, 1980:84-86</ref> Accommodation is not the same thing as levelling, but it can be its short-term preamble.\n\n===Koin\u00e9ization===\n[[Koin\u00e9isation]], unlike dialect levelling, 'involves the mixing of features of different dialects, and leads to a new, compromised dialect'. It results from 'integration or unification of the speakers of the varieties in contact'.<ref>Siegel 1985: 365, 369</ref> Clearly, dialect levelling is not strictly synonymous with koin\u00e9isation. First, dialect levelling does not merely take place in the space between dialects; it may also occur between a dialect and a standard language. Second, its end product cannot be equated with that of koin\u00e9isation, a koin\u00e9 being the structurally stabilized and sociologically more or less standard product of heavy intermixture.\n\nAccording to Milroy (2002), the difference between dialect levelling and koin\u00e9ization is that dialect levelling involves the eradication of linguistic variants due to language contact while koin\u00e9ization involves the creation of a new linguistic variety based on language contact.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Language death]]\n* [[Language shift]]\n* [[Lingua franca]]\n* [[Linguistic discrimination]]\n* [[Linguistic prescription]]\n* [[Linguistic purism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n==Bibliography==\n* Anderson, Bridget. 2002.

Examples of stakeholders for a factory project could include employees, suppliers, area residents, emergency responders, and local government. It is important in this process that stakeholders hear what other stakeholders and the decision-maker are saying, to foster mutual understanding and create otherwise-impossible arrangements that satisfy the needs of the most-critical groups (i.e., to optimize the decision).\n\nStakeholder inputs are used to quantify uncertainties and evaluate benefits and costs under different scenarios.\n\nThese findings can then be incorporated into a probabilistic modeling process to systematically identify possible events that could affect an investment's payback, assess the consequences,<ref name=\"ESG SROI\">{{cite web|title=Sustainable Return On Investment (S-ROI)|url=https://www.earthshiftglobal.com/consultingservices/start-sustainability-return-on-investment-roi-engagement|website=EarthShift Global|publisher=EarthShift Global LLC|accessdate=17 June 2017|location=Kittery, ME|date=2012-04-16}}</ref> and identify opportunities for optimizing overall outcomes. A [[Net present value|Net Present Value]] (NPV) assessment can be made for each stakeholder, using Monte Carlo analysis to generate best-case, worst-case, and most-likely assessments of an investment's profitability.\n\nOne example would be the possible replacement of a dangerous chemical with a more benign alternative. The S-ROI process can evaluate possible effects of industrial accidents, including the risk of fines, lawsuits, and damage to brand reputation and employee relations. These types of analyses can show whether preventive measures like extra training or redundant safety systems create an unnecessary burden or provide payback through risk reduction.<ref name=\"ESG SROI\" />\n\nOther examples are S-ROI of waste to energy facilities<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/nawtec/nawtec18/nawtec18-3552.pdf|title=Measuring The Sustainable Return On Investment (SROI) Of Waste To Energy|last=Parker|first=John C.|last2=Williams|first2=John F.|date=2010|website=|access-date=11 August 2017}}</ref> and implementation of a system for recycling waste generated during the production of concrete for construction projects.<ref name=\"GIZ 32\">{{cite web|last1=Kruschel|first1=Philipp|title=Sustainable Return on Investment (ROI)|url=https://www.emm-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Sustainable-ROI-Introduction-1st-Workshop.pdf|website=Emerging Market Multinationals Network for Sustainability|publisher=Emerging Markets Multinationals Network For Sustainability (EMM) & Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)|accessdate=17 June 2017|pages=32|format=PDF|date=March 31, 2016}}</ref> The S-ROI analysis assessed payback by analyzing up-front and operational costs, cost savings from reduced water usage and waste disposal, and potential scalability of the program.\n\nThe S-ROI method can also be used to explore broader issues.

The methodology was devised by industry collaborators for use in industry and had a vetting period, during which the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of Fortune 500 companies in the chemical industry were brought in to ensure the financial calculations met their stringent requirements.\n\nAlthough the initial methodology had a narrow scope and focus, practitioners have found that the basic method can be applied beyond environmental and safety costs to include health risks, societal costs, and benefits in all categories.\n\nSeveral practitioners and government and industry partners continued the development of the methodology to include benefits and the multi-[[Stakeholder (project)|stakeholder]] perspective that are included in the S-ROI concept.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=John|title=Determining the Right Shade of Green for a Specific Community|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|volume=1|issue=2|pages=130\u2013138|doi=10.1089/sus.2008.9974|year=2008}}</ref><ref name=\"ImpactInfrastructure Blog\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.autocase.com/blog/2014/05/27/sroiprocessevolutionadditionautomationgrowth/|title=S-ROI Process \u2013 Evolution, Addition, Automation & Growth|first=|date=May 27, 2014|website=Autocase|publisher=Impact Infrastructure|author1=|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Japan\">{{cite web|last1=Laurin|first1=Lise|last2=Hayashi|first2=K.|title=Sustainability Return on Investment: A Scenario-based Mu|url=https://www.earthshiftglobal.com/docs/sroi-scenario-based-multi-criteria-assessment-tool-policy-japan.pdf|website=www.earthshiftglobal.com|publisher=EarthShift, LLC|location=Kittery, ME|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"ISSST Video\">{{cite web|title=ISSST 2016 A: Challenges to Business and Industry|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnFfQpMNUpY&t=33m2s|publisher=ISSST Network|accessdate=17 June 2017|format=Video|date=May 18, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Dow Goals\">{{cite web|title=2025 Sustainability Goals|url=http://www.dow.com/en-us/science-and-sustainability/2025-sustainability-goals|website=Dow|publisher=The Dow Chemical Company|accessdate=17 June 2017|format=website}}</ref>\n\n== Process and Applications ==\n\nAn initial data-gathering phase typically involves concurrent dialog with stakeholders inside and outside the project-planning organization, or proxies for these groups, to identify types of impacts from the project under consideration. Examples of stakeholders for a factory project could include employees, suppliers, area residents, emergency responders, and local government. It is important in this process that stakeholders hear what other stakeholders and the decision-maker are saying, to foster mutual understanding and create otherwise-impossible arrangements that satisfy the needs of the most-critical groups (i.e., to optimize the decision).\n\nStakeholder inputs are used to quantify uncertainties and evaluate benefits and costs under different scenarios.\n\nThese findings can then be incorporated into a probabilistic modeling process to systematically identify possible events that could affect an investment\u2019s payback, assess the consequences,<ref name=\"ESG SROI\">{{cite web|title=Sustainable Return On Investment (S-ROI)|url=https://www.earthshiftglobal.com/consultingservices/start-sustainability-return-on-investment-roi-engagement|website=EarthShift Global|publisher=EarthShift Global LLC|accessdate=17 June 2017|location=Kittery, ME|date=2012-04-16}}</ref> and identify opportunities for optimizing overall outcomes. A [[Net present value|Net Present Value]] (NPV) assessment can be made for each stakeholder, using Monte Carlo analysis to generate best-case, worst-case, and most-likely assessments of an investment\u2019s profitability.\n\nOne example would be the possible replacement of a dangerous chemical with a more benign alternative. The S-ROI process can evaluate possible effects of industrial accidents, including the risk of fines, lawsuits, and damage to brand reputation and employee relations.

Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals, hymns and early gospel songs as part of their repertoire. Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black [[gospel music]]. Prior to [[World War II]], American churches, black and white, regarded jazz and blues with suspicion or outright hostility as \"the devil's music.\" It was only after World War II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious settings and/or as religious expression. Since the 1950's, sacred and liturgical music has been performed and recorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowes |first1=Malcolm |title=Jazz in the chapel |journal=Music Journal |date=11 January 1966 |volume=24 |issue=9 |page=45}}</ref> \n\nFew music historians or musicologists have written about sacred jazz. One of the first and the most extensive treatise to date is a 2013 doctoral dissertation, in which Angelo Versace examined the development of sacred jazz in the 1950s using disciplines of [[musicology]] and history.<ref name=\"Versace\" /> He noted that the historically parallel traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the 1950s to produce \"sacred jazz.\" The two are similar in religious intent but differ in gospel's lack of extended instrumental passages and instrumental improvisation and in gospel's hymn-like structure, and concern with social and political issues. Prominent artists [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Rosetta Tharpe]] contributed to gospel and sacred jazz. Versace maintained that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz. Most prominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer [[Mary Lou Williams]], known for her jazz masses in the 1950s and [[Duke Ellington]]. Prior to his later sacred compositions, Ellington included \"Come Sunday\" and \"Twenty-third Psalm\" in his \"Black, Brown and Beige\", which he recorded in 1958 with Mahalia Jackson. However, a number of other jazz artists, black and white, contributed to the movement.\n\nThe marked societal changes of the [[1960s]] included changes in attitudes toward the arts in both [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] Churches, which slowly became more open to the liturgical use of jazz.<ref name=\"Versace\" /> Mary Lou Williams continued composing sacred jazz including her \"Black Christ of the Andes\" (1964) in honor of newly canonized Martin De Porres. Prior to his death in 1974 in response to contacts from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, [[Duke Ellington]] wrote three Sacred Concerts: 1965 - A Concert of Sacred Music; 1968 - Second Sacred Concert; 1973 - Third Sacred Concert. Other popular and influential artists including [[John Coltrane]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Lalo Schifrin]] and [[Vince Guaraldi]] performed and recorded major sacred jazz works. Most works were in the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition but some were inspired by Asian and African religious traditions, e.g. John Contrane's \"[[A Love Supreme]],\" [[Alice Coltrane]]'s \"Universal Consciousness\", and [[Pharoah Sanders]]' \"Karma.\"\n\nThe last decades of the [[20th century]] and the first of the [[21st century]] saw continued regular composition, performance and recording of sacred jazz by established and new artists.
