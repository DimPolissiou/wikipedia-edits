As an [[SI derived unit]], it is used worldwide. In the [[United States]],<ref>https://www.vox.com/2015/2/16/8031177/america-fahrenheit</ref> the [[Bahamas]], [[Belize]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Liberia]], [[Fahrenheit]] remains the preferred scale for everyday temperature measurement. The '''degree Celsius''' (symbol: '''\u00b0C''') can refer to a specific [[temperature]] on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference between two temperatures or an [[uncertainty]]. It is named after the Swedish astronomer [[Anders Celsius]] (1701\u20131744), who developed a similar temperature scale. Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called ''centigrade'', from the Latin ''centum'', which means 100, and ''gradus'', which means steps.\n\nFrom 1743, the Celsius scale is based on 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for the freezing point of water and 100&nbsp;\u00b0C for the boiling point of water at 1&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] pressure. Prior to 1743, the scale was also based on the boiling and melting points of water, but the values were reversed (i.e. the boiling point <!-- \"boiling\" is correct, please read the paragraph -->was at 0 degrees and the melting point was at 100 degrees). The 1743 scale reversal was proposed by [[Jean-Pierre Christin]].\n\nBy international agreement, between 1954 and 2019 the unit {{em|degree Celsius}} and the Celsius scale were defined by [[absolute zero]] and the [[Triple point#Triple point of water|triple point]] of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] (VSMOW), a precisely defined water standard. This definition also precisely related the Celsius scale to the [[Kelvin]] scale, which defines the [[SI base unit]] of [[thermodynamic temperature]] with symbol K. Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, is defined as being exactly 0&nbsp;K and \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C. Until 19 May 2019, the temperature of the triple point of water was defined as exactly {{convert|273.16|K|C}}<!-- do not include Fahrenheit in \"convert\" template here - \u00b0C value is exact; \u00b0F is rounded -->.<ref name=\"BIPMbrocure\">{{cite web|url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html|title=SI brochure, section 2.1.1.5|accessdate=9 May 2008|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215600/http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html|archivedate=26 September 2007}}</ref> This means that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin are exactly the same.<ref name=\"nistphys\">{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html|title=Essentials of the SI: Base & derived units|accessdate=9 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 May 2019, the kelvin was [[2019 redefinition of SI base units#Kelvin|redefined]] so that its value is now determined by the definition of the [[Boltzmann constant]] rather than being defined by the triple point of VSMOW. This means that the triple point is now a measured value, not a defined value. The newly-defined exact value of the Boltzmann constant was selected so that the measured value of the VSMOW triple point is exactly the same as the older defined value to within the limits of accuracy of contemporary [[metrology]]. The degree Celsius remains exactly equal to the kelvin, and 0&nbsp;K remains exactly \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Celsius original thermometer.png|thumb|75px|An illustration of [[Anders Celsius]]'s original thermometer.

He also determined with remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of atmospheric pressure. He proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale, being the boiling point, would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level. This pressure is known as one [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]]. The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]]'s 10th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) later defined one standard atmosphere to equal precisely 1,013,250 [[dyne]]s per [[square centimetre|square centimeter]] (101.325&nbsp;[[kPa]]).<ref name=\"bipm 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/10/4|title=Resolution 4 of the 10th meeting of the CGPM (1954)|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1743, the [[Lyon]]nais physicist [[Jean-Pierre Christin]], permanent secretary of the ''{{ill|Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Lyon|fr|vertical-align=sup}}'', working independently of Celsius, developed a scale where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water.<ref name=\"EOC 1\">[[Don Rittner]]; Ronald A.

Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as ''degrees'' or, when greater specificity was desired, as ''degrees centigrade'' (symbol: \u00b0C). Because the term ''centigrade'' was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/10000 of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term ''centesimal degree'' (known as the ''[[gradian]]'', \"grad\" or \"gon\": 1\u1d4d = 0.9\u00b0, 100\u1d4d = 90\u00b0) was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]]. More properly, what was defined as \"centigrade\" then would now be \"''hectograde''\".\n\nTo eliminate any confusion, the 9th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] and the CIPM ([[International Committee for Weights and Measures|Comit\u00e9 international des poids et mesures]]) formally adopted \"degree Celsius\" in 1948,<ref name=\"bipmagreement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/cipm-1948.html |title=CIPM, 1948 and 9th CGPM, 1948|accessdate=9 May 2008|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}</ref>{{efn|name=OED}} formally keeping the recognized degree symbol, rather than adopting the gradian/centesimal degree symbol.\n\nFor scientific use, \"Celsius\" is the term usually used, with \"centigrade\" remaining in common but decreasing use, especially in informal contexts in English-speaking countries.<ref name=\"OED 2\">{{cite web|title=centigrade, adj. and n.|url=http://www.oed.com|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> It was not until February 1985 that the [[BBC Weather|weather forecasts issued by the BBC]] switched from \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\".<ref name=\"BBC change 1\">{{YouTube|id=9E21c02Vp9k#t=18m42s|title=1985 BBC Special: A Change In The Weather}}</ref>\n\n===Common temperatures===\nSome key temperatures relating the Celsius scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Key scale relations\n|-\n! !!

Thus, besides expressing specific temperatures along its scale (e.g. \"[[Gallium]] melts at 29.7646&nbsp;\u00b0C\" and \"The temperature outside is 23 degrees Celsius\"), the degree Celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature ''intervals'': differences between temperatures or their uncertainties (e.g. \"The output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees Celsius\", and \"Our standard uncertainty is \u00b13&nbsp;\u00b0C\").<ref name=\"bipm 3\">Decision #3 of [http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/13/3/ Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM].</ref> Because of this dual usage, one must not rely upon the unit name or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval; it must be unambiguous through context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval.{{efn|name=bipm-4}} This is sometimes solved by using the symbol \u00b0C (pronounced \"degrees Celsius\") for a temperature, and C\u00b0 (pronounced \"Celsius degrees\") for a temperature interval, although this usage is non-standard.<ref name=\"UPWMP 1\">H.D.

Addison Wesley. p. 573.</ref> Another way to express the same is \"40\u00b0C \u00b1 3 K\", which can be commonly found in literature.\n\nCelsius measurement follows an [[level of measurement#Interval scale|interval system]] but not a [[level of measurement#Ratio scale|ratio system]]; and it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale. For example, an object at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C does not have twice the energy of when it is 10&nbsp;\u00b0C; and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C is not the lowest Celsius value. Thus, degrees Celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance.<ref name=\"BAGTDAAD 1\">This fact is demonstrated in the book ''Biostatistics: A Guide to Design, Analysis, and Discovery'' By Ronald N. Forthofer, Eun Sul Lee and Mike Hernandez</ref>\n\n==Coexistence of Kelvin and Celsius scales==\nIn science and in engineering, the Celsius scale and the Kelvin scale are often used in combination in close contexts, e.g. \"a measured value was 0.01023&nbsp;\u00b0C with an uncertainty of 70&nbsp;\u00b5K\". This practice is permissible because the magnitude of the degree Celsius is equal to that of the kelvin. Notwithstanding the official endorsement provided by decision #3 of Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM,<ref>http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/13/3/</ref> which stated \"a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees Celsius\", the practice of simultaneously using both \u00b0C and K remains widespread throughout the scientific world as the use of [[Metric prefix#List of SI prefixes|SI-prefixed]] forms of the degree Celsius (such as \"\u00b5\u00b0C\" or \"microdegrees Celsius\") to express a temperature interval has not been well-adopted.\n\n==Melting and boiling points of water==\nThe melting and boiling points of water are no longer part of the definition of the Celsius scale. In 1948, the definition was changed to use the triple point of water.<ref name=\"bipm3res\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/3|title=Resolution 3 of the 9th CGPM (1948)|accessdate=9 May 2008|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}</ref>  In 2005 the definition was further refined to use water with precisely defined isotopic composition (VSMOW) for the triple point. In 2019, the definition was changed to use the [[Boltzmann constant]], completely decoupling the definition of the kelvin from the [[Water (properties)|properties of water]]. Each of these formal definitions left the numerical values of the Celsius scale identical to the prior definition to within the limits of accuracy of the [[metrology]] of the time.\n\nWhen the melting and boiling points of water ceased being part of the definition, they became measured quantities instead. This is also true of the triple point. \n\nIn 1948 when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures ([[CGPM]]) in Resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point was so close to being 0.01&nbsp;\u00b0C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as precisely 0.01&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, later measurements showed that the difference between the triple and melting points of VSMOW is actually very slightly (<0.001&nbsp;\u00b0C) greater than 0.01&nbsp;\u00b0C. Thus, the actual melting point of ice is very slightly (less than a thousandth of a degree) below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. Also, defining water's triple point at 273.16&nbsp;K precisely defined the magnitude of each 1&nbsp;\u00b0C increment in terms of the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute thermodynamic temperature scale]] (referencing absolute zero). Now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water, the value \"100&nbsp;\u00b0C\" is hotter than 0&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 in absolute terms \u2013 by a factor of ''precisely'' {{sfrac|373.15|273.15}} (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering ''strictly'' to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW under one standard atmosphere of pressure was actually 373.1339&nbsp;K (99.9839&nbsp;\u00b0C). When calibrated to [[International Temperature Scale of 1990|ITS-90]] (a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW was slightly less, about 99.974&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"LSBU 1\">Citation: London South Bank University, [http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html#c1 ''Water Structure and Behavior, notes c1 and c2'']</ref>\n\nThis boiling-point difference of 16.1 millikelvins between the Celsius scale's original definition and the previous one (based on absolute zero and the triple point) has little practical meaning in common daily applications because water's boiling point is very sensitive to variations in [[barometric pressure]].

The OED also cites this 1928 reporting of a temperature: \"My altitude was about 5,800 metres, the temperature was 28\u00b0 Celsius.\" However, dictionaries seek to find the earliest use of a word or term and are not a useful resource as regards to the terminology used throughout the history of science. According to several writings of Dr. Terry Quinn CBE FRS, Director of the BIPM (1988\u20132004), including {{cite web|url= http://www.imeko.org/publications/tc12-2004/IMEKO-TC12-2004-PL-001.pdf |title=Temperature Scales from the early days of thermometry to the 21st century}}&nbsp;{{small|(146&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} as well as ''Temperature'' (2nd Edition/1990/Academic Press/0125696817), the term ''Celsius'' in connection with the centigrade scale was not used whatsoever by the scientific or thermometry communities until after the CIPM and CGPM adopted the term in 1948. The BIPM was not even aware that \"degree Celsius\" was in sporadic, non-scientific use before that time. It is also noteworthy that the twelve-volume, 1933 edition of OED didn't even have a listing for the word ''Celsius'' (but did have listings for both ''centigrade'' and ''centesimal'' in the context of temperature measurement). The 1948 adoption of ''Celsius'' accomplished three objectives:\n:1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All common temperature scales would have their units named after someone closely associated with them; namely, Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, R\u00e9aumur and Rankine.\n:2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the important contribution of Linnaeus who gave the Celsius scale its modern form, Celsius's name was the obvious choice because it began with the letter C. Thus, the symbol \u00b0C that for centuries had been used in association with the name ''centigrade'' could remain in use and would simultaneously inherit an intuitive association with the new name.\n:3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new name eliminated the ambiguity of the term \"centigrade\", freeing it to refer exclusively to the French-language name for the unit of angular measurement.}}\n\n{{efn |name=VSMOW-1 |1=For [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] at one [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (101.325 kPa) when calibrated solely per the two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature.

However, the current definition results in a boiling point that is actually 16.1&nbsp;mK less. For more about the actual boiling point of water, see [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water#VSMOW in temperature measurement|VSMOW in temperature measurement]].

The '''degree Celsius''' (symbol: '''\u00b0C''') can refer to a specific [[temperature]] on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference between two temperatures or an [[uncertainty]]. It is named after the Swedish astronomer [[Anders Celsius]] (1701\u20131744), who developed a similar temperature scale. Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called ''centigrade'', from the Latin ''centum'', which means 100, and ''gradus'', which means steps.\n\nFrom 1743, the Celsius scale is based on 0&nbsp;\u00b0C for the freezing point of water and 100&nbsp;\u00b0C for the boiling point of water at 1&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] pressure. Prior to 1743, the scale was also based on the boiling and melting points of water, but the values were reversed (i.e. the boiling point <!-- \"boiling\" is correct, please read the paragraph -->was at 0 degrees and the melting point was at 100 degrees). The 1743 scale reversal was proposed by [[Jean-Pierre Christin]].\n\nBy international agreement, between 1954 and 2019 the unit {{em|degree Celsius}} and the Celsius scale were defined by [[absolute zero]] and the [[Triple point#Triple point of water|triple point]] of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] (VSMOW), a precisely defined water standard. This definition also precisely related the Celsius scale to the [[Kelvin]] scale, which defines the [[SI base unit]] of [[thermodynamic temperature]] with symbol K. Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, is defined as being exactly 0&nbsp;K and \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C. Until 19 May 2019, the temperature of the triple point of water was defined as exactly {{convert|273.16|K|C}}<!-- do not include Fahrenheit in \"convert\" template here - \u00b0C value is exact; \u00b0F is rounded -->.<ref name=\"BIPMbrocure\">{{cite web|url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html|title=SI brochure, section 2.1.1.5|accessdate=9 May 2008|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215600/http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html|archivedate=26 September 2007}}</ref> This means that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin are exactly the same.<ref name=\"nistphys\">{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html|title=Essentials of the SI: Base & derived units|accessdate=9 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 May 2019, the kelvin was [[2019 redefinition of SI base units#Kelvin|redefined]] so that its value is now determined by the definition of the [[Boltzmann constant]] rather than being defined by the triple point of VSMOW. This means that the triple point is now a measured value, not a defined value. The newly-defined exact value of the Boltzmann constant was selected so that the measured value of the VSMOW triple point is exactly the same as the older defined value to within the limits of accuracy of contemporary [[metrology]]. The degree Celsius remains exactly equal to the kelvin, and 0&nbsp;K remains exactly \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Celsius original thermometer.png|thumb|75px|An illustration of [[Anders Celsius]]'s original thermometer.

He also determined with remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of atmospheric pressure. He proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale, being the boiling point, would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level. This pressure is known as one [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]].

Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as ''degrees'' or, when greater specificity was desired, as ''degrees centigrade'' (symbol: \u00b0C). Because the term ''centigrade'' was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/10000 of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term ''centesimal degree'' (known as the ''[[gradian]]'', \"grad\" or \"gon\": 1\u1d4d = 0.9\u00b0, 100\u1d4d = 90\u00b0) was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]]. More properly, what was defined as \"centigrade\" then would now be \"''hectograde''\".\n\nTo eliminate any confusion, the 9th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] and the CIPM ([[International Committee for Weights and Measures|Comit\u00e9 international des poids et mesures]]) formally adopted \"degree Celsius\" in 1948,<ref name=\"bipmagreement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/cipm-1948.html |title=CIPM, 1948 and 9th CGPM, 1948|accessdate=9 May 2008|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}</ref>{{efn|name=OED}} formally keeping the recognized degree symbol, rather than adopting the gradian/centesimal degree symbol.\n\nFor scientific use, \"Celsius\" is the term usually used, with \"centigrade\" remaining in common but decreasing use, especially in informal contexts in English-speaking countries.<ref name=\"OED 2\">{{cite web|title=centigrade, adj. and n.|url=http://www.oed.com|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> It was not until February 1985 that the [[BBC Weather|weather forecasts issued by the BBC]] switched from \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\".<ref name=\"BBC change 1\">{{YouTube|id=9E21c02Vp9k#t=18m42s|title=1985 BBC Special: A Change In The Weather}}</ref>\n\n===Common temperatures===\nSome key temperatures relating the Celsius scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Key scale relations\n|-\n! !!

Thus, besides expressing specific temperatures along its scale (e.g. \"[[Gallium]] melts at 29.7646&nbsp;\u00b0C\" and \"The temperature outside is 23 degrees Celsius\"), the degree Celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature ''intervals'': differences between temperatures or their uncertainties (e.g. \"The output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees Celsius\", and \"Our standard uncertainty is \u00b13&nbsp;\u00b0C\").<ref name=\"bipm 3\">Decision #3 of [http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/13/3/ Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM].</ref> Because of this dual usage, one must not rely upon the unit name or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval; it must be unambiguous through context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval.{{efn|name=bipm-4}} This is sometimes solved by using the symbol \u00b0C (pronounced \"degrees Celsius\") for a temperature, and C\u00b0 (pronounced \"Celsius degrees\") for a temperature interval, although this usage is non-standard.<ref name=\"UPWMP 1\">H.D. Young, R.&nbsp;A. Freedman (2008). University Physics with Modern Physics (12th ed.). Addison Wesley. p. 573.</ref> Another way to express the same is \"40\u00b0C \u00b1 3 K\", which can be commonly found in literature.\n\nCelsius measurement follows an [[level of measurement#Interval scale|interval system]] but not a [[level of measurement#Ratio scale|ratio system]]; and it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale. For example, an object at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C does not have twice the energy of when it is 10&nbsp;\u00b0C; and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C is not the lowest Celsius value. Thus, degrees Celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance.<ref name=\"BAGTDAAD 1\">This fact is demonstrated in the book ''Biostatistics: A Guide to Design, Analysis, and Discovery'' By Ronald N. Forthofer, Eun Sul Lee and Mike Hernandez</ref>\n\n==Coexistence of Kelvin and Celsius scales==\nIn science and in engineering, the Celsius scale and the Kelvin scale are often used in combination in close contexts, e.g. \"a measured value was 0.01023&nbsp;\u00b0C with an uncertainty of 70&nbsp;\u00b5K\". This practice is permissible because the magnitude of the degree Celsius is equal to that of the kelvin. Notwithstanding the official endorsement provided by decision #3 of Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM,<ref>http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/13/3/</ref> which stated \"a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees Celsius\", the practice of simultaneously using both \u00b0C and K remains widespread throughout the scientific world as the use of [[Metric prefix#List of SI prefixes|SI-prefixed]] forms of the degree Celsius (such as \"\u00b5\u00b0C\" or \"microdegrees Celsius\") to express a temperature interval has not been well-adopted.\n\n==Melting and boiling points of water==\nThe melting and boiling points of water are no longer part of the definition of the Celsius scale. In 1948, the definition was changed to use the triple point of water.<ref name=\"bipm3res\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/3|title=Resolution 3 of the 9th CGPM (1948)|accessdate=9 May 2008|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}</ref>  In 2005 the definition was further refined to use water with precisely defined isotopic composition (VSMOW) for the triple point. In 2019, the definition was changed to use the [[Boltzmann constant]], completely decoupling the definition of the kelvin from the [[Water (properties)|properties of water]]. Each of these formal definitions left the numerical values of the Celsius scale identical to the prior definition to within the limits of accuracy of the [[metrology]] of the time.\n\nWhen the melting and boiling points of water ceased being part of the definition, they became measured quantities instead. This is also true of the triple point. \n\nIn 1948 when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures ([[CGPM]]) in Resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point was so close to being 0.01&nbsp;\u00b0C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as precisely 0.01&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, later measurements showed that the difference between the triple and melting points of VSMOW is actually very slightly (<0.001&nbsp;\u00b0C) greater than 0.01&nbsp;\u00b0C. Thus, the actual melting point of ice is very slightly (less than a thousandth of a degree) below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. Also, defining water's triple point at 273.16&nbsp;K precisely defined the magnitude of each 1&nbsp;\u00b0C increment in terms of the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute thermodynamic temperature scale]] (referencing absolute zero). Now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water, the value \"100&nbsp;\u00b0C\" is hotter than 0&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 in absolute terms \u2013 by a factor of ''precisely'' {{sfrac|373.15|273.15}} (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering ''strictly'' to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW under one standard atmosphere of pressure was actually 373.1339&nbsp;K (99.9839&nbsp;\u00b0C). When calibrated to [[International Temperature Scale of 1990|ITS-90]] (a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW was slightly less, about 99.974&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"LSBU 1\">Citation: London South Bank University, [http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html#c1 ''Water Structure and Behavior, notes c1 and c2'']</ref>\n\nThis boiling-point difference of 16.1 millikelvins between the Celsius scale's original definition and the previous one (based on absolute zero and the triple point) has little practical meaning in common daily applications because water's boiling point is very sensitive to variations in [[barometric pressure]]. For example, an altitude change of only 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) causes the boiling point to change by one millikelvin.\n{{temperature}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Comparison of temperature scales]]\n*[[Degree of frost]]\n*[[International Temperature Scale of 1990|ITS-90]] \n*[[R\u00e9aumur scale]] \n*[[Thermodynamic temperature]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist |notes=\n{{efn |name=OED |1=According to ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' (OED), the term \"Celsius' thermometer\" had been used at least as early as 1797. Further, the term \"The Celsius or Centigrade thermometer\" was again used in reference to a particular type of thermometer at least as early as 1850. The OED also cites this 1928 reporting of a temperature: \"My altitude was about 5,800 metres, the temperature was 28\u00b0 Celsius.\" However, dictionaries seek to find the earliest use of a word or term and are not a useful resource as regards to the terminology used throughout the history of science. According to several writings of Dr. Terry Quinn CBE FRS, Director of the BIPM (1988\u20132004), including {{cite web|url= http://www.imeko.org/publications/tc12-2004/IMEKO-TC12-2004-PL-001.pdf |title=Temperature Scales from the early days of thermometry to the 21st century}}&nbsp;{{small|(146&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} as well as ''Temperature'' (2nd Edition/1990/Academic Press/0125696817), the term ''Celsius'' in connection with the centigrade scale was not used whatsoever by the scientific or thermometry communities until after the CIPM and CGPM adopted the term in 1948. The BIPM was not even aware that \"degree Celsius\" was in sporadic, non-scientific use before that time. It is also noteworthy that the twelve-volume, 1933 edition of OED didn't even have a listing for the word ''Celsius'' (but did have listings for both ''centigrade'' and ''centesimal'' in the context of temperature measurement). The 1948 adoption of ''Celsius'' accomplished three objectives:\n:1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All common temperature scales would have their units named after someone closely associated with them; namely, Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, R\u00e9aumur and Rankine.\n:2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the important contribution of Linnaeus who gave the Celsius scale its modern form, Celsius's name was the obvious choice because it began with the letter C. Thus, the symbol \u00b0C that for centuries had been used in association with the name ''centigrade'' could remain in use and would simultaneously inherit an intuitive association with the new name.\n:3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new name eliminated the ambiguity of the term \"centigrade\", freeing it to refer exclusively to the French-language name for the unit of angular measurement.}}\n\n{{efn |name=VSMOW-1 |1=For [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] at one [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (101.325 kPa) when calibrated solely per the two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature. Older definitions of the Celsius scale once defined the boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere as being precisely 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, the current definition results in a boiling point that is actually 16.1&nbsp;mK less. For more about the actual boiling point of water, see [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water#VSMOW in temperature measurement|VSMOW in temperature measurement]]. A different approximation uses [[ITS-90]], which approximates the temperature to 99.974 \u00b0C}}\n\n{{efn |name=bipm-4 |1=In 1948, [http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/7 Resolution 7 of the 9th CGPM] stated, <span style=\"color:#721F01;\">\"To indicate a temperature interval or difference, rather than a temperature, the word 'degree' in full, or the abbreviation 'deg' must be used.\"</span> This resolution was abrogated in 1967/1968 by [http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/13/3/ Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM], which stated that <span style=\"color:#721F01;\">[\"The names \"degree Kelvin\" and \"degree\", the symbols \"\u00b0K\" and \"deg\" and the rules for their use given in Resolution 7 of the 9th CGPM (1948),] ...and the designation of the unit to express an interval or a difference of temperatures are abrogated, but the usages which derive from these decisions remain permissible for the time being.\"</span> Consequently, there is now wide freedom in usage regarding how to indicate a temperature interval. The most important thing is that one's intention must be clear and the basic rule of the SI must be followed; namely that the unit name or its symbol must not be relied upon to indicate the nature of the quantity. Thus, if a temperature interval is, say, 10&nbsp;K or 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (which may be written 10 kelvins or 10 degrees Celsius), it must be unambiguous through obvious context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval.

The Senate comprises 40 elected members from 40 single-member senatorial districts in the state. Descended from the colonial legislature, the current Massachusetts Senate was established in June 1780 upon the adoption of the [[Massachusetts Constitution]]. The first General Court met in October 1780 and consisted of one-year elected terms for both houses. This was expanded to two-year terms starting with the 142nd General Court in January 1921.

Other versions include [[stainless steel]], insulated presses designed to keep the coffee hot, similar in design to [[thermos]] flasks. One variation uses a \"pull\" design: the coffee grounds are placed in a mesh basket, which is then pulled into the lid after brewing, trapping the grounds out of the coffee. Others produce a similar effect by having shutters that can be closed via the top of the press, sealing the grounds off from the coffee entirely. French presses are also sometimes used to make [[cold brew coffee]].\n\n==Tea==\nIn the same way as coffee, a French press can also be used in place of a [[tea infuser]] to brew loose [[tea]]. To some extent the tea will continue to steep even after the plunger is depressed, which may cause the tea remaining in the press to become bitter.

The islands had a very high number of German soldiers compared to the civilian population, one soldier for every 2-3 civilians, which reduced options; this linked to the severe penalties imposed by the occupiers meant that only forms of non-lethal [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] were used by the population. Even so, over twenty civilians died for resistance against the occupiers.\n\n[[File:Plaque prison German occupation Jersey.jpg|thumb|Plaque: \"During the period of the German occupation of Jersey, from 1 July 1940 to 9 May 1945, many inhabitants were imprisoned for acts of protest and defiance against the Occupation Forces in H.M.

The ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' (Lightning War) tactics took the Western powers by surprise. By the time of the resignation of the French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] on 16 June, it was obvious that Germany victory in the [[Battle of France]] was inevitable. In the Channel Islands, civilians worried about the consequences of remaining on the Islands but, to avoid panic, were told by the authorities to stay put. Senior officials were ordered to stay in order to maintain order and to keep the Government functioning. On the 15th of June, the British government decided to demilitarise the Islands, evacuating the British garrisons and leaving them undefended. The Germans were not informed however.<ref name=\"PTAPO\">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Tabb |title=A peculiar occupation |publisher=Ian Allan Publishing |ISBN=978-0711031135}}</ref>{{rp|50}} <ref name=\"Chapel\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Chapman |title=Chapel and Swastika: Methodism in the Channel Islands During the German Occupation 1940-1945 |publisher=ELSP |ISBN=978-1906641085}}</ref>{{rp|36}} Evacuation boats for civilians only became available on the 20th of June and again, to stop a panic, people were still told to remain where they were and that only women and children should be taken.

Their line of reporting was directly to the Field Commander in each Island and dealt with all crimes as well as routine traffic control and guarding installations.

Patriotic pride was bound up more in survival than in imagery of resistance. Some individuals who were later eligible for awards from the Soviet Union for their help towards Soviet prisoners were reluctant to participate in what they considered propaganda. Personal contacts between fugitive prisoners and the families that had helped them were in some cases maintained after the war despite the [[Cold War]] and the barriers to communication. Communists and [[Conscientious objection|conscientious objectors]], groups regarded with disdain by many Islanders, were among those who identified with and sympathised with fugitive workers. Others sympathised on compassionate grounds; some offering help in the way they hoped members of their own family caught up in the war might be treated by others wherever they might be. Some saw helping fugitives as the only practical way of defying the Germans in the face of obstacles to more active forms of resistance. In other occupied countries, those who sheltered victims of Nazism were generally offering help to local deserters from forced service and Jews \u2013 mostly their friends, neighbours, family, or people from the same social milieu. With so few Jews in the community, and the forced labour situation being different, in the Channel Islands those who helped fugitives were generally harbouring strangers with whom they did not share a language.<ref name=Willmot />\n\n[[Norman Le Brocq]] of the [[Jersey Communist Party]] (JCP) led a resistance group called Jersey Democratic Movement (JDM). The resistance helped many of the Soviet forced labourers that the Germans had brought to the island. JDM, the JCP and Transport and General Workers\u2019 Union distributed propaganda. With the aid of a German deserter, Paul Mulbach, they apparently had some success in turning the soldiers of the garrison against their masters, including most notably the highest military authority in the Islands, Huffmeier. There is some evidence to suggest that they had even set a date for this mutiny (1 May 1945) but that it was rendered pointless by the suicide of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Peter Tabb suggests that they were involved in the blowing up of the Palace Hotel and of separate ammo dumps, in actual fact it is more likely that their involvement was to set fire to the hotel, and the German efforts to put out the subsequent blaze by using dynamite to create a breach between the flames were misjudged and set off charges in a neighbouring ammo dump.

Penalties if caught could be severe.\n\nResistance started very early in the occupation, a local newspaper published on 1 July 1940 the \u201cOrdre of the Kommandant of the German Forthes in occupation of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, Alderney and Sarc\u201d, using the exact spelling they were given.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/kheft05.htm |title=The First Attack on England |publisher=Calvin}}</ref>\n\nThere were no radio transmitters available to civilians in the islands as transmitters required licences,<ref name=\"RL\">{{cite book |last=Lempri\u00e9re |first=Raoul |title=History of the Channel Islands |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |ISBN=978-0709142522}}</ref>{{rp|216}} so all owners were known to the authorities, nor was any attempt made by the British to deliver a radio to the islands. The islands stayed isolated and out of contact with Britain throughout the occupation.\n\n===Inherent resistance===\n\nThe physical location of the Islands, the loyalty of the Islanders to the British Crown and the fact that it was the only part of \"British\" territory that was captured by the German forces,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/occupation_channel_islands |title=German Occupation of the Channel Islands |publisher=BBC }}</ref> resulted in a strong desire, especially by Hitler himself, to defend and spend excessive amounts of time and energy on the Islands. The \"Festung\" books, hand created with coloured drawings for Hitler, showing in great detail the Islands defences are testament to his interest in the Islands.\n\nAn important military consequence of the occupation and fortification of the Channel Islands was the deployment of very large numbers of German troops and high usage of slave labour relative to the minor amount of military resources and strategic value they held.  This became evident in July 1944, shortly after the [[D-Day]] landings and the subsequent [[St Lo]] breakout.  As the Allies simply chose to bypass the Islands, and many of the arguably far more militarily-significant French coastal ports such as [[St Nazaire]], [[Lorient]], [[Brest, France|Brest]], and [[St Malo]] as well, all of which Hitler had previously ordered to be defended and held at all costs and consequently all of which were all heavily garrisoned, this meant that well over 100,000 German troops which could otherwise have served to help to defend Occupied France (and subsequently Germany itself), at a time when Germans forces on the Western Front were suffering from a massive shortage of manpower, were tied down in positions which were essentially militarily useless.  The German historian Joachim Ludewig estimates from his study of German archival records that in the middle of 1944 the Channel Islands occupation alone was responsible for over 30,000 such misdeployed troops.<ref>''R\u00fcckzug'' (Retreat), Joachim Ludewig, Rombach GmbHm, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1991, Eng. trans. \u00a9 2012 The [[University Press of Kentucky]], {{ISBN|978-0-8131-4079-7}}, pp. 37-41.</ref> Around 500 Germans had died in the Channel Islands.<ref name=PTAPO/>{{rp|218}}\n\n===Passive resistance===\n\nSome defiance or passive resistance was very minor and personal to each activist, from crossing a road to avoid meeting a German soldier on a pavement,  knocking on a door using the [[morse code]] letter V '''\u2022\u2022\u2022-''', breaking a used matchstick into a \"V\" shape, to providing a crust of food to a starving forced worker.\n\n[[Guernsey Press and Star|The ''Guernsey Evening Press'' and ''The Star'']], subject to censorship from the German authorities, continued to publish, eventually on alternate days given the shortage of materials and staff available. After the Germans temporarily removed the editor of ''The Star'', Bill Taylor, from his position, following an article which they deemed offensive, it was edited by Frank Falla. Falla was a key member of the Guernsey \"Resistance\", being involved in the Guernsey Underground News Sheet (which went by the acronym GUNS). GUNS published BBC news, illegally received, typed on a single news sheet using tomato packing paper. According to his memoirs, through strategic placement of stories handed to him by the German authorities in ''The Star'', he allowed islanders to distinguish easily between German news and stories emanating from Guernsey journalists. Falla was eventually betrayed by an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[collaborationism|collaborator]] and, along with his peers who helped to produce GUNS, was deported to Germany. Falla survived, though other members of the organisation did not return from Germany.<ref>{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Falla |title=The Silent War (4th edition) |publisher=Blue Ormer |location=Guernsey |oclc=1053852898 |date=2018}}</ref>\n\nA shortage of [[Jersey pound|coinage in Jersey]] (partly caused by occupying troops taking away coins as souvenirs) led to the passing of the ''Currency Notes (Jersey) Law'' on 29 April 1941. A series of two [[shilling]] notes (blue lettering on orange paper) was issued. The law was amended on 29 November 1941 to provide for further issues of notes of various denominations, and a series of banknotes designed by [[Edmund Blampied]] was issued by the States of Jersey in denominations of 6 pence (6d), 1, 2 and 10 shillings (10/\u2013) and 1 pound (\u00a31). The 6d note was designed by Blampied in such a way that the word ''six'' on the reverse incorporated an outsized \"X\" so that when the note was folded, the result was the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] symbol [[V sign|\"V\" for victory]].<ref>''Edmund Blampied'', Marguerite Syvret, London 1986 {{ISBN|0-906030-20-X}}</ref>  A year later he was asked to design six new postage stamps for the island, in denominations of \u00bdd to 3d.

The German authorities buried them with full military honours.

At first, the Germans followed a policy of presenting a non-threatening presence to the resident population for its propaganda value ahead of an eventual invasion and occupation of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://museums.gov.gg/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=76718&p=0 |title=1940- 45 OCCUPATION OF GUERNSEY BY GERMAN FORCES |publisher=Guernsey Museum}}</ref> Many Islanders were willing to go along with the necessities of Occupation as long as they felt the Germans were behaving in a correct and legal way. Two events particularly jolted many Islanders out of this passive attitude: the confiscation of radios, and the deportation of large sections of the populations.<ref name=Willmot />\n\nListening to [[BBC]] Radio had been banned in the first few weeks of the occupation and then (surprisingly given the policy elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe) tolerated for a period before being once again prohibited. In 1942 the ban became draconian, with all radio listening (even to [[William Joyce|German stations]]) being banned by the occupiers, a ban backed up by the confiscation of wireless sets.<ref name=RL/>{{rp|223}}\n\nDenied access to BBC broadcasts, the populations of the Islands felt increased resentment against the Germans and increasingly sought to undermine the rules. Hidden radio receivers and underground news distribution networks spread. Nevertheless, many islanders successfully hid their radios (or replaced them with homemade [[crystal set]]s) and continued listening to the BBC despite the risk of being discovered by the Germans or being informed on by neighbours.<ref>Bunting (1995); Maughan (1980)</ref> The regular raids by German personnel hunting for radios further alienated the occupied civilian populations.<ref name=Willmot />\n\nIn September 1941 the British War Cabinet ordered German civilians in [[Iran|Persia]] to be interned, which was against international law. Hitler in response ordered the internment of British civilians, most of which were to be found in the Channel Islands. 10 British for 1 German and shipped to the [[Pinsk Marshes|Pripet Marshes]]. The Islands had been ordered to carry out a census, so the Germans knew the place of birth of every Islander. Such a reprisal act was against international law. The Germans in the islands delayed, however in August 1942 Hitler was reminded of the issue by a Swiss trying to arrange an exchange of prisoners for British civilians and reissued his order when he found his initial 1941 order had not been acted upon.<ref name=JNJ&J/>\n \nThe deportations of 2,058 men, women, children and babies in September 1942, which triggered suicides in Guernsey, Sark and Jersey,<ref name=JNJ&J/> sparked the first mass demonstrations of [[patriotism]] of the Occupation. The illegality and injustice of the measure, which contrasted with the Germans' earlier showy insistence on legality and correctness, outraged those who remained behind and encouraged many to turn a blind eye to the resistance activities of others in passive support.<ref name=Willmot /><ref name=BBC1014/> The deportees were sent to camps in Germany, sailing off singing patriotic songs, including [[There'll Always Be an England]] and [[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]].<ref name=JNJ&J/>{{rp|84}}\n\nFurther resentment was caused by a second deportation of 187 that occurred in early 1943, following a commando raid on Sark, [[Operation Basalt]] which resulted in captive German soldiers being killed while trying to escape.\n\nThe sight of brutality against slave workers brought home to many Islanders the reality of Nazi ideology behind the punctilious fa\u00e7ade of the Occupation. [[Forced march]]es between camps and work sites by wretched workers and open public beatings rendered visible the brutality of the r\u00e9gime.<ref name=Willmot />\n\nThe rotation of German soldiers, with first grade men being gradually downgraded until many soldiers were non-German, ex-Russian prisoners appeared in German uniform resulted in a reduction in morals and an increase in crimes, often linked to the soldiers' hunger, including murders.<ref name=\"PKCIW\">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=King |title=The Channel Islands War |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd; First edition (Jun. 1991)  |ISBN=978-0709045120}}</ref>{{rp|26}}\n\nFollowing the Normandy invasion in June 1944, many changes to attitude occurred, prisoners could no longer be sent to France, similarly, no supplies could be received into the Islands. Both sides realised that the writing was on the wall for Germany and the Island authorities could become less subservient and more demanding in requests, such as the request for [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] assistance. The Germans were agreeing to more of these requests. Even Britain changed its attitude, previous requests for Red Cross help being refused with Churchill, on 27 September 1944, writing a note saying: ''Let them starve. No fighting. They can rot at their leisure.''<ref name=JNJ&J/>{{rp|100}}\n\nThere is little evidence of \"eleventh hour resistors\" towards the end of the war, as in other countries. The Islanders had been bypassed by the war, they were tired and very hungry during the winter of 1944\u20131945, they knew there was little they could do to help the war effort, so patiently awaited the liberation. Each arrival of the [[SS Vega (1913)|SS ''Vega'']] gave brief opportunities to celebrate. During April 1945 British flags started to appear, and the public was warned not to aggravate the Germans. The true feelings of Islanders burst out into the open on 9 May 1945 when they were [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmeMAMla5fU finally liberated] <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmeMAMla5fU |title=Liberation of the Channel Islands in 1945}}</ref>\n\nThere is no doubt that the Islands were an embarrassment to Churchill.

The ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' (Lightning War) tactics took the Western powers by surprise. By the time of the resignation of the French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] on 16 June, it was obvious that Germany victory in the [[Battle of France]] was inevitable. In the Channel Islands, civilians worried about the consequences of remaining on the Islands but, to avoid panic, were told by the authorities to stay put. Senior officials were ordered to stay in order to maintain order and to keep the Government functioning. On the 15th of June, the British government decided to demilitarise the Islands, evacuating the British garrisons and leaving them undefended.

Patriotic pride was bound up more in survival than in imagery of resistance. Some individuals who were later eligible for awards from the Soviet Union for their help towards Soviet prisoners were reluctant to participate in what they considered propaganda. Personal contacts between fugitive prisoners and the families that had helped them were in some cases maintained after the war despite the [[Cold War]] and the barriers to communication. Communists and [[Conscientious objection|conscientious objectors]], groups regarded with disdain by many Islanders, were among those who identified with and sympathised with fugitive workers. Others sympathised on compassionate grounds; some offering help in the way they hoped members of their own family caught up in the war might be treated by others wherever they might be. Some saw helping fugitives as the only practical way of defying the Germans in the face of obstacles to more active forms of resistance. In other occupied countries, those who sheltered victims of Nazism were generally offering help to local deserters from forced service and Jews \u2013 mostly their friends, neighbours, family, or people from the same social milieu. With so few Jews in the community, and the forced labour situation being different, in the Channel Islands those who helped fugitives were generally harbouring strangers with whom they did not share a language.<ref name=Willmot />\n\n[[Norman Le Brocq]] of the [[Jersey Communist Party]] (JCP) led a resistance group called Jersey Democratic Movement (JDM). The resistance helped many of the Soviet forced labourers that the Germans had brought to the island. JDM, the JCP and Transport and General Workers\u2019 Union distributed propaganda. With the aid of a German deserter, Paul Mulbach, they apparently had some success in turning the soldiers of the garrison against their masters, including most notably the highest military authority in the Islands, Huffmeier. There is some evidence to suggest that they had even set a date for this mutiny (1 May 1945) but that it was rendered pointless by the suicide of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Peter Tabb suggests that they were involved in the blowing up of the Palace Hotel and of separate ammo dumps, in actual fact it is more likely that their involvement was to set fire to the hotel, and the German efforts to put out the subsequent blaze by using dynamite to create a breach between the flames were misjudged and set off charges in a neighbouring ammo dump. Nevertheless, the JCP do seem to have made many plans for organised resistance.<ref name=\"Tabb, A Peculiar Occupation 2005\">Tabb, A Peculiar Occupation, (Jersey 2005)</ref>\n\n==Escapees==\n\nA total of 225 islanders, such as [[Peter Crill]], escaped from the islands to England or France: 150 from Jersey, and 75 from Guernsey.<ref name=Saunders /> A high number of people drowned or failed to escape and were captured.<ref name=BTOO/> Five boats left Guernsey the day after the occupation started.<ref name=SHCII/> The number of escapes increased after [[D-Day]], when conditions in the islands worsened as supply routes to the continent were cut off, the desire to join in the liberation of Europe increased and the route shortened.<ref>{{cite book |first=Roy |last=McLaughlin |title=The Sea was their Fortune |publisher=Seaflower Books 1997 |ISBN=0948578866}}</ref>{{rp|128}}\n[[File:Plaque Gorey American escapees 1945.jpg|thumb|Plaque at [[Gorey, Jersey|Gorey]]: \"Captain Ed Clark, Lieutenant George Haas escaped on 19 January 1945.

The islands stayed isolated and out of contact with Britain throughout the occupation.\n\n===Inherent resistance===\n\nThe physical location of the Islands, the loyalty of the Islanders to the British Crown and the fact that it was the only part of \"British\" territory that was captured by the German forces,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/occupation_channel_islands |title=German Occupation of the Channel Islands |publisher=BBC }}</ref> resulted in a strong desire, especially by Hitler himself, to defend and spend excessive amounts of time and energy on the Islands. The \"Festung\" books, hand created with coloured drawings for Hitler, showing in great detail the Islands defences are testament to his interest in the Islands.\n\nAn important military consequence of the occupation and fortification of the Channel Islands was the deployment of very large numbers of German troops and high usage of slave labour relative to the minor amount of military resources and strategic value they held.  This became evident in July 1944, shortly after the [[D-Day]] landings and the subsequent [[St Lo]] breakout.  As the Allies simply chose to bypass the Islands, and many of the arguably far more militarily-significant French coastal ports such as [[St Nazaire]], [[Lorient]], [[Brest, France|Brest]], and [[St Malo]] as well, all of which Hitler had previously ordered to be defended and held at all costs and consequently all of which were all heavily garrisoned, this meant that well over 100,000 German troops which could otherwise have served to help to defend Occupied France (and subsequently Germany itself), at a time when Germans forces on the Western Front were suffering from a massive shortage of manpower, were tied down in positions which were essentially militarily useless.  The German historian Joachim Ludewig estimates from his study of German archival records that in the middle of 1944 the Channel Islands occupation alone was responsible for over 30,000 such misdeployed troops.<ref>''R\u00fcckzug'' (Retreat), Joachim Ludewig, Rombach GmbHm, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1991, Eng. trans. \u00a9 2012 The [[University Press of Kentucky]], {{ISBN|978-0-8131-4079-7}}, pp. 37-41.</ref> Around 500 Germans had died in the Channel Islands.<ref name=PTAPO/>{{rp|218}}\n\n===Passive resistance===\n\nSome defiance or passive resistance was very minor and personal to each activist, from crossing a road to avoid meeting a German soldier on a pavement,  knocking on a door using the [[morse code]] letter V '''\u2022\u2022\u2022-''', breaking a used matchstick into a \"V\" shape, to providing a crust of food to a starving forced worker.\n\n[[Guernsey Press and Star|The ''Guernsey Evening Press'' and ''The Star'']], subject to censorship from the German authorities, continued to publish, eventually on alternate days given the shortage of materials and staff available. After the Germans temporarily removed the editor of ''The Star'', Bill Taylor, from his position, following an article which they deemed offensive, it was edited by Frank Falla. Falla was a key member of the Guernsey \"Resistance\", being involved in the Guernsey Underground News Sheet (which went by the acronym GUNS). GUNS published BBC news, illegally received, typed on a single news sheet using tomato packing paper. According to his memoirs, through strategic placement of stories handed to him by the German authorities in ''The Star'', he allowed islanders to distinguish easily between German news and stories emanating from Guernsey journalists. Falla was eventually betrayed by an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[collaborationism|collaborator]] and, along with his peers who helped to produce GUNS, was deported to Germany. Falla survived, though other members of the organisation did not return from Germany.<ref>{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Falla |title=The Silent War (4th edition) |publisher=Blue Ormer |location=Guernsey |oclc=1053852898 |date=2018}}</ref>\n\nA shortage of [[Jersey pound|coinage in Jersey]] (partly caused by occupying troops taking away coins as souvenirs) led to the passing of the ''Currency Notes (Jersey) Law'' on 29 April 1941. A series of two [[shilling]] notes (blue lettering on orange paper) was issued. The law was amended on 29 November 1941 to provide for further issues of notes of various denominations, and a series of banknotes designed by [[Edmund Blampied]] was issued by the States of Jersey in denominations of 6 pence (6d), 1, 2 and 10 shillings (10/\u2013) and 1 pound (\u00a31). The 6d note was designed by Blampied in such a way that the word ''six'' on the reverse incorporated an outsized \"X\" so that when the note was folded, the result was the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] symbol [[V sign|\"V\" for victory]].<ref>''Edmund Blampied'', Marguerite Syvret, London 1986 {{ISBN|0-906030-20-X}}</ref>  A year later he was asked to design six new postage stamps for the island, in denominations of \u00bdd to 3d.

The German authorities buried them with full military honours. The funerals became an opportunity for some of the islanders to demonstrate their loyalty to Britain and their opposition to the occupiers: around 5,000 of the 23,000 Islanders attended the funeral, laying some 900 wreaths \u2013 enough of a demonstration against the Occupation for subsequent military funerals to be closed to civilians by the German occupiers.<ref name=\"NH2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW2Ships-CharybdisAsr.htm|title= H.M.S.

As many of the German soldiers were familiar with both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], the indigenous languages enjoyed a brief revival as islanders sought to converse without the Germans understanding.\n\n===Active resistance===\n\nThere was no armed [[resistance movement]] in the Channel Islands. This has been ascribed to a range of factors including the demilitarisation of the Islands by the British government in 1940, the physical separation of the islands, the density of troops (up to one German for every two islanders), the small size of the islands precluding any hiding places for resistance groups,<ref name=JNJ&J/>{{rp|174}} and the absence of the [[Gestapo]] from the occupying forces.

At first, the Germans followed a policy of presenting a non-threatening presence to the resident population for its propaganda value ahead of an eventual invasion and occupation of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://museums.gov.gg/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=76718&p=0 |title=1940- 45 OCCUPATION OF GUERNSEY BY GERMAN FORCES |publisher=Guernsey Museum}}</ref> Many Islanders were willing to go along with the necessities of Occupation as long as they felt the Germans were behaving in a correct and legal way. Two events particularly jolted many Islanders out of this passive attitude: the confiscation of radios, and the deportation of large sections of the populations.<ref name=Willmot />\n\nListening to [[BBC]] Radio had been banned in the first few weeks of the occupation and then (surprisingly given the policy elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe) tolerated for a period before being once again prohibited. In 1942 the ban became draconian, with all radio listening (even to [[William Joyce|German stations]]) being banned by the occupiers, a ban backed up by the confiscation of wireless sets.<ref name=RL/>{{rp|223}}\n\nDenied access to BBC broadcasts, the populations of the Islands felt increased resentment against the Germans and increasingly sought to undermine the rules. Hidden radio receivers and underground news distribution networks spread. Nevertheless, many islanders successfully hid their radios (or replaced them with homemade [[crystal set]]s) and continued listening to the BBC despite the risk of being discovered by the Germans or being informed on by neighbours.<ref>Bunting (1995); Maughan (1980)</ref> The regular raids by German personnel hunting for radios further alienated the occupied civilian populations.<ref name=Willmot />\n\nIn September 1941 the British War Cabinet ordered German civilians in [[Iran|Persia]] to be interned, which was against international law. Hitler in response ordered the internment of British civilians, most of which were to be found in the Channel Islands. 10 British for 1 German and shipped to the [[Pinsk Marshes|Pripet Marshes]]. The Islands had been ordered to carry out a census, so the Germans knew the place of birth of every Islander. Such a reprisal act was against international law. The Germans in the islands delayed, however in August 1942 Hitler was reminded of the issue by a Swiss trying to arrange an exchange of prisoners for British civilians and reissued his order when he found his initial 1941 order had not been acted upon.<ref name=JNJ&J/>\n \nThe deportations of 2,058 men, women, children and babies in September 1942, which triggered suicides in Guernsey, Sark and Jersey,<ref name=JNJ&J/> sparked the first mass demonstrations of [[patriotism]] of the Occupation. The illegality and injustice of the measure, which contrasted with the Germans' earlier showy insistence on legality and correctness, outraged those who remained behind and encouraged many to turn a blind eye to the resistance activities of others in passive support.<ref name=Willmot /><ref name=BBC1014/> The deportees were sent to camps in Germany, sailing off singing patriotic songs, including [[There'll Always Be an England]] and [[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]].<ref name=JNJ&J/>{{rp|84}}\n\nFurther resentment was caused by a second deportation of 187 that occurred in early 1943, following a commando raid on Sark, [[Operation Basalt]] which resulted in captive German soldiers being killed while trying to escape.\n\nThe sight of brutality against slave workers brought home to many Islanders the reality of Nazi ideology behind the punctilious fa\u00e7ade of the Occupation. [[Forced march]]es between camps and work sites by wretched workers and open public beatings rendered visible the brutality of the r\u00e9gime.<ref name=Willmot />\n\nThe rotation of German soldiers, with first grade men being gradually downgraded until many soldiers were non-German, ex-Russian prisoners appeared in German uniform resulted in a reduction in morals and an increase in crimes, often linked to the soldiers' hunger, including murders.<ref name=\"PKCIW\">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=King |title=The Channel Islands War |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd; First edition (Jun. 1991)  |ISBN=978-0709045120}}</ref>{{rp|26}}\n\nFollowing the Normandy invasion in June 1944, many changes to attitude occurred, prisoners could no longer be sent to France, similarly, no supplies could be received into the Islands. Both sides realised that the writing was on the wall for Germany and the Island authorities could become less subservient and more demanding in requests, such as the request for [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] assistance. The Germans were agreeing to more of these requests. Even Britain changed its attitude, previous requests for Red Cross help being refused with Churchill, on 27 September 1944, writing a note saying: ''Let them starve. No fighting. They can rot at their leisure.''<ref name=JNJ&J/>{{rp|100}}\n\nThere is little evidence of \"eleventh hour resistors\" towards the end of the war, as in other countries. The Islanders had been bypassed by the war, they were tired and very hungry during the winter of 1944-5, they knew there was little they could do to help the war effort, so patiently awaited the liberation. Each arrival of the [[SS Vega (1913)|SS ''Vega'']] gave brief opportunities to celebrate. During April 1945 British flags started to appear, and the public was warned not to aggravate the Germans. The true feelings of Islanders burst out into the open on 9 May 1945 when they were [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmeMAMla5fU finally liberated] <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmeMAMla5fU |title=Liberation of the Channel Islands in 1945}}</ref>\n\nThere is no doubt that the Islands were an embarrassment to Churchill. His \"[[We shall fight on the beaches|We will fight them on the beaches]]\" speech was certainly not taken up in the Channel Islands. However it was the British Government that had abandoned the Islands and declared them neutral territory in June 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Model Occupation: the Channel Islands under German rule, 1940\u20131945|last=Bunting|first=Madelaine|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1995|isbn=0-00-255242-6|location=London|pages=316|via=}}</ref>\n\nKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth made a special visit to the Islands on 7 June 1945.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/channel/update/2015-04-29/liberation-stamps-revealed/ |title=Liberation stamps revealed |publisher=ITV News |date=29 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Retribution==\n\nEarly on in the war, Islanders were given a salutary lesson in resistance.

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death, and was known for an often humorous style of country music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he moved to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby.\n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], he was discovered by [[Kris Kristofferson]] (although Prine himself credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-prine-roger-ebert-first-review/|title=How an Unplanned Roger Ebert Review Launched John Prine's Career|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>), resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|self-titled debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. After receiving critical acclaim, Prine focused on his musical career, recording three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums.

{"title_page": "Tickle torture", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=July 2011}}\n\n'''Tickle torture''' is the use of [[tickling]] to abuse, dominate, harass, humiliate, or interrogate an individual. While laughter is popularly thought of as a pleasure response, in tickle torture, the one being tickled may laugh despite whether or not they find the experience pleasant. In a tickling situation, laughter can indicate a panic reflex rather than a pleasure response. Tickle torture may be a consensual activity or one that is forced, depending on the circumstances.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/science/anatomy-of-a-tickle-is-serious-business-at-the-research-lab.html|newspaper=New York Times|title=Anatomy of a Tickle Is Serious Business at the Research Lab|author=Carol Yoon|date=June 3, 1997}}</ref> In a consensual form, tickle torture may be part of a mutually fulfilling, physically-intimate act between partners. However, forced tickle torture can cause real physical and mental distress in a victim, which is why it has been used as an interrogation method or to simply show dominance over another person.\n\nThat moment when you accidentally cum in your pants and then you get naked to clean your cummed underwear but your step sis walks in and says \u201cstep bro what are you doing?\u201d So you tell her what happened but she doesn\u2019t believe you so you hit her in the head eith your PlayStation DualShock 4 Gray Camo controller then you throw her in a daycare.\n\n==In history==\n''Chinese tickle torture'' is an ancient form of torture practiced by the Chinese, in particular the courts of the [[Han Dynasty]]. Chinese tickle torture was a punishment for nobility since it left no marks and a victim could recover relatively easily and quickly.<ref name=AZ>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE2KfBWPAt0C&pg=PA183|page=183|title=A to Z of Punishment and Torture|author=Irene Thompson|isbn=978-1-84624-203-8|publisher=Book Guild Publishing|date=March 2008}}</ref>{{Self-published source|date=November 2019}}\n\nAnother example of tickle torture was used in ancient [[Rome]], where a person\u2019s feet were dipped in a salt solution, and a [[goat]] was brought in to lick the solution off. This type of tickle torture would only start as tickling, eventually becoming extremely painful.<ref name=AZ/>{{Self-published source|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{Tone|section|date=March 2009}}\n\n[[Josef Kohout]], a man persecuted in the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]] during [[World War&nbsp;II]], witnessed [[Nazi]] prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate, followed by various other tortures which resulted in his death. This incident is described in [[Heinz Heger]]'s book ''The Men With The Pink Triangle'': \"The first game that the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the [[armpit]]s, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other.

He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him....

At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967).

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

New York Times ] October 29, 1966: 1.</ref>)\n\nHamilton then made a science fiction movie for [[George Pal]] at MGM, ''[[The Power (1968 film)|The Power]]'' (1968).\n\n===Television===\nGeorge went into television in 1969, supporting [[Lana Turner]] in the all-star ABC series ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]'' (1969\u201370).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-survivors/cast/204719/|title=The Survivors (1969) Cast| website=TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the show was canceled in January 1970, George went into ''[[Paris 7000]]'' (1970). He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept [[Crash (computing)|crashing]], Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job.

Although Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company.<ref name=\"History\" /> In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in [[seed funding]], and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.<ref name=\"History\" /> After months at beta stage, the application launched in November 2009, exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend in [[Los Angeles]], Chris Peiffer, to develop a [[BlackBerry]] version, which arrived two months later.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nTo cover the primary cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one.

They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\".

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work = New Zealand Herald |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work = New Zealand Herald |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.

Proteins perform a variety of critical functions as [[enzyme|enzymes]], structural proteins or [[hormone|hormones]] and therefore, are crucial biological components.

Protein synthesis is very similar for [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s but there are distinct differences.\n\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases - [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. During transcription, a [[gene]] (section of [[DNA]]) is converted into a template molecule ([[messenger RNA]]) by enzymes, known as [[RNA polymerases]], in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. This mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore|nuclear pores]] to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. Subsequently during translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome|ribosomes]] in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid|amino acids]]. The amino acids are joined together by [[peptide bond|peptide bonds]] (a type of [[covalent bond]]) to form a polypeptide chain. \n\nFollowing translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide chain, this polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein i.e. fold to produce the functional [[active site]] of the enzyme. The incorrect folding of polypeptide chains can result in non-functional proteins, this is often caused by [[mutations]] in the underlying DNA [[nucleotide]] sequence. These mutations in the DNA change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then changes the amino acid sequence in the polypeptide chain. These mutations can cause the mRNA sequence to be shorter due to [[stop codon|earlier termination of transcription]], thereby, producing a shorter polypeptide chain. Alternatively, the mutation can just [[change the amino acid at that position|missense mutation]] in the polypeptide chain  <ref name=\"Scheper 2008\">{{cite journal |last1=Scheper |first1=Gert C. |last2=van der Knaap |first2=Marjo S. |last3=Proud |first3=Christopher G. |title=Translation matters: protein synthesis defects in inherited disease |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |date=2007 |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=711\u2013723 |doi=10.1038/nrg2142|pmid=17680008 }}</ref>. \n\nA correctly folded protein may undergo further maturation through the addition of different [[post-translational modification|post-translational modifications]], which can alter the proteins ability to function, where the protein is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the proteins ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name \"Wang 2013\"> {{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref> .\n\n\n==Transcription==\n{{main|Transcription (genetics)}}\n[[File:RNA polymerase transcribing template strand DNA.png|400px|thumb|RNA polymerase transcribes the template strand of DNA to produce the complementary messenger RNA]]\nTranscription occurs in the cell nucleus using DNA as a template to produce an RNA molecule. In eukaryotes, this RNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand.\n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of single nucleotides by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand, behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

The purpose of the 5' cap is to prevent the pre-mRNA and mature mRNA molecules from being broken down in the cell before they are translated, the cap also aids binding of the ribosome to the mRNA to start translation. In contrast, the 3' Poly(A) tail is added to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule.

In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid. \n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[Peptidyl transferase|peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases.

This mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore|nuclear pores]] to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. Subsequently during translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome|ribosomes]] in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid|amino acids]]. The amino acids are joined together by [[peptide bond|peptide bonds]] (a type of [[covalent bond]]) to form a polypeptide chain. \n\nFollowing translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide chain, this polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein i.e. fold to produce the functional [[active site]] of the enzyme. The incorrect folding of polypeptide chains can result in non-functional proteins, this is often caused by [[mutations]] in the underlying DNA [[nucleotide]] sequence.

In eukaryotes, this RNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand.\n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of single nucleotides by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand, behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome.

The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain.

The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerase.
