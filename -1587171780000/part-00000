As Liam lies in a coma, Fallon begins seeing Trixie everywhere she goes. Adam tries to kill Liam in the hospital, but is interrupted by Fallon.

She needs to keep Liam single a bit longer because he will inherit a large amount of shares in Van Kirk Industries when he marries, and would be likely to interfere with the deal. Adam insinuates himself into the planning of Cristal's fundraising gala. Dominique throws a birthday party for Michael, but Anders shows him proof that Dominique and Vanessa are manipulating him for the benefit of their show. Sam hires Ramy as Kirby's assistant, to her chagrin. Ramy steals cash from Sam's safe, and Sam and Kirby have a falling out over it. Laura is delighted when she and Blake manipulate Liam into an argument with Fallon that threatens their wedding, but it is all a ruse staged by Blake, Liam and Fallon. Cristal and Father Caleb acknowledge their attraction to each other, and Adam is watching when Caleb kisses her. Having closed her Moldavian deal quickly and on the verge of restoring Carrington Atlantic to Blake, a triumphant Laura kisses him.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Dynasty

It was released on March 27, 1991, through [[Touch and Go Records]]. Featuring dramatically alternating [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and vocals ranging from [[spoken word]] to shouting, the album contains [[narrative]] lyrics that emphasize alienation. ''Spiderland'' was Slint's first release on Touch and Go, and the group's only album to feature bassist Todd Brashear.\n\nAlthough ''Spiderland'' was not widely recognized on its initial release, it eventually sold more than 50,000 copies and became a landmark album in [[underground music]] after Slint broke up.

It was released on March 27, 1991, through [[Touch and Go Records]]. Featuring dramatically alternating [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and vocals ranging from [[spoken word]] to shouting, the album contains [[narrative]] lyrics that emphasize alienation. ''Spiderland'' was Slint's first release on Touch and Go, and the group's only album to feature Todd Brashear.\n\nAlthough ''Spiderland'' was not widely recognized on its initial release, it eventually sold more than 50,000 copies and became a landmark album in [[underground music]] after Slint broke up. The album has been influential on the styles of many bands in the [[post-rock]] genres. In 2005, 2007 and 2013\u20132014, Slint reunited for a tour consisting of performances of ''Spiderland'' in its entirety.\n\n== Background ==\n\nSlint formed in 1986 in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], from the remnants of the [[punk rock]] band [[Squirrel Bait]]; the founding members included [[Brian McMahan]] (guitar, vocals), [[David Pajo]] (guitar), [[Britt Walford]] (drums) and [[Ethan Buckler]] (bass guitar).

Member institutions are located in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], and [[Missouri]].  The MSFA was organized in 1993, and on-field competition began in 1994. The MSFA is divided into two leagues, The Mideast and the Midwest. \n\nCharter members included [[Geneva College]], [[Lindenwood University]], [[Malone University|Malone College]], [[Olivet Nazarene University]], [[Saint Xavier University]], [[Taylor University]], [[Tiffin University]], [[Trinity International University]], the [[University of Findlay]], [[Urbana University]], and [[Westminster College (Pennsylvania)|Westminster College]].\n\nMSFA member schools have won eight NAIA National Championships since the inception of the league in 1993.  An MSFA team has played in each of the last seven championships, winning six of the seven, including each of the last three.  The two MSFA division champions earn an automatic bid to the NAIA National Championship Series.\n\n==National Championship appearances==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

It is a [[plucked string instrument]] similar in appearance and construction to an [[Electric guitar|electric]] or an [[acoustic guitar]], except with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and typically four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. Since the mid-1950s, the electric bass has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]]. \n\nThe four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or [[guitar pick|striking]] with a [[plectrum|pick]]. The electric bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and must be connected to an [[Bass amplifier|amplifier and speaker]] to be loud enough to compete with other instruments.\n\n==Terminology==\nAccording to the ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', an \"Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E<sub>1</sub>'\u2013A<sub>1</sub>'\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>.\"{{sfn|Sadie|Tyrrell|2001|p=}} It also defines ''bass'' as \"Bass (iv).

In comparison with the large, heavy [[upright bass]], which had been the main bass instrument in popular music from the early 20th century to the 1940s, the bass guitar could be easily transported to shows. When amplified, the bass guitar was also less prone than acoustic basses to unwanted [[audio feedback]].{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} The addition of [[Fret|frets]] enabled bassists to play in tune more easily than on fretless acoustic or [[electric upright bass]]es, and allowed guitarists to more easily transition to the instrument.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Dave |last2=Braithwaite |first2=Laun |last3=May 13 |first3=Tim Mullally |title=1952 Fender Precision Bass |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/1952_Fender_Precision_Bass |website=www.premierguitar.com |accessdate=7 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, [[Monk Montgomery]] became the first bassist to tour with the Fender bass, in [[Lionel Hampton]]'s postwar [[big band]].{{sfn|George|1998|p=91}} Montgomery was also possibly the first to record with the electric bass, on July 2, 1953, with [[the Art Farmer Septet]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bass heroes : styles, stories & secrets of 30 great bass players : from the pages of Guitar player magazine|last=Mulhern|first=Tom|date=1993|publisher=GPI Books|isbn=0-585-34936-3|location=San Francisco|pages=165|oclc=47008985}}</ref> Roy Johnson (with Lionel Hampton), and [[Shifty Henry]] (with [[Louis Jordan]] and His [[Tympany Five]]), were other early Fender bass pioneers.{{sfn|Slog|Coryat|1999|p=154}} [[Bill Black]], who played with [[Elvis Presley]], switched from upright bass to the Fender Precision Bass around 1957.{{sfn|Bacon|2010|p=}} The bass guitar was intended to appeal to guitarists as well as upright bass players, and many early pioneers of the instrument, such as [[Carol Kaye]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Paul McCartney]] were originally guitarists.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}}\n\nAlso in 1953, [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] released the first short-scale [[violin]]-shaped electric bass, with an extendable end pin so a bassist could play it upright or horizontally. Gibson renamed the bass the [[Gibson EB-1|EB-1]] in 1958.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1958, Gibson released the maple arched-top [[Gibson EB-2|EB-2]] described in the Gibson catalog as a \"hollow-body electric bass that features a Bass/Baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics\".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1959, these were followed by the more conventional-looking [[Gibson EB-0|EB-0 Bass]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The EB-0 was very similar to a [[Gibson SG]] in appearance (although the earliest examples have a slab-sided body shape closer to that of the double-cutaway [[Les Paul]] Special).  Whereas Fender basses had pickups mounted in positions in between the base of the neck and the top of the bridge, many of Gibson's early basses featured one [[humbucker|humbucking]] pickup mounted directly against the neck pocket.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  The Fender and Gibson versions used [[Bolt-on neck|bolt-on]] and [[Set-in neck|glued-on]] necks.\n\nA number of other companies also began manufacturing bass guitars during the 1950s. 1956 saw the appearance at the German trade fair \"Musikmesse Frankfurt\" of the distinctive [[H\u00f6fner 500/1]] violin-shaped bass made using violin construction techniques by Walter [[H\u00f6fner]], a second-generation violin luthier.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The design was eventually known popularly as the \"[[The Beatles|Beatle Bass]]\", due to its endorsement and use by Beatles bassist [[Paul McCartney]]. In 1957, [[Rickenbacker]] introduced the model 4000,the first bass to feature a [[neck-through]]-body design in which the neck is part of the body wood.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} [[Kay Musical Instrument Company]] began production of the K-162 in 1952, [[Danelectro]] released the Longhorn in 1956, and [[Burns London]]/Supersound in 1958.{{sfn|Bacon|2010|p=}}\n\n=== 1960s ===\n[[File:Gibson eb3 67.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Gibson EB-3]]]]\nWith the explosion of the popularity of [[rock music]] in the 1960s, many more manufacturers began making electric basses, including [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[Teisco]] and [[Guyatone]]. Introduced in 1960, the [[Fender Jazz Bass]], initially known as the \"Deluxe Bass\", was intended to accompany the [[Jazzmaster]] guitar.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The \"J-bass\" featured two single-coil pickups, one close to the bridge and one in the Precision bass's split coil pickup position. The earliest production Jazz basses had a \"stacked\"{{explain|date=February 2019}} volume and tone control for each pickup; this was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup, and a single passive tone control. \n\nThe Jazz Bass's neck was narrower at the nut than the Precision bass \u2014 {{convert|1+1/2|in|mm|0}} versus {{convert|1+3/4|in|mm|0}} \u2014 allowing for easier access to the lower strings and an overall spacing and feel closer to that of an electric guitar, allowing trained guitarists to transition to the bass guitar more easily.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Another visual difference that set the Jazz Bass apart from the Precision is its \"offset-waist\" body.{{explain|date=February 2019}}\n\nPickup shapes on electric basses are often referred to as \"P\" or \"J\" pickups in reference to the visual and electrical differences between the Precision Bass and Jazz Bass [[pick up (music technology)|pickups]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In the 1950s and 1960s, all bass guitars were often called the \"Fender bass\", due to [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]'s early dominance in the market.\n\nProviding a more \"Gibson-scale\" instrument, rather than the {{convert|34|in|mm|0}} Jazz and Precision, Fender produced the [[Fender Mustang Bass|Mustang Bass]], a {{convert|30|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale-length instrument.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}  The [[Fender VI]], a 6 string bass, was tuned one octave lower than standard guitar tuning.

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

It is a [[plucked string instrument]] similar in appearance and construction to an [[Electric guitar|electric]] or an [[acoustic guitar]], except with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and typically four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. Since the mid-1950s, the electric bass has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]]. \n\nThe four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or [[guitar pick|striking]] with a [[plectrum|pick]]. The electric bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and must be connected to an [[Bass amplifier|amplifier and speaker]] to be loud enough to compete with other instruments.\n\n==Terminology==\nAccording to the ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', an \"Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E<sub>1</sub>'\u2013A<sub>1</sub>'\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>.\"{{sfn|Sadie|Tyrrell|2001|p=}} It also defines ''bass'' as \"Bass (iv).

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass.

[[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

They generally have different job descriptions and, in a few cases, may not even work for the company at all.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 88%;\"\n!width=8%|\n! colspan=\"2\"| English-language\n! colspan=\"1\"| German-language\n! colspan=\"2\"| French-language\n! colspan=\"1\"| Spanish-language\n! colspan=\"1\"| Hebrew-language\n! colspan=\"1\"| Swedish-language\n! colspan=\"1\"| Czech-language\n! colspan=\"1\"| Finnish-language\n! colspan=\"1\"| Hindi-language\n|-\n!width=8%|\n!width=8%|Original&nbsp;version<br/>(2001\u201303)\n!width=8%|American&nbsp;version<br/>(2005\u201313)\n!width=8%|German&nbsp;version<br/>(2004\u201312)\n!width=8%|French&nbsp;version<br/>(2006)\n!width=8%|Canadian&nbsp;French<br/>version<br/>(2006\u201307)\n!width=8%|Chilean&nbsp;version<br/>(2008)\n!width=8%|Israeli&nbsp;version<br/>(2010\u201313)\n!width=8%|Swedish&nbsp;version<br/>(2012)\n!width=8%|Czech version (2014)\n!width=8%|Finnish&nbsp;version<br/>(2017)\n!width=8%|Indian&nbsp;version<br/>(2019\u2013)\n|-\n|''Name''||'''''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'''''||'''''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'''''||'''''[[Stromberg (TV series)|Stromberg]]'''''||'''''[[Le Bureau]]'''''<br>(\"The Office\")||'''''[[La Job]]'''''<br>(\"The Job\")||'''''{{ill|La ofis|es}}'''''<br>(\"The Office\")||'''''[[HaMisrad]]''''' (''\u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05d3'', \"The Office\")||'''''{{ill|Kontoret|sv}}'''''<br>(\"The Office\")\n|'''Kancl''' (\"The Office\")||'''''{{ill|Konttori|fi|Konttori (suomalainen televisiosarja)}}'''''<br>(\"The Office\") || '''''[[The Office (Indian TV series)|The Office]]'''''\n|-\n|''Firm''||'''Wernham Hogg'''||'''[[Dunder Mifflin]]'''||'''Capitol-Versicherung AG'''||'''Cogirep'''||'''Les Papiers Jennings'''||'''Papeles Lozano'''||'''\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9\u05e1'''||'''Svensk kontorshygien AB'''\n|'''Pap\u00edr a print'''||'''Leskisen paperi''' || '''Wilkins Chawla'''\n|-\n|''Business''||Paper||Paper||Insurance||Paper||Paper||Paper||Office supplies||Office hygiene\n|Paper||Paper ||Paper\n|-\n|''Location''||[[Slough]]||[[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]||''Unspecified city in Germany''||[[Villepinte, Seine-Saint-Denis|Villepinte]]||[[Saint-Laurent (borough)|C\u00f4te-de-Liesse]]||[[Santiago, Chile|Santiago Centro]]||[[Yehud]]|| [[Upplands-V\u00e4sby]]|||[[Brno]]||  || [[Faridabad]]\n|-\n|''Regional<br/>Manager''||'''[[David Brent]]'''<br/>([[Ricky Gervais]])||'''[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]]''' <br/> ([[Steve Carell]]) <br/> '''[[Andy Bernard]]'''<br/>([[Ed Helms]]) ||'''Bernd Stromberg'''<br/>([[Christoph Maria Herbst]])||'''Gilles Triquet'''<br/>([[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]])||'''David Gervais'''<br/>([[Antoine V\u00e9zina]])||'''Manuel Cerda'''<br/>(Luis Gnecco)||'''Avi Meshulam'''<br/>([[Dvir Benedek]])||'''Ove Sundberg'''<br/>([[Henrik Dorsin]])\n|'''Marek Chv\u00e1la'''\n(V\u00e1clav Kopta)\n|'''Pentti Markkanen'''<br/>([[Sami Hedberg]]) || '''Jagadeep Chadda'''<br/>(Mukul Chadda)\n|-\n|''Senior Sales<br/>Representative''||'''[[Tim Canterbury]]'''<br/>([[Martin Freeman]])||'''[[Jim Halpert]]'''<br/>([[John Krasinski]])||'''Ulf Steinke'''<br/>(Oliver Wnuk)||'''Paul Delorme'''<br/>([[J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Elka\u00efm]])||'''Louis Tremblay'''<br/>([[S\u00e9bastien Huberdeau]])||'''Diego Ram\u00edrez'''<br/>(Pablo Cazals)||'''Yossi'''<br/>(Eldad Fribas)||'''Erik Lundkvist'''<br/>(Kim Sulocki)\n| ||'''Timo'''<br/>(Pyry \u00c4ik\u00e4\u00e4) || '''Amit Sharma'''<br/>(Sayandeep Sengupta)\n|-\n|''Assistant to the Regional Manager''||'''[[Gareth Keenan]]'''<br/>([[Mackenzie Crook]])''||'''[[Dwight Schrute]]'''<br/>([[Rainn Wilson]])||'''Berthold''' \"'''Ernie'''\" '''Heisterkamp'''<br/>([[Bjarne M\u00e4del]]) ||'''Joel Liotard'''<br/>(Beno\u00eet Carr\u00e9)''|| '''Sam Bisaillon'''<br/>([[Paul Ahmarani]])||'''Cristi\u00e1n M\u00fcller'''<br/>(Mauricio Dell)'' ||'''Yariv Shauli'''<br/>(Maayan Blum)'' ||'''Viking Ytterman'''<br/>([[Bj\u00f6rn Gustafsson]])\n| ||'''Jaakko'''<br/>(Antti Heikkinen) ||'''T.P.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century.

The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia.

The [[Cuman-Kipchak Confederation]] and Islamic [[Volga Bulgaria]] were absorbed by the Golden Horde in the 13th century; in the 14th century, Islam became the official religion under [[Uzbeg Khan]] where the general population (Turks) as well as the aristocracy (Mongols) came to speak the [[Kipchak language]] and were collectively known as \"[[Tatars]]\" by Russians and Westerners. This country was also known as the [[Kipchak Khanate]] and covered most of what is today [[Ukraine]], as well as the entirety of modern-day southern and eastern [[Russia]] (the European section). The Golden Horde disintegrated into several khanates and hordes in the 15th and 16th century including the [[Crimean Khanate]], [[Khanate of Kazan]], and [[Kazakh Khanate]] (among others), which were one by one conquered and annexed by the Russian Empire in the 16th through 19th centuries.\n\nIn Siberia, the [[Siberian Khanate]] was established in the 1490s by fleeing Tatar aristocrats of the disintegrating [[Golden Horde]] who established Islam as the official religion in western Siberia over the partly Islamized native [[Siberian Tatars]] and indigenous Uralic peoples.

[[Chinese Turkestan]] remained part of the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nImmediately after the independence of the Turkic states, Turkey began seeking diplomatic relations with them.

Small numbers inhabit eastern [[Poland]] and the south-eastern part of [[Finland]].<ref>Substantial numbers (possibly several millions) of maghrebis of the former Ottoman colonies in North Africa are of Ottoman Turkish descent. [[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India.

Some groups of Turkic people practice other religions, including their original animistic-shamanistic religion, [[Christianity]], [[Burkhanism]], [[Jew]]s ([[Khazars]], [[Krymchaks]], [[Crimean Karaites]]), [[Buddhism]] and a small number of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Map of independent Turkic countries..png|thumb|upright=1.55|alt=Map highlighting present-day Turkic countries|Independent Turkic states shown in red]]\nThe Ottoman Empire gradually grew weaker in the face of poor administration, repeated wars with [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], Austria and Hungary, and the [[emergence of nationalist movements in the Balkans]], and it finally gave way after World War I to the present-day [[Republic of Turkey]].<ref name=\"Carter V.

[[Chinese Turkestan]] remained part of the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nImmediately after the independence of the Turkic states, Turkey began seeking diplomatic relations with them.

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

{"title_page": "Achievement gaps in the United States", "text_new": "{{Education in the U.S.}}\n'''Achievement gaps in the United States''' are observed, persistent disparities in measures of educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially groups defined by [[socioeconomic status]] (SES), [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]] and [[gender]]. The achievement gap can be observed on a variety of measures, including [[standardized test]] scores, [[grade point average]], [[Dropping out|dropout]] rates, and college enrollment and completion rates. While this article focuses on the achievement gap in the United States, the gap in achievement between lower income students and higher income students exists in all nations<ref>Carnoy & Rothstein, [http://www.epi.org/blog/international-tests-achievement-gaps-gains-american-students/ \"International Tests Show Achievement Gaps in All Countries\"], Economic Policy Institute, January 15, 2013</ref> and it has been studied extensively in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.K.<ref>Joseph Rowntree Bawlls vs Lunch [http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty \"Education and Poverty\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324140816/http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty |date=March 24, 2013 }}, \"How Does Poverty Affect Children's Education?\"</ref> Various other gaps between groups exist around the globe as well.\n\nResearch into the causes of the disparity in academic achievement between students from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds has been ongoing since the 1966 publication of the Coleman Report (officially titled \"Equality of Educational Opportunity\"), commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], which found that a combination of home, community, and in-school factors affect academic performance and contribute to the achievement gap. According to American educational psychologist [[David Berliner]], home and community environments have a stronger impact on school achievement than in-school factors, in part, because students spend more time outside of school than in school. In addition, the out-of-school factors influencing academic performance differ significantly between children living in poverty and children from middle-income households.<ref>Berliner, D., [http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/PB-Berliner-NON-SCHOOL.pdf \"Poverty and Potential: Out-of-School Factors and School Success\"], Education Public Interest Center, 2009</ref><ref>Berliner, D., [http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=12106 \"Our Impoverished View of Educational Reform\"], Teachers College Record, 2006</ref>\n\nThe achievement gap, as reported in trend data collected by the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP), has become a focal point of [[education reform]] efforts by a number of nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups. Attempts to minimize the achievement gap by improving equality of access to educational opportunities have been numerous but fragmented, such as [[affirmative action]], [[multicultural education]], finance equalization,{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and interventions to improve school testing, teacher quality and accountability.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Racial achievement gap==\n{{cleanup section| date=August 2019 |reason=Per [[Wikipedia:Summary style]], details should be moved to [[Racial achievement gap in the United States]], leaving a brief summary here.}}\n{{main|Racial achievement gap in the United States}}\nThe [[education of African Americans]] and some other minorities lags behind those of other [[United States|U.S.]] ethnic groups, such as [[White people|Whites]] and [[Asian Americans]], as reflected by test scores, grades, urban high school graduation rates, rates of disciplinary action, and rates of conferral of undergraduate degrees. Indeed, high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates are comparable to those of whites 25 or 30 years ago. It should also be noted that the category of [[Africans in the United States|African immigrant]] population (excluding Haitians and other foreign-born blacks born outside of Africa) has the highest educational attainment of any group in the United States, but they represent a small group within the larger African American population.<ref>U.S. Census http://www.asian-nation.org/immigrant-stats.shtml</ref>\n\n[[East Asia|East Asian Americans]] of [[Taiwan]]ese, [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Koreans|Korean]] descent score the highest on average, with the difference primarily on mathematics subtests, in all scholastic standardized tests such as the [[SAT]], [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]], [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]], [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]] exams and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]] followed by [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] [[White people]] who score in the intermediate range, followed by [[Hispanic]] and [[African-American]] students whose scores are, statistically, considerably lower.  U.S. students as whole have in general attained average scores on the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|International PISA test]] while other wealthy [[industrialized]] [[developed country|developed]] [[East Asian]] countries, such as [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]] have the highest top scores. However, compared with children in some less developed countries like Benin where some children, especially girls, end their education after the elementary level, education in the United States is compulsory to age 16 regardless of race or class. It is expected that over half of public education students will be required to pass [[high school graduation examination|standards-based assessments]] which expect that all students to be at least exposed to algebra by high school and exit prepared for college. In many other nations, such as Germany and Japan, those with lower test scores may be tracked as skilled tradepersons or unskilled laborers.\n\nNowadays, there's a gaining population of students who use online education, and the number of institutions which offering fully online degrees is also increasing. According to several studies, online education probably could create an environment where there is less cultural division and negative stereotypes of African Americans, thus protecting those students who have had bad experiences. In addition, the influence technology and user skills and so as economics and academic influences are tightly bonded, that may have positively contributed to African American online learners experience. However, it appears African American male students are less likely to enroll in online classes.\n\n===Statistical evidence and effects===\n<!-- sort, annotate me -->\n{{Main|National Assessment of Educational Progress}}\n[[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Evidence of the racial achievement gaps|Evidence of the achievement gap]] can be found using various measures, but one assessment used nationwide is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The graphs below show the achievement gap on this assessment between black and white students and between Hispanic and white students in the U.S. over time. Although the gaps have generally narrowed in recent years according to this particular measure, there are clearly still large disparities between groups.\n\n==== Math ====\n\n===== Caucasian-African American gap =====\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Black-math-ss09-09.gif|450px]]\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Black-math-ss09-13.gif|450px]]\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Black-math-ss09-17.gif|450px]]\n\n===== Caucasian-Hispanic gap =====\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Hispanic-math-ss10-09.gif|450px]]\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Hispanic-math-ss10-13.gif|450px]]\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Hispanic-math-ss10-17.gif|450px]]\n\n==== Reading ====\nResults of the reading achievement test:\n\n===== Caucasian-African American gap =====\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Black-reading-ss07-09.gif|450px]]\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Black-reading-ss07-13.gif|450px]]\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Black-reading-ss07-17.gif|450px]]\n\n===== Caucasian-Hispanic gap =====\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Hispanic-reading-ss08-09.gif|450px]]\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Hispanic-reading-ss08-13.gif|450px]]\n[[File:NAEP-longterm-Hispanic-reading-ss08-17.gif|450px]]\n\n=====Long-term trends=====\n[[File:NAEP-reading-trends-race-2004.png|450px|NAEP reading long-term trends for ages 9, 13, and 17]]<br />\n::'''Reading- ages 9 (light gray), 13 (dark gray), and 17 (black).'''\n\n==== Education attainment ====\n (Issued August 2003) Educational attainment by race and gender: 2000<ref name=\"census.gov\">{{cite web |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf|title = Education Attainment: 2000|publisher = US Census Bureau|first1 = Kurt J. |last1=Bauman |first2=Nikki L. |last2=Graf|date = August 2003}}</ref>\n Census 2000 Brief\n Percent of Adults 25 and over in group\n Ranked by advanced degree                   HS   SC   BA   AD\n Asian alone . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  80.4 64.6 44.1 17.4\n White alone, not Hispanic or Latino.. . . . 85.5 55.4 27.0  9.8\n White alone... . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  83.6 54.1 26.1  9.5\n Two or more races. . . . . . . . . . . .    73.3 48.1 19.6  7.0\n Black or African American alone . . . . .   72.3 42.5 14.3  4.8\n Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander  78.3 44.6 13.8  4.1\n American Indian and Alaska Native alone . . 70.9 41.7 11.5  3.9\n Hispanic or Latino (of any race).. . . . .  52.4 30.3 10.4  3.8\n Some other race alone . . . . . . . . . . . 46.8 25.0  7.3  2.3\n HS = high school completed SC = some college\n BA = bachelor's degree AD = advanced degree\n\nAfrican Americans lagged behind whites in 2000 by nearly a factor of two. However, it is less frequently observed{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} that whites lag behind Asians by nearly as large a ratio. The group with the least education is not the African Americans, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Hispanic]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] or other groups who have quite a different legacy of discrimination.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The African-American community is behind the curve in education but statistics show 9 out of 10 young black adults ages 25 to 29 have completed high school or its equivalent.\n\nIn 2008, over three million degrees were awarded throughout the United States. Half of all degrees earned were [[bachelor's degrees]]. The bachelor's degree is one of the most awarded degrees for all ethnicities and races. Asians obtained bachelor's degrees more than any other race, followed by Whites. Despite high educational expectations, Hispanics are among the least educated group in the United States: 11 percent of those over age 25 have earned a bachelor's degree or higher compared with 17 percent of blacks, 30 percent of whites, and 49 percent of Asian Americans in the same age group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003).<ref name=\"Schhneider\">{{Cite journal|title = Barriers to Educational Opportunities for Hispanics in the United States|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19909/|date = 2006-01-01|first = Barbara|last = Schhneider|first2 = Sylvia|last2 = Martinez|first3 = Ann|last3 = Ownes}}</ref> Asians obtain more [[first professional degree]]s than any other race.

The college enrollment rate is determined by the percentage of high school students who enroll in two-year or four-year college and universities immediately after high school. In 2008, the college enrollment rate for all races was 69%. Although the college rate increased for each racial and ethnic group between 1980 and 2007, the enrollment rates for [[Black people|Blacks]] and [[Hispanics]] did not increase at the same rate as among White students. Between 1980 and 2007, the college enrollment rate for Blacks increased from 44% to 56% and the college enrollment rates for Hispanics increased from 50% to 62%. In comparison, the same rate increased from 49.8% to 77.7% for Whites. There are no data for Asians or American Indians/Alaska Natives regarding enrollment rates from the 1980s to 2007.<ref name=\"education\" />{{rp|118}}\n\nIn 2009, the enrollment rate of high school graduates reached a historical high of 70.1% (see above for statistics on the racial gap in graduation rates). Asian Americans have the highest enrollment rate (92.2%), followed by Whites (69.2%), Blacks (68.7%), and Hispanics (59.3%).<ref>{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/college-enrollment-rate-at-record-high/ | work=The New York Times | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | title=College Enrollment Rate at Record High | date=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Illiteracy ====\n\nAfrican Americans were once denied educations. Even as late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. However, by 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among African Americans\u2014the number of among young adults was less than one percent, though African Americans still lag in more stringent definitions of document literacy.<!-- see table below --> Inability to read, write or speak English in America today is largely an issue for immigrants, mostly from Asia and [[Latin America]].\n\n''Illiteracy by age and race: 1947 to 1969''<br />''In thousands except percent''<br />''Civilian noninstitutional population 14 yrs and over''<br />''Source: US census''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Nov 1969\n!14 ovr!!14-24!!25-44!!45-64!!65+\n|-\n!Total\n|1.0 ||0.3 ||0.5 ||1.1 ||3.5\n|-\n!White\n|0.7 ||0.2 ||0.4 ||0.7 ||2.3\n|-\n!Black\n|3.6 ||0.5 ||1.6 ||5.5 ||16.7\n|-\n!Mar 1959\n! !! !! !! !!\n|-\n!Total\n|2.2 ||0.6 ||1.2 ||2.6 ||6.5\n|-\n!White\n|1.6 ||0.5 ||0.8 ||1.8 ||5.1\n|-\n!Black\n|7.5 ||1.2 ||5.1 ||11.3 ||25.5\n|-\n!Oct 1952\n! !! !! !! !!\n|-\n!Total\n|2.5 ||1.2 ||1.3 ||3.5 ||6.9\n|-\n!White\n|1.8 ||0.8 || || ||5.0\n|-\n!Black\n| ||10.2 ||3.9 || ||33.3\n|-\n!Oct 1947\n! !! !! !! !!\n|-\n!Total\n|2.7 ||1.0 ||1.7 ||4.0 ||6.7\n|-\n!White\n|1.8 ||0.6 || || ||4.9\n|-\n!Black\n|11.0 ||4.4 || || ||32.4\n|}\n\n==== High school graduation ====\n\n''Completed High School age 25-29 (1998)''<ref>Public Information Office, [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.\n\n==== Income and class ====\n\nConservative African American scholars such as [[Thomas Sowell]] observe that while SAT scores are lower for students with less parental education and income{{citation needed}}. Asian Americans who took the SAT with incomes below $10,000 score 482 in math in 1995, comparable to whites earning $30\u201340,000 and higher and blacks over $70,000{{citation needed}}. Test scores in middle-income black communities, such as [[Prince George County]], are still not comparable to those in non-black suburbs{{citation needed}}.\n\n==== State standards ====\n\nMost state tests showing African American failure rates anywhere from two to four times the rate of whites, such as Washington State's [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] test, and only half to one-quarter as likely to achieve a high score, even though these tests were designed to eliminate the negative effects of bias associated with standardized multiple choice tests. It is a top goal of education reform to eliminate the ''[[Education gap]]'' between all races, though skeptics question whether legislation such as [[No Child Left Behind]] truly closes the gap just by raising expectations. Others, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], observe it may merely penalize those who do not score as well as the most educated ethnic and income groups.<ref>See {{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Murray |title=Acid Tests |journal=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 25, 2006 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115379210632316123 }} He claims NCLB punishes minority students and does not close basic skill differences.</ref>\n\n''Scored Level 3 on [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] Washington Assessment of Student Learning, Mathematics Grade 4 (1997)\nData: Office Washington State Superintendent of Instruction\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!White!!Black !!Hispanic!!Asian!!Native American\n|-\n|17.1%\n| 4.0%\n| 4.3%\n|15.6%\n| 1.6%\n|-\n|}\n\n==== International comparisons ====\n\n{{TIMSSMathScores2007}}\n\nAs a whole, students in the United States lagged the best Asian and European nations in the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS international math and science test]].

Many children who are poor, regardless of race, come from homes that lack stability, continuity of care, adequate nutrition, and medical care creating a level of environmental stress that can affect the young child's development. As a result, these children enter school with decreased word knowledge that can affect their language skills, influence their experience with books, and create different perceptions and expectations in the classroom context.<ref name=\"test\">Hart and Risley (1995).

Poverty, coupled with the environment they are raised in, can lead to shortcomings in educational achievement. Despite strong standards and beliefs in education, Hispanic children consistently perform poorly, reflected by a low average of math and reading scores, as compared to other groups except African American.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite journal|title=Digest of Education Statistics|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=51|issue=10|pages=51\u20135366\u201351-5366|doi=10.5860/choice.51-5366|year=2014}}</ref> Hispanic and African American children have been shown to be more likely to be raised in poverty, with 33% of Hispanic families living below the [[Poverty in the United States|economic poverty level]], compared to African American (39%), Asian (14%) and White (13%) counterparts.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Children who are raised in poverty are less likely to be enrolled in nursery or preschool. Though researchers are seeing improvements in achievement levels, such as a decrease in high school dropout rates (from 24% to 17%) and a steady increase in math and reading scores over the past 10 years,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> there are still issues that must be addressed.\n\nThere is a common misconception that Hispanic parents are not involved in their child's education and fail to transmit strong educational values to their children. However, there is evidence that Hispanic parents actually hold their children's education in high value. The majority of Hispanic children are affected by [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]]. It affects recent immigrants as well as the children of immigrants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valencia|first=Richard R.|date=2002-04-01|title=\"Mexican Americans Don't Value Education!\" On the Basis of the Myth, Mythmaking, and Debunking|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81\u2013103|doi=10.1207/s1532771xjle0102_2|issn=1534-8431}}</ref> Both recent immigrants and the children of immigrants are faced with language barriers and other migration obstacles.

Immigrant parents appeal to their children and hold high expectations because of the \u201cgift\u201d they are bestowing on them. They immigrated and sacrificed their lives so their children can succeed, and this framework is salient in encouraging children to pursue their education.

In 2012, 97% of families reported teaching their children letters, words or numbers.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> A study reported that parent involvement during adolescence continues to be as influential as in early childhood.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n====Motivation gap====\nAnother explanation that has been suggested for racial and ethnic differences in standardized test performance is that some minority children may not be motivated to do their best on these assessments. Many argue that standardized IQ tests and other testing procedures are culturally biased toward the knowledge and experiences of the European-American middle class.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/ronnie-reese/test-bias-minorities_b_2734149.html |title=Minority Testing Bias Persists |last=Reese |first=Ronnie |work=The Huffington Post |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/11/why-its-time-to-get-rid-of-standardized-tests/ |title=Why It's Time to Get Rid of Standardized Tests |last=Rooks |first=Noliwe M. |magazine=TIME |date=October 11, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nClaude M. Steele suggested that minority children and adolescents may also experience [[stereotype threat]]\u2014the fear that they will be judged to have traits associated with negative appraisals and/or stereotypes of their race or ethnic group. According to this theory, this produces test anxiety and keeps them from doing as well as they could on tests. According to Steele, minority test takers experience anxiety, believing that if they do poorly on their test they will confirm the stereotypes about inferior intellectual performance of their minority group. As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy begins, and the child performs at a level beneath his or her inherent abilities.\n\n====\"Acting white\"====\n{{Main|Acting white}}\n\nSome researchers<ref name=\"researchers\">Steele, C., and J. Aronson, \"Stereotype Threat and the Test Performance of Academically Successful African Americans\" (pp. 401\u2013430), in C. Jencks and M. Phillips (Eds.), The Black-White Test Score Gap (Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1998).</ref> also hypothesize that in some cases, minorities, especially African American students, may stop trying in school because they do not want to be accused of \u201c[[acting white]]\u201d by their peers,<ref>''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the \"Burden of 'Acting White'\"'' [[Signithia Fordham]] and John U. Ogbu 1986</ref> or that some minority students simply stop trying because they do not believe they will ever see the true or deserved benefits of their hard work. As some researchers point out, minority students may feel little motivation to do well in school because they do not believe it will pay off in the form of a better job or upward [[social mobility]].<ref name=\"jencks&phillips\"/><ref>''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the \"Burden of 'Acting White'\"'' Signithia Fordham and John U. Ogbu 1986</ref> By not trying to do well in school, such students engage in a rejection of the [[achievement ideology]] &ndash; that is, the idea that working hard and studying long hours will pay off for students in the form of higher wages or upward social mobility.\n\n====Structural and institutional factors====\nDifferent schools have different effects on similar students. Children of color tend to be concentrated in low-achieving, highly segregated schools. In general, minority students are more likely to come from low-income households, meaning minority students are more likely to attend poorly funded schools based on the districting patterns within the school system. Schools in lower-income districts tend to employ less qualified teachers and have fewer educational resources.<ref>''Education and the Inequalities of Place'' Vincent J.Roscigno, Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, and Martha Crowley 2006</ref> Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student learning. Good teachers can actually close or eliminate the gaps in achievement on the standardized tests that separate white and minority students.<ref name=\"teachers\">Gordon, Kane & Staiger (2006). 'Identifying Effective Teachers Using Performance on the Job.' Brookings Institution.</ref>\n\nSchools also tend to place students in [[tracking (education)|tracking]] groups as a means of tailoring lesson plans for different types of learners. However, as a result of schools placing emphasis on socioeconomic status and cultural capital, minority students are vastly over-represented in lower educational tracks.<ref>''Why Do Some Schools Group By Ability?'' Peter G. VanderHart 2006</ref> Similarly, Hispanic and African American students are often wrongly placed into lower tracks based on teachers\u2019 and administrators\u2019 expectations for minority students. Such expectations of a race within school systems are a form of [[institutional racism]]. Some researchers compare the tracking system to a modern form of [[racial segregation]] within the schools.<ref>''Detracking: The Social Construction of Ability, Cultural Politics, and Resistance to Reform'' Jeannie Oakes, Amy Stuart Wells, Makeba Jones, and Amanda Datnow 1997</ref>\n\nStudies on tracking groups within schools have also proven to be detrimental for minority students.<ref>''Urban Teachers' Beliefs on Teaching, Learning, and Students: A Pilot Study in the United States of America'' Kim Hyunsook Song 2006</ref> Once students are in these lower tracks, they tend to have less-qualified teachers, a less challenging curriculum, and few opportunities to advance into higher tracks.<ref>''Social Class in Public Schools'' Jennifer L. Hochschild 2003</ref> There is also some research that suggests students in lower tracks suffer from social psychological consequences of being labeled as a slower learner, which often leads children to stop trying in school.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In fact, many sociologists argue that tracking in schools does not provide any lasting benefits to any group of students.<ref>''Is Ability Grouping Equitable?''

A 2009 report by the management consulting firm [[McKinsey & Company]] asserts that the persistence of the achievement gap in the U.S. has the economic effect of a \u201cpermanent national recession.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title=The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap on America's Schools |publisher=McKinsey & Company |year=2009 |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievementgap.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424192005/http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievementgap.asp |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}</ref> The report claims that if the achievement gap between black and Latino performance and white student performance had been narrowed, GDP in 2008 would have been $310 billion to $525 billion higher (2\u20134 percent).<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIf the gap between low-income students and their peers had been narrowed, GDP in the same year would have been $400 billion to $670 billion higher (3\u20135 percent). In addition to the potential increase in GDP, the report projects that closing the achievement gap would lead to cost savings in areas outside of education, such as incarceration and healthcare. The link between low school performance and crime, low earnings and poor health has been echoed in academic research.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence From Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-reports |first=L. |last=Lochner |first2=E. |last2=Moretti |year=2004 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=155\u2013189 |doi=10.1257/000282804322970751 |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4mf8k11n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Krueger |first=Alan B. |first2=Diane M. |last2=Whitmore |chapter=Would Smaller Classes Help Close the Black-White Achievement Gap? |title=Bridging the Achievement Gap |publisher=The Brookings Institution |year=2002 }}</ref>\n\n=== Attempts at narrowing the racial achievement gap ===\nExplanations for the achievement gap and concerns over its effects and even the existence of such a gap are widely contested.\u00a0 These explanations are also the source of much controversy, especially since efforts to \"close the gap\" have become some of the more politically prominent education reform issues. The issues that the achievement gap perpetuate also hold politically charged issues. For example, the cause of the Latino education crisis is not attributable to any single factor. It is likely the result of multiple variables\u2014all of which can have an effect on one another\u2014ranging from social, economic, and educational conditions to inadequate social services and families with exceptionally low human and social capital. The effects of the achievement gap in school can be seen later in life for students. For example, since schools often lack the resources to meet many students' most basic educational needs and since there are few entry level jobs that provide a living wage and benefits available to those without higher education or special skills in the economy, many are left at a disadvantage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215170642/http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-02-15|title=NEA - The Crisis in the Education of Latino Students|date=2010-02-15|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> The following attempts have all been made in order to counteract the effects of the achievement gap at schools. They range from nationwide, government-led initiatives to smaller school-based initiatives.\n\n====Standards-based reform and No Child Left Behind====\nThe federal [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002 (NCLB) focuses on standardized test scores and school accountability to ensure that all students have the same educational opportunities. As written, the legislation incentivizes that schools show continual improvement toward this goal (otherwise known as \"Adequate Yearly Progress,\" or AYP) otherwise schools face punishments, such as sanctions. This system has been criticized by some for being unfair toward schools that have the highest population of minority and poor students, as it is harder for these schools to meet the standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act, due to insufficient funding from either local, district, or state actors. This in turn leads to a cycle of underperformance and sanctions within these areas which furthers the problems that the Act meant to fix.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the [[Obama Administration]] instituted the [[Race to the Top]] (RTTT) program which provides financial incentives to states to produce measurable student gains. RTTT's primary goals are to improve student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve high school graduation rates.<ref>\"Fact Sheet: The Race to the Top\". The White House. Archived from the original on April 9, 2011. Retrieved April 9,2011.</ref> The goals of both programs has been to close the achievement gap, but the RTTT has been more focused on closing the gap between higher and lower performing schools rather than focusing on a national approach.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0235.htm|title=COMPARING NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND AND RACE TO THE TOP|last=Director|first=Judith Lohman, Assistant|website=www.cga.ct.gov|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> The major difference between the two educational reform programs is that RTTT is a competitive grant program that provides incentives for schools to change, while the NCLB Act mandated various changes in state and local education systems.<ref name=\":2\" /> The RTTT's approach is more adaptable and focused as it allows for individual actions between schools, and is meant to encourage reform within schools without resorting to punishments, whereas the No Child Left Behind Act relies on punishments as its main form of promoting reform in schools.\n\nAnother attempt to standardize the education of students is the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], also known as Common Core. The Common Core, created in 2009 and 2010, sets benchmarks for the skills that students should have by certain grade levels in subjects such as Math and Language Arts and the system itself is to meant to be a national baseline for how students are achieving. This baseline is meant to help establish what students need in order to achieve in higher education.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/commoncore/3-what-problems-is-the-common-core-trying-to-solve|title=What problems is the Common Core trying to solve?|date=2014-03-26|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref> While the standards are meant to be nationwide, they have only been adopted by 35 states as it is not mandatory for states to subscribe to the Common Core unless they desire federal grants.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-states-academic-standards-common-core-or.html|title=Map: Tracking the Common Core State Standards|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref> The Common Core Initiative has been criticized as it has not yielded any noticeable improvement in what has almost 10 years since it has been implemented, due to a multiple reasons, from incorrect implementation to content as the idea of a centralized system for education has been criticized for not taking the dynamic differences in learning-style into consideration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nealmccluskey/2018/10/18/common-core-doesnt-seem-to-be-working-that-may-be-just-fine/#1b9d5bbb6993|title=Common Core Doesn't Seem To Be Working; That May Be Just Fine|last=McCluskey|first=Neal|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe newest addition to the growing list of government-led initiatives has been the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], or ESSA. The ESSA, enacted in December 2015, is Congress's replacement for the NCLB. The ESSA takes notes from both the RTTT and the NCLB, by keeping the standardized testing of the NCLB while allowing for the flexibility of the RTTT. The ESSA gives states more say in how schools are held accountable, and how states can act to fix issues at their schools, and as such, states can set long-term goals instead of having to worry about year-to-year performance issues as with the NCLB.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/every-student-succeeds-act/index.html|title=The Every Student Succeeds Act: An ESSA Overview|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref> States must still identify low performing schools and provide additional support, but now states can focus on long-term solutions. The new bill also focuses more on academic growth, which is subjective and does not always line up with a student's grade level, whereas the NCLB only cared whether students were performing to grade level.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://educationpost.org/the-abcs-of-esea-essa-and-no-child-left-behind/|title=The ABC's of ESEA, ESSA and No Child Left Behind - Education Post|work=Education Post|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref> By combining the standardized test requirements of the NCLB while allowing for more state control like in the RTTT, the ESSA hopes to achieve long-lasting success and reform.\n\n==== Resources for poor school districts ====\nAnother explanation to address this educational gap is the lack of resources attainable by certain groups of students. A study found that there is a need for financial literacy for students enrolled in colleges and universities. Specifically, there is a need for student knowledge about loans, budgeting, and time requirements for degree completion .<ref>Eichelberger, Brenda, Mattioli, Heather, & Foxhoven, Rachel. (2017). Uncovering Barriers to Financial Capability: Underrepresented Students' Access to Financial Resources. ''Journal of Student Financial Aid,'' ''47''(3), Journal of Student Financial Aid, 2017, Vol.47(3)</ref> Focus group results in the same study concluded that students in search of financial aid information believe that there will be a lack of understanding among advisors and staff regarding minority student's cultural/identity based circumstances. As a result of this belief, many students rather just not seek any services.\n\nOn the high school level, a report finds that the greater the number of people of color enrolled at any particular school, the less likely that school has any computer science courses whatsoever .<ref name=\":0\">Zelinski, N.

There has been a push for partnerships between community agencies and higher education institutions that would offer IDA's to encourage lower income individuals to turn towards higher education.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====School-based reform====\nInitiatives to close the achievement gap have been implemented at the school, district and state level in order to better address the issue. These include investments in pre-kindergarten programs, class size reduction, small schools, curricular reform, alignment of pre-kindergarten through college standards and expectations, and improved teacher education programs.<ref>\"Bridging the Achievement Gap\" John E. Chubb & Tom Loveless, 2002</ref> Many schools have started implementing [[After-school activity|after-school activities]] such as tutoring sessions, remedial programs, and rapid assessment programs. These programs are meant to help minority students learn at a more accelerated rate in order to help them catch up to their peers. Other schools have started de-tracking their students in order to provide the same quality education for all students, regardless of race. De-tracking not only allows for all students to be taught in the same way, but it also opens up new opportunities for students who would be put on a certain career path by their education.\n\n====Teacher-focused reform====\nAnother focus of reform directed toward the achievement gap has been on teacher development, as research shows that since teachers are responsible for almost every aspect of a child's education within the bounds of a classroom. Therefore, in order to best address the achievement gap, reform efforts based on improved teaching are one of the main strategies used to address the gap. This reform effort has been both top-down, in the form of higher state standards for teacher education and preparation,<ref>\"Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching\" Linda Darling-Hammond(prepared for the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 1997)</ref> as well as bottom-up, through programs like Teach for America and AmeriCorps that aim to address educational inequity by recruiting and training teachers specifically to work in high-needs schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teach for America: Our Approach|url=http://www.teachforamerica.org/what-we-do/our-approach/|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Way Public Schools AmeriCorps team|url=http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|accessdate=October 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419162328/http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|archive-date=April 19, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Investment in early childhood====\nOne strategy being used to address the achievement gap has been focusing on early childhood development. Economic research shows that investment at this stage is both more effective and cost effective than interventions later in a child's life.<ref>\"Investments in Early Childhood as a Means for Deficit Reduction\" James Heckman, 2010</ref> By helping develop critical skills early on, these programs cut out the need for such intervention later on. Head Start and various state-funded pre-kindergarten programs target students from low-income families in an attempt to level the playing field for these children before school begins. In addition to increased access, there has also an increased national focus on raising quality standards for Head Start and state-funded pre-K programs, and in improving training and professional development for early care providers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Changing Landscape of Pre-K: Examining the changes and impacts of quality standards in prekindergarten at the national, state, district and program levels|url=http://www.nieer.org|accessdate=April 13, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110417172816/http://nieer.org/| archivedate=April 17, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThere is substantial evidence pointing to early childhood development playing a huge role in closing the achievement gap: various studies, including the Carolina Abecedarian study, Child-Parent Center study, and HighScope Perry Preschool study, have shown that pre-K programs can have a positive and long-lasting impact on academic achievement of low-income and minority students.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=F.

Pre-K programs help students develop social, emotional, and critical thinking skills at a young age, and while none of this prevents the effects of poverty, it does help in dampening the effects while also better preparing student for their future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/03/524907739/pre-k-decades-worth-of-studies-one-strong-message|title=Pre-K: Decades Worth Of Studies, One Strong Message|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Narrowing the achievement gap through technology====\n\nComputer and technology use have been linked to increased student achievement. \u201cWhen teachers and administrators make a sustained commitment to the use of [[computers in the classroom]], student achievement increases (Mann & Shafer, 1997).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=D. |last2=Shafer |first2=E. |year=1997 |title=Technology and Achievement |journal=The American School Board Journal |url=http://www.asbj.com/achievement/cilcilo.html }}</ref> Randomized experiments demonstrate that the performance of low-achieving students can be improved by using technology that adjusts the level of difficulty of the books and math problems that are presented to each student, raises the probability that each student will achieve high scores on end-of-book reading comprehension quizzes and high accuracy scores on daily math assignments, raises the probability that each student can earn high letter grades, and creates a structured environment where each student is likely to receive regular, objective, positive feedback signaling that he or she is advancing on a daily basis, promoting high self-efficacy and a strong sense of control over academic outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ysseldyke |first=Jim |last2=Bolt |first2=Daniel M. |year=2007 |title=Effect of Technology-Enhanced Continuous Progress Monitoring on Math Achievement |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=453\u2013467 |doi= }}</ref><ref>Ross, Steven M., Nunnery, John, & Goldfeder, Elizabeth (2004).

These skills can be achieved through the use of weblogs, social networking sites, feeds, and myriad other multimedia. In classrooms, students can communicate internally, or they can work side by side with others who are located thousands of miles away. Through the use of technology, presentations can be archived so that the material can be reviewed at any time. \u201cAll teachers could record important parts of what they do in the classroom that can then be archived to the class Weblog and used by students who may have missed the class or just want a refresher on what happened.\u201d (Richardson, p.&nbsp;117)<ref name=\"Richardson, W. 2010\">Richardson, W.

Some teachers feel that technology is not the solution and see it as a risk. Therefore, technology is not always being used to its fullest potential by teachers and students do not gain the advantages technology offers. \u201cGiven the fact that the amount of information going online shows no sign of slowing, if they are unable to consistently collect potentially relevant information for their lives and careers and quickly discern what of that information is most useful, they will be at a disadvantage.\u201d (Richardson, p.&nbsp;73).<ref name=\"Richardson, W. 2010\"/>\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, by 2012, it is estimated that 70% of homes will have broadband access. While this is a large percentage, it still leaves 30% of households without internet access. The government has lent its hand in closing the Global Achievement Gap by granting funding for low-income school districts for programs such as one-on-one computing, however, the fact that many of these students do not have online capability at home is still a main issue. This [[digital divide]] may cause the achievement gap to increase as technology continues to become heavily integrated in the daily coursework for school children. Students need to have Internet access outside of school on a regular basis to successfully complete challenging courswork.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics, it noted that African American 12th grade male students had the lowest reading scores among other racial and ethnic group. Reading gaps between African Americans and Whites have increased from 1992 to present (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016).<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Tonsing-Meyer (2013)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = TonsingMeyer | first1 = J | year = 2013 | title = An examination of online instructional practices based on the learning styles of graduate education students | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Distance Education | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 141\u2013149 }}</ref> claimed that the reading and writing practice was specified and emphasized in 85% of online course assignment, with activities attached, which might improve this situation.\n\nStudents who have problems with technology interfered are more likely to withdraw from their online courses (Bambara et al., 2009).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bambara | first1 = C.

In 2008 Janet Hyde and others published a study showing that male and female students did equally well on [[No Child Left Behind]] standardized tests that were administered in second through eleventh grades in ten states. However, Hyde and her team did find gaps that favored males at the upper end of the achievement distribution and tried to examine gaps on more difficult test questions (previous research has shown that males outperform females on more challenging items), but the tests they examined lacked adequately challenging items.

The first is that teachers are more likely to give special attention and extra assistance to students who appear to be struggling in their class. In reading and writing classes, male students are often behind female students in terms of achievement. Therefore, male students are more likely to get more teacher attention, and this extra interaction could give males an advantage in terms of future achievement. The second view is that teachers demand more and show more respect toward students who they view to be high achievers, which creates a cycle in which only students who are perceived to be intelligent receive extra help and teacher attention.<ref name=\"Good\">{{cite journal |last=Good |first=T.

Teachers usually have higher expectations for students they view as higher achievers and treat these students with more respect.<ref name=\"Good\"/> A study by Tach and Farkas has also found that when students are split into reading groups based on their abilities, the students in the higher-ability reading groups are more likely to demonstrate positive learning behaviors and higher achievement.<ref name=\"Tach\"/>\n\nTeachers are more likely to favor girls when evaluating what types of readers students seem to be. Because studies have shown that teacher perceptions of students can determine how much individualized attention a student receives and can serve as an indicator of future academic progress, if teachers underestimate males\u2019 reading abilities and use ability grouping in their classrooms, male students might be put at a disadvantage and have their learning in reading classes be negatively affected.<ref name=\"Tach\">{{cite journal |last=Tach |first=L.

Differences in [[gender roles]] in a particular culture, as well as [[sexism]], can influence a person's interests, opportunities, and activities in a way that might increase or decrease intellectual abilities for any particular task. For ethical and practical reasons, it is not generally feasible to perform an experiment that raises children without a gender identity or which randomly assigns a gender identity, to distinguish the effects of [[socialization]] from genetics.\n\nResearchers concerned with the achievement gap between genders cite biological differences, such as brain structure and development, as a possible reason why one gender outperforms the other in certain subjects. For example, a Virginia Tech Study conducted in 2000 examined the brains of 508 children and found that different areas of the brain develop in a different sequence in girls compared to boys.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hanlon|first=Harriet|author2=Robert Thatcher |author3=Marvin Cline|title=Gender Differences in the Development of EEG Coherence in Normal Children|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=1999|volume=16|issue=3|pages=479\u2013506|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn1603_27}}</ref>\n\nThe differing maturation speed of the brain between boys and girls affects how each gender processes information and could have implications for how they perform in school.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sax|first=Leonard|title=Why Gender Matters: What Parents and Teachers Need to Know about the Emerging Science of Sex Differences|url=https://archive.org/details/whygendermatters00leon|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Doubleday|location=Portland}}</ref>\n\n===Implications of the gender gap===\n\nIt is important to address the gender achievement gap in education because failure to cultivate the academic talents of any one group will have aggregate negative consequences. If women are underrepresented in STEM fields, and if men are underrepresented in the social sciences and humanities, both genders are missing opportunities to develop diverse skill sets that can help them in the workplace.<ref name=\"Ellison\">{{cite journal |last=Ellison |first=Glenn |first2=Ashley |last2=Swanson |year=2010 |title=The Gender Gap in Secondary School Mathematics at High Achievement Levels: Evidence from the American Mathematics Competitions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=109\u2013128 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.109 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w15238.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIf the gender achievement gap in education continues to exist, so does the stereotype that medicine, science, and engineering are all \u201cmasculine\u201d fields and that women belong in fields like teaching, counseling, or social work. This stereotype can lead to the image that women who pursue careers in the STEM fields are seen as \u201cnerdy\u201d or \u201cgeeky,\u201d and this can have a detrimental effect on the self-esteem of females who do choose to enter these fields.<ref name=\"Ellison\"/>\n\nResearchers have found that the gender achievement gap has a large impact on the future career choices of high-achieving students. Part of this is a result of the college majors that men and women choose; men are more likely to major in engineering or the hard sciences, while women are more likely to receive degrees in English, psychology, or sociology. Therefore, men are statistically more likely to enter careers that have more potential for higher long-term earnings than women.<ref name=\"Dey\"/>\n\nThe careers that are aligned with these majors have different levels of prestige and different salaries, which can lead to a [[Gender pay gap|gender wage gap]]. U.S. Census data indicates that women who work full-time earn only 77% of what their male counterparts earn. For men and women who are ten years out of college, women earn only 69% of the salaries of their male workers.<ref name=\"Dey\"/>\n\n===Attempts to reduce the gender gap===\n\nThere have been several studies done of interventions aimed at reducing the gender achievement gap in science classes. Some interventions, such as instituting mentoring programs aimed at women or restructuring the course curriculum, have had limited success. The most successful interventions have been a form of psychological interventions called values affirmation. In a famous study of women's achievement in college science by Miyake et al., values affirmation was successful in reducing the differences between male and female academic achievement in college-level introductory physics classes, and it has been particularly effective at combating the psychological phenomenon known as [[stereotype threat]].<ref name=\"Miyake\"/>\n\nValues affirmation exercises require students to either write about their most important values or their least important values two times at the beginning of the 15-week course. After this intervention, the modal grades of women enrolled in the course increased from a C to a B. Psychological interventions such as this one show promise for increasing women's achievement in math and science courses and reducing the achievement gap that exists between the genders in these subject areas, but further research will need to be done in order to determine whether the positive effects are long-lasting.<ref name=\"Miyake\">{{cite journal |first=Akira |last=Miyake |first2=Lauren E. |last2=Kost-Smith |first3=Noah D. |last3=Finkelstein |first4=Steven J. |last4=Pollock |first5=Geoffrey L. |last5=Cohen |first6=Tiffany A. |last6=Ito |displayauthors=1 |year=2010 |title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=330 |issue=6008 |pages=1234\u20131237 |doi=10.1126/science.1195996 |bibcode=2010Sci...330.1234M |pmid=21109670 }}</ref>\n\n==LGBT achievement gap==\n\nThe [[LGBT]] achievement gap refers to the difference in academic performance and achievement between LGBT youth and their [[heterosexual]] peers.  Historically, the circumstance of LGBT youth in education has received little attention from scholars and the media.<ref>Harrell, J. (2013, September 10). The LGBT Achievement Gap Needs to Get Out of the Closet. The Huffington Post. Retrieved from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-harrell/the-lgbt-achievement-gap-needs-to-get-out-of-the-closet_b_3890764.html</ref> The term [[LGBT]] refers to [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] persons but often is understood to encompass the [[sexual minority]]. Before the turn of the century, little research went into the topic of the LGBT population in schools. However, with the [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]]'s (GLSEN) recurring study on school climate in the U.S. for LGBT students, there is now more information indicating the existence of an achievement gap. LGBT students in the U.S. tend to have lower [[GPA]]s than their heterosexual peers, as well as higher truancy and dropout rates. There are many supposed causes of this achievement gap, as well as efforts to alleviate the disparity.<ref name=GLSEN>Kosciw, J. G., Greytak, E. A., Bartkiewicz, M. J., Boesen, M. J., & Palmer, N. A. (2012). The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in Our Nation's Schools. Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN). 121 West 27th Street Suite 804, New York, NY 10001.</ref>\n\nIn United States secondary schools, LGBT youth often have more difficult experiences compared to their heterosexual [[peer group|peers]], leading to observed underachievement, though current data is limited. In Massachusetts, LGBT youth are 12% less likely to make A and B grades than their heterosexual peers.<ref name=NEA /> The GLSEN reports that 92.3% of LGBT youth report experienced harassment in 2011, compared to about 25% of the general youth population (as reported by the [[United States Department of Justice]]).<ref name=GLSEN /><ref name=NEA>Kim, R. (2009). A report on the status of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in education: Stepping out of the closet, into the light. National Education Association.</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/bullying-statistics.html | title=Bullying Statistics| date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Among LGBT youth, those who endure more severe harassment report significantly lower GPAs than LGBT youth who endure less harassment (2.9 to 3.2, respectively). Less-harassed LGBT youth are also twice as likely to plan for higher education than their highly victimized peers, indicating a general lack of interest in school among LGBT youth.<ref name=GLSEN />\n\n[[Dropping out]] and absenteeism are also concerns with LGBT youth. According to the [[National Education Association]]\u2019s report on LGBT students, gay and bisexual students are almost twice as likely to consider dropping out as heterosexual students, and transgendered students are even more likely.<ref name=NEA /> High instances of dropping out prevent LGBT students from pursuing higher education. Because most studies focus on students enrolled in school and it is hard to find a sample of student youth out of school, an accurate count of LGBT youth who have dropped out of school is hard to obtain.<ref name=GLSEN /> While many LGBT students do not drop out, they often miss school because they feel unsafe. Nationwide, about 50% of students enduring severe verbal harassment, and 70% of students enduring severe physical harassment miss school once a month out of concern for their safety.<ref name=GLSEN /> Studies in Massachusetts schools indicate that LGBT students are up to six times more likely than heterosexual students to miss school. Likewise, students in California who endure harassment \"because of actual or perceived sexual orientation\" are three times as likely as non-harassed heterosexual students to miss school, meaning even heterosexual students harassed for suspected sexual orientation endure some of these problems.<ref name=NEA />\n\nDespite such evidence of negative experiences, some LGBT find positive benefits in [[coming out]]. Students who are out, while receiving increased harassment from homophobic peers, have lower instances of depression and a greater sense of belonging, a phenomenon well documented in other LGBT studies as well.<ref name=GLSEN /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vaughan | first1 = M.

Retrieved from http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/education/18sex.html?_r=0</ref> An extensive nationwide survey conducted by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] indicates that, among women, LGBT identity is inversely related to education level, meaning that for every progressive education level, the percentage of women identifying as LGBT steadily decreases. For instance, while 6.7% of women with no [[high school diploma]] identify as lesbian, bisexual, or something else, only 2.9% of women with a bachelor's degree or higher identify that way. The same study showed no statistically significant correlation between LGBT identity and education for men.<ref>Mosher, W. D., Copen, C., & Sionean, C. (2011).

With extensive studies into the personal experiences of LGBT youth by the GLSEN, the Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and other organizations, some issues relevant to LGBT youth stand out as affecting academic outcomes.\n\nThe most highly documented and widely studied cause of underachievement by LGBT students is the problem of [[bullying]] in schools.<ref name=GLSEN /><ref name=NEA /> Out of students of any sexual identity who feel unsafe at school, 60% feel so because of their sexual orientation. More specifically, a bully's perception of a student's sexual orientation or gender-nonconformity\u2014not necessarily the individual's actual sexual identity\u2014leads to bullying. Because of this, a gender-nonconforming yet heterosexual student could experience some of the same academic outcomes attributed to the LGBT students.<ref name=NEA /> 33% of LGBT students nationwide have skipped school at lease once in a single month for personal safety, and these students who have missed school are three times more likely to attempt [[suicide]] than those who have not missed school.<ref name=NEA />\n\nIn addition to their schooling experience, LGBT youth often have negative home environments. LGBT youth have a very unique situation in that the may not find any support from their family. Upon coming out to their parents, 50% of LGBT teens met a negative reaction.<ref name=NEA /><ref name=Homelessness>Ray, N., & Berger, C. (2007). Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth: An epidemic of homelessness. National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute.</ref> Two studies indicate that approximately 30% of LGBT youth encountered physical violence and 26% were kicked out of the house. This risk is higher for transgender teens.<ref name=Homelessness /> Because of these negative home environments, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, based on studies in Seattle, estimates that 40% of all homeless youth in the United States are LGBT, compared to roughly 3.5% of the general population.<ref name=Homelessness /><ref>Gates, G. J. (2011). How many people are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender?.</ref> In addition to these homeless youths\u2019 higher risk for [[sexual violence]], [[drug abuse]], and [[prostitution]], all of which would affect performance (or general attendance) in school, these youth may not be able to enroll in school at all. Some public schools are either reluctant to or ignorant about enrolling homeless students, significantly thwarting a teen's pursuit of educational opportunities.<ref name=NEA /><ref name=Homelessness />\n\n===Proposed solutions to the LGBT achievement gap===\n\nGovernment-based as well as independent organizations focusing on education or LGBT issues have proposed solutions to improving the experiences of LGBT youth in schools. One such solution is the inclusion of LGBT-related subjects in a school's curriculum, shown to improve LGBT youths' performance in school. When surveyed, school personnel in California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota ranked lesson plans as the top need in addressing LGBT concerns.<ref name=NEA /> The [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]] proposes including LGBT curriculum in school health and sex education classes. Their proposed curriculum would aim to teach students, over the course of their K-12 education, to understand sexual orientation as well as gender roles, and treat others with respect, among other key concepts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McGarry | first1 = R | year = 2013 | title = Build a curriculum that includes everyone | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 94 | issue = 5| pages = 27\u201331 | doi=10.1177/003172171309400506}}</ref> However, many states in the U.S. including [[Alabama]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], and others, have laws explicitly prohibiting the inclusion of homosexuality in education. Alabama and Texas laws even require teachers to refrain from presenting homosexuality as an acceptable [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Significant opposition to changing these statutes exist in these states, preventing the inclusion of LGBT curriculum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoshall|first= L.|date =2013 |title = Afraid of Who You Are: No Promo Homo Laws in Public School Sex Education |journal = Texas Journal of Women & the Law |volume =22|number =2|pages = 219\u2013239|url = https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tjwl22&id=231&collection=journals&index=}}</ref>\n\nThe NEA recommends the inclusion of specific school policies protecting LGBT from harassment and bullying. LGBT students in Massachusetts who attend schools with safety policies explicitly regarding LGBT students are 3.5 times more likely to make A and B grades than LGBT youth in other schools.<ref name=NEA />  Additionally, student organizations such as [[gay-straight alliance]]s (GSAs) can improve the experience of LGBT youth in schools. Even when LGBT students don't participate in their school's GSA, the very presence of the organization can reduce threat and injury of LGBT students by one-third, and reduce LGBT suicide attempts by almost 50%. LGBT students in Massachusetts schools with GSAs were twice as likely to earn A and B grades than LGBT students in schools without GSAs.<ref name=NEA />\n\n== Gap of native-born behind immigrants ==\nEducational attainment rates change when it comes to comparing the same races against immigrants or foreign born students. No matter which race is examined, immigrants of that race outperform natives of the same race.

The achievement gap can be observed on a variety of measures, including [[standardized test]] scores, [[grade point average]], [[Dropping out|dropout]] rates, and college enrollment and completion rates. While this article focuses on the achievement gap in the United States, the gap in achievement between lower income students and higher income students exists in all nations<ref>Carnoy & Rothstein, [http://www.epi.org/blog/international-tests-achievement-gaps-gains-american-students/ \"International Tests Show Achievement Gaps in All Countries\"], Economic Policy Institute, January 15, 2013</ref> and it has been studied extensively in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.K.<ref>Joseph Rowntree Bawlls vs Lunch [http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty \"Education and Poverty\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324140816/http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty |date=March 24, 2013 }}, \"How Does Poverty Affect Children's Education?\"</ref> Various other gaps between groups exist around the globe as well.\n\nResearch into the causes of the disparity in academic achievement between students from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds has been ongoing since the 1966 publication of the Coleman Report (officially titled \"Equality of Educational Opportunity\"), commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], which found that a combination of home, community, and in-school factors affect academic performance and contribute to the achievement gap. According to American educational psychologist [[David Berliner]], home and community environments have a stronger impact on school achievement than in-school factors, in part, because students spend more time outside of school than in school. In addition, the out-of-school factors influencing academic performance differ significantly between children living in poverty and children from middle-income households.<ref>Berliner, D., [http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/PB-Berliner-NON-SCHOOL.pdf \"Poverty and Potential: Out-of-School Factors and School Success\"], Education Public Interest Center, 2009</ref><ref>Berliner, D., [http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=12106 \"Our Impoverished View of Educational Reform\"], Teachers College Record, 2006</ref>\n\nThe achievement gap, as reported in trend data collected by the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP), has become a focal point of [[education reform]] efforts by a number of nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups. Attempts to minimize the achievement gap by improving equality of access to educational opportunities have been numerous but fragmented, such as [[affirmative action]], [[multicultural education]], finance equalization,{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and interventions to improve school testing, teacher quality and accountability.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Racial achievement gap==\n{{cleanup section| date=August 2019 |reason=Per [[Wikipedia:Summary style]], details should be moved to [[Racial achievement gap in the United States]], leaving a brief summary here.}}\n{{main|Racial achievement gap in the United States}}\nThe [[education of African Americans]] and some other minorities lags behind those of other [[United States|U.S.]] ethnic groups, such as [[White people|Whites]] and [[Asian Americans]], as reflected by test scores, grades, urban high school graduation rates, rates of disciplinary action, and rates of conferral of undergraduate degrees. Indeed, high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates are comparable to those of whites 25 or 30 years ago. It should also be noted that the category of [[Africans in the United States|African immigrant]] population (excluding Haitians and other foreign-born blacks born outside of Africa) has the highest educational attainment of any group in the United States, but they represent a small group within the larger African American population.<ref>U.S. Census http://www.asian-nation.org/immigrant-stats.shtml</ref>\n\n[[East Asia|East Asian Americans]] of [[Taiwan]]ese, [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Koreans|Korean]] descent score the highest on average, with the difference primarily on mathematics subtests, in all scholastic standardized tests such as the [[SAT]], [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]], [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]], [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]] exams and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]] followed by [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] [[White people]] who score in the intermediate range, followed by [[Hispanic]] and [[African-American]] students whose scores are, statistically, considerably lower.  U.S. students as whole have in general attained average scores on the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|International PISA test]] while other wealthy [[industrialized]] [[developed country|developed]] [[East Asian]] countries, such as [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]] have the highest top scores. However, compared with children in some less developed countries like Benin where some children, especially girls, end their education after the elementary level, education in the United States is compulsory to age 16 regardless of race or class. It is expected that over half of public education students will be required to pass [[high school graduation examination|standards-based assessments]] which expect that all students to be at least exposed to algebra by high school and exit prepared for college. In many other nations, such as Germany and Japan, those with lower test scores may be tracked as skilled tradepersons or unskilled laborers.\n\nNowadays, there's a gaining population of students who use online education, and the number of institutions which offering fully online degrees is also increasing. According to several studies, online education probably could create an environment where there is less cultural division and negative stereotypes of African Americans, thus protecting those students who have had bad experiences. In addition, the influence technology and user skills and so as economics and academic influences are tightly bonded, that may have positively contributed to African American online learners experience. However, it appears African American male students are less likely to enroll in online classes.\n\n===Statistical evidence and effects===\n<!-- sort, annotate me -->\n{{Main|National Assessment of Educational Progress}}\n[[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Evidence of the racial achievement gaps|Evidence of the achievement gap]] can be found using various measures, but one assessment used nationwide is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The graphs below show the achievement gap on this assessment between black and white students and between Hispanic and white students in the U.S. over time.

However, it is less frequently observed{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} that whites lag behind Asians by nearly as large a ratio. The group with the least education is not the African Americans, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Hispanic]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] or other groups who have quite a different legacy of discrimination.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The African-American community is behind the curve in education but statistics show 9 out of 10 young black adults ages 25 to 29 have completed high school or its equivalent.\n\nIn 2008, over three million degrees were awarded throughout the United States. Half of all degrees earned were [[bachelor's degrees]]. The bachelor's degree is one of the most awarded degrees for all ethnicities and races. Asians obtained bachelor's degrees more than any other race, followed by Whites. Despite high educational expectations, Hispanics are among the least educated group in the United States: 11 percent of those over age 25 have earned a bachelor's degree or higher compared with 17 percent of blacks, 30 percent of whites, and 49 percent of Asian Americans in the same age group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003).<ref name=\"Schhneider\">{{Cite journal|title = Barriers to Educational Opportunities for Hispanics in the United States|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19909/|date = 2006-01-01|first = Barbara|last = Schhneider|first2 = Sylvia|last2 = Martinez|first3 = Ann|last3 = Ownes}}</ref> Asians obtain more [[first professional degree]]s than any other race.

The college enrollment rate is determined by the percentage of high school students who enroll in two-year or four-year college and universities immediately after high school. In 2008, the college enrollment rate for all races was 69%. Although the college rate increased for each racial and ethnic group between 1980 and 2007, the enrollment rates for [[Black people|Blacks]] and [[Hispanics]] did not increase at the same rate as among White students. Between 1980 and 2007, the college enrollment rate for Blacks increased from 44% to 56% and the college enrollment rates for Hispanics increased from 50% to 62%. In comparison, the same rate increased from 49.8% to 77.7% for Whites. There are no data for Asians or American Indians/Alaska Natives regarding enrollment rates from the 1980s to 2007.<ref name=\"education\" />{{rp|118}}\n\nIn 2009, the enrollment rate of high school graduates reached a historical high of 70.1% (see above for statistics on the racial gap in graduation rates). Asian Americans have the highest enrollment rate (92.2%), followed by Whites (69.2%), Blacks (68.7%), and Hispanics (59.3%).<ref>{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/college-enrollment-rate-at-record-high/ | work=The New York Times | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | title=College Enrollment Rate at Record High | date=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Illiteracy ====\n\nAfrican Americans were once denied educations. Even as late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. However, by 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among African Americans\u2014the number of among young adults was less than one percent, though African Americans still lag in more stringent definitions of document literacy.<!-- see table below --> Inability to read, write or speak English in America today is largely an issue for immigrants, mostly from Asia and [[Latin America]].\n\n''Illiteracy by age and race: 1947 to 1969''<br />''In thousands except percent''<br />''Civilian noninstitutional population 14 yrs and over''<br />''Source: US census''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Nov 1969\n!14 ovr!!14-24!!25-44!!45-64!!65+\n|-\n!Total\n|1.0 ||0.3 ||0.5 ||1.1 ||3.5\n|-\n!White\n|0.7 ||0.2 ||0.4 ||0.7 ||2.3\n|-\n!Black\n|3.6 ||0.5 ||1.6 ||5.5 ||16.7\n|-\n!Mar 1959\n! !! !! !! !!\n|-\n!Total\n|2.2 ||0.6 ||1.2 ||2.6 ||6.5\n|-\n!White\n|1.6 ||0.5 ||0.8 ||1.8 ||5.1\n|-\n!Black\n|7.5 ||1.2 ||5.1 ||11.3 ||25.5\n|-\n!Oct 1952\n! !! !! !! !!\n|-\n!Total\n|2.5 ||1.2 ||1.3 ||3.5 ||6.9\n|-\n!White\n|1.8 ||0.8 || || ||5.0\n|-\n!Black\n| ||10.2 ||3.9 || ||33.3\n|-\n!Oct 1947\n! !! !! !! !!\n|-\n!Total\n|2.7 ||1.0 ||1.7 ||4.0 ||6.7\n|-\n!White\n|1.8 ||0.6 || || ||4.9\n|-\n!Black\n|11.0 ||4.4 || || ||32.4\n|}\n\n==== High school graduation ====\n\n''Completed High School age 25-29 (1998)''<ref>Public Information Office, [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.\n\n==== Income and class ====\n\nConservative African American scholars such as [[Thomas Sowell]] observe that while SAT scores are lower for students with less parental education and income. Asian Americans who took the SAT with incomes below $10,000 score 482 in math in 1995, comparable to whites earning $30\u201340,000 and higher and blacks over $70,000. Test scores in middle-income black communities, such as [[Prince George County]], are still not comparable to those in non-black suburbs.\n\n==== State standards ====\n\nMost state tests showing African American failure rates anywhere from two to four times the rate of whites, such as Washington State's [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] test, and only half to one-quarter as likely to achieve a high score, even though these tests were designed to eliminate the negative effects of bias associated with standardized multiple choice tests. It is a top goal of education reform to eliminate the ''[[Education gap]]'' between all races, though skeptics question whether legislation such as [[No Child Left Behind]] truly closes the gap just by raising expectations. Others, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], observe it may merely penalize those who do not score as well as the most educated ethnic and income groups.<ref>See {{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Murray |title=Acid Tests |journal=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 25, 2006 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115379210632316123 }} He claims NCLB punishes minority students and does not close basic skill differences.</ref>\n\n''Scored Level 3 on [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] Washington Assessment of Student Learning, Mathematics Grade 4 (1997)\nData: Office Washington State Superintendent of Instruction\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!White!!Black !!Hispanic!!Asian!!Native American\n|-\n|17.1%\n| 4.0%\n| 4.3%\n|15.6%\n| 1.6%\n|-\n|}\n\n==== International comparisons ====\n\n{{TIMSSMathScores2007}}\n\nAs a whole, students in the United States lagged the best Asian and European nations in the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS international math and science test]].

Many children who are poor, regardless of race, come from homes that lack stability, continuity of care, adequate nutrition, and medical care creating a level of environmental stress that can affect the young child's development. As a result, these children enter school with decreased word knowledge that can affect their language skills, influence their experience with books, and create different perceptions and expectations in the classroom context.<ref name=\"test\">Hart and Risley (1995).

Poverty, coupled with the environment they are raised in, can lead to shortcomings in educational achievement. Despite strong standards and beliefs in education, Hispanic children consistently perform poorly, reflected by a low average of math and reading scores, as compared to other groups except African American.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite journal|title=Digest of Education Statistics|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=51|issue=10|pages=51\u20135366\u201351-5366|doi=10.5860/choice.51-5366|year=2014}}</ref> Hispanic and African American children have been shown to be more likely to be raised in poverty, with 33% of Hispanic families living below the [[Poverty in the United States|economic poverty level]], compared to African American (39%), Asian (14%) and White (13%) counterparts.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Children who are raised in poverty are less likely to be enrolled in nursery or preschool. Though researchers are seeing improvements in achievement levels, such as a decrease in high school dropout rates (from 24% to 17%) and a steady increase in math and reading scores over the past 10 years,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> there are still issues that must be addressed.\n\nThere is a common misconception that Hispanic parents are not involved in their child's education and fail to transmit strong educational values to their children. However, there is evidence that Hispanic parents actually hold their children's education in high value. The majority of Hispanic children are affected by [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]]. It affects recent immigrants as well as the children of immigrants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valencia|first=Richard R.|date=2002-04-01|title=\"Mexican Americans Don't Value Education!\" On the Basis of the Myth, Mythmaking, and Debunking|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81\u2013103|doi=10.1207/s1532771xjle0102_2|issn=1534-8431}}</ref> Both recent immigrants and the children of immigrants are faced with language barriers and other migration obstacles.

Immigrant parents appeal to their children and hold high expectations because of the \u201cgift\u201d they are bestowing on them. They immigrated and sacrificed their lives so their children can succeed, and this framework is salient in encouraging children to pursue their education.

In 2012, 97% of families reported teaching their children letters, words or numbers.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> A study reported that parent involvement during adolescence continues to be as influential as in early childhood.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n====Motivation gap====\nAnother explanation that has been suggested for racial and ethnic differences in standardized test performance is that some minority children may not be motivated to do their best on these assessments. Many argue that standardized IQ tests and other testing procedures are culturally biased toward the knowledge and experiences of the European-American middle class.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/ronnie-reese/test-bias-minorities_b_2734149.html |title=Minority Testing Bias Persists |last=Reese |first=Ronnie |work=The Huffington Post |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/11/why-its-time-to-get-rid-of-standardized-tests/ |title=Why It's Time to Get Rid of Standardized Tests |last=Rooks |first=Noliwe M. |magazine=TIME |date=October 11, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nClaude M. Steele suggested that minority children and adolescents may also experience [[stereotype threat]]\u2014the fear that they will be judged to have traits associated with negative appraisals and/or stereotypes of their race or ethnic group. According to this theory, this produces test anxiety and keeps them from doing as well as they could on tests. According to Steele, minority test takers experience anxiety, believing that if they do poorly on their test they will confirm the stereotypes about inferior intellectual performance of their minority group. As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy begins, and the child performs at a level beneath his or her inherent abilities.\n\n====\"Acting white\"====\n{{Main|Acting white}}\n\nSome researchers<ref name=\"researchers\">Steele, C., and J. Aronson, \"Stereotype Threat and the Test Performance of Academically Successful African Americans\" (pp. 401\u2013430), in C. Jencks and M. Phillips (Eds.), The Black-White Test Score Gap (Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1998).</ref> also hypothesize that in some cases, minorities, especially African American students, may stop trying in school because they do not want to be accused of \u201c[[acting white]]\u201d by their peers,<ref>''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the \"Burden of 'Acting White'\"'' [[Signithia Fordham]] and John U. Ogbu 1986</ref> or that some minority students simply stop trying because they do not believe they will ever see the true or deserved benefits of their hard work. As some researchers point out, minority students may feel little motivation to do well in school because they do not believe it will pay off in the form of a better job or upward [[social mobility]].<ref name=\"jencks&phillips\"/><ref>''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the \"Burden of 'Acting White'\"'' Signithia Fordham and John U. Ogbu 1986</ref> By not trying to do well in school, such students engage in a rejection of the [[achievement ideology]] &ndash; that is, the idea that working hard and studying long hours will pay off for students in the form of higher wages or upward social mobility.\n\n====Structural and institutional factors====\nDifferent schools have different effects on similar students. Children of color tend to be concentrated in low-achieving, highly segregated schools. In general, minority students are more likely to come from low-income households, meaning minority students are more likely to attend poorly funded schools based on the districting patterns within the school system. Schools in lower-income districts tend to employ less qualified teachers and have fewer educational resources.<ref>''Education and the Inequalities of Place'' Vincent J.Roscigno, Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, and Martha Crowley 2006</ref> Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student learning. Good teachers can actually close or eliminate the gaps in achievement on the standardized tests that separate white and minority students.<ref name=\"teachers\">Gordon, Kane & Staiger (2006). 'Identifying Effective Teachers Using Performance on the Job.' Brookings Institution.</ref>\n\nSchools also tend to place students in [[tracking (education)|tracking]] groups as a means of tailoring lesson plans for different types of learners. However, as a result of schools placing emphasis on socioeconomic status and cultural capital, minority students are vastly over-represented in lower educational tracks.<ref>''Why Do Some Schools Group By Ability?'' Peter G. VanderHart 2006</ref> Similarly, Hispanic and African American students are often wrongly placed into lower tracks based on teachers\u2019 and administrators\u2019 expectations for minority students. Such expectations of a race within school systems are a form of [[institutional racism]]. Some researchers compare the tracking system to a modern form of [[racial segregation]] within the schools.<ref>''Detracking: The Social Construction of Ability, Cultural Politics, and Resistance to Reform'' Jeannie Oakes, Amy Stuart Wells, Makeba Jones, and Amanda Datnow 1997</ref>\n\nStudies on tracking groups within schools have also proven to be detrimental for minority students.<ref>''Urban Teachers' Beliefs on Teaching, Learning, and Students: A Pilot Study in the United States of America'' Kim Hyunsook Song 2006</ref> Once students are in these lower tracks, they tend to have less-qualified teachers, a less challenging curriculum, and few opportunities to advance into higher tracks.<ref>''Social Class in Public Schools'' Jennifer L. Hochschild 2003</ref> There is also some research that suggests students in lower tracks suffer from social psychological consequences of being labeled as a slower learner, which often leads children to stop trying in school.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In fact, many sociologists argue that tracking in schools does not provide any lasting benefits to any group of students.<ref>''Is Ability Grouping Equitable?''

In addition to the potential increase in GDP, the report projects that closing the achievement gap would lead to cost savings in areas outside of education, such as incarceration and healthcare. The link between low school performance and crime, low earnings and poor health has been echoed in academic research.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence From Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-reports |first=L. |last=Lochner |first2=E. |last2=Moretti |year=2004 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=155\u2013189 |doi=10.1257/000282804322970751 |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4mf8k11n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Krueger |first=Alan B. |first2=Diane M. |last2=Whitmore |chapter=Would Smaller Classes Help Close the Black-White Achievement Gap? |title=Bridging the Achievement Gap |publisher=The Brookings Institution |year=2002 }}</ref>\n\n=== Attempts at narrowing the racial achievement gap ===\nExplanations for the achievement gap and concerns over its effects and even the existence of such a gap are widely contested.\u00a0 These explanations are also the source of much controversy, especially since efforts to \"close the gap\" have become some of the more politically prominent education reform issues. The issues that the achievement gap perpetuate also hold politically charged issues. For example, the cause of the Latino education crisis is not attributable to any single factor. It is likely the result of multiple variables\u2014all of which can have an effect on one another\u2014ranging from social, economic, and educational conditions to inadequate social services and families with exceptionally low human and social capital. The effects of the achievement gap in school can be seen later in life for students. For example, since schools often lack the resources to meet many students' most basic educational needs and since there are few entry level jobs that provide a living wage and benefits available to those without higher education or special skills in the economy, many are left at a disadvantage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215170642/http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-02-15|title=NEA - The Crisis in the Education of Latino Students|date=2010-02-15|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> The following attempts have all been made in order to counteract the effects of the achievement gap at schools. They range from nationwide, government-led initiatives to smaller school-based initiatives.\n\n====Standards-based reform and No Child Left Behind====\nThe federal [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002 (NCLB) focuses on standardized test scores and school accountability to ensure that all students have the same educational opportunities. As written, the legislation incentivizes that schools show continual improvement toward this goal (otherwise known as \"Adequate Yearly Progress,\" or AYP) otherwise schools face punishments, such as sanctions. This system has been criticized by some for being unfair toward schools that have the highest population of minority and poor students, as it is harder for these schools to meet the standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act, due to insufficient funding from either local, district, or state actors. This in turn leads to a cycle of underperformance and sanctions within these areas which furthers the problems that the Act meant to fix.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the [[Obama Administration]] instituted the [[Race to the Top]] (RTTT) program which provides financial incentives to states to produce measurable student gains. RTTT's primary goals are to improve student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve high school graduation rates.<ref>\"Fact Sheet: The Race to the Top\". The White House. Archived from the original on April 9, 2011. Retrieved April 9,2011.</ref> The goals of both programs has been to close the achievement gap, but the RTTT has been more focused on closing the gap between higher and lower performing schools rather than focusing on a national approach.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0235.htm|title=COMPARING NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND AND RACE TO THE TOP|last=Director|first=Judith Lohman, Assistant|website=www.cga.ct.gov|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> The major difference between the two educational reform programs is that RTTT is a competitive grant program that provides incentives for schools to change, while the NCLB Act mandated various changes in state and local education systems.<ref name=\":2\" /> The RTTT's approach is more adaptable and focused as it allows for individual actions between schools, and is meant to encourage reform within schools without resorting to punishments, whereas the No Child Left Behind Act relies on punishments as its main form of promoting reform in schools.\n\nAnother attempt to standardize the education of students is the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], also known as Common Core. The Common Core, created in 2009 and 2010, sets benchmarks for the skills that students should have by certain grade levels in subjects such as Math and Language Arts and the system itself is to meant to be a national baseline for how students are achieving. This baseline is meant to help establish what students need in order to achieve in higher education.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/commoncore/3-what-problems-is-the-common-core-trying-to-solve|title=What problems is the Common Core trying to solve?|date=2014-03-26|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref> While the standards are meant to be nationwide, they have only been adopted by 35 states as it is not mandatory for states to subscribe to the Common Core unless they desire federal grants.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-states-academic-standards-common-core-or.html|title=Map: Tracking the Common Core State Standards|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref> The Common Core Initiative has been criticized as it has not yielded any noticeable improvement in what has almost 10 years since it has been implemented, due to a multiple reasons, from incorrect implementation to content as the idea of a centralized system for education has been criticized for not taking the dynamic differences in learning-style into consideration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nealmccluskey/2018/10/18/common-core-doesnt-seem-to-be-working-that-may-be-just-fine/#1b9d5bbb6993|title=Common Core Doesn't Seem To Be Working; That May Be Just Fine|last=McCluskey|first=Neal|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe newest addition to the growing list of government-led initiatives has been the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], or ESSA. The ESSA, enacted in December 2015, is Congress's replacement for the NCLB. The ESSA takes notes from both the RTTT and the NCLB, by keeping the standardized testing of the NCLB while allowing for the flexibility of the RTTT. The ESSA gives states more say in how schools are held accountable, and how states can act to fix issues at their schools, and as such, states can set long-term goals instead of having to worry about year-to-year performance issues as with the NCLB.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/every-student-succeeds-act/index.html|title=The Every Student Succeeds Act: An ESSA Overview|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref> States must still identify low performing schools and provide additional support, but now states can focus on long-term solutions. The new bill also focuses more on academic growth, which is subjective and does not always line up with a student's grade level, whereas the NCLB only cared whether students were performing to grade level.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://educationpost.org/the-abcs-of-esea-essa-and-no-child-left-behind/|title=The ABC's of ESEA, ESSA and No Child Left Behind - Education Post|work=Education Post|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref> By combining the standardized test requirements of the NCLB while allowing for more state control like in the RTTT, the ESSA hopes to achieve long-lasting success and reform.\n\n==== Resources for poor school districts ====\nAnother explanation to address this educational gap is the lack of resources attainable by certain groups of students. A study found that there is a need for financial literacy for students enrolled in colleges and universities. Specifically, there is a need for student knowledge about loans, budgeting, and time requirements for degree completion .<ref>Eichelberger, Brenda, Mattioli, Heather, & Foxhoven, Rachel. (2017). Uncovering Barriers to Financial Capability: Underrepresented Students' Access to Financial Resources. ''Journal of Student Financial Aid,'' ''47''(3), Journal of Student Financial Aid, 2017, Vol.47(3)</ref> Focus group results in the same study concluded that students in search of financial aid information believe that there will be a lack of understanding among advisors and staff regarding minority student's cultural/identity based circumstances. As a result of this belief, many students rather just not seek any services.\n\nOn the high school level, a report finds that the greater the number of people of color enrolled at any particular school, the less likely that school has any computer science courses whatsoever .<ref name=\":0\">Zelinski, N.

Supplementing state funds for the districts with higher amount of disadvantaged students produced benefits in the form of student achievement.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henry | first1 = Gary T. | last2 = Fortner | first2 = C.

There has been a push for partnerships between community agencies and higher education institutions that would offer IDA's to encourage lower income individuals to turn towards higher education.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====School-based reform====\nInitiatives to close the achievement gap have been implemented at the school, district and state level in order to better address the issue. These include investments in pre-kindergarten programs, class size reduction, small schools, curricular reform, alignment of pre-kindergarten through college standards and expectations, and improved teacher education programs.<ref>\"Bridging the Achievement Gap\" John E. Chubb & Tom Loveless, 2002</ref> Many schools have started implementing [[After-school activity|after-school activities]] such as tutoring sessions, remedial programs, and rapid assessment programs. These programs are meant to help minority students learn at a more accelerated rate in order to help them catch up to their peers. Other schools have started de-tracking their students in order to provide the same quality education for all students, regardless of race. De-tracking not only allows for all students to be taught in the same way, but it also opens up new opportunities for students who would be put on a certain career path by their education.\n\n====Teacher-focused reform====\nAnother focus of reform directed toward the achievement gap has been on teacher development, as research shows that since teachers are responsible for almost every aspect of a child's education within the bounds of a classroom. Therefore, in order to best address the achievement gap, reform efforts based on improved teaching are one of the main strategies used to address the gap. This reform effort has been both top-down, in the form of higher state standards for teacher education and preparation,<ref>\"Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching\" Linda Darling-Hammond(prepared for the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 1997)</ref> as well as bottom-up, through programs like Teach for America and AmeriCorps that aim to address educational inequity by recruiting and training teachers specifically to work in high-needs schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teach for America: Our Approach|url=http://www.teachforamerica.org/what-we-do/our-approach/|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Way Public Schools AmeriCorps team|url=http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|accessdate=October 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419162328/http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|archive-date=April 19, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Investment in early childhood====\nOne strategy being used to address the achievement gap has been focusing on early childhood development. Economic research shows that investment at this stage is both more effective and cost effective than interventions later in a child's life.<ref>\"Investments in Early Childhood as a Means for Deficit Reduction\" James Heckman, 2010</ref> By helping develop critical skills early on, these programs cut out the need for such intervention later on. Head Start and various state-funded pre-kindergarten programs target students from low-income families in an attempt to level the playing field for these children before school begins. In addition to increased access, there has also an increased national focus on raising quality standards for Head Start and state-funded pre-K programs, and in improving training and professional development for early care providers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Changing Landscape of Pre-K: Examining the changes and impacts of quality standards in prekindergarten at the national, state, district and program levels|url=http://www.nieer.org|accessdate=April 13, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110417172816/http://nieer.org/| archivedate=April 17, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThere is substantial evidence pointing to early childhood development playing a huge role in closing the achievement gap: various studies, including the Carolina Abecedarian study, Child-Parent Center study, and HighScope Perry Preschool study, have shown that pre-K programs can have a positive and long-lasting impact on academic achievement of low-income and minority students.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=F.

Pre-K programs help students develop social, emotional, and critical thinking skills at a young age, and while none of this prevents the effects of poverty, it does help in dampening the effects while also better preparing student for their future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/03/524907739/pre-k-decades-worth-of-studies-one-strong-message|title=Pre-K: Decades Worth Of Studies, One Strong Message|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Narrowing the achievement gap through technology====\n\nComputer and technology use have been linked to increased student achievement. \u201cWhen teachers and administrators make a sustained commitment to the use of [[computers in the classroom]], student achievement increases (Mann & Shafer, 1997).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=D. |last2=Shafer |first2=E. |year=1997 |title=Technology and Achievement |journal=The American School Board Journal |url=http://www.asbj.com/achievement/cilcilo.html }}</ref> Randomized experiments demonstrate that the performance of low-achieving students can be improved by using technology that adjusts the level of difficulty of the books and math problems that are presented to each student, raises the probability that each student will achieve high scores on end-of-book reading comprehension quizzes and high accuracy scores on daily math assignments, raises the probability that each student can earn high letter grades, and creates a structured environment where each student is likely to receive regular, objective, positive feedback signaling that he or she is advancing on a daily basis, promoting high self-efficacy and a strong sense of control over academic outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ysseldyke |first=Jim |last2=Bolt |first2=Daniel M. |year=2007 |title=Effect of Technology-Enhanced Continuous Progress Monitoring on Math Achievement |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=453\u2013467 |doi= }}</ref><ref>Ross, Steven M., Nunnery, John, & Goldfeder, Elizabeth (2004).

These skills can be achieved through the use of weblogs, social networking sites, feeds, and myriad other multimedia. In classrooms, students can communicate internally, or they can work side by side with others who are located thousands of miles away. Through the use of technology, presentations can be archived so that the material can be reviewed at any time. \u201cAll teachers could record important parts of what they do in the classroom that can then be archived to the class Weblog and used by students who may have missed the class or just want a refresher on what happened.\u201d (Richardson, p.&nbsp;117)<ref name=\"Richardson, W. 2010\">Richardson, W. (2010), Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms</ref>\n\nHaving access to information on the web gives students an advantage to learning. \u201cStudents at all levels show more interest in their work and their ability to locate and reflect upon their work is greatly enhanced as are the opportunities for collaborative learning\u201d (Richardson, p.&nbsp;28).<ref name=\"Richardson, W. 2010\"/> Weblogs are different from posts or comments; they require students to analyze and synthesize the content and communicate their understanding with the audience responses in mind. \n \nTechnology has been incorporated into the Standards. Even though the NCLB Act holds school districts accountable for student achievement, there are still many students who do not have the resources at home to fully take part in these excellent educational tools. Some teachers feel that technology is not the solution and see it as a risk. Therefore, technology is not always being used to its fullest potential by teachers and students do not gain the advantages technology offers. \u201cGiven the fact that the amount of information going online shows no sign of slowing, if they are unable to consistently collect potentially relevant information for their lives and careers and quickly discern what of that information is most useful, they will be at a disadvantage.\u201d (Richardson, p.&nbsp;73).<ref name=\"Richardson, W. 2010\"/>\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, by 2012, it is estimated that 70% of homes will have broadband access. While this is a large percentage, it still leaves 30% of households without internet access. The government has lent its hand in closing the Global Achievement Gap by granting funding for low-income school districts for programs such as one-on-one computing, however, the fact that many of these students do not have online capability at home is still a main issue. This [[digital divide]] may cause the achievement gap to increase as technology continues to become heavily integrated in the daily coursework for school children. Students need to have Internet access outside of school on a regular basis to successfully complete challenging courswork.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics, it noted that African American 12th grade male students had the lowest reading scores among other racial and ethnic group.

In 2008 Janet Hyde and others published a study showing that male and female students did equally well on [[No Child Left Behind]] standardized tests that were administered in second through eleventh grades in ten states. However, Hyde and her team did find gaps that favored males at the upper end of the achievement distribution and tried to examine gaps on more difficult test questions (previous research has shown that males outperform females on more challenging items), but the tests they examined lacked adequately challenging items.

The first is that teachers are more likely to give special attention and extra assistance to students who appear to be struggling in their class. In reading and writing classes, male students are often behind female students in terms of achievement. Therefore, male students are more likely to get more teacher attention, and this extra interaction could give males an advantage in terms of future achievement. The second view is that teachers demand more and show more respect toward students who they view to be high achievers, which creates a cycle in which only students who are perceived to be intelligent receive extra help and teacher attention.<ref name=\"Good\">{{cite journal |last=Good |first=T.

Teachers usually have higher expectations for students they view as higher achievers and treat these students with more respect.<ref name=\"Good\"/> A study by Tach and Farkas has also found that when students are split into reading groups based on their abilities, the students in the higher-ability reading groups are more likely to demonstrate positive learning behaviors and higher achievement.<ref name=\"Tach\"/>\n\nTeachers are more likely to favor girls when evaluating what types of readers students seem to be. Because studies have shown that teacher perceptions of students can determine how much individualized attention a student receives and can serve as an indicator of future academic progress, if teachers underestimate males\u2019 reading abilities and use ability grouping in their classrooms, male students might be put at a disadvantage and have their learning in reading classes be negatively affected.<ref name=\"Tach\">{{cite journal |last=Tach |first=L.

Differences in [[gender roles]] in a particular culture, as well as [[sexism]], can influence a person's interests, opportunities, and activities in a way that might increase or decrease intellectual abilities for any particular task. For ethical and practical reasons, it is not generally feasible to perform an experiment that raises children without a gender identity or which randomly assigns a gender identity, to distinguish the effects of [[socialization]] from genetics.\n\nResearchers concerned with the achievement gap between genders cite biological differences, such as brain structure and development, as a possible reason why one gender outperforms the other in certain subjects. For example, a Virginia Tech Study conducted in 2000 examined the brains of 508 children and found that different areas of the brain develop in a different sequence in girls compared to boys.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hanlon|first=Harriet|author2=Robert Thatcher |author3=Marvin Cline|title=Gender Differences in the Development of EEG Coherence in Normal Children|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=1999|volume=16|issue=3|pages=479\u2013506|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn1603_27}}</ref>\n\nThe differing maturation speed of the brain between boys and girls affects how each gender processes information and could have implications for how they perform in school.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sax|first=Leonard|title=Why Gender Matters: What Parents and Teachers Need to Know about the Emerging Science of Sex Differences|url=https://archive.org/details/whygendermatters00leon|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Doubleday|location=Portland}}</ref>\n\n===Implications of the gender gap===\n\nIt is important to address the gender achievement gap in education because failure to cultivate the academic talents of any one group will have aggregate negative consequences. If women are underrepresented in STEM fields, and if men are underrepresented in the social sciences and humanities, both genders are missing opportunities to develop diverse skill sets that can help them in the workplace.<ref name=\"Ellison\">{{cite journal |last=Ellison |first=Glenn |first2=Ashley |last2=Swanson |year=2010 |title=The Gender Gap in Secondary School Mathematics at High Achievement Levels: Evidence from the American Mathematics Competitions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=109\u2013128 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.109 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w15238.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIf the gender achievement gap in education continues to exist, so does the stereotype that medicine, science, and engineering are all \u201cmasculine\u201d fields and that women belong in fields like teaching, counseling, or social work. This stereotype can lead to the image that women who pursue careers in the STEM fields are seen as \u201cnerdy\u201d or \u201cgeeky,\u201d and this can have a detrimental effect on the self-esteem of females who do choose to enter these fields.<ref name=\"Ellison\"/>\n\nResearchers have found that the gender achievement gap has a large impact on the future career choices of high-achieving students. Part of this is a result of the college majors that men and women choose; men are more likely to major in engineering or the hard sciences, while women are more likely to receive degrees in English, psychology, or sociology. Therefore, men are statistically more likely to enter careers that have more potential for higher long-term earnings than women.<ref name=\"Dey\"/>\n\nThe careers that are aligned with these majors have different levels of prestige and different salaries, which can lead to a [[Gender pay gap|gender wage gap]]. U.S. Census data indicates that women who work full-time earn only 77% of what their male counterparts earn. For men and women who are ten years out of college, women earn only 69% of the salaries of their male workers.<ref name=\"Dey\"/>\n\n===Attempts to reduce the gender gap===\n\nThere have been several studies done of interventions aimed at reducing the gender achievement gap in science classes. Some interventions, such as instituting mentoring programs aimed at women or restructuring the course curriculum, have had limited success. The most successful interventions have been a form of psychological interventions called values affirmation. In a famous study of women's achievement in college science by Miyake et al., values affirmation was successful in reducing the differences between male and female academic achievement in college-level introductory physics classes, and it has been particularly effective at combating the psychological phenomenon known as [[stereotype threat]].<ref name=\"Miyake\"/>\n\nValues affirmation exercises require students to either write about their most important values or their least important values two times at the beginning of the 15-week course. After this intervention, the modal grades of women enrolled in the course increased from a C to a B. Psychological interventions such as this one show promise for increasing women's achievement in math and science courses and reducing the achievement gap that exists between the genders in these subject areas, but further research will need to be done in order to determine whether the positive effects are long-lasting.<ref name=\"Miyake\">{{cite journal |first=Akira |last=Miyake |first2=Lauren E. |last2=Kost-Smith |first3=Noah D. |last3=Finkelstein |first4=Steven J. |last4=Pollock |first5=Geoffrey L. |last5=Cohen |first6=Tiffany A. |last6=Ito |displayauthors=1 |year=2010 |title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=330 |issue=6008 |pages=1234\u20131237 |doi=10.1126/science.1195996 |bibcode=2010Sci...330.1234M |pmid=21109670 }}</ref>\n\n==LGBT achievement gap==\n\nThe [[LGBT]] achievement gap refers to the difference in academic performance and achievement between LGBT youth and their [[heterosexual]] peers.  Historically, the circumstance of LGBT youth in education has received little attention from scholars and the media.<ref>Harrell, J. (2013, September 10). The LGBT Achievement Gap Needs to Get Out of the Closet. The Huffington Post. Retrieved from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-harrell/the-lgbt-achievement-gap-needs-to-get-out-of-the-closet_b_3890764.html</ref> The term [[LGBT]] refers to [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] persons but often is understood to encompass the [[sexual minority]]. Before the turn of the century, little research went into the topic of the LGBT population in schools. However, with the [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]]'s (GLSEN) recurring study on school climate in the U.S. for LGBT students, there is now more information indicating the existence of an achievement gap. LGBT students in the U.S. tend to have lower [[GPA]]s than their heterosexual peers, as well as higher truancy and dropout rates. There are many supposed causes of this achievement gap, as well as efforts to alleviate the disparity.<ref name=GLSEN>Kosciw, J. G., Greytak, E. A., Bartkiewicz, M. J., Boesen, M. J., & Palmer, N. A. (2012). The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in Our Nation's Schools. Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN). 121 West 27th Street Suite 804, New York, NY 10001.</ref>\n\nIn United States secondary schools, LGBT youth often have more difficult experiences compared to their heterosexual [[peer group|peers]], leading to observed underachievement, though current data is limited. In Massachusetts, LGBT youth are 12% less likely to make A and B grades than their heterosexual peers.<ref name=NEA /> The GLSEN reports that 92.3% of LGBT youth report experienced harassment in 2011, compared to about 25% of the general youth population (as reported by the [[United States Department of Justice]]).<ref name=GLSEN /><ref name=NEA>Kim, R. (2009). A report on the status of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in education: Stepping out of the closet, into the light. National Education Association.</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/bullying-statistics.html | title=Bullying Statistics| date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Among LGBT youth, those who endure more severe harassment report significantly lower GPAs than LGBT youth who endure less harassment (2.9 to 3.2, respectively). Less-harassed LGBT youth are also twice as likely to plan for higher education than their highly victimized peers, indicating a general lack of interest in school among LGBT youth.<ref name=GLSEN />\n\n[[Dropping out]] and absenteeism are also concerns with LGBT youth. According to the [[National Education Association]]\u2019s report on LGBT students, gay and bisexual students are almost twice as likely to consider dropping out as heterosexual students, and transgendered students are even more likely.<ref name=NEA /> High instances of dropping out prevent LGBT students from pursuing higher education. Because most studies focus on students enrolled in school and it is hard to find a sample of student youth out of school, an accurate count of LGBT youth who have dropped out of school is hard to obtain.<ref name=GLSEN /> While many LGBT students do not drop out, they often miss school because they feel unsafe. Nationwide, about 50% of students enduring severe verbal harassment, and 70% of students enduring severe physical harassment miss school once a month out of concern for their safety.<ref name=GLSEN /> Studies in Massachusetts schools indicate that LGBT students are up to six times more likely than heterosexual students to miss school. Likewise, students in California who endure harassment \"because of actual or perceived sexual orientation\" are three times as likely as non-harassed heterosexual students to miss school, meaning even heterosexual students harassed for suspected sexual orientation endure some of these problems.<ref name=NEA />\n\nDespite such evidence of negative experiences, some LGBT find positive benefits in [[coming out]]. Students who are out, while receiving increased harassment from homophobic peers, have lower instances of depression and a greater sense of belonging, a phenomenon well documented in other LGBT studies as well.<ref name=GLSEN /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vaughan | first1 = M.

Retrieved from http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/education/18sex.html?_r=0</ref> An extensive nationwide survey conducted by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] indicates that, among women, LGBT identity is inversely related to education level, meaning that for every progressive education level, the percentage of women identifying as LGBT steadily decreases. For instance, while 6.7% of women with no [[high school diploma]] identify as lesbian, bisexual, or something else, only 2.9% of women with a bachelor's degree or higher identify that way. The same study showed no statistically significant correlation between LGBT identity and education for men.<ref>Mosher, W. D., Copen, C., & Sionean, C. (2011).

With extensive studies into the personal experiences of LGBT youth by the GLSEN, the Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and other organizations, some issues relevant to LGBT youth stand out as affecting academic outcomes.\n\nThe most highly documented and widely studied cause of underachievement by LGBT students is the problem of [[bullying]] in schools.<ref name=GLSEN /><ref name=NEA /> Out of students of any sexual identity who feel unsafe at school, 60% feel so because of their sexual orientation. More specifically, a bully's perception of a student's sexual orientation or gender-nonconformity\u2014not necessarily the individual's actual sexual identity\u2014leads to bullying. Because of this, a gender-nonconforming yet heterosexual student could experience some of the same academic outcomes attributed to the LGBT students.<ref name=NEA /> 33% of LGBT students nationwide have skipped school at lease once in a single month for personal safety, and these students who have missed school are three times more likely to attempt [[suicide]] than those who have not missed school.<ref name=NEA />\n\nIn addition to their schooling experience, LGBT youth often have negative home environments. LGBT youth have a very unique situation in that the may not find any support from their family. Upon coming out to their parents, 50% of LGBT teens met a negative reaction.<ref name=NEA /><ref name=Homelessness>Ray, N., & Berger, C. (2007). Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth: An epidemic of homelessness. National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute.</ref> Two studies indicate that approximately 30% of LGBT youth encountered physical violence and 26% were kicked out of the house. This risk is higher for transgender teens.<ref name=Homelessness /> Because of these negative home environments, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, based on studies in Seattle, estimates that 40% of all homeless youth in the United States are LGBT, compared to roughly 3.5% of the general population.<ref name=Homelessness /><ref>Gates, G. J. (2011). How many people are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender?.</ref> In addition to these homeless youths\u2019 higher risk for [[sexual violence]], [[drug abuse]], and [[prostitution]], all of which would affect performance (or general attendance) in school, these youth may not be able to enroll in school at all. Some public schools are either reluctant to or ignorant about enrolling homeless students, significantly thwarting a teen's pursuit of educational opportunities.<ref name=NEA /><ref name=Homelessness />\n\n===Proposed solutions to the LGBT achievement gap===\n\nGovernment-based as well as independent organizations focusing on education or LGBT issues have proposed solutions to improving the experiences of LGBT youth in schools. One such solution is the inclusion of LGBT-related subjects in a school's curriculum, shown to improve LGBT youths' performance in school. When surveyed, school personnel in California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota ranked lesson plans as the top need in addressing LGBT concerns.<ref name=NEA /> The [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]] proposes including LGBT curriculum in school health and sex education classes. Their proposed curriculum would aim to teach students, over the course of their K-12 education, to understand sexual orientation as well as gender roles, and treat others with respect, among other key concepts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McGarry | first1 = R | year = 2013 | title = Build a curriculum that includes everyone | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 94 | issue = 5| pages = 27\u201331 | doi=10.1177/003172171309400506}}</ref> However, many states in the U.S. including [[Alabama]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], and others, have laws explicitly prohibiting the inclusion of homosexuality in education. Alabama and Texas laws even require teachers to refrain from presenting homosexuality as an acceptable [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Significant opposition to changing these statutes exist in these states, preventing the inclusion of LGBT curriculum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoshall|first= L.|date =2013 |title = Afraid of Who You Are: No Promo Homo Laws in Public School Sex Education |journal = Texas Journal of Women & the Law |volume =22|number =2|pages = 219\u2013239|url = https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tjwl22&id=231&collection=journals&index=}}</ref>\n\nThe NEA recommends the inclusion of specific school policies protecting LGBT from harassment and bullying. LGBT students in Massachusetts who attend schools with safety policies explicitly regarding LGBT students are 3.5 times more likely to make A and B grades than LGBT youth in other schools.<ref name=NEA />  Additionally, student organizations such as [[gay-straight alliance]]s (GSAs) can improve the experience of LGBT youth in schools. Even when LGBT students don't participate in their school's GSA, the very presence of the organization can reduce threat and injury of LGBT students by one-third, and reduce LGBT suicide attempts by almost 50%. LGBT students in Massachusetts schools with GSAs were twice as likely to earn A and B grades than LGBT students in schools without GSAs.<ref name=NEA />\n\n== Gap of native-born behind immigrants ==\nEducational attainment rates change when it comes to comparing the same races against immigrants or foreign born students.

In both the criminal case files and contemporary journalistic accounts, the killer was called the '''Whitechapel Murderer''' and '''Leather Apron'''.\n\nAttacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the [[East End of London]] whose throats were cut prior to abdominal [[mutilation|mutilations]]. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and numerous letters were received by media outlets and [[Scotland Yard]] from individuals purporting to be the murderer. The name \"Jack the Ripper\" originated in [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The [[From Hell letter|\"From Hell\" letter]] received by [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] came with half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as \"Jack the Ripper\", mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events.\n\nExtensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper, and the legend solidified. A police investigation into a [[Whitechapel murders|series of eleven brutal murders]] committed in Whitechapel and [[Spitalfields]] between 1888 and 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888. Five victims\u2014[[Mary Ann Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman]], [[Elizabeth Stride]], [[Catherine Eddowes]], and [[Mary Jane Kelly]]\u2014are known as the \"canonical five\" and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked. The murders were never solved, and the legends surrounding these crimes became a combination of genuine historical research, [[folklore]], and [[pseudohistory]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:JacktheRipperWhitechapelcirca1890.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Women and children congregate in front of one of the Whitechapel [[common lodging-house]]s close to where Jack the Ripper murdered two of his victims<ref>''Serial Killers: True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-7835-0001-0}} p. 93</ref>]]\nIn the mid-19th century, Britain experienced an influx of [[Irish diaspora|Irish immigrants]] who swelled the populations of the major cities, including the [[East End of London]].

In both the criminal case files and contemporary journalistic accounts, the killer was called the '''Whitechapel Murderer''' and '''Leather Apron'''.\n\nAttacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the [[East End of London]] whose throats were cut prior to abdominal [[mutilation|mutilations]]. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and numerous letters were received by media outlets and [[Scotland Yard]] from individuals purporting to be the murderer. The name \"Jack the Ripper\" originated in [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The [[From Hell letter|\"From Hell\" letter]] received by [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] came with half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as \"Jack the Ripper\", mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events.\n\nExtensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper, and the legend solidified. A police investigation into a [[Whitechapel murders|series of eleven brutal murders]] committed in Whitechapel and [[Spitalfields]] between 1888 and 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888. Five victims\u2014[[Mary Ann Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman]], [[Elizabeth Stride]], [[Catherine Eddowes]], and [[Mary Jane Kelly]]\u2014are known as the \"canonical five\" and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked. The murders were never solved, and the legends surrounding these crimes became a combination of genuine historical research, [[folklore]], and [[pseudohistory]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:JacktheRipperWhitechapelcirca1890.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Women and children congregate in front of one of the Whitechapel [[common lodging-house]]s close to where Jack the Ripper murdered two of his victims<ref>''Serial Killers: True Crime'' {{ISBN|978-0-7835-0001-0}} p. 93</ref>]]\nIn the mid-19th century, Britain experienced an influx of [[Irish diaspora|Irish immigrants]] who swelled the populations of the major cities, including the [[East End of London]].

Her left [[external carotid artery|carotid artery]] had been severed. Several minor bruises and cuts were found on the body.
