Many people from other states, especially Americans from the Northeast and Midwest, retire in Florida, driving home construction, infrastructure expansion, as well as the banking and financial planning industries. Recreational and commercial fishing have been economically important in Florida for over a century.\n\nFlorida is also an important agricultural state, producing large amounts of vegetables, fruits, cattle, and dairy products.

However, the [[cuisine of the Southern United States]] is popular throughout the whole state. Florida is most often associated with seafood, [[key lime pie]] and [[Floribbean cuisine]]. Citrus production is a major industry and citrus fruits are widely consumed. Tropical fruits are grown in South Florida and are widely used in Florida cuisine. Barbecue is especially popular throughout the state, where many barbecue competitions are held annually. The development of Florida cuisine has drawn on the cuisines of the southeastern United States, the Bahamas, Colombia, Spain, Cuba, and the rest of the Caribbean, as well as being influenced by nationwide and worldwide trends.

The company had about 357,000 Telephone customers, 804,000 Mobile customers and 162,000 Broadband Internet customers (My.T ADSL) as at June 2014.                                        \n\n==History==\n\nMauritius Telecom was founded in July 1992 by a merger between the former Overseas Telecommunications Services Ltd and Mauritius Telecommunication Services Ltd. As from that date, Mauritius Telecom became the major provider of voice, mobile, Internet and data communication services in Mauritius.         \n\nIn 1996, Cellplus Mobile Communications Ltd, a [[Mobile Network Operator]] and a fully owned subsidiary of Mauritius Telecom launched the [[GSM]] network in Mauritius and later during the same year Telecom Plus Ltd, another fully owned subsidiary of Mauritius Telecom as from 2006, launched a [[dial-up Internet access]] service.                                      \n \nIn November 2000, France Telecom (now Orange S.A.) became the majority shareholder of Mauritius Telecom by acquiring 40% of its shares. Following the partnership with France Telecom, Telecom Plus Ltd launched [[internet access|Broadband Internet Access]] in 2002 under the [[Wanadoo]] brand.               \n\nThe two companies launched in June 2006 their [[IPTV]] services branded as My.T which enabled Mauritius to become among the first countries in the world to launch IPTV services.                                     \n\nOn 17 April 2008, Mauritius Telecom re-branded its mobile and internet services as Orange. Cellplus Prepaid and Post Paid were rebranded as Orange Prepay and Post Pay. Telecom Plus dial-up internet access and Wanadoo ADSL as Orange Dial-Up and Orange ADSL.               \n\nIn 2013, Mauritius Telecom introduced fibre optic broadband.  In May 2015, Mauritius Telecom announced that as from 1 June 2015, all its 850,000 [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] mobile customers would receive free unlimited access to [[Facebook]].        \n\nAfter a 10-year branding agreement with Orange came to an end in September 2017. All Mauritius Telecom products were re-branded under the [[My.T]] brand on 9 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.mu/article/320342/telephonie-orange-maurice-devient-myt-mobile|title=T\u00e9l\u00e9phonie: Orange Maurice devient MyT Mobile|first=Florian|last=Lepoigneur|date=9 November 2017|website=lexpress.mu|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Shareholders==\nThe main shareholders of Mauritius Telecom are:\n\n{| style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n| width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" | ''' Mauritius Telecom Stock Ownership'''\n|- valign=\"top\" \n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"\n! style=\"width:2em;\" |Rank !!Owner!!Shares\n|-\n|1|| [[Orange S.A.]] || 40%\n|-\n|2|| [[Government of Mauritius]] || 33.45%\n|-\n|3|| SBM Investments Managers Ltd || 19%\n|-\n|4|| National Pensions Fund || 6.55%\n|-\n|5|| Employees of Mauritius Telecom || 1%\n|-\n| ||'''Total'''||'''100.00'''\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n==Subsidiaries==\n\nMauritius Telecom owns the following companies:\n\n* Call Services Ltd (CSL), a [[telemarketing]] company\n* Cellplus Mobile Communications Ltd, a [[mobile phone|cellular phone]] service provider\n* Mauritius Telecom Foundation\n* Mauritius Telecom International Ventures Ltd\n* MT Properties Ltd\n* MT Services Ltd (MTS)\n* Telecom Plus Ltd, an [[internet service provider]]\n* Teleservices (Mauritius) Ltd, a [[telephone directory]] company\n\n==My.T==\n{{Infobox company |\n  name   = My.T|\n  logo   = [[File:My.T 2016 Logo.png|100px]]|\n  industry       = Pay TV |\n  products       = IPTV |  \n  owner          = Mauritius Telecom |\n  location       = [[Port Louis]],<br>Mauritius |\n  homepage       = http://myt.mu\n}}\n'''My.T''' is an IPTV service in [[Mauritius]].

The company had about 357,000 Telephone customers, 804,000 Mobile customers and 162,000 Broadband Internet customers (My.T ADSL) as at June 2014.                                        \n\n==History==\n\nMauritius Telecom was founded in July 1992 by a merger between the former Overseas Telecommunications Services Ltd and Mauritius Telecommunication Services Ltd. As from that date, Mauritius Telecom became the major provider of voice, mobile, Internet and data communication services in Mauritius.         \n\nIn 1996, Cellplus Mobile Communications Ltd, a [[Mobile Network Operator]] and a fully owned subsidiary of Mauritius Telecom launched the [[GSM]] network in Mauritius and later during the same year Telecom Plus Ltd, another fully owned subsidiary of Mauritius Telecom as from 2006, launched a [[dial-up Internet access]] service.                                      \n \nIn November 2000, France Telecom (now Orange S.A.) became the majority shareholder of Mauritius Telecom by acquiring 40% of its shares. Following the partnership with France Telecom, Telecom Plus Ltd launched [[internet access|Broadband Internet Access]] in 2002 under the [[Wanadoo]] brand.               \n\nThe two companies launched in June 2006 their [[IPTV]] services branded as My.T which enabled Mauritius to become among the first countries in the world to launch IPTV services.                                     \n\nOn 17 April 2008, Mauritius Telecom re-branded its mobile and internet services as Orange. Cellplus Prepaid and Post Paid were rebranded as Orange Prepay and Post Pay. Telecom Plus dial-up internet access and Wanadoo ADSL as Orange Dial-Up and Orange ADSL.               \n\nIn 2013, Mauritius Telecom introduced fibre optic broadband.  In May 2015, Mauritius Telecom announced that as from 1 June 2015, all its 850,000 [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] mobile customers would receive free unlimited access to [[Facebook]].        \n\nAfter a 10-year branding agreement with Orange came to an end in September 2017. All Mauritius Telecom products were re-branded under the [[My.T]] brand on 9 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.mu/article/320342/telephonie-orange-maurice-devient-myt-mobile|title=T\u00e9l\u00e9phonie: Orange Maurice devient MyT Mobile|first=Florian|last=Lepoigneur|date=9 November 2017|website=lexpress.mu|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Shareholders==\nThe main shareholders of Mauritius Telecom are:\n\n{| style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n| width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" | ''' Mauritius Telecom Stock Ownership'''\n|- valign=\"top\" \n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"\n! style=\"width:2em;\" |Rank !!Owner!!Shares\n|-\n|1|| [[Orange S.A.]] || 40%\n|-\n|2|| [[Government of Mauritius]] || 33.45%\n|-\n|3|| SBM Investments Managers Ltd || 19%\n|-\n|4|| National Pensions Fund || 6.55%\n|-\n|5|| Employees of Mauritius Telecom || 1%\n|-\n| ||'''Total'''||'''100.00'''\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n==Subsidiaries==\n\nMauritius Telecom owns the following companies:\n\n* Call Services Ltd (CSL), a [[telemarketing]] company\n* Cellplus Mobile Communications Ltd, a [[mobile phone|cellular phone]] service provider\n* Mauritius Telecom Foundation\n* Mauritius Telecom International Ventures Ltd\n* MT Properties Ltd\n* MT Services Ltd (MTS)\n* Telecom Plus Ltd, an [[internet service provider]]\n* Teleservices (Mauritius) Ltd, a [[telephone directory]] company\n\n==My.T==\n{{Infobox company |\n  name   = My.T|\n  logo   = [[File:My.T 2016 Logo.png|100px]]|\n  industry       = Pay TV |\n  products       = IPTV |  \n  owner          = Mauritius Telecom |\n  location       = [[Port Louis]],<br>Mauritius |\n  homepage       = http://myt.mu\n}}\n'''My.T''' is an IPTV service in [[Mauritius]].

It is patchily distributed in [[Queensland]] from inland of [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and west to [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]]; it is more common in the southeast of the state. In [[New South Wales]], it occurs throughout the [[New England Tablelands (biogeographic region)|New England Tablelands]] and the [[South West Slopes]], extending westward to the [[Pilliga Scrub]] and to [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]], and eastwards into the [[Hunter Valley]]. It is fairly common in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. In [[Victoria]], the speckled warbler is found within a broad strip, including the [[Chiltern Box-Ironbark National Park|Chiltern Box-Ironbark]] and [[Warby-Ovens National Park]]s, the [[Bendigo]] region, the [[Brisbane Ranges]] and [[You Yangs Regional Park|You Yangs]], to Balmoral on the western side of the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ebird.org/map/spewar3|title=eBirdmap: Speckled warbler|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> It is scarce to moderately common within its range.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> Its preferred habitat is open eucalypt woodland with rocky gullies, tussocky grass, scattered logs, and sparse shrubbery.<ref name=Morcombe></ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe speckled warbler is quiet and well camouflaged. However, when disturbed, it will make a grating twitter and fly to a perch, then soon return to foraging on the ground.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> Its song is soft, mellow and musical, interspersed with sharp whistles, somewhat like that of the [[western gerygone]] (''Gerygone fusca'').<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Chapman>{{cite web|url=http://www.graemechapman.com.au/library/sounds.php?c=547&p=180|title=Chapman Library: Speckled warbler|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> It is also a mimic of other species.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Simpson></ref><ref name=Morcombe></ref><ref name=Gregory></ref> Like the [[redthroat]] (''Pyrrholaemus brunneus''), the speckled warbler makes a distinctive whirring sound with its wings in flight.<ref name=Chapman></ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nThe breeding season is from August to January.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> It builds a dome-shaped nest with a side-entrance in a slight hollow, near the base of a tree or dense shrub, or among fallen branches.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Morcombe></ref> The nest is loosely built of dried grass, bark-shreds and moss, often lined with feathers and fur, and resembling the surrounding debris.<ref name=Morcombe></ref><ref name=Pizzey></ref> It lays a clutch of 3 or 4 eggs, each measuring {{convert|19|x|16|mm|in}}.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> The eggs are a reddish-chocolate, darker at the large end.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Gregory></ref> The female incubates the eggs for 17-20 days.<ref name=Gregory></ref> The female broods the hatchlings, and then the nestlings are fed by her and the primary male for 15-19 days.<ref name=Gregory></ref> The nests are [[brood parasite|parasitised]] by the [[fan-tailed cuckoo]] (''Cacomantis flabelliformis'') and the [[black-eared cuckoo]] (''Chrysococcyx osculans'').<ref name=Gregory></ref>\n\n===Diet and Foraging===\nIt feeds on the ground, often in the company of other birds ([[mixed species flocks]]), such as the [[buff-rumped thornbill]] (''Acanthiza reguloides''), [[eastern yellow robin]] (''Eopsaltria australis''), [[white-browed scrubwren]] (''Sericornis frontalis''), [[spotted pardalote]] (''Pardalotus punctatus''), [[weebill]] (''Smicrornis brevirostris''), and [[silver-eye]] (''Zosterops lateralis'').<ref name=Slater></ref><ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Gregory></ref> It is mainly insectivorous, but occasionally eats seeds.

It is patchily distributed in [[Queensland]] from inland of [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and west to [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]]; it is more common in the southeast of the state. In [[New South Wales]], it occurs throughout the [[New England Tablelands (biogeographic region)|New England Tablelands]] and the [[South West Slopes]], extending westward to the [[Pilliga Scrub]] and to [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]], and eastwards into the [[Hunter Valley]]. It is fairly common in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. In [[Victoria]], the speckled warbler is found within a broad strip, including the [[Chiltern Box-Ironbark National Park|Chiltern Box-Ironbark]] and [[Warby-Ovens National Park]]s, the [[Bendigo]] region, the [[Brisbane Ranges]] and [[You Yangs Regional Park|You Yangs]], to Balmoral on the western side of the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ebird.org/map/spewar3|title=eBirdmap: Speckled warbler|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> It is scarce to moderately common within its range.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> Its preferred habitat is open eucalypt woodland with rocky gullies, tussocky grass, scattered logs, and sparse shrubbery.<ref name=Morcombe></ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe speckled warbler is quiet and well camouflaged. However, when disturbed, it will make a grating twitter and fly to a perch, then soon return to foraging on the ground.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> Its song is soft, mellow and musical, interspersed with sharp whistles, somewhat like that of the [[western gerygone]] (''Gerygone fusca'').<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Chapman>{{cite web|url=http://www.graemechapman.com.au/library/sounds.php?c=547&p=180|title=Chapman Library: Speckled warbler|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> It is also a mimic of other species.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Simpson></ref><ref name=Morcombe></ref><ref name=Gregory></ref> Like the [[redthroat]] (''Pyrrholaemus brunneus''), the speckled warbler makes a distinctive whirring sound with its wings in flight.<ref name=Chapman></ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nThe breeding season is from August to January.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> It builds a dome-shaped nest with a side-entrance in a slight hollow, near the base of a tree or dense shrub, or among fallen branches.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Morcombe></ref> The nest is loosely built of dried grass, bark-shreds and moss, often lined with feathers and fur, and resembling the surrounding debris.<ref name=Morcombe></ref><ref name=Pizzey></ref> It lays a clutch of 3 or 4 eggs, each measuring {{convert|19|x|16|mm|in}}.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> The eggs are a reddish-chocolate, darker at the large end.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Gregory></ref> The female incubates the eggs for 17-20 days.<ref name=Gregory></ref> The female broods the hatchlings, and then the nestlings are fed by her and the primary male for 15-19 days.<ref name=Gregory></ref> The nests are [[brood parasite|parasitised]] by the [[fan-tailed cuckoo]] (''Cacomantis flabelliformis'') and the [[black-eared cuckoo]] (''Chrysococcyx osculans'').<ref name=Gregory></ref>\n\n===Diet and Foraging===\nIt feeds on the ground, often in the company of other birds ([[mixed species flocks]]), such as the [[buff-rumped thornbill]] (''Acanthiza reguloides''), [[eastern yellow robin]] (''Eopsaltria australis''), [[white-browed scrubwren]] (''Sericornis frontalis''), [[spotted pardalote]] (''Pardalotus punctatus''), [[weebill]] (''Smicrornis brevirostris''), and [[silver-eye]] (''Zosterops lateralis'').<ref name=Slater></ref><ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Gregory></ref> It is mainly insectivorous, but occasionally eats seeds.

She claims that one cannot rely on these primary sources as accurate historical accounts because they have been altered and re-written by subsequent generations of Christians.\n\n==== Examination of primary sources ====\nIn her examination of the \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\", Moss claims that it contains \"many wild coincidences, improbabilities and illegalities\".

They were not concerned with religious doctrine, but political rebellion.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|174}}\n\n=== Rewards for martyrs ===\nMoss describes Church teachings that, once dead, all would wait for the [[Day of Judgement]] to decide one's eternal fate - all except for martyrs, who were awarded a [[martyr's crown]] and immediately went to heaven.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|209}} For this reason some Christians deliberately sought martyrdom in a suicidal quest for a martyr's crown.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n=== Conclusions ===\nIt is the author's contention that there are consequences of the promotion of such a \"myth\" that reach to the present day. While accepting that there were genuine cases of martyrdom and state persecutions of Christians, the author goes on to claim that the idea of a persecuted church was greatly exaggerated, especially by early church historian Eusebius.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|217\u2013233}} The author concludes that the idea that Christians have always been persecuted by the powers of evil, and always will be, has led to a combative and aggressive attitude by Christians even today. This is evidenced, according to Moss, in debates over such issues as abortion and same-sex marriage.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|249\u2013256}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\nLaura Miller, writing for [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']], reviewed ''The Myth of Persecution''. She said that \"Moss cannot be called a natural or fluent writer, but she is thorough, strives for clarity and is genuinely fired up in her concern for the influence of the myth of martyrdom on Western societies.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=\"The Myth of Persecution\": Early Christians weren't persecuted|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/24/the_myth_of_persecution_early_christians_werent_persecuted/|newspaper=Salon|date=24 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The National Catholic Reporter]]'', Maureen Daly said \"In the first few pages of ''The Myth of Persecution'', I had the feeling that I had fallen into an argument already at full boil...Moss, scholar of the early church and martyrs, contends persecution was rare and the duration brief. Why is this important? 'The myth of Christian martyrdom is not only inaccurate; it has contributed to great violence and continues to support a view of the world in which we are under attack from our fellow human beings,' she writes.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Daly|first=Maureen|title=The long shadow of the martyr myth|url=http://ncronline.org/books/2013/03/long-shadow-martyr-myth|newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=27 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nEphraim Radner, a historical theologian, reviewed the book in ''[[First Things]]''. He wrote that \"according to Moss's criteria... The rule is apparently to read skeptically the writings of the past, but not to doubt the imaginations of present-day scholars. The whole book, however, begs for the latter suspicion.

Moss notes that the letter begins by saying that the events are \"worthy of undying remembrance\" and she observes that the phrase was also used by Eusebius in both the ''Church History'' and his ''[[Martyrs of Palestine]]''.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|113}} According to Moss, these indicate that the letter was edited by Eusebius and that it is therefore impossible to tell which parts of it are historical and which parts were added by Eusebius for theological purposes.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|114}}\n\n=== Duration ===\nAccording to Moss, although [[Roman governor|provincial governors]] in the [[Roman Empire]] had a great deal of personal discretion and power to do what they felt was needed in their jurisdiction, and there were local and sporadic incidents of persecution and mob violence against Christians, for most of the first three hundred years of Christian history Christians were able to live in peace, practice professions, and rise to positions of responsibility. \"We are talking about fewer than ten years out of nearly three hundred during which Christians were executed as the result of imperial initiatives.\"<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|129}} According to the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', \"Of the 249 years from the first persecution under [[Nero]] (64) to the year 313, when [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] established lasting peace, it is calculated that the Christians suffered persecution about 129 years and enjoyed a certain degree of toleration about 120 years.\"<ref>{{CE1913|prescript= |last=Hassatt |first=Maurice M. |wstitle=Martyr |volume=Vol. IX}}</ref>\n\n=== Reasons for persecution ===\nMoss holds that the Romans interpreted refusal to burn incense and make sacrificial offerings to an image of the Emperor as seditious and a sign of possible treason. They were not concerned with religious doctrine, but political rebellion.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|174}}\n\n=== Rewards for martyrs ===\nMoss describes Church teachings that, once dead, all would wait for the [[Day of Judgement]] to decide one's eternal fate - all except for martyrs, who were awarded a [[martyr's crown]] and immediately went to heaven.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|209}} For this reason some Christians deliberately sought martyrdom in a suicidal quest for a martyr's crown.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n=== Conclusions ===\nIt is the author's contention that there are consequences of the promotion of such a \"myth\" that reach to the present day. While accepting that there were genuine cases of martyrdom and state persecutions of Christians, the author goes on to claims that the idea of a persecuted church was greatly exaggerated, especially by early church historian Eusebius.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|217\u2013233}} The author concludes that the idea that Christians have always been persecuted by the powers of evil, and always will be, has led to a combative and aggressive attitude by Christians even today. This is evidenced, according to Moss, in debates over such issues as abortion and same-sex marriage.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>{{rp|249\u2013256}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\nLaura Miller, writing for [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']], reviewed ''The Myth of Persecution''. She said that \"Moss cannot be called a natural or fluent writer, but she is thorough, strives for clarity and is genuinely fired up in her concern for the influence of the myth of martyrdom on Western societies.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=\"The Myth of Persecution\": Early Christians weren't persecuted|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/24/the_myth_of_persecution_early_christians_werent_persecuted/|newspaper=Salon|date=24 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The National Catholic Reporter]]'', Maureen Daly said \"In the first few pages of ''The Myth of Persecution'', I had the feeling that I had fallen into an argument already at full boil...Moss, scholar of the early church and martyrs, contends persecution was rare and the duration brief. Why is this important? 'The myth of Christian martyrdom is not only inaccurate; it has contributed to great violence and continues to support a view of the world in which we are under attack from our fellow human beings,' she writes.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Daly|first=Maureen|title=The long shadow of the martyr myth|url=http://ncronline.org/books/2013/03/long-shadow-martyr-myth|newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=27 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nEphraim Radner, a historical theologian, reviewed the book in ''[[First Things]]''. He wrote that \"according to Moss's criteria... The rule is apparently to read skeptically the writings of the past, but not to doubt the imaginations of present-day scholars. The whole book, however, begs for the latter suspicion. Her framing chapters on the dishonesty and dangers of 'persecution' claims by contemporary conservative political voices and religious leaders easily identify her bias.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Radner|first=Ephraim|title=Unmythical Martyrs A review of The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2013/04/unmythical-martyrs|newspaper=First Things|date= May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Kirkus Reviews]] said \"The myth of martyrdom\u2014and the expectation of huge rewards in heaven\u2014was effective in organizing a cohesive early Christian identity, which involved the notion of being 'under attack' and justified a violent reaction. While none of Moss' arguments are particularly new or striking, she provides an intriguing venture that begs for more research and focus.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=THE MYTH OF PERSECUTION How Early Christians Invented a Story of Persecution|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/candida-moss/the-myth-of-martyrdom/|newspaper=Kirkus Reviews|date=26 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his review, N. Clayton Croy said: \"Modern ideology drives Moss's thesis more than ancient testimony, and the result is a distortion of history more severe than the caricature she wants to expose.\"<ref>https://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/9158_10095.pdf</ref>\n\n== Reviews ==\n\n*{{cite news|last=Trueman|first=Carl|title=The Myth of Persecution |url=http://theaquilareport.com/the-myth-of-persecution/|newspaper=Aquila Report|date= 27 June 2013}}\n*{{cite news|last=Radner|first=Ephraim|title=Unmythical Martyrs A review of The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2013/04/unmythical-martyrs|newspaper=First Things|date= May 2013}}\n*{{cite news|last=Jones|first=E.
