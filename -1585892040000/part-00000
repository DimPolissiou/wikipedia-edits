Established as KBS 3, [[Seoul Animation Center]] and KBS Educational Radio in the 1980s, and became an independent corporation in 1990. EBS strives to supplement school education and promote lifelong education for everyone in Korea.\n\nThe main counterparts of this network are [[PBS]] in the [[United States]], as well as [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]], [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Four]] in the UK.\n\n* '''[[EBS1|EBS 1TV]]''' &mdash; EBS' main terrestrial channel for premium documentaries, preschool and youth program. (Channel 10.1)\n* '''[[EBS2|EBS 2TV]]''' &mdash; EBS' second terrestrial channel. (Channel 10.2)\n* '''[[HLQL-FM|EBS FM]]''' &mdash; A EBS' radio channel, the station focuses mainly on language learning. The actual CSAT listening comprehension examinations are broadcast on this station annually at 8:40 AM and 1:10 PM on the day of the CSAT.\n* '''EBS Plus 1''' (subscription television) &mdash; The channel focuses greatly around the [[College Scholastic Ability Test|high school test curriculum]] and offers programming to complement and amplify the student's in-school education.\n* '''EBS Plus 2''' (subscription television) &mdash; The main focus of this channel is \"lifelong\" learning, with various programs for younger and older viewers.\n* '''EBS English''' (subscription television) &mdash; This is the network's English education channel, covering kids from kindergarten to grade 12.\n* '''EBSuHD''' ([[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]]) &mdash; EBS' children's channel; formerly a simulcast of EBS Plus 1.\n\nAlso EBS offers one pay-television channel, EBS America, in the United States. Its programming centres around Korean culture, language education, and children's shows.\n\n==Funding==\n\nThough considered a public broadcasting entity, EBS gets most of its yearly budget from advertisements and sales revenue. In 2012, 72.1% of its revenue came from textbook sales, publications and ad revenues on its TV Radio and internet platforms, while the rest came from TV license fees (EBS gets 3% of the total License Fee being collected by the Korean Broadcasting System) and government grants.<ref>[http://global.ebs.co.kr/eng/about/report EBS Annual Revenue Report]</ref>\n\n== Logos ==\n<gallery>\nFile:EBS 2.png|Second EBS logo (July 1995 until July 2001)\nFile:EBS 3.png|Third EBS logo (July 2001 until March 2004)\nFile:EBS Logo.svg|Fourth and current EBS logo (March 2004 to present)\n</gallery>\n\n==Programming==\n\n===Originally-produced===\n*''Teletoon Advance''\n*''[[Bboongbboong-E]]''\n*''Piwi-chan! 3D Anime Series''\n*''Chiro''\n* ''EBS News''\n* ''Jisik Channel e'' (Knowledge Channel e; {{lang|ko|\uc9c0\uc2dd\ucc44\ub110 e}})\n* ''[[Tayo the Little Bus]]''\n* ''Janghak Quiz'' ({{lang|ko|\uc7a5\ud559\ud034\uc988}})\n* ''Ding-Dong-Dang kindergarten'' ({{lang|ko|\ub529\ub3d9\ub315\uc720\uce58\uc6d0}})\n* ''[[Roary the Racing Car]]''\n* ''GO!

({{lang|ko|\ud55c\uad6d\uad50\uc721\ubc29\uc1a1\uacf5\uc0ac}}) or '''EBS''' is a South Korean educational television and radio network covering South Korean territory, and the only major South Korean radio and television network without a separate regional service. Established as KBS 3, [[Seoul Animation Center]] and KBS Educational Radio in the 1980s, and became an independent corporation in 1990. EBS strives to supplement school education and promote lifelong education for everyone in Korea.\n\nThe main counterparts of this network are [[PBS]] in the [[United States]], as well as [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]], [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Four]] in the UK.\n\n* '''[[EBS1|EBS 1TV]]''' &mdash; EBS' main terrestrial channel for premium documentaries, preschool and youth program. (Channel 10.1)\n* '''[[EBS2|EBS 2TV]]''' &mdash; EBS' second terrestrial channel. (Channel 10.2)\n* '''[[HLQL-FM|EBS FM]]''' &mdash; A EBS' radio channel, the station focuses mainly on language learning. The actual CSAT listening comprehension examinations are broadcast on this station annually at 8:40 AM and 1:10 PM on the day of the CSAT.\n* '''EBS Plus 1''' (subscription television) &mdash; The channel focuses greatly around the [[College Scholastic Ability Test|high school test curriculum]] and offers programming to complement and amplify the student's in-school education.\n* '''EBS Plus 2''' (subscription television) &mdash; The main focus of this channel is \"lifelong\" learning, with various programs for younger and older viewers.\n* '''EBS English''' (subscription television) &mdash; This is the network's English education channel, covering kids from kindergarten to grade 12.\n* '''EBSuHD''' ([[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]]) &mdash; EBS' children's channel; formerly a simulcast of EBS Plus 1.\n\nAlso EBS offers one pay-television channel, EBS America, in the United States. Its programming centres around Korean culture, language education, and children's shows.\n\n==Funding==\n\nThough considered a public broadcasting entity, EBS gets most of its yearly budget from advertisements and sales revenue. In 2012, 72.1% of its revenue came from textbook sales, publications and ad revenues on its TV Radio and internet platforms, while the rest came from TV license fees (EBS gets 3% of the total License Fee being collected by the Korean Broadcasting System) and government grants.<ref>[http://global.ebs.co.kr/eng/about/report EBS Annual Revenue Report]</ref>\n\n== Logos ==\n<gallery>\nFile:EBS 2.png|Second EBS logo (July 1995 until July 2001)\nFile:EBS 3.png|Third EBS logo (July 2001 until March 2004)\nFile:EBS Logo.svg|Fourth and current EBS logo (March 2004 to present)\n</gallery>\n\n==Programming==\n\n===Originally-produced===\n*''Teletoon Advance''\n*''[[Bboongbboong-E]]''\n*''Piwi-chan! 3D Anime Series''\n*''Chiro''\n* ''EBS News''\n* ''Jisik Channel e'' (Knowledge Channel e; {{lang|ko|\uc9c0\uc2dd\ucc44\ub110 e}})\n* ''[[Tayo the Little Bus]]''\n* ''Janghak Quiz'' ({{lang|ko|\uc7a5\ud559\ud034\uc988}})\n* ''Ding-Dong-Dang kindergarten'' ({{lang|ko|\ub529\ub3d9\ub315\uc720\uce58\uc6d0}})\n* ''[[Roary the Racing Car]]''\n* ''GO!
