Therefore, to give concrete the ability to resist being stretched, steel bars, which can resist high stretching forces, are often added to concrete to form [[reinforced concrete]].\n\n[[Fibre-reinforced plastic|Fibre-reinforced polymers]] (FRP)s include [[carbon fiber reinforced polymer]] (CFRP) and [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP). If classified by matrix then there are [[thermoplastic composites]], [[short fiber thermoplastics|short fibre thermoplastics]], [[long fibre thermoplastic]]s or long fibre-reinforced thermoplastics. There are numerous [[thermoset]] composites, including [[paper composite panels]]. Many advanced [[thermoset polymer matrix]] systems usually incorporate [[aramid]] [[fibre]] and [[carbon fibre]] in an [[epoxy resin]] matrix.\n\n[[Shape memory polymer]] composites are high-performance composites, formulated using fibre or fabric reinforcement and shape memory polymer resin as the matrix. Since a shape memory polymer resin is used as the matrix, these composites have the ability to be easily manipulated into various configurations when they are heated above their [[activation temperature]]s and will exhibit high strength and stiffness at lower temperatures.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} They can also be reheated and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} These composites are ideal{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} for applications such as lightweight, rigid, deployable structures; rapid manufacturing; and dynamic reinforcement.\n\n[[High strain composite structure|High strain composites]] are another type of high-performance composites that are designed to perform in a high deformation setting and are often used in deployable systems where structural flexing is advantageous.{{citation needed|date =August 2017}} Although high strain composites exhibit many similarities to shape memory polymers, their performance is generally dependent on the fibre layout as opposed to the resin content of the matrix.\n\nComposites can also use metal fibres reinforcing other metals, as in [[metal matrix composite]]s (MMC) or [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|ceramic matrix composites]] (CMC), which includes [[bone mineral|bone]] ([[hydroxyapatite]] reinforced with [[collagen]] fibres), [[cermet]] (ceramic and metal) and [[concrete]]. Ceramic matrix composites are built primarily for [[fracture toughness]], not for strength. Another class of composite materials involve woven fabric composite consisting of longitudinal and transverse laced yarns. Woven fabric composites are flexible as they are in form of fabric.\n\nOrganic matrix/ceramic aggregate composites include [[asphalt concrete]], [[polymer concrete]], [[mastic asphalt]], [[mastic roller hybrid]], [[dental composite]], [[syntactic foam]] and [[nacre|mother of pearl]]. [[Chobham armour]] is a special type of [[composite armour]] used in military applications.\n\nAdditionally, thermoplastic composite materials can be formulated with specific metal powders resulting in materials with a density range from 2 g/cm\u00b3 to 11 g/cm\u00b3 (same density as lead). The most common name for this type of material is \"high gravity compound\" (HGC), although \"lead replacement\" is also used. These materials can be used in place of traditional materials such as aluminium, stainless steel, brass, bronze, copper, lead, and even tungsten in weighting, balancing (for example, modifying the centre of gravity of a tennis [[racquet]]), vibration damping, and radiation shielding applications. High density composites are an economically viable option when certain materials are deemed hazardous and are banned (such as lead) or when secondary operations costs (such as machining, finishing, or coating) are a factor.\n\nA [[sandwich-structured composite]] is a special class of composite material that is fabricated by attaching two thin but stiff skins to a lightweight but thick core. The core material is normally low strength material, but its higher thickness provides the sandwich composite with high [[bending]] [[stiffness]] with overall low [[density]].\n\nWood is a naturally occurring composite comprising cellulose fibres in a [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]] matrix. [[Engineered wood]] includes a wide variety of different products such as wood fibre board, [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]], [[wood plastic composite]] (recycled wood fibre in polyethylene matrix), [[Pykrete]] (sawdust in ice matrix), Plastic-impregnated or [[Plastic-coated paper|laminated paper]] or textiles, [[Arborite]], [[Formica (plastic)]] and [[Micarta]]. Other engineered laminate composites, such as [[Mallite]], use a central core of end grain [[balsa wood]], bonded to surface skins of light [[alloy]] or GRP. These generate low-weight, high rigidity materials.\n\nParticulate composites have particle as filler material dispersed in matrix, which may be nonmetal, such as glass, epoxy. Automobile tire is an example of particulate composite.\n\nAdvanced diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated polymer composites have been reported<ref name=\"ZiaShah2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Zia|first1=Abdul Wasy|last2=Shah|first2=Atta Ur Rehman|last3=Lee|first3=Seunghun|last4=Song|first4=Jung Il|title=Development of diamond-like-carbon coated abaca-reinforced polyester composites for hydrophobic and outdoor structural applications|journal=Polymer Bulletin|volume=72|issue=11|year=2015|pages=2797\u20132808|issn=0170-0839|doi=10.1007/s00289-015-1436-y}}</ref> where the coating increases the surface hydrophobicity, hardness and wear resistance.\n\n=== Products ===\n\nFibre-reinforced composite materials have gained popularity (despite their generally high cost) in high-performance products that need to be lightweight, yet strong enough to take harsh loading conditions such as [[aerospace]] components ([[empennage|tail]]s, [[wing]]s, [[fuselage]]s, [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s), boat and [[scull]] hulls, [[bicycle]] frames and [[racing car]] bodies. Other uses include [[fishing rod]]s, [[storage tank]]s, swimming pool panels, and [[Composite baseball bat|baseball bats]]. The [[Boeing 787]] and [[Airbus A350]] structures including the wings and fuselage are composed largely of composites. Composite materials are also becoming more common in the realm of [[orthopedic surgery]], and it is the most common hockey stick material.\n\nCarbon composite is a key material in today's launch vehicles and [[heat shield]]s for the [[re-entry]] phase of [[spacecraft]]. It is widely used in solar panel substrates, antenna reflectors and yokes of spacecraft. It is also used in payload adapters, inter-stage structures and heat shields of [[launch vehicle]]s. Furthermore, [[disk brake]] systems of [[airplane]]s and racing cars are using [[carbon/carbon]] material, and the [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|composite material]] with [[carbon fibre]]s and [[silicon carbide]] matrix has been introduced in [[luxury vehicle]]s and [[sports car]]s.\n\nIn 2006, a fibre-reinforced composite pool panel was introduced for in-ground swimming pools, residential as well as commercial, as a non-corrosive alternative to galvanized steel.\n\nIn 2007, an all-composite military [[Humvee]] was introduced by TPI Composites Inc and Armor Holdings Inc, the first all-composite [[military vehicle]]. By using composites the vehicle is lighter, allowing higher payloads. In 2008, carbon fibre and [[DuPont]] Kevlar (five times stronger than steel) were combined with enhanced thermoset resins to make military transit cases by ECS Composites creating 30-percent lighter cases with high strength.\n\nPipes and fittings for various purpose like transportation of potable water, fire-fighting, irrigation, seawater, desalinated water, chemical and industrial waste, and sewage are now manufactured in glass reinforced plastics.\n\nComposite materials used in tensile structures for facade application provides the advantage of being translucent.

There are two main categories of constituent materials: '''matrix''' ([[binder (material)|binder]]) and '''reinforcement'''. At least one portion of each type is required. The matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism produces material properties unavailable from the individual constituent materials, while the wide variety of matrix and strengthening materials allows the designer of the product or structure to choose an optimum combination.\n\nEngineered composite materials must be formed to shape. The matrix material can be introduced to the reinforcement before or after the reinforcement material is placed into the [[Molding (process)|mould]] cavity or onto the mould surface. The matrix material experiences a melding event, after which the part shape is essentially set. Depending upon the nature of the matrix material, this melding event can occur in various ways such as chemical [[polymerization]] for a [[thermoset polymer matrix]], or solidification from the melted state for a thermoplastic polymer matrix composite.\n\nA variety of moulding methods can be used according to the end-item design requirements. The principal factors impacting the methodology are the natures of the chosen matrix and reinforcement materials. Another important factor is the gross quantity of material to be produced. Large quantities can be used to justify high capital expenditures for rapid and automated manufacturing technology. Small production quantities are accommodated with lower capital expenditures but higher labour and tooling costs at a correspondingly slower rate.\n\nMany commercially produced composites use a [[polymer]] matrix material often called a resin solution. There are many different polymers available depending upon the starting raw ingredients. There are several broad categories, each with numerous variations. The most common are known as [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], [[epoxy]], [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]], [[polyimide]], [[polyamide]], [[polypropylene]], [[PEEK]], and others. The reinforcement materials are often fibres but also commonly ground minerals. The various methods described below have been developed to reduce the resin content of the final product, or the fibre content is increased. As a rule of thumb, lay up results in a product containing 60% resin and 40% fibre, whereas vacuum infusion gives a final product with 40% resin and 60% fibre content. The strength of the product is greatly dependent on this ratio.\n\nMartin Hubbe and Lucian A Lucia consider [[wood]] to be a natural composite of [[cellulose fibre]]s in a [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] of [[lignin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_02/BioRes_02_4_534_535_Hubbe_L_BioResJ_Editorial_LoveHate.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327013842/http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_02/BioRes_02_4_534_535_Hubbe_L_BioResJ_Editorial_LoveHate.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-27 |title=The \"love-hate\" relationship present in lignocellulosic materials |last1=Hubbe |first1=Martin A. |last2=Lucia |first2=Lucian A.}}</ref><ref>David Hon and Nobuo Shiraishi, eds. (2001) Wood and cellulose chemistry, 2nd ed. (New York: Marcel Dekker), p. 5 ff.</ref>\n\n==Constituents==\n\n===Matrices===\n\n====Organic====\n\nPolymers are common matrices (especially used for fibre reinforced plastics). Road surfaces are often made from [[asphalt concrete]] which uses [[bitumen]] as a matrix. Mud (wattle and daub) has seen extensive use. Typically, most common polymer-based composite materials, including [[fibreglass]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[Kevlar]], include at least two parts, the substrate and the resin.\n\nPolyester resin tends to have yellowish tint, and is suitable for most backyard projects. Its weaknesses are that it is UV sensitive and can tend to degrade over time, and thus generally is also coated to help preserve it. It is often used in the making of surfboards and for marine applications. Its hardener is a peroxide, often MEKP (methyl ethyl ketone peroxide).  When the peroxide is mixed with the resin, it decomposes to generate free radicals, which initiate the curing reaction.  Hardeners in these systems are commonly called catalysts, but since they do not re-appear unchanged at the end of the reaction, they do not fit the strictest chemical definition of a catalyst.\n\n[[Vinyl ester resin]] tends to have a purplish to bluish to greenish tint. This resin has lower viscosity than polyester resin and is more transparent. This resin is often billed as being fuel resistant, but will melt in contact with gasoline. It tends to be more resistant over time to degradation than polyester resin and is more flexible. It uses the same hardeners as polyester resin (at a similar mix ratio) and the cost is approximately the same.\n\nEpoxy resin is almost transparent when cured. In the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material or as a structural glue.\n\n[[Shape memory polymer]] (SMP) resins have varying visual characteristics depending on their formulation. These resins may be epoxy-based, which can be used for auto body and outdoor equipment repairs; cyanate-ester-based, which are used in space applications; and acrylate-based, which can be used in very cold temperature applications, such as for sensors that indicate whether perishable goods have warmed above a certain maximum temperature.  These resins are unique in that their shape can be repeatedly changed by heating above their [[glass transition]] temperature (T''<sub>g</sub>''). When heated, they become flexible and elastic, allowing for easy configuration. Once they are cooled, they will maintain their new shape. The resins will return to their original shapes when they are reheated above their T''<sub>g</sub>''. The advantage of shape memory polymer resins is that they can be shaped and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties. These resins can be used in fabricating shape memory composites.\n\nTraditional materials such as glues, muds have traditionally been used as matrices for [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] and [[adobe]].\n\n====Inorganic====\n\nCement (concrete), metals, ceramics, and sometimes glasses are employed. Unusual matrices such as ice are sometime proposed as in [[pykecrete]].\n\n===Reinforcements===\n\n====Fiber====\n[[File:Glass reinforcements.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Differences in the way the fibres are laid out give different strengths and ease of manufacture]]\nReinforcement usually adds rigidity and greatly impedes crack propagation. Thin fibers can have very high strength, and provided they are mechanically well attached to the matrix they can greatly improve the composite's overall properties.\n\n[[Fibre]]-reinforced composite materials can be divided into two main categories normally referred to as [[Short Fiber Reinforced Blends|short fibre-reinforced materials]] and continuous fiber-reinforced materials. Continuous reinforced materials will often constitute a layered or laminated structure. The woven and continuous fiber styles are typically available in a variety of forms, being pre-impregnated with the given matrix (resin), dry, uni-directional tapes of various widths, plain weave, harness satins, braided, and stitched.\n\nThe short and long fibres are typically employed in compression moulding and sheet moulding operations. These come in the form of flakes, chips, and random mate (which can also be made from a continuous fibre laid in random fashion until the desired thickness of the ply / laminate is achieved).\n\nCommon fibres used for reinforcement include [[glass (fiber)|glass fibres]],  carbon fibres, cellulose (wood/paper fibre and straw) and high strength polymers for example [[aramid]]. [[Silicon carbide]] fibers are used for some high temperature applications.\n\n'''Particle'''\n\nParticle reinforcement adds a similar effect to [[precipitation hardening]] in metals and ceramics.  Large particles impede dislocation movement and crack propagation as well as contribute to the composite's [[Young's modulus|Young's Modulus]].  In general, particle reinforcement effect on Young's Modulus lies between values predicted by\n\n<math>E_c = \\frac{E_\\alpha E_\\beta}{(V_\\alpha E_\\beta + V_\\beta E_\\alpha)}</math>\n\nas a lower bound and\n\n<math>E_c = V_\\alpha E_\\alpha + V_\\beta E_\\beta </math>\n\nas an upper bound.\n\nTherefore, it can be expressed as a linear combination of contribution from the matrix and some weighted contribution from the particles.\n\n<math>E_c = V_m E_m + K_c V_p E_p</math>\n\nWhere K<sub>c</sub> is an experimentally derived constant between 0 and 1.  This range of values for K<sub>c</sub> reflects that particle reinforced composites are not characterized by the isostrain condition.\n\nSimilarly, the tensile strength can be modeled in an equation of similar construction where K<sub>s</sub> is a similarly bounded constant not necessarily of the same value of K<sub>c</sub><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|last=H.|first=Courtney, Thomas|date=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0070285941|edition= 2nd |location=Boston|oclc=41932585}}</ref>\n\n<math>(T.S.)_c = V_m (T.S.)_m + K_s V_p (T.S.)_p</math>\n\nThe true value of K<sub>c</sub> and K<sub>s</sub> vary based on factors including particle shape, particle distribution, and particle/matrix interface.

The operation is usually{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} done in an open or closed forming mould, but the order and ways of introducing the ingredients varies considerably.\n\n===Mould overview===\nWithin a mould, the reinforcing and matrix materials are combined, compacted, and cured (processed) to undergo a melding event. After the melding event, the part shape is essentially set, although it can deform under certain process conditions. For a [[thermoset polymer matrix]] material, the melding event is a curing reaction that is initiated by the application of additional heat or chemical reactivity such as an organic peroxide. For a thermoplastic polymeric matrix material, the melding event is a solidification from the melted state. For a metal matrix material such as titanium foil, the melding event is a fusing at high pressure and a temperature near the melting point.\n\nFor many moulding methods, it is convenient to refer to one mould piece as a \"lower\" mould and another mould piece as an \"upper\" mould. Lower and upper refer to the different faces of the moulded panel, not the mould's configuration in space. In this convention, there is always a lower mould, and sometimes an upper mould. Part construction begins by applying materials to the lower mould. Lower mould and upper mould are more generalized descriptors than more common and specific terms such as male side, female side, a-side, b-side, tool side, bowl, hat, mandrel, etc. Continuous manufacturing uses a different nomenclature.\n\nThe moulded product is often referred to as a panel. For certain geometries and material combinations, it can be referred to as a casting. For certain continuous processes, it can be referred to as a profile.\n\n===Vacuum bag moulding===\nVacuum bag moulding uses a flexible film to enclose the part and seal it from outside air. Vacuum bag material is available in a tube shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the vacuum bag and atmospheric pressure compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging materials, the edges of the vacuum bag are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould.  When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane vacuum bag. The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the vacuum bag, a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure. This process can be performed at either ambient or elevated temperature with ambient atmospheric pressure acting upon the vacuum bag. A vacuum pump is typically used to draw a vacuum. An economical method of drawing a vacuum is with a [[Aspirator (pump)|venturi vacuum]] and air compressor.\n\nA vacuum bag is a bag made of strong [[rubber]]-coated [[fabric]] or a polymer film used to compress the part during cure or hardening.  In some applications the bag encloses the entire material, or in other applications a [[Molding (process)|mold]] is used to form one face of the laminate with the bag being a single layer to seal to the outer edge of the mold face.\nWhen using a tube shaped bag, the ends of the bag are sealed and the air is drawn out of the bag through a nipple using a [[vacuum pump]].  As a result, uniform pressure approaching one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] is applied to the surfaces of the object inside the bag, holding parts together while the [[adhesive]] [[Curing (chemistry)|cures]].  The entire bag may be placed in a temperature-controlled oven, oil bath or water bath and gently heated to accelerate curing.\n\nVacuum bagging is widely used in the composites industry as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/what-is-vacuum-bagging/|title=What is Vacuum Bagging?|publisher=Coventive Composites|accessdate=2018-10-01|date=2018-09-20}}</ref> [[carbon (fibre)|Carbon fibre]] fabric and [[glass (fibre)|fibreglass]], along with resins and epoxies are common materials laminated together with a vacuum bag operation.\n\n;Woodworking applications\nIn commercial woodworking facilities, vacuum bags are used to laminate curved and irregular shaped workpieces.\n\nTypically, polyurethane or vinyl materials are used to make the bag. A tube shaped bag is open at both ends. The piece, or pieces to be glued are placed into the bag and the ends sealed. One method of sealing the open ends of the bag is by placing a clamp on each end of the bag. A plastic rod is laid across the end of the bag, the bag is then folded over the rod. A plastic sleeve with an opening in it, is then snapped over the rod. This procedure forms a seal at both ends of the bag, when the vacuum is ready to be drawn.\n\nA \"platen\" is sometimes used inside the bag for the piece being glued to lie on. The platen has a series of small slots cut into it, to allow the air under it to be evacuated. The platen must have rounded edges and corners to prevent the vacuum from tearing the bag.\n\nWhen a curved part is to be glued in a vacuum bag, it is important that the pieces being glued be placed over a solidly built form, or have an air bladder placed under the form. This air bladder has access to \"free air\" outside the bag. It is used to create an equal pressure under the form, preventing it from being crushed.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Vacuum_Systems_pg_4_-_Vacuum_bags.html|title=  Vacuum Bags For Woodworking|url-status=  live|archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20100928231703/http://prowoodworkingtips.com/Vacuum_Systems_pg_4_-_Vacuum_bags.html|archivedate=  2010-09-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Pressure bag moulding ===\nThis process is related to vacuum bag molding in exactly the same way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a flexible male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite [[helmets]] due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.\n\n=== Autoclave moulding ===\nA process using a two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. On the lower side is a rigid mould and on the upper side is a flexible membrane made from silicone or an extruded polymer film such as nylon. Reinforcement materials can be placed manually or robotically. They include continuous fibre forms fashioned into textile constructions. Most often, they are pre-impregnated with the resin in the form of [[Pre-preg|prepreg]] fabrics or unidirectional tapes. In some instances, a resin film is placed upon the lower mould and dry reinforcement is placed above. The upper mould is installed and vacuum is applied to the mould cavity. The assembly is placed into an [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]]. This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.\n\n=== Resin transfer moulding (RTM) ===\nRTM is a process using a rigid two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. The mould is typically constructed from aluminum or steel, but composite molds are sometimes used.  The two sides fit together to produce a mould cavity. The distinguishing feature of resin transfer moulding is that the reinforcement materials are placed into this cavity and the mould set is closed prior to the introduction of matrix material. Resin transfer moulding includes numerous varieties which differ in the mechanics of how the resin is introduced to the reinforcement in the mould cavity. These variations include everything from the RTM methods used in [[out of autoclave composite manufacturing]] for high-tech aerospace components to vacuum infusion (for resin infusion see also [[boat building]]) to vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding (VARTM). This process can be performed at either [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] or elevated temperature and is suitable for manufacturing high performance composite components in medium volumes (1,000s to 10,000s of parts).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/resin-transfer-moulding-rtm/|accessdate=2018-10-01|title=What is Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)?|publisher=Coventive Composites|date=2018-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Light Resin Transfer Molding (LRTM) ===\nSimilar to the methods performed in Resin Transfer Molding, Light Resin Transfer Molding (Light RTM) involves a closed mold process. A vacuum holds mold A and mold B together to result in two finished sides with fixed thickness levels. Vacuum rings around the tools hold the molds together for this process after dry fiber reinforcements are loaded into mold A before joining with mold B. The air is vacuumed out of the molds with a lower vacuum level, separate from the tooling. After the air is removed the resin is injected into the part. The vacuum remains in effect into the resin is cured.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.coppsindustries.com/epoxy-products/composite-materials|title=Composite Epoxy Resin Manufacturing - Copps Industries|work=Copps Industries|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Other fabrication methods ===\nOther types of fabrication include press moulding, [[transfer moulding]], [[pultrusion]] moulding, [[filament winding]], [[casting]], centrifugal casting, [[Braiding machine|braiding]] (onto a [[former]]), [[continuous casting]] and [[slip forming]]. There are also forming capabilities including [[Numerical control|CNC]] filament winding, vacuum infusion, wet lay-up, [[compression moulding]], and [[thermoplastic]] moulding, to name a few. The use of curing ovens and paint booths is also needed for some projects.\n\n==== Finishing methods ====\nThe finishing of the composite parts is also critical in the final design.  Many of these finishes will include rain-erosion coatings or polyurethane coatings.\n\n=== Tooling ===\nThe mould and mould inserts are referred to as \"tooling.\" The mould/tooling can be constructed from a variety of materials. Tooling materials include [[invar]], steel, [[aluminium]], reinforced [[silicone rubber]], [[nickel]], and [[carbon fibre]]. Selection of the tooling material is typically based on, but not limited to, the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]], expected number of cycles, end item tolerance, desired or required surface condition, method of cure, [[glass transition temperature]] of the material being moulded, moulding method, matrix, cost and a variety of other considerations.\n\n== Physical properties ==\n[[File:Composite elastic modulus.svg|thumb|Plot of the overall strength of a composite material as a function of fiber volume fraction limited by the upper bound (isostrain) and lower bound (isostress) conditions.]]\nThe physical properties of composite materials are generally not [[isotropic]] (independent of direction of applied force) in nature, but they are typically [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] (different depending on the direction of the applied force or load). For instance, the stiffness of a composite panel will often depend upon the orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The strength of a composite is bounded by two loading conditions as shown in the plot to the right. If both the fibres and matrix are aligned parallel to the loading direction, the deformation of both phases will be the same (assuming there is no delamination at the fibre-matrix interface). This isostrain condition provides the upper bound for composite strength, and is determined by the rule of mixtures:\n[[File:Isostress and isostrain conditions for composite materials.gif|thumb|Figure a) shows the isostress condition where the composite materials are perpendicular to the applied force and b) is the isostrain condition that has the layers parallel to the force.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Hyoung Seop |title=On the rule of mixtures for the hardness of particle reinforced composites |journal=Materials Science and Engineering: A |date=September 2000 |volume=289 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=30\u201333 |doi=10.1016/S0921-5093(00)00909-6 }}</ref>]]\n<math>E_C = \\sum_{i=1} V_iE_i</math>\n\nwhere ''E<sub>C</sub>'' is the effective composite [[Young's modulus]], and ''V<sub>i</sub>'' and ''E<sub>i</sub>'' are the volume fraction and Young's moduli, respectively, of the composite phases.\n\nFor example, a composite material made up of \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases as shown in the figure to the right under isostrain, the Young's modulus would be as follows:<math display=\"block\">E_C=V_\\alpha E_\\alpha+V_\\beta E_\\beta</math>where V<sub>\u03b1</sub> and V<sub>\u03b2</sub> are the respective volume fractions of each phase.\nThis can be derived by considering that in the isostrain case, <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_C = \\epsilon_\\alpha = \\epsilon_\\beta = \\epsilon </math>\nAssuming that the composite has a uniform cross section, the stress on the composite is a weighted average between the two phases, <math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_C = \\sigma_\\alpha V_\\alpha + \\sigma_\\beta V_\\beta </math>\nThe stresses in the individual phases are given by Hooke's Law, <math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_\\beta = E_\\beta \\epsilon </math>  <math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_\\alpha = E_\\alpha \\epsilon </math> Combining these equations gives that the overall stress in the composite is  <math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_C = E_\\alpha V_\\alpha \\epsilon + E_\\beta V_\\beta \\epsilon = (E_\\alpha V_\\alpha  + E_\\beta V_\\beta) \\epsilon </math>\n\nNow we can show <math display=\"block\"> E_C = (E_\\alpha V_\\alpha  + E_\\beta V_\\beta) </math>\n\nThe lower bound is dictated by the isostress condition, in which the fibres and matrix are oriented perpendicularly to the loading direction:\n\n<math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_C = \\sigma_\\alpha = \\sigma_\\beta = \\sigma </math> and now the strains become a weighted average <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_C = \\epsilon_\\alpha V_\\alpha + \\epsilon_\\beta V_\\beta </math>\n\nRewriting Hooke's Law for the individual phases <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_\\beta =  \\frac{\\sigma}{E_\\beta} </math>  <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_\\alpha =  \\frac{\\sigma}{E_\\alpha} </math>\nThis leads to  <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_c = V_\\beta  \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_\\beta} + V_\\alpha  \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_\\alpha} = (\\frac{V_\\alpha}{\\epsilon_\\alpha}  + \\frac{V_\\beta}{\\epsilon_\\beta}) \\sigma </math> From the definition of Hooke's Law\n\n<math display=\"block\"> \\frac{1}{E_C} = \\frac{V_\\alpha}{E_\\alpha} + \\frac{V_\\beta}{E_\\beta}  </math> and in general\n\n<math>\\frac{1}{E_C} = \\sum_{i=1}\\frac{V_i}{E_i} </math>\n\nFollowing the example above, if one had a composite material made up of \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases under isostress conditions as shown in the figure to the right, the composition Young's modulus would be:<math display=\"block\">E_C=(E_\\alpha E_\\beta)/(V_\\alpha E_\\beta+V_\\beta E_\\alpha)</math>The isostrain condition implies that under an applied load, both phases experience the same strain but will feel different stress. Comparatively, under isostress conditions both phases will feel the same stress but the strains will differ between each phase.\nThough composite stiffness is maximized when fibres are aligned with the loading direction, so is the possibility of fibre tensile fracture, assuming the tensile strength exceeds that of the matrix. When a fibre has some angle of misorientation \u03b8, several fracture modes are possible. For small values of \u03b8 the stress required to initiate fracture is increased by a factor of (cos \u03b8)<sup>\u22122</sup> due to the increased cross-sectional area (''A'' cos \u03b8) of the fibre and reduced force (''F/''cos \u03b8) experienced by the fibre, leading to a composite tensile strength of ''\u03c3<sub>parallel </sub>/''cos<sup>2</sup> \u03b8 where ''\u03c3<sub>parallel </sub>'' is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres aligned parallel with the applied force.\n\nIntermediate angles of misorientation \u03b8 lead to matrix shear failure. Again the cross sectional area is modified but since shear stress is now the driving force for failure the area of the matrix parallel to the fibres is of interest, increasing by a factor of 1/sin \u03b8. Similarly, the force parallel to this area again decreases (''F/''cos \u03b8) leading to a total tensile strength of ''\u03c4<sub>my</sub> /''sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 where ''\u03c4<sub>my</sub>'' is the matrix shear strength.\n\nFinally, for large values of \u03b8 (near \u03c0/2) transverse matrix failure is the most likely to occur, since the fibres no longer carry the majority of the load. Still, the tensile strength will be greater than for the purely perpendicular orientation, since the force perpendicular to the fibres will decrease by a factor of 1/sin \u03b8 and the area decreases by a factor of 1/sin \u03b8 producing a composite tensile strength of ''\u03c3<sub>perp</sub> /''sin<sup>2</sup>\u03b8 where ''\u03c3<sub>perp </sub>'' is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres align perpendicular to the applied force.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Courtney |first=Thomas H. |date=2000 |title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials |edition= 2nd |publisher=Waveland Press, Inc. |location=Long Grove, IL |pages=263\u2013265 |isbn=978-1-57766-425-3 }}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:Composite Strength as a Function of Fiber Misalignment.png|thumb|The graph depicts the three fracture modes a composite material may experience depending on the angle of misorientation relative to aligning fibres parallel to the applied stress.]]\n\nThe majority of commercial composites are formed with random dispersion and orientation of the strengthening fibres, in which case the composite Young's modulus will fall between the isostrain and isostress bounds. However, in applications where the strength-to-weight ratio is engineered to be as high as possible (such as in the aerospace industry), fibre alignment may be tightly controlled.\n\nPanel stiffness is also dependent on the design of the panel. For instance, the fibre reinforcement and matrix used, the method of panel build, thermoset versus thermoplastic, and type of weave.\n\nIn contrast to composites, isotropic materials (for example, aluminium or steel), in standard wrought forms, typically have the same stiffness regardless of the directional orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures for an isotropic material can be described with the following material properties: Young's Modulus, the [[shear Modulus]] and the [[Poisson's ratio]], in relatively simple mathematical relationships. For the anisotropic material, it requires the mathematics of a second order tensor and up to 21 material property constants. For the special case of orthogonal isotropy, there are three different material property constants for each of Young's Modulus, Shear Modulus and Poisson's ratio\u2014a total of 9 constants to describe the relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures.\n\nTechniques that take advantage of the anisotropic properties of the materials include [[mortise and tenon]] joints (in natural composites such as wood) and [[Pi Joints]] in synthetic composites.\n\n=== Failure ===\nShock, impact, or repeated cyclic stresses can cause the laminate to separate at the interface between two layers, a condition known as [[delamination]]. Individual fibres can separate from the matrix e.g. [[fiber pull-out|fibre pull-out]].\n\nComposites can fail on the [[microscopic]] or [[macroscopic]] scale. Compression failures can occur at both the macro scale or at each individual reinforcing fibre in compression buckling. Tension failures can be net section failures of the part or degradation of the composite at a microscopic scale where one or more of the layers in the composite fail in tension of the matrix or failure of the bond between the matrix and fibres.\n\nSome composites are brittle and have little reserve strength beyond the initial onset of failure while others may have large deformations and have reserve energy absorbing capacity past the onset of damage. The variations in fibres and matrices that are available and the [[mixture]]s that can be made with blends leave a very broad range of properties that can be designed into a composite structure.\nThe best known failure of a brittle ceramic matrix composite occurred when the carbon-carbon composite tile on the leading edge of the wing of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] fractured when impacted during take-off. It led to catastrophic break-up of the vehicle when it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003.\n\nCompared to metals, composites have relatively poor bearing strength.\n\n=== Testing ===\nTo aid in predicting and preventing failures, composites are tested before and after construction. Pre-construction testing may use [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) for ply-by-ply analysis of curved surfaces and predicting wrinkling, crimping and dimpling of composites.<ref name=\"Waterman\">{{Cite journal\n |author      = Waterman, Pamela J.\n |title       = The Life of Composite Materials\n |journal     = Desktop Engineering Magazine\n |volume      = April 2007\n |url         = http://66.195.41.10/Articles/Feature/The-Life-of-Composite-Materials-200704101800.html\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20071202141018/http://66.195.41.10/Articles/Feature/The-Life-of-Composite-Materials-200704101800.html\n |archivedate = 2007-12-02\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aghdam |first1=M.M. |last2=Morsali |first2=S.R. |title=Damage initiation and collapse behavior of unidirectional metal matrix composites at elevated temperatures |journal=Computational Materials Science |date=November 2013 |volume=79 |pages=402\u2013407 |doi=10.1016/j.commatsci.2013.06.024 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Primary and Secondary Manufacturing of Polymer Matrix Composites.|last=Kishore.|first=Debnath|others=Singh, Inderdeep.|isbn=9781498799300|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=1004424029|date = 2017-09-18}}</ref><ref>[https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/what-is-finite-element-analysis/ What is Finite Element Analysis?]</ref> Materials may be tested during manufacturing and after construction through several [[Nondestructive testing|nondestructive]] methods including ultrasonics, thermography, shearography and X-ray radiography,<ref>{{Cite journal\n |author      = Matzkanin, George A.\n |author2     = Yolken, H.

Therefore, to give concrete the ability to resist being stretched, steel bars, which can resist high stretching forces, are often added to concrete to form [[reinforced concrete]].\n\n[[Fibre-reinforced plastic|Fibre-reinforced polymers]] (FRP)s include [[carbon fiber reinforced polymer]] (CFRP) and [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP). If classified by matrix then there are [[thermoplastic composites]], [[short fiber thermoplastics|short fibre thermoplastics]], [[long fibre thermoplastic]]s or long fibre-reinforced thermoplastics. There are numerous [[thermoset]] composites, including [[paper composite panels]]. Many advanced [[thermoset polymer matrix]] systems usually incorporate [[aramid]] [[fibre]] and [[carbon fibre]] in an [[epoxy resin]] matrix.\n\n[[Shape memory polymer]] composites are high-performance composites, formulated using fibre or fabric reinforcement and shape memory polymer resin as the matrix. Since a shape memory polymer resin is used as the matrix, these composites have the ability to be easily manipulated into various configurations when they are heated above their [[activation temperature]]s and will exhibit high strength and stiffness at lower temperatures.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} They can also be reheated and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} These composites are ideal{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} for applications such as lightweight, rigid, deployable structures; rapid manufacturing; and dynamic reinforcement.\n\n[[High strain composite structure|High strain composites]] are another type of high-performance composites that are designed to perform in a high deformation setting and are often used in deployable systems where structural flexing is advantageous.{{citation needed|date =August 2017}} Although high strain composites exhibit many similarities to shape memory polymers, their performance is generally dependent on the fibre layout as opposed to the resin content of the matrix.\n\nComposites can also use metal fibres reinforcing other metals, as in [[metal matrix composite]]s (MMC) or [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|ceramic matrix composites]] (CMC), which includes [[bone mineral|bone]] ([[hydroxyapatite]] reinforced with [[collagen]] fibres), [[cermet]] (ceramic and metal) and [[concrete]]. Ceramic matrix composites are built primarily for [[fracture toughness]], not for strength. Another class of composite materials involve woven fabric composite consisting of longitudinal and transverse laced yarns. Woven fabric composites are flexible as they are in form of fabric.\n\nOrganic matrix/ceramic aggregate composites include [[asphalt concrete]], [[polymer concrete]], [[mastic asphalt]], [[mastic roller hybrid]], [[dental composite]], [[syntactic foam]] and [[nacre|mother of pearl]]. [[Chobham armour]] is a special type of [[composite armour]] used in military applications.\n\nAdditionally, thermoplastic composite materials can be formulated with specific metal powders resulting in materials with a density range from 2 g/cm\u00b3 to 11 g/cm\u00b3 (same density as lead). The most common name for this type of material is \"high gravity compound\" (HGC), although \"lead replacement\" is also used. These materials can be used in place of traditional materials such as aluminium, stainless steel, brass, bronze, copper, lead, and even tungsten in weighting, balancing (for example, modifying the centre of gravity of a tennis [[racquet]]), vibration damping, and radiation shielding applications. High density composites are an economically viable option when certain materials are deemed hazardous and are banned (such as lead) or when secondary operations costs (such as machining, finishing, or coating) are a factor.\n\nA [[sandwich-structured composite]] is a special class of composite material that is fabricated by attaching two thin but stiff skins to a lightweight but thick core. The core material is normally low strength material, but its higher thickness provides the sandwich composite with high [[bending]] [[stiffness]] with overall low [[density]].\n\nWood is a naturally occurring composite comprising cellulose fibres in a [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]] matrix. [[Engineered wood]] includes a wide variety of different products such as wood fibre board, [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]], [[wood plastic composite]] (recycled wood fibre in polyethylene matrix), [[Pykrete]] (sawdust in ice matrix), Plastic-impregnated or [[Plastic-coated paper|laminated paper]] or textiles, [[Arborite]], [[Formica (plastic)]] and [[Micarta]]. Other engineered laminate composites, such as [[Mallite]], use a central core of end grain [[balsa wood]], bonded to surface skins of light [[alloy]] or GRP. These generate low-weight, high rigidity materials.\n\nParticulate composites have particle as filler material dispersed in matrix, which may be nonmetal, such as glass, epoxy. Automobile tire is an example of particulate composite.\n\nAdvanced diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated polymer composites have been reported<ref name=\"ZiaShah2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Zia|first1=Abdul Wasy|last2=Shah|first2=Atta Ur Rehman|last3=Lee|first3=Seunghun|last4=Song|first4=Jung Il|title=Development of diamond-like-carbon coated abaca-reinforced polyester composites for hydrophobic and outdoor structural applications|journal=Polymer Bulletin|volume=72|issue=11|year=2015|pages=2797\u20132808|issn=0170-0839|doi=10.1007/s00289-015-1436-y}}</ref> where the coating increases the surface hydrophobicity, hardness and wear resistance.\n\n=== Products ===\n\nFibre-reinforced composite materials have gained popularity (despite their generally high cost) in high-performance products that need to be lightweight, yet strong enough to take harsh loading conditions such as [[aerospace]] components ([[empennage|tail]]s, [[wing]]s, [[fuselage]]s, [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s), boat and [[scull]] hulls, [[bicycle]] frames and [[racing car]] bodies. Other uses include [[fishing rod]]s, [[storage tank]]s, swimming pool panels, and [[Composite baseball bat|baseball bats]]. The [[Boeing 787]] and [[Airbus A350]] structures including the wings and fuselage are composed largely of composites. Composite materials are also becoming more common in the realm of [[orthopedic surgery]], and it is the most common hockey stick material.\n\nCarbon composite is a key material in today's launch vehicles and [[heat shield]]s for the [[re-entry]] phase of [[spacecraft]]. It is widely used in solar panel substrates, antenna reflectors and yokes of spacecraft. It is also used in payload adapters, inter-stage structures and heat shields of [[launch vehicle]]s. Furthermore, [[disk brake]] systems of [[airplane]]s and racing cars are using [[carbon/carbon]] material, and the [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|composite material]] with [[carbon fibre]]s and [[silicon carbide]] matrix has been introduced in [[luxury vehicle]]s and [[sports car]]s.\n\nIn 2006, a fibre-reinforced composite pool panel was introduced for in-ground swimming pools, residential as well as commercial, as a non-corrosive alternative to galvanized steel.\n\nIn 2007, an all-composite military [[Humvee]] was introduced by TPI Composites Inc and Armor Holdings Inc, the first all-composite [[military vehicle]]. By using composites the vehicle is lighter, allowing higher payloads. In 2008, carbon fibre and [[DuPont]] Kevlar (five times stronger than steel) were combined with enhanced thermoset resins to make military transit cases by ECS Composites creating 30-percent lighter cases with high strength.\n\nPipes and fittings for various purpose like transportation of potable water, fire-fighting, irrigation, seawater, desalinated water, chemical and industrial waste, and sewage are now manufactured in glass reinforced plastics.\n\nComposite materials used in tensile structures for facade application provides the advantage of being translucent.

There are two main categories of constituent materials: '''matrix''' ([[binder (material)|binder]]) and '''reinforcement'''. At least one portion of each type is required. The matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism produces material properties unavailable from the individual constituent materials, while the wide variety of matrix and strengthening materials allows the designer of the product or structure to choose an optimum combination.\n\nEngineered composite materials must be formed to shape. The matrix material can be introduced to the reinforcement before or after the reinforcement material is placed into the [[Molding (process)|mould]] cavity or onto the mould surface. The matrix material experiences a melding event, after which the part shape is essentially set. Depending upon the nature of the matrix material, this melding event can occur in various ways such as chemical [[polymerization]] for a [[thermoset polymer matrix]], or solidification from the melted state for a thermoplastic polymer matrix composite.\n\nA variety of moulding methods can be used according to the end-item design requirements. The principal factors impacting the methodology are the natures of the chosen matrix and reinforcement materials. Another important factor is the gross quantity of material to be produced. Large quantities can be used to justify high capital expenditures for rapid and automated manufacturing technology. Small production quantities are accommodated with lower capital expenditures but higher labour and tooling costs at a correspondingly slower rate.\n\nMany commercially produced composites use a [[polymer]] matrix material often called a resin solution. There are many different polymers available depending upon the starting raw ingredients. There are several broad categories, each with numerous variations. The most common are known as [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], [[epoxy]], [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]], [[polyimide]], [[polyamide]], [[polypropylene]], [[PEEK]], and others. The reinforcement materials are often fibres but also commonly ground minerals. The various methods described below have been developed to reduce the resin content of the final product, or the fibre content is increased. As a rule of thumb, lay up results in a product containing 60% resin and 40% fibre, whereas vacuum infusion gives a final product with 40% resin and 60% fibre content. The strength of the product is greatly dependent on this ratio.\n\nMartin Hubbe and Lucian A Lucia consider [[wood]] to be a natural composite of [[cellulose fibre]]s in a [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] of [[lignin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_02/BioRes_02_4_534_535_Hubbe_L_BioResJ_Editorial_LoveHate.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327013842/http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_02/BioRes_02_4_534_535_Hubbe_L_BioResJ_Editorial_LoveHate.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-27 |title=The \"love-hate\" relationship present in lignocellulosic materials |last1=Hubbe |first1=Martin A. |last2=Lucia |first2=Lucian A.}}</ref><ref>David Hon and Nobuo Shiraishi, eds. (2001) Wood and cellulose chemistry, 2nd ed. (New York: Marcel Dekker), p. 5 ff.</ref>\n\n==Constituents==\n\n===Matrices===\n\n====Organic====\n\nPolymers are common matrices (especially used for fibre reinforced plastics). Road surfaces are often made from [[asphalt concrete]] which uses [[bitumen]] as a matrix. Mud (wattle and daub) has seen extensive use. Typically, most common polymer-based composite materials, including [[fibreglass]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[Kevlar]], include at least two parts, the substrate and the resin.\n\nPolyester resin tends to have yellowish tint, and is suitable for most backyard projects. Its weaknesses are that it is UV sensitive and can tend to degrade over time, and thus generally is also coated to help preserve it. It is often used in the making of surfboards and for marine applications. Its hardener is a peroxide, often MEKP (methyl ethyl ketone peroxide).  When the peroxide is mixed with the resin, it decomposes to generate free radicals, which initiate the curing reaction.  Hardeners in these systems are commonly called catalysts, but since they do not re-appear unchanged at the end of the reaction, they do not fit the strictest chemical definition of a catalyst.\n\n[[Vinyl ester resin]] tends to have a purplish to bluish to greenish tint. This resin has lower viscosity than polyester resin and is more transparent. This resin is often billed as being fuel resistant, but will melt in contact with gasoline. It tends to be more resistant over time to degradation than polyester resin and is more flexible. It uses the same hardeners as polyester resin (at a similar mix ratio) and the cost is approximately the same.\n\nEpoxy resin is almost transparent when cured. In the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material or as a structural glue.\n\n[[Shape memory polymer]] (SMP) resins have varying visual characteristics depending on their formulation. These resins may be epoxy-based, which can be used for auto body and outdoor equipment repairs; cyanate-ester-based, which are used in space applications; and acrylate-based, which can be used in very cold temperature applications, such as for sensors that indicate whether perishable goods have warmed above a certain maximum temperature.  These resins are unique in that their shape can be repeatedly changed by heating above their [[glass transition]] temperature (T''<sub>g</sub>''). When heated, they become flexible and elastic, allowing for easy configuration. Once they are cooled, they will maintain their new shape. The resins will return to their original shapes when they are reheated above their T''<sub>g</sub>''. The advantage of shape memory polymer resins is that they can be shaped and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties. These resins can be used in fabricating shape memory composites.\n\nTraditional materials such as glues, muds have traditionally been used as matrices for [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] and [[adobe]].\n\n====Inorganic====\n\nCement (concrete), metals, ceramics, and sometimes glasses are employed. Unusual matrices such as ice are sometime proposed as in [[pykecrete]].\n\n===Reinforcements===\n\n====Fiber====\n[[File:Glass reinforcements.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Differences in the way the fibres are laid out give different strengths and ease of manufacture]]\nReinforcement usually adds rigidity and greatly impedes crack propagation. Thin fibers can have very high strength, and provided they are mechanically well attached to the matrix they can greatly improve the composite's overall properties.\n\n[[Fibre]]-reinforced composite materials can be divided into two main categories normally referred to as [[Short Fiber Reinforced Blends|short fibre-reinforced materials]] and continuous fiber-reinforced materials. Continuous reinforced materials will often constitute a layered or laminated structure. The woven and continuous fiber styles are typically available in a variety of forms, being pre-impregnated with the given matrix (resin), dry, uni-directional tapes of various widths, plain weave, harness satins, braided, and stitched.\n\nThe short and long fibres are typically employed in compression moulding and sheet moulding operations. These come in the form of flakes, chips, and random mate (which can also be made from a continuous fibre laid in random fashion until the desired thickness of the ply / laminate is achieved).\n\nCommon fibres used for reinforcement include [[glass (fiber)|glass fibres]],  carbon fibres, cellulose (wood/paper fibre and straw) and high strength polymers for example [[aramid]]. [[Silicon carbide]] fibers are used for some high temperature applications.\n\n'''Particle'''\n\nParticle reinforcement adds a similar effect to [[precipitation hardening]] in metals and ceramics.  Large particles impede dislocation movement and crack propagation as well as contribute to the composite's [[Young's modulus|Young's Modulus]].  In general, particle reinforcement effect on Young's Modulus lies between values predicted by\n\n<math>E_c = \\frac{E_\\alpha E_\\beta}{(V_\\alpha E_\\beta + V_\\beta E_\\alpha)}</math>\n\nas a lower bound and\n\n<math>E_c = V_\\alpha E_\\alpha + V_\\beta E_\\beta </math>\n\nas an upper bound.\n\nTherefore, it can be expressed as a linear combination of contribution from the matrix and some weighted contribution from the particles.\n\n<math>E_c = V_m E_m + K_c V_p E_p</math>\n\nWhere K<sub>c</sub> is an experimentally derived constant between 0 and 1.  This range of values for K<sub>c</sub> reflects that particle reinforced composites are not characterized by the isostrain condition.\n\nSimilarly, the tensile strength can be modeled in an equation of similar construction where K<sub>s</sub> is a similarly bounded constant not necessarily of the same value of K<sub>c</sub><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|last=H.|first=Courtney, Thomas|date=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0070285941|edition= 2nd |location=Boston|oclc=41932585}}</ref>\n\n<math>(T.S.)_c = V_m (T.S.)_m + K_s V_p (T.S.)_p</math>\n\nThe true value of K<sub>c</sub> and K<sub>s</sub> vary based on factors including particle shape, particle distribution, and particle/matrix interface. Knowing these parameters, the mechanical properties can be modeled based on effects from [[grain boundary strengthening]], [[Work hardening|dislocation strengthening]], and [[Precipitation hardening|Orowan strengthening]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Guoqing |last2=Zhang |first2=Qingqing |last3=Yang |first3=Xue |last4=Huang |first4=Zheng |last5=Sha |first5=Wei |title=Effects of particle/matrix interface and strengthening mechanisms on the mechanical properties of metal matrix composites |journal=Composite Interfaces |date=24 December 2013 |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=415\u2013429 |doi=10.1080/15685543.2014.872914 }}</ref>\n\nThe most common particle reinforced composite is concrete, which is a mixture of gravel and sand usually strengthened by addition of small rocks or sand.

This is a more common layup for the manufacture of radomes, doors, cowlings, or non-structural parts.\n\nOpen- and closed-cell-structured [[foam]]s like [[polyvinylchloride]], [[polyurethane]], [[polyethylene]] or [[polystyrene]] foams, [[balsa|balsa wood]], [[syntactic foam]]s, and [[composite honeycomb|honeycomb]]s are commonly used core materials. Open- and closed-cell [[metal foam]] can also be used as core materials. Recently, 3D graphene structures ( also called graphene foam) have also been employed as core structures. A recent review by Khurram and Xu et al., have provided the summary of the state-of-the-art techniques for fabrication of the 3D structure of graphene, and the examples of the use of these foam like structures as a core for their respective polymer composites.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shehzad |first1=Khurram |last2=Xu |first2=Yang |last3=Gao |first3=Chao |last4=Duan |first4=Xiangfeng |title=Three-dimensional macro-structures of two-dimensional nanomaterials |journal=Chemical Society Reviews |date=2016 |volume=45 |issue=20 |pages=5541\u20135588 |doi=10.1039/c6cs00218h |pmid=27459895 }}</ref>\n\n====Semi-Crystalline Polymers====\n\nAlthough the two phases are chemically equivalent, semi-crystalline polymers can be described both quantitatively and qualitatively as composite materials.

The operation is usually{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} done in an open or closed forming mould, but the order and ways of introducing the ingredients varies considerably.\n\n===Mould overview===\nWithin a mould, the reinforcing and matrix materials are combined, compacted, and cured (processed) to undergo a melding event. After the melding event, the part shape is essentially set, although it can deform under certain process conditions. For a [[thermoset polymer matrix]] material, the melding event is a curing reaction that is initiated by the application of additional heat or chemical reactivity such as an organic peroxide. For a thermoplastic polymeric matrix material, the melding event is a solidification from the melted state. For a metal matrix material such as titanium foil, the melding event is a fusing at high pressure and a temperature near the melting point.\n\nFor many moulding methods, it is convenient to refer to one mould piece as a \"lower\" mould and another mould piece as an \"upper\" mould. Lower and upper refer to the different faces of the moulded panel, not the mould's configuration in space. In this convention, there is always a lower mould, and sometimes an upper mould. Part construction begins by applying materials to the lower mould. Lower mould and upper mould are more generalized descriptors than more common and specific terms such as male side, female side, a-side, b-side, tool side, bowl, hat, mandrel, etc. Continuous manufacturing uses a different nomenclature.\n\nThe moulded product is often referred to as a panel. For certain geometries and material combinations, it can be referred to as a casting. For certain continuous processes, it can be referred to as a profile.\n\n===Vacuum bag moulding===\nVacuum bag moulding uses a flexible film to enclose the part and seal it from outside air. Vacuum bag material is available in a tube shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the vacuum bag and atmospheric pressure compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging materials, the edges of the vacuum bag are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould.  When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane vacuum bag. The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the vacuum bag, a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure. This process can be performed at either ambient or elevated temperature with ambient atmospheric pressure acting upon the vacuum bag. A vacuum pump is typically used to draw a vacuum. An economical method of drawing a vacuum is with a [[Aspirator (pump)|venturi vacuum]] and air compressor.\n\nA vacuum bag is a bag made of strong [[rubber]]-coated [[fabric]] or a polymer film used to compress the part during cure or hardening.  In some applications the bag encloses the entire material, or in other applications a [[mold]] is used to form one face of the laminate with the bag being a single layer to seal to the outer edge of the mold face.\nWhen using a tube shaped bag, the ends of the bag are sealed and the air is drawn out of the bag through a nipple using a [[vacuum pump]].  As a result, uniform pressure approaching one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] is applied to the surfaces of the object inside the bag, holding parts together while the [[adhesive]] [[Curing (chemistry)|cures]].  The entire bag may be placed in a temperature-controlled oven, oil bath or water bath and gently heated to accelerate curing.\n\nVacuum bagging is widely used in the composites industry as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/what-is-vacuum-bagging/|title=What is Vacuum Bagging?|publisher=Coventive Composites|accessdate=2018-10-01|date=2018-09-20}}</ref> [[carbon (fibre)|Carbon fibre]] fabric and [[glass (fibre)|fibreglass]], along with resins and epoxies are common materials laminated together with a vacuum bag operation.\n\n;Woodworking applications\nIn commercial woodworking facilities, vacuum bags are used to laminate curved and irregular shaped workpieces.\n\nTypically, polyurethane or vinyl materials are used to make the bag. A tube shaped bag is open at both ends. The piece, or pieces to be glued are placed into the bag and the ends sealed. One method of sealing the open ends of the bag is by placing a clamp on each end of the bag. A plastic rod is laid across the end of the bag, the bag is then folded over the rod. A plastic sleeve with an opening in it, is then snapped over the rod. This procedure forms a seal at both ends of the bag, when the vacuum is ready to be drawn.\n\nA \"platen\" is sometimes used inside the bag for the piece being glued to lie on. The platen has a series of small slots cut into it, to allow the air under it to be evacuated. The platen must have rounded edges and corners to prevent the vacuum from tearing the bag.\n\nWhen a curved part is to be glued in a vacuum bag, it is important that the pieces being glued be placed over a solidly built form, or have an air bladder placed under the form. This air bladder has access to \"free air\" outside the bag. It is used to create an equal pressure under the form, preventing it from being crushed.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Vacuum_Systems_pg_4_-_Vacuum_bags.html|title=  Vacuum Bags For Woodworking|url-status=  live|archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20100928231703/http://prowoodworkingtips.com/Vacuum_Systems_pg_4_-_Vacuum_bags.html|archivedate=  2010-09-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Pressure bag moulding ===\nThis process is related to vacuum bag molding in exactly the same way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a flexible male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite [[helmets]] due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.\n\n=== Autoclave moulding ===\nA process using a two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. On the lower side is a rigid mould and on the upper side is a flexible membrane made from silicone or an extruded polymer film such as nylon. Reinforcement materials can be placed manually or robotically. They include continuous fibre forms fashioned into textile constructions. Most often, they are pre-impregnated with the resin in the form of [[Pre-preg|prepreg]] fabrics or unidirectional tapes. In some instances, a resin film is placed upon the lower mould and dry reinforcement is placed above. The upper mould is installed and vacuum is applied to the mould cavity. The assembly is placed into an [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]]. This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.\n\n=== Resin transfer moulding (RTM) ===\nRTM is a process using a rigid two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. The mould is typically constructed from aluminum or steel, but composite molds are sometimes used.  The two sides fit together to produce a mould cavity. The distinguishing feature of resin transfer moulding is that the reinforcement materials are placed into this cavity and the mould set is closed prior to the introduction of matrix material. Resin transfer moulding includes numerous varieties which differ in the mechanics of how the resin is introduced to the reinforcement in the mould cavity. These variations include everything from the RTM methods used in [[out of autoclave composite manufacturing]] for high-tech aerospace components to vacuum infusion (for resin infusion see also [[boat building]]) to vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding (VARTM). This process can be performed at either [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] or elevated temperature and is suitable for manufacturing high performance composite components in medium volumes (1,000s to 10,000s of parts).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/resin-transfer-moulding-rtm/|accessdate=2018-10-01|title=What is Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)?|publisher=Coventive Composites|date=2018-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Light Resin Transfer Molding (LRTM) ===\nSimilar to the methods performed in Resin Transfer Molding, Light Resin Transfer Molding (Light RTM) involves a closed mold process. A vacuum holds mold A and mold B together to result in two finished sides with fixed thickness levels. Vacuum rings around the tools hold the molds together for this process after dry fiber reinforcements are loaded into mold A before joining with mold B. The air is vacuumed out of the molds with a lower vacuum level, separate from the tooling. After the air is removed the resin is injected into the part. The vacuum remains in effect into the resin is cured.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.coppsindustries.com/epoxy-products/composite-materials|title=Composite Epoxy Resin Manufacturing - Copps Industries|work=Copps Industries|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Other fabrication methods ===\nOther types of fabrication include press moulding, [[transfer moulding]], [[pultrusion]] moulding, [[filament winding]], [[casting]], centrifugal casting, [[Braiding machine|braiding]] (onto a [[former]]), [[continuous casting]] and [[slip forming]]. There are also forming capabilities including [[Numerical control|CNC]] filament winding, vacuum infusion, wet lay-up, [[compression moulding]], and [[thermoplastic]] moulding, to name a few. The use of curing ovens and paint booths is also needed for some projects.\n\n==== Finishing methods ====\nThe finishing of the composite parts is also critical in the final design.  Many of these finishes will include rain-erosion coatings or polyurethane coatings.\n\n=== Tooling ===\nThe mould and mould inserts are referred to as \"tooling.\" The mould/tooling can be constructed from a variety of materials. Tooling materials include [[invar]], steel, [[aluminium]], reinforced [[silicone rubber]], [[nickel]], and [[carbon fibre]]. Selection of the tooling material is typically based on, but not limited to, the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]], expected number of cycles, end item tolerance, desired or required surface condition, method of cure, [[glass transition temperature]] of the material being moulded, moulding method, matrix, cost and a variety of other considerations.\n\n== Physical properties ==\n[[File:Composite elastic modulus.svg|thumb|Plot of the overall strength of a composite material as a function of fiber volume fraction limited by the upper bound (isostrain) and lower bound (isostress) conditions.]]\nThe physical properties of composite materials are generally not [[isotropic]] (independent of direction of applied force) in nature, but they are typically [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] (different depending on the direction of the applied force or load). For instance, the stiffness of a composite panel will often depend upon the orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The strength of a composite is bounded by two loading conditions as shown in the plot to the right. If both the fibres and matrix are aligned parallel to the loading direction, the deformation of both phases will be the same (assuming there is no delamination at the fibre-matrix interface). This isostrain condition provides the upper bound for composite strength, and is determined by the rule of mixtures:\n[[File:Isostress and isostrain conditions for composite materials.gif|thumb|Figure a) shows the isostress condition where the composite materials are perpendicular to the applied force and b) is the isostrain condition that has the layers parallel to the force.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Hyoung Seop |title=On the rule of mixtures for the hardness of particle reinforced composites |journal=Materials Science and Engineering: A |date=September 2000 |volume=289 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=30\u201333 |doi=10.1016/S0921-5093(00)00909-6 }}</ref>]]\n<math>E_C = \\sum_{i=1} V_iE_i</math>\n\nwhere ''E<sub>C</sub>'' is the effective composite [[Young's modulus]], and ''V<sub>i</sub>'' and ''E<sub>i</sub>'' are the volume fraction and Young's moduli, respectively, of the composite phases.\n\nFor example, a composite material made up of \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases as shown in the figure to the right under isostrain, the Young's modulus would be as follows:<math display=\"block\">E_C=V_\\alpha E_\\alpha+V_\\beta E_\\beta</math>where V<sub>\u03b1</sub> and V<sub>\u03b2</sub> are the respective volume fractions of each phase.\nThis can be derived by considering that in the isostrain case, <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_C = \\epsilon_\\alpha = \\epsilon_\\beta = \\epsilon </math>\nAssuming that the composite has a uniform cross section, the stress on the composite is a weighted average between the two phases, <math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_C = \\sigma_\\alpha V_\\alpha + \\sigma_\\beta V_\\beta </math>\nThe stresses in the individual phases are given by Hooke's Law, <math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_\\beta = E_\\beta \\epsilon </math>  <math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_\\alpha = E_\\alpha \\epsilon </math> Combining these equations gives that the overall stress in the composite is  <math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_C = E_\\alpha V_\\alpha \\epsilon + E_\\beta V_\\beta \\epsilon = (E_\\alpha V_\\alpha  + E_\\beta V_\\beta) \\epsilon </math>\n\nNow we can show <math display=\"block\"> E_C = (E_\\alpha V_\\alpha  + E_\\beta V_\\beta) </math>\n\nThe lower bound is dictated by the isostress condition, in which the fibres and matrix are oriented perpendicularly to the loading direction:\n\n<math display=\"block\"> \\sigma_C = \\sigma_\\alpha = \\sigma_\\beta = \\sigma </math> and now the strains become a weighted average <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_C = \\epsilon_\\alpha V_\\alpha + \\epsilon_\\beta V_\\beta </math>\n\nRewriting Hooke's Law for the individual phases <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_\\beta =  \\frac{\\sigma}{E_\\beta} </math>  <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_\\alpha =  \\frac{\\sigma}{E_\\alpha} </math>\nThis leads to  <math display=\"block\"> \\epsilon_c = V_\\beta  \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_\\beta} + V_\\alpha  \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_\\alpha} = (\\frac{V_\\alpha}{\\epsilon_\\alpha}  + \\frac{V_\\beta}{\\epsilon_\\beta}) \\sigma </math> From the definition of Hooke's Law\n\n<math display=\"block\"> \\frac{1}{E_C} = \\frac{V_\\alpha}{E_\\alpha} + \\frac{V_\\beta}{E_\\beta}  </math> and in general\n\n<math>\\frac{1}{E_C} = \\sum_{i=1}\\frac{V_i}{E_i} </math>\n\nFollowing the example above, if one had a composite material made up of \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases under isostress conditions as shown in the figure to the right, the composition Young's modulus would be:<math display=\"block\">E_C=(E_\\alpha E_\\beta)/(V_\\alpha E_\\beta+V_\\beta E_\\alpha)</math>The isostrain condition implies that under an applied load, both phases experience the same strain but will feel different stress. Comparatively, under isostress conditions both phases will feel the same stress but the strains will differ between each phase.\nThough composite stiffness is maximized when fibres are aligned with the loading direction, so is the possibility of fibre tensile fracture, assuming the tensile strength exceeds that of the matrix. When a fibre has some angle of misorientation \u03b8, several fracture modes are possible. For small values of \u03b8 the stress required to initiate fracture is increased by a factor of (cos \u03b8)<sup>\u22122</sup> due to the increased cross-sectional area (''A'' cos \u03b8) of the fibre and reduced force (''F/''cos \u03b8) experienced by the fibre, leading to a composite tensile strength of ''\u03c3<sub>parallel </sub>/''cos<sup>2</sup> \u03b8 where ''\u03c3<sub>parallel </sub>'' is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres aligned parallel with the applied force.\n\nIntermediate angles of misorientation \u03b8 lead to matrix shear failure. Again the cross sectional area is modified but since shear stress is now the driving force for failure the area of the matrix parallel to the fibres is of interest, increasing by a factor of 1/sin \u03b8. Similarly, the force parallel to this area again decreases (''F/''cos \u03b8) leading to a total tensile strength of ''\u03c4<sub>my</sub> /''sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 where ''\u03c4<sub>my</sub>'' is the matrix shear strength.\n\nFinally, for large values of \u03b8 (near \u03c0/2) transverse matrix failure is the most likely to occur, since the fibres no longer carry the majority of the load. Still, the tensile strength will be greater than for the purely perpendicular orientation, since the force perpendicular to the fibres will decrease by a factor of 1/sin \u03b8 and the area decreases by a factor of 1/sin \u03b8 producing a composite tensile strength of ''\u03c3<sub>perp</sub> /''sin<sup>2</sup>\u03b8 where ''\u03c3<sub>perp </sub>'' is the tensile strength of the composite with fibres align perpendicular to the applied force.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Courtney |first=Thomas H. |date=2000 |title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials |edition= 2nd |publisher=Waveland Press, Inc. |location=Long Grove, IL |pages=263\u2013265 |isbn=978-1-57766-425-3 }}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:Composite Strength as a Function of Fiber Misalignment.png|thumb|The graph depicts the three fracture modes a composite material may experience depending on the angle of misorientation relative to aligning fibres parallel to the applied stress.]]\n\nThe majority of commercial composites are formed with random dispersion and orientation of the strengthening fibres, in which case the composite Young's modulus will fall between the isostrain and isostress bounds. However, in applications where the strength-to-weight ratio is engineered to be as high as possible (such as in the aerospace industry), fibre alignment may be tightly controlled.\n\nPanel stiffness is also dependent on the design of the panel. For instance, the fibre reinforcement and matrix used, the method of panel build, thermoset versus thermoplastic, and type of weave.\n\nIn contrast to composites, isotropic materials (for example, aluminium or steel), in standard wrought forms, typically have the same stiffness regardless of the directional orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures for an isotropic material can be described with the following material properties: Young's Modulus, the [[shear Modulus]] and the [[Poisson's ratio]], in relatively simple mathematical relationships. For the anisotropic material, it requires the mathematics of a second order tensor and up to 21 material property constants. For the special case of orthogonal isotropy, there are three different material property constants for each of Young's Modulus, Shear Modulus and Poisson's ratio\u2014a total of 9 constants to describe the relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures.\n\nTechniques that take advantage of the anisotropic properties of the materials include [[mortise and tenon]] joints (in natural composites such as wood) and [[Pi Joints]] in synthetic composites.\n\n=== Failure ===\nShock, impact, or repeated cyclic stresses can cause the laminate to separate at the interface between two layers, a condition known as [[delamination]]. Individual fibres can separate from the matrix e.g. [[fiber pull-out|fibre pull-out]].\n\nComposites can fail on the [[microscopic]] or [[macroscopic]] scale. Compression failures can occur at both the macro scale or at each individual reinforcing fibre in compression buckling. Tension failures can be net section failures of the part or degradation of the composite at a microscopic scale where one or more of the layers in the composite fail in tension of the matrix or failure of the bond between the matrix and fibres.\n\nSome composites are brittle and have little reserve strength beyond the initial onset of failure while others may have large deformations and have reserve energy absorbing capacity past the onset of damage. The variations in fibres and matrices that are available and the [[mixture]]s that can be made with blends leave a very broad range of properties that can be designed into a composite structure.\nThe best known failure of a brittle ceramic matrix composite occurred when the carbon-carbon composite tile on the leading edge of the wing of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] fractured when impacted during take-off. It led to catastrophic break-up of the vehicle when it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003.\n\nCompared to metals, composites have relatively poor bearing strength.\n\n=== Testing ===\nTo aid in predicting and preventing failures, composites are tested before and after construction. Pre-construction testing may use [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) for ply-by-ply analysis of curved surfaces and predicting wrinkling, crimping and dimpling of composites.<ref name=\"Waterman\">{{Cite journal\n |author      = Waterman, Pamela J.\n |title       = The Life of Composite Materials\n |journal     = Desktop Engineering Magazine\n |volume      = April 2007\n |url         = http://66.195.41.10/Articles/Feature/The-Life-of-Composite-Materials-200704101800.html\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20071202141018/http://66.195.41.10/Articles/Feature/The-Life-of-Composite-Materials-200704101800.html\n |archivedate = 2007-12-02\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aghdam |first1=M.M. |last2=Morsali |first2=S.R. |title=Damage initiation and collapse behavior of unidirectional metal matrix composites at elevated temperatures |journal=Computational Materials Science |date=November 2013 |volume=79 |pages=402\u2013407 |doi=10.1016/j.commatsci.2013.06.024 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Primary and Secondary Manufacturing of Polymer Matrix Composites.|last=Kishore.|first=Debnath|others=Singh, Inderdeep.|isbn=9781498799300|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=1004424029|date = 2017-09-18}}</ref><ref>[https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/what-is-finite-element-analysis/ What is Finite Element Analysis?]</ref> Materials may be tested during manufacturing and after construction through several [[Nondestructive testing|nondestructive]] methods including ultrasonics, thermography, shearography and X-ray radiography,<ref>{{Cite journal\n |author      = Matzkanin, George A.\n |author2     = Yolken, H.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nChristian thought of this age was heavily influenced by Pope Gregory the Great, monasticism and St.Benedict. Constantine and his Bishop Alduin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking 30 years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nChristian thought of this age was heavily influenced by Pope Gregory the Great, monasticism and St.Benedict. Constantine and his Bishop Alduin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking 30 years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
