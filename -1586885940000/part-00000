Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods; however, they will steal from their mate's cache if given the opportunity.<ref name=Powlesland/> Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males.<ref name=SteerBurns>{{cite journal|last1=Steer|first1=Jamie|last2=Burns|first2=KC|year=2008|title=Seasonal variation in male-female competition, cooperation and selfish hoarding in a monogamous songbird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1175\u20131183|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0546-z}}</ref> During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.<ref name=PowleslandA/>\n\nSouth Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age. They begin their breeding season fairly early in August or September (Southern Hemisphere spring) and thus can make use of the winter's remaining food stores during this time.<ref name=Powlesland/> They build open-cup nests in tree-forks or inside tree cavities. Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again. Modal clutch size is two eggs,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S. S.|last2=Jamieson|first2=I. G.|last3=Wallis|first3=G.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

Z. Carr''' is a contemporary Canadian poet who resides in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]]. A full member of the League of Canadian Poets and the Federation of BC Writers, Fern G. Z. Carr is the author of ''Shards of Crystal'' (Silver Bow Publishing, 2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1927616964/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542292047&sr=8-1&keywords=Shards+of+Crystal+Fern+G.+Z.+Carr|title=Shards of Crystal: Amazon.ca: Fern G.

Retrieved on May 22, 2019.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and education==\nFern G. Z. Carr was born in 1956 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. Carr attended the [[University of Manitoba]] where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) and her Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB). She received her Call to the Bar from the [[Law Society of Manitoba]]. After briefly practising law, Carr decided to pursue her interest in languages. She enrolled at le Coll\u00e8ge Universitaire de Saint-Boniface where she received her Certificat en \u00c9ducation and was the recipient of the Manitoba Government Book Prize for highest standing in her program.<ref>{{cite book |title=The University of Manitoba 104th Annual Convocation |date=1983}}</ref> She subsequently taught French Immersion before moving to [[Kelowna]] with her family in 1999. She is married and is the sister-in-law of [[James Gordon Carr]], Member of Parliament.\n\n==Writing style and influences==\nCarr's early poetry from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s is more representative of traditional meter and rhyme. She subsequently began to experiment with different forms and styles while continuing to compose traditional poetry in set forms such as [[pantoum]] and [[ghazal]]. An admirer of [[Emily Dickinson]], Carr liked the use of [[em dashes]] and often incorporated them into her poems. In the 2000s, Carr's poetry style became more eclectic as she experimented with design. This was particularly evident in her [[Visual poetry|visual]] and [[concrete poetry]] as well as in her experimental math / science poems such as \"The Fickle Nature of the Parabola\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=The Fickle Nature of the Parabola |journal=Windsor Review |date=Fall 2018 |volume=43 |issue=2 |page=128}}</ref> and \"Holocaust Genealogy\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=Holocaust Genealogy |journal=mgversion2 |date=July 2016 |volume=85 |page=84}}</ref> To date, her stylistic focus is [[free verse]].\n\nWhile Carr's poetry primarily is written in English, she also composes poems in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Yiddish]] and the [[Chinese Mandarin]] dialect. Even though she occasionally translates the works of other poets, she tends to focus on bilingual and trilingual side-by-side translations of her own poetry.\n\nMany of Carr's poems were influenced by her early years in Winnipeg's West End where she bore witness to poverty and crime. While this darkness is evident in some of her poetry, she also composes poems which evoke a diverse array of human emotions.\n\n==''Shards of Crystal''==\n''Shards of Crystal'' reflects a dichotomy and as such, is described as a metamorphosis of darkness to light. Dealing with issues such as suicide, trauma, dementia, cruelty to animals, and the death of a child, the book then gradually changes course. It begins its transformative move towards the beauty of life with poems about musicality, spiritual liberation and the philosophy of existence. It culminates in a philosophical examination of mankind's place in the universe with Carr's signature poem, \"I Am\".<ref name=\"parl.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://bdp.parl.ca/About/Parliament/Poet/poem-selected-former-poet-laureate2-e.html?id=1&id4=254|title=The Parliamentary Poet Laureate|website=Bdp.parl.ca|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe imagery in ''Shards of Crystal'' parallels the darkness-to-light chronology of Carr's poems. This transition is essentially a redemptive move both literally and metaphorically, reconciling the pain of \"Shards\" at the outset of the book with the beauty and enlightenment of \"Crystal\" at the conclusion. Beginning with the darkness of night and becoming progressively lighter, her poems ultimately achieve the illumination of the eternal. This is in keeping with the overarching theme of hope as expressed by the Victor Hugo quote at the start of the book: \"Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hugo |first1=Victor |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables |date=1987 |publisher=Signet Classics |isbn=9780451525260 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lesmisrablessign00vict }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nCarr has been published extensively worldwide in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Finland, France, Holland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte Island, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (in England, Scotland and Wales) and USA.\n\nAdditionally, she has written literary non-fiction articles which have been published in [[The Federation of B.C.

Z. Carr''' is a contemporary Canadian poet who resides in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]]. A full member of the League of Canadian Poets and the Federation of BC Writers, Fern G. Z. Carr is the author of ''Shards of Crystal'' (Silver Bow Publishing, 2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1927616964/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542292047&sr=8-1&keywords=Shards+of+Crystal+Fern+G.+Z.+Carr|title=Shards of Crystal: Amazon.ca: Fern G.

Retrieved on May 22, 2019.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and education==\nFern G. Z. Carr was born in 1956 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. Carr attended the [[University of Manitoba]] where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) and her Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB). She received her Call to the Bar from the [[Law Society of Manitoba]]. After briefly practising law, Carr decided to pursue her interest in languages. She enrolled at le Coll\u00e8ge Universitaire de Saint-Boniface where she received her Certificat en \u00c9ducation and was the recipient of the Manitoba Government Book Prize for highest standing in her program.<ref>{{cite book |title=The University of Manitoba 104th Annual Convocation |date=1983}}</ref> She subsequently taught French Immersion before moving to [[Kelowna]] with her family in 1999. She is married and is the sister-in-law of [[James Gordon Carr]], Member of Parliament.\n\n==Writing style and influences==\nCarr's early poetry from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s is more representative of traditional meter and rhyme. She subsequently began to experiment with different forms and styles while continuing to compose traditional poetry in set forms such as [[pantoum]] and [[ghazal]]. An admirer of [[Emily Dickinson]], Carr liked the use of [[em dashes]] and often incorporated them into her poems. In the 2000s, Carr's poetry style became more eclectic as she experimented with design. This was particularly evident in her [[Visual poetry|visual]] and [[concrete poetry]] as well as in her experimental math / science poems such as \"The Fickle Nature of the Parabola\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=The Fickle Nature of the Parabola |journal=Windsor Review |date=Fall 2018 |volume=43 |issue=2 |page=128}}</ref> and \"Holocaust Genealogy\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=Holocaust Genealogy |journal=mgversion2 |date=July 2016 |volume=85 |page=84}}</ref> To date, her stylistic focus is [[free verse]].\n\nWhile Carr's poetry primarily is written in English, she also composes poems in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Yiddish]] and the [[Chinese Mandarin]] dialect. Even though she occasionally translates the works of other poets, she tends to focus on bilingual and trilingual side-by-side translations of her own poetry.\n\nMany of Carr's poems were influenced by her early years in Winnipeg's West End where she bore witness to poverty and crime. While this darkness is evident in some of her poetry, she also composes poems which evoke a diverse array of human emotions.\n\n==''Shards of Crystal''==\n''Shards of Crystal'' reflects a dichotomy and as such, is described as a metamorphosis of darkness to light. Dealing with issues such as suicide, trauma, dementia, cruelty to animals, and the death of a child, the book then gradually changes course. It begins its transformative move towards the beauty of life with poems about musicality, spiritual liberation and the philosophy of existence. It culminates in a philosophical examination of mankind's place in the universe with Carr's signature poem, \"I Am\".<ref name=\"parl.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://bdp.parl.ca/About/Parliament/Poet/poem-selected-former-poet-laureate2-e.html?id=1&id4=254|title=The Parliamentary Poet Laureate|website=Bdp.parl.ca|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe imagery in ''Shards of Crystal'' parallels the darkness-to-light chronology of Carr's poems. This transition is essentially a redemptive move both literally and metaphorically, reconciling the pain of \"Shards\" at the outset of the book with the beauty and enlightenment of \"Crystal\" at the conclusion. Beginning with the darkness of night and becoming progressively lighter, her poems ultimately achieve the illumination of the eternal. This is in keeping with the overarching theme of hope as expressed by the Victor Hugo quote at the start of the book: \"Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hugo |first1=Victor |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables |date=1987 |publisher=Signet Classics |isbn=9780451525260 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lesmisrablessign00vict }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nCarr has been published extensively worldwide in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Finland, France, Holland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte Island, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (in England, Scotland and Wales) and USA.\n\nAdditionally, she has written literary non-fiction articles which have been published in The Federation of B.C.

From that year until 1502, the number of men charged with sodomy numbered more than 17,000, of whom 3,000 were convicted. This number also included heterosexual sodomy. This also gave rise to a number of proverbs illuminating the views of the common people towards the practice; among them: \"If you crave joys, tumble some boys.\"<ref>Florentine proverb, ca. 1480.

For example, the French would call \"homosexuality\" the \"Italian vice\" in the 16th and 17th centuries, the \"English vice\" in the 18th century, the ''m\u0153urs orientales'' (oriental mores) in the 19th century, and the \"German vice\" starting from 1870 and into the 20th century.<ref>Revenin, ''Homosexualit\u00e9 et prostitution masculines \u00e0 Paris : 1870-1918'', 102-103.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThe Church could not repress all expressions of homoerotic desire. One of the most famous examples is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] philosophic defense of the practice provided by [[Antonio Rocco]], in his infamous ''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola'' (''[[Alcibiades the Schoolboy]]'', in English) a dialogue in which a teacher seeks to use philosophy to convince a male student to have sex with him. However, given the tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing, it seems unclear whether it is meant to be satire or genuine under the pretense of a joke.\n\n==Modern Europe==\n[[Image:Vitahomosexualis.JPG|right|thumb|''Vita homosexualis'', a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann's popular pamphlets on the [[third sex]] and against [[\u00a7175]] - a copy from the library of the [[Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee]], confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: ''\"Destined [[Nazi book burnings|for destruction]] in accordance with the [[Reichspr\u00e4sident|Reichspresident]]'s [[Reichstag Fire Decree|decree of 28 February 1933]]!\"'' and hidden from the public (label \"Secr.\") as [[Nazi plunder]] at the [[Prussian State Library]].]]\n\n===Psychology and terminology shifts===\nThe developing field of psychology was the first way homosexuality could be directly addressed aside from Biblical condemnation. In Europe, homosexuality had been part of case studies since the 1790s with Johann Valentin M\u00fcller's work.<ref>Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152. 2003.</ref> The studies of this era tended to be rigorous examination of \"criminals,\" looking to confirm guilt and establish patterns for future prosecutions. Ambroise Tardieu in France believed he could identify \"pederasts\" affirming that the sex organs are altered by homosexuality in his 1857 publishing.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152.</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Charles's expos\u00e9, ''Les Deux Prostitutions: \u00e9tudes du pathologie sociale'', (\"The Two Prostitutions: Study of the Social Pathology\") developed methods for police to persecute through meticulous documentation of homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Others include Johann Caspar and Otto Westphal, Karl Ulrichs. [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 publication, ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', was the most widely translated work of this kind.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>  He and Ulrichs believed that homosexuality was congenitally based, but Krafft-Ebing differed; in that, he asserted that homosexuality was a symptom of other psychopathic behavior that he viewed to be an inherited disposition to degeneracy.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nDegeneracy became a widely acknowledged theory for homosexuality during the 1870s and 80s.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> It spoke to the eugenic and social Darwin theories of the late 19th century. [[Benedict Augustin Morel]] is considered the father of degeneracy theory.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> His theories posit that physical, intellectual, and moral abnormalities come from disease, urban over-population, malnutrition, alcohol, and other failures of his contemporary society.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn important shift in the terminology of homosexuality was brought about by the development of psychology's inquisition into homosexuality.  \"Contrary sexual feeling,\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> as Westphal's phrased, and the word \"homosexual\" itself made their way into the Western lexicons. Homosexuality had a name aside from the ambiguous term \"sodomy\" and the elusive \"abomination.\"  As Michel Foucault phrases, \"the sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn addendum to the terminology of homosexuality is the seemingly ever-changing acronym, with its roots in the 1980s when female homosexuals began to identify themselves as lesbians instead of gay. This led to references of \"gay and lesbian\" every time homosexuals were discussed in the media. Non-heterosexuals such as bisexual people and those who are transgender have also been classed alongside gay people and lesbians, resulting in the popular LGBT acronym (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender). However, the acronym is not set in stone; it has sometimes appeared as LGBTQ (to include [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning or queer people]]).\n\n===Homosexuality in eighteenth-century Great Britain===\n{{main|Timeline of LGBT history in Britain}}\n\nVarious authors wrote on the topic of homosexuality.

A ''Molly house'' is an archaic 18th century English term for a tavern or private room where homosexual and [[cross-dressing]] men could meet each other and possible sexual partners. Patrons of the Molly house would sometimes enact mock weddings, sometimes with the bride giving birth. [[Margaret Clap]] (?\u2014circa 1726), better known as ''Mother Clap'', ran such a Molly house from 1724 to 1726 in [[Holborn]], London. She was also heavily involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premise was raided and shut down. Molly houses were perhaps the first precursors to the modern [[gay bar]].\n\n===Decriminalization of homosexuality in France===\n{{See also|LGBT history in France|LGBT rights in France|LGBT culture in Paris}}\n\nWritten on July 21, 1776, the Letter LXIII became infamous for its frank talk of human sexuality.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] decried cultural degeneration, [[prostitution]] and [[syphilis]] in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', blaming at least some of the phenomena on Jews.\n\n[[Berlin]] also had the most active [[LGBT movements|LGBT rights movements]] in the world at the time. Jewish doctor [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] had co-founded the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] (Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee, WhK) in Berlin in 1897 to campaign against the notorious \"[[Paragraph 175]]\" of the Penal Code that made [[Men who have sex with men|sex between men]] illegal. It also sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was the first public gay rights organization. The Committee had branches in several other countries, thereby being the first international LGBT organization, although on a small scale. In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sex Research), a private [[sexology]] [[research institute]]. It had a [[research library]] and a large archive, and included a marriage and sex counseling office. In addition, the institute was a pioneer worldwide in the call for [[civil rights]] and social acceptance for homosexual and transgender people.\nAs a  leading city for homosexuals during the 1920, Berlin had  clubs and even newspapers for both lesbians and gay men. The lesbian magazine [[Die Freundin]] was started by [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] and the gay men's magazine ''[[Der Eigene]]'' had already started in 1896 as the world's first gay magazine.

Conditions for gay men in the camps were especially rough; they faced not only persecution from German soldiers, but also other prisoners, and many gay men were reported to die of beatings. Female homosexuality was not, technically, a crime and thus gay women were generally not treated as harshly as gay men. Although there are some scattered reports that gay women were sometimes imprisoned for their sexuality, most would have been imprisoned for other reasons, i.e. \"anti-social\".\n\n===Alan Turing===\nIn Britain, the view of homosexuality as the mark of a deviant mind was not limited to the psychiatric wards of hospitals but also the courts. An extremely famous case was that of [[Alan Turing]], a British mathematician and theoretician.

For the success of this, he received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18541715|title=I remember Alan Turing...|date=June 23, 2012|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In spite of all his brilliance and the services rendered to his country, Turing was also openly homosexual and in the early 1950s this fact came to the attention of the British government when he was arrested under section 11 of an [[Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885|1885 statute]] of \"gross indecency\".<ref>Leavitt, David (2007).

Thomas Jefferson suggested castration as the punishment for sodomy, rape, and polygamy in a proposed revision of the Virginia criminal code near the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nPennsylvania was the first state to repeal the death penalty for \"sodomy\" in 1786 and within a generation all the other colonies followed suit (except North and South Carolina that repealed after the Civil War).<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Along with the removal of the death penalty during this generation, legal language shifted away from that of damnation to more dispassionate terms like \"unmentionable\" or \"abominable\" acts.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Aside from sodomy and \"attempted sodomy\" court cases and a few public scandals, homosexuality was seen as peripheral in mainstream society. Lesbianism had no legal definition largely given Victorian notions of female sexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nA survey of sodomy law enforcement during the nineteenth century suggests that a significant minority of cases did not specify the gender of the \"victim\" or accused. Most cases were argued as non-consensual or rape.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\">Mucciaroni, Gary. Same Sex, Different Politics. Chicago UP. Pg. 117\u2013128. 2008</ref> The first prosecution for consensual sex between people of the same gender was not until 1880.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In response to increasing visibility of alternative genders, gender bending, and homosexuality, a host of laws against vagrancy, public indecency, disorderly conduct, and indecent exposure was introduced across the United States. \"Sodomy\" laws also shifted in many states over the beginning of the twentieth century to address homosexuality specifically (many states during the twentieth century made heterosexual anal intercourse legal).<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In some states, these laws would last until they were repealed by the Supreme Court in 2003 with the Lawrence decision.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/>\n\n===Male ideal and the 19th century===\nHomosexual identity found its first social foothold in the 19th Century not in sexuality or homoerotica, but in idealized conception of the wholesome and loving male friendship during the 19th Century. Or as contemporary author [[Theodore Winthrop]] in Cecil Dreeme writes, \"a friendship I deemed more precious than the love of women.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> This ideal came from and was enforced by the male-centric institutions of boy's boarding schools, all-male colleges, the military, the frontier, etc. \u2013 fictional and non-fiction accounts of passionate male friendships became a theme present in American Literature and social conceptions of masculinity.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nNew York, as America's largest city exponentially growing during the 19th Century (doubling from 1800\u201320 and again by 1840 to a population of 300,000), saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Continuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He was immediately drawn to young working-class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting their ages, physical characteristics, jobs, and origins.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''\u2014\"frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love\" or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:\n\n\"Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nSometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments\u2014\"I share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman's treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more homosexuals to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians debate whether he was a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th Century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nTwenty years after Whitman came to New York, [[Horatio Alger]] continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian [[self-made man]].<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[We'wha]] (1849\u20131896) was a notable [[Zuni]] weaver, potter and ''[[lhamana]]''. Raised as a boy, they would later spend part of their life dressing and living in the roles usually filled by women in Zuni culture, later living and working in roles filled by men, changing depending on the situation. Anthropologist [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], a friend of We'wha's who wrote extensively about the Zuni, hosted We'wha and the Zuni delegation when We'wha was chosen as an official emissary to Washington D.C. in 1886. During this time [[Singular they|they]] met President [[Grover Cleveland]]. We'wha had at least one husband, was trained in the customs and rites for the ceremonies for both men and women, and was a respected member of their community. Friends who documented their life used both pronouns for We'wha.<ref name=Bost139>Suzanne Bost, ''Mulattas and Mestizas: Representing Mixed Identities in the Americas'', 1850-2000, (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2003), pg.139</ref><ref name=Stevenson37>Matilda Coxe Stevenson, ''The Zuni Indians: Their Mythology, Esoteric Fraternities, and Ceremonies'', (BiblioBazaar, 2010) p.&nbsp;37 Quote:\"the most intelligent person in the pueblo. Strong character made his word law among both men and women with whom he associated. Though his wrath was dreaded by men as well as women, he was loved by all children, to whom he was ever kind\"</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn 1908, the first American defense of homosexuality was published.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> ''The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life'', was written by Edward Stevenson under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> This 600-page defense detailed Classical examples, but also modern literature and the homosexual subcultures of urban life.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> He dedicated the novel to Krafft-Ebing because he argued homosexuality was inherited and, in Stevenson's view and not necessarily Krafft-Ebing's, should not face prejudice. He also wrote one of the first homosexual novels\u2014''Imre: A Memorandum''.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Also in this era, the earliest known open homosexual in the United States, Claude Hartland, wrote an account of his sexual history.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 90\u201391.</ref> He affirmed that he wrote it to affront the naivety surrounding sexuality. It was in response to the ignorance he saw while being treated by doctors and psychologists that failed to \"cure\" him.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/> Hartland wished his attraction to men could be solely \"spiritual,\" but could not escape the \"animal.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/>\n\nBy this time, society was slowly becoming aware of the homosexual subculture. In an 1898 lecture in Massachusetts, a doctor gave a lecture on this development in modern cities.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> With a population around three million at the turn of the 20th century, New York's queer subculture had a strong sense of self-definition and began redefining itself on its own terms. \"Middle class queer,\" \"fairies,\" were among the terminology of the underground world of the Lower East Side.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> But with this growing public presence, backlash occurred. The YMCA, who ironically promoted a similar image to that of the Whitman's praise of male brotherhood and athletic prowess, took a chief place in the purity campaigns of the epoch. Anthony Comstock, a salesman and leader of YMCA in Connecticut and later head of his own New York Society for the Suppression of Vice successfully pressed Congress and many state legislatures to pass strict censorship laws.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Ironically, the YMCA became a site of homosexual conduct. In 1912, a scandal hit Oregon where more than 50 men, many prominent in the community were arrested for homosexual activity. In reaction to this scandal conflicting with public campaigns, YMCA leadership began to look the other way on this conduct.\n\n===1920s===\n[[File:WeMustGrowAMustache.jpg|thumb|Sheet music poking fun at the masculine traits many women adopted during the 1920s.]]\n\nThe 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. This was reflected in many of the films (see [[Pre-Code]]) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality. Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. One of these songs had the title \"Masculine Women, Feminine Men.\"<ref>The song was written by [[Edgar Leslie]] (words) and [[James Vincent Monaco|James V. Monaco]] (music) and featured in [[Hugh J. Ward]]'s production of the musical ''[[Lady, Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''.</ref> It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics:<ref>Artists who recorded this song include: 1.

Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as \"pansy clubs\". The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor [[William Haines]], regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover, [[Jimmie Shields]].<ref>Mann, William J., ''Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star.

'' New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 12\u201313, 80\u201383.</ref> In 1927, [[Mae West]] wrote a play about homosexuality called ''[[The Drag (play)|The Drag]]'', and alluded to the work of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic [[human rights]] issue, and was also an early advocate of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]]. With the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality.\n\n===Late 1930s===\nBy 1935, the United States had become conservative once again. [[Victorian morality|Victorian values]] and morals, which had been widely ridiculed during the 1920s became fashionable once again. During this period, life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many laws were passed against homosexuals during this period and it was declared to be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest homosexuals by using young undercover cops to get them to make propositions to them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.

The war effort greatly shifted American culture and by extension representations in entertainment of both the [[nuclear family]] and LGBT people. In mostly same sex quarters service members were more easily able to express their interests and find willing partners of all sexualities.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1947, WWII [[conscientious objectors]] in the US assigned to psychiatric hospitals under [[Civilian Public Service]] exposed abuses throughout the psychiatric care system and were instrumental in [[reform]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n===Stonewall riots===\n{{Main|Stonewall riots}}\n\nAlthough the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are generally considered the starting point of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the LGBT community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power. ''See: [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots]]''\n\nIn the autumn of 1959, the police force of New York City's Wagner administration began closing down the city's gay bars, which had numbered almost two dozen in Manhattan at the beginning of the year. This crackdown was largely the result of a sustained campaign by the right-wing ''NY Mirror'' newspaper columnist [[Lee Mortimer]]. Existing gay bars were quickly closed and new ones lasted only a short time. The election of [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, [[Dick Leitsch]], [[Craig Rodwell]] president and vice president respectively of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and Mattachine activist John Timmons staged the Sip-In at [[Julius (restaurant)|Julius' Bar]] on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the NY State Liquor Authority being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens, transsexuals, and butch lesbians against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 at about 1:20&nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small. It was the commemorative march one year later, organized by the impetus of [[Craig Rodwell]], owner of the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]], which drew 5,000 marchers up New York City's [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], that drew nationwide publicity and put the Stonewall events on the historical map and led to the modern-day pride marches. A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. Late in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.\n\n===1980s===\n {{Disputed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe 1980s in LGBT history are marked with the emergence of [[HIV]]. During the early period of the outbreak of HIV, the [[HIV and men who have sex with men|epidemic of HIV was commonly linked to gay men.]]\n\nIn the 1980s a renewed conservative movement spawned a new anti-gay movement in the United States, particularly with the help of the Religious Right ([[Evangelicals]] in particular). While it is a common belief within some circles of the LGBT community that [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] were anti-gay, some others believe that this is an exaggeration. Ronald Reagan spoke up for gay equality as early as 1978, when he came out against [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a ballot initiative that would have dismissed California teachers who \"advocated\" homosexuality, even off-campus. As President, he allocated 5.727 Billion dollars from 1982 until 1989 for AIDS research. Socially, the Reagans were well known for being tolerant of homosexuals. Robert G. Kaiser's news story in the March 18, 1984, Washington Post.\n\"The Reagans are also tolerant about homosexual men,\" Kaiser wrote. \"Their interior decorator, Ted Graber, who oversaw the redecoration of the White House, spent a night in the Reagans' private White House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case, when they came to Washington for Nancy Reagan's 60th birthday party\u2014a fact confirmed for the press by Mrs. Reagan's press secretary.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Murdock |first=Deroy |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/304207/gay-left-lies-about-reagan-again-deroy-murdock?pg=2: |title=The Gay Left Lies about Reagan \u2014 Again |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> However, by the later part of the decade the general public started to show more sympathy and even tolerance for gays as the toll for AIDS related deaths continued to rise to include heterosexuals as well as cultural icons such as [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Liberace]], who also died from the condition. Also, despite the more conservative period, life in general for gays and lesbians was considerably better in contrast to the pre-Stonewall era.\n \nTestifying to improved conditions, a 1991 [[Wall Street Journal]] survey found that homosexuals, in comparison with average Americans, were three times more likely to be college graduates, three times more likely to hold professional or managerial positions, with average salaries $30,000 higher than the norm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nayo9QVuJs8C&pg=PA139 \"The Pleasure Principle: Sex, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom\"], Michael Bronski.

Legal recognition of a marital union opens up a wide range of entitlements, including [[social security]], taxation, inheritance and other benefits unavailable to couples not married, in the eyes of the law. Restricting legal recognition to opposite-sex couples prevents same-sex couples from gaining access to the legal benefits of marriage. Though certain rights can be replicated by legal means other than marriage (for example, by drawing-up contracts), many cannot, such as inheritance, hospital visitation and immigration. Lack of legal recognition also makes it more difficult for same-sex couples to adopt children.\n\nThe first country to legalize same-sex marriages was the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (2001), while the first marriages were performed in the Amsterdam city hall on April 1, 2001. {{as of|2019|June}}, same-sex marriages are legal nationally in twenty-six countries: the Netherlands (2001), [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (without [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Northern Ireland]]\u2014May 22, 2015), [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] (2014), [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]] (2015),  [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]] (2016), [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]], [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] (2018) and in [[Same-sex marriage in Austria|Austria]], [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Ecuador|Ecuador]] (2019).

In 1990, a student group named The Other Ten Percentile (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8) was founded by a group of teachers and students in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], becoming the first LGBT organization in [[Jerusalem]]. Frequently, such groups have been banned or prohibited from meeting or receiving the same recognition as other student groups. For example, in September 2006, [[Touro University California]] briefly attempted to ban the school's GSA, the [[Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance]]. After student demonstrations and an outcry of support from the [[American Medical Student Association]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] and the [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] [[City council|City Council]], Touro University retracted its revocation of the school's GSA. The university went on to reaffirm its commitment to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nIn April 2016, the GSA Network changed their name from Gay-Straight Alliance Network to Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network in order to be more inclusive and reflective of youth who make up the organization.\n\n==Historical study of homosexuality==\n\n===19th century and early 20th century===\nWhen [[Heinrich H\u00f6ssli]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|K. H. Ulrichs]] began their pioneering homosexual scholarship in the late 19th century, they found little in the way of comprehensive historical data, except for material from ancient Greece and Islam.<ref>''Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia: Volume 2 of Encyclopedia of lesbian and gay histories and cultures'', George E. Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman, {{ISBN|0-8153-3354-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3354-8}}, Taylor & Francis, 2000, page 388.</ref> Some other information was added by the English scholars Richard Burton and [[Havelock Ellis]]. In Germany, [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] published a volume containing lists of famous homosexuals. By the end of the century, however, when the Berlin Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was formed it was realised that a comprehensive bibliographical search must be undertaken. The results of this inquiry were incorporated into the volumes of the ''Jahrbuch fur sexualle Zwischenstufen'' and Magnus Hirschfeld's ''Die Homoexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes'' (1914). The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[Nazism]] put a stop to most serious homosexual research.\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\nAs part of the growth of the contemporary gay movement in Southern California, a number of historical articles made their way into such movement periodicals as ''The Ladder'', ''Mattachine Review'', and ''One Quarterly''. In France ''Aracadie'' under the editorship of Marc Daniel published a considerable amount of historical material. Almost without exception, university scholars were afraid to touch the subject. As a result, much of the work was done by autodidacts toiling under less than ideal conditions. Since most of this scholarship was done under movement auspices, it tended to reflect relevant concerns; compiling a brief of injustices and biographical sketches of exemplary gay men and women of the past for example.\n\nThe atmosphere of the 1960s changed things. The sexual revolution made human sexuality an appropriate object of research. A new emphasis on social and intellectual history appeared, stemming in large measure from the group around the French periodical ''Annales''. Although several useful syntheses of the world [[history of homosexuality]] have appeared, much material, especially from [[Islam]], China and other non-Western cultures has not yet been properly studied and published, so that undoubtedly these will be superseded.<ref>Ed.

From that year until 1502, the number of men charged with sodomy numbered more than 17,000, of whom 3,000 were convicted. This number also included heterosexual sodomy. This also gave rise to a number of proverbs illuminating the views of the common people towards the practice; among them: \"If you crave joys, tumble some boys.\"<ref>Florentine proverb, ca. 1480.

For example, the French would call \"homosexuality\" the \"Italian vice\" in the 16th and 17th centuries, the \"English vice\" in the 18th century, the ''m\u0153urs orientales'' (oriental mores) in the 19th century, and the \"German vice\" starting from 1870 and into the 20th century.<ref>Revenin, ''Homosexualit\u00e9 et prostitution masculines \u00e0 Paris : 1870-1918'', 102-103.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThe Church could not repress all expressions of homoerotic desire. One of the most famous examples is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] philosophic defense of the practice provided by [[Antonio Rocco]], in his infamous ''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola'' (''[[Alcibiades the Schoolboy]]'', in English) a dialogue in which a teacher seeks to use philosophy to convince a male student to have sex with him. However, given the tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing, it seems unclear whether it is meant to be satire or genuine under the pretense of a joke.\n\n==Modern Europe==\n[[Image:Vitahomosexualis.JPG|right|thumb|''Vita homosexualis'', a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann's popular pamphlets on the [[third sex]] and against [[\u00a7175]] - a copy from the library of the [[Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee]], confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: ''\"Destined [[Nazi book burnings|for destruction]] in accordance with the [[Reichspr\u00e4sident|Reichspresident]]'s [[Reichstag Fire Decree|decree of 28 February 1933]]!\"'' and hidden from the public (label \"Secr.\") as [[Nazi plunder]] at the [[Prussian State Library]].]]\n\n===Psychology and terminology shifts===\nThe developing field of psychology was the first way homosexuality could be directly addressed aside from Biblical condemnation. In Europe, homosexuality had been part of case studies since the 1790s with Johann Valentin M\u00fcller's work.<ref>Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152. 2003.</ref> The studies of this era tended to be rigorous examination of \"criminals,\" looking to confirm guilt and establish patterns for future prosecutions. Ambroise Tardieu in France believed he could identify \"pederasts\" affirming that the sex organs are altered by homosexuality in his 1857 publishing.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152.</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Charles's expos\u00e9, ''Les Deux Prostitutions: \u00e9tudes du pathologie sociale'', (\"The Two Prostitutions: Study of the Social Pathology\") developed methods for police to persecute through meticulous documentation of homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Others include Johann Caspar and Otto Westphal, Karl Ulrichs. [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 publication, ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', was the most widely translated work of this kind.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>  He and Ulrichs believed that homosexuality was congenitally based, but Krafft-Ebing differed; in that, he asserted that homosexuality was a symptom of other psychopathic behavior that he viewed to be an inherited disposition to degeneracy.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nDegeneracy became a widely acknowledged theory for homosexuality during the 1870s and 80s.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> It spoke to the eugenic and social Darwin theories of the late 19th century. [[Benedict Augustin Morel]] is considered the father of degeneracy theory.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> His theories posit that physical, intellectual, and moral abnormalities come from disease, urban over-population, malnutrition, alcohol, and other failures of his contemporary society.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn important shift in the terminology of homosexuality was brought about by the development of psychology's inquisition into homosexuality.  \"Contrary sexual feeling,\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> as Westphal's phrased, and the word \"homosexual\" itself made their way into the Western lexicons. Homosexuality had a name aside from the ambiguous term \"sodomy\" and the elusive \"abomination.\"  As Michel Foucault phrases, \"the sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn addendum to the terminology of homosexuality is the seemingly ever-changing acronym, with its roots in the 1980s when female homosexuals began to identify themselves as lesbians instead of gay. This led to references of \"gay and lesbian\" every time homosexuals were discussed in the media. Non-heterosexuals such as bisexual people and those who are transgender have also been classed alongside gay people and lesbians, resulting in the popular LGBT acronym (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender). However, the acronym is not set in stone; it has sometimes appeared as LGBTQ (to include [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning or queer people]]).\n\n===Homosexuality in eighteenth-century Great Britain===\n{{main|Timeline of LGBT history in Britain}}\n\nVarious authors wrote on the topic of homosexuality.

A ''Molly house'' is an archaic 18th century English term for a tavern or private room where homosexual and [[cross-dressing]] men could meet each other and possible sexual partners. Patrons of the Molly house would sometimes enact mock weddings, sometimes with the bride giving birth. [[Margaret Clap]] (?\u2014circa 1726), better known as ''Mother Clap'', ran such a Molly house from 1724 to 1726 in [[Holborn]], London. She was also heavily involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premise was raided and shut down. Molly houses were perhaps the first precursors to the modern [[gay bar]].\n\n===Decriminalization of homosexuality in France===\n{{See also|LGBT history in France|LGBT rights in France|LGBT culture in Paris}}\n\nWritten on July 21, 1776, the Letter LXIII became infamous for its frank talk of human sexuality.

There were even many [[drag (clothing)|drag]] bars where tourists [[heterosexuality|straight]] and gay would enjoy [[drag queen|female impersonation]] acts. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] decried cultural degeneration, [[prostitution]] and [[syphilis]] in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', blaming at least some of the phenomena on Jews.\n\n[[Berlin]] also had the most active [[LGBT movements|LGBT rights movements]] in the world at the time. Jewish doctor [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] had co-founded the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] (Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee, WhK) in Berlin in 1897 to campaign against the notorious \"[[Paragraph 175]]\" of the Penal Code that made [[Men who have sex with men|sex between men]] illegal. It also sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was the first public gay rights organization. The Committee had branches in several other countries, thereby being the first international LGBT organization, although on a small scale. In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sex Research), a private [[sexology]] [[research institute]]. It had a [[research library]] and a large archive, and included a marriage and sex counseling office. In addition, the institute was a pioneer worldwide in the call for [[civil rights]] and social acceptance for homosexual and transgender people.\nAs a  leading city for homosexuals during the 1920, Berlin had  clubs and even newspapers for both lesbians and gay men. The lesbian magazine [[Die Freundin]] was started by [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] and the gay men's magazine ''[[Der Eigene]]'' had already started in 1896 as the world's first gay magazine.

Conditions for gay men in the camps were especially rough; they faced not only persecution from German soldiers, but also other prisoners, and many gay men were reported to die of beatings. Female homosexuality was not, technically, a crime and thus gay women were generally not treated as harshly as gay men. Although there are some scattered reports that gay women were sometimes imprisoned for their sexuality, most would have been imprisoned for other reasons, i.e. \"anti-social\".\n\n===Alan Turing===\nIn Britain, the view of homosexuality as the mark of a deviant mind was not limited to the psychiatric wards of hospitals but also the courts. An extremely famous case was that of [[Alan Turing]], a British mathematician and theoretician. During WWII, Turing worked at [[Bletchley Park]] and was one of the major architects of the [[Colossus computer]], designed to break the Enigma codes of the Nazi war machine. For the success of this, he received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18541715|title=I remember Alan Turing...|date=June 23, 2012|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In spite of all his brilliance and the services rendered to his country, Turing was also openly homosexual and in the early 1950s this fact came to the attention of the British government when he was arrested under section 11 of an [[Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885|1885 statute]] of \"gross indecency\".<ref>Leavitt, David (2007).

Homosexuality remained an unseen and taboo concept in society, and the word \"homosexuality\" was not coined until 1868 by German-Hungarian [[Karoly Maria Kertbeny]] (who advocated decriminalization).<ref>EEdsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 69\u201384. 2003.</ref> During this era, homosexuality fell under the umbrella term \"sodomy\" that comprised all forms of nonproductive sexuality (masturbation and oral sex were sometimes excluded). Without urban sub-cultures or a name for self-definition, group identification and self-consciousness was unlikely.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 69\u201384. 2003.</ref>\n\nMainstream [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation]] of {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26-7|KJV}} and the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] were the justification for the severe penalties facing those accused of \"sodomy.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Most of the laws around homosexuality in the colonies were derived from the English laws of \"buggery,\" and the punishment in all American colonies was death. The penalty for attempted sodomy (both homosexuality and bestiality) was prison, whipping, banishment, or fines. Thomas Jefferson suggested castration as the punishment for sodomy, rape, and polygamy in a proposed revision of the Virginia criminal code near the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nPennsylvania was the first state to repeal the death penalty for \"sodomy\" in 1786 and within a generation all the other colonies followed suit (except North and South Carolina that repealed after the Civil War).<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Along with the removal of the death penalty during this generation, legal language shifted away from that of damnation to more dispassionate terms like \"unmentionable\" or \"abominable\" acts.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Aside from sodomy and \"attempted sodomy\" court cases and a few public scandals, homosexuality was seen as peripheral in mainstream society. Lesbianism had no legal definition largely given Victorian notions of female sexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nA survey of sodomy law enforcement during the nineteenth century suggests that a significant minority of cases did not specify the gender of the \"victim\" or accused. Most cases were argued as non-consensual or rape.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\">Mucciaroni, Gary. Same Sex, Different Politics. Chicago UP.

Or as contemporary author [[Theodore Winthrop]] in Cecil Dreeme writes, \"a friendship I deemed more precious than the love of women.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> This ideal came from and was enforced by the male-centric institutions of boy's boarding schools, all-male colleges, the military, the frontier, etc. \u2013 fictional and non-fiction accounts of passionate male friendships became a theme present in American Literature and social conceptions of masculinity.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nNew York, as America's largest city exponentially growing during the 19th Century (doubling from 1800\u201320 and again by 1840 to a population of 300,000), saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Continuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He was immediately drawn to young working-class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting their ages, physical characteristics, jobs, and origins.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''\u2014\"frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love\" or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:\n\n\"Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nSometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments\u2014\"I share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman's treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more homosexuals to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians debate whether he was a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th Century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nTwenty years after Whitman came to New York, [[Horatio Alger]] continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian [[self-made man]].<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C.

Raised as a boy, they would later spend part of their life dressing and living in the roles usually filled by women in Zuni culture, later living and working in roles filled by men, changing depending on the situation. Anthropologist [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], a friend of We'wha's who wrote extensively about the Zuni, hosted We'wha and the Zuni delegation when We'wha was chosen as an official emissary to Washington D.C. in 1886. During this time [[Singular they|they]] met President [[Grover Cleveland]]. We'wha had at least one husband, was trained in the customs and rites for the ceremonies for both men and women, and was a respected member of their community. Friends who documented their life used both pronouns for We'wha.<ref name=Bost139>Suzanne Bost, ''Mulattas and Mestizas: Representing Mixed Identities in the Americas'', 1850-2000, (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2003), pg.139</ref><ref name=Stevenson37>Matilda Coxe Stevenson, ''The Zuni Indians: Their Mythology, Esoteric Fraternities, and Ceremonies'', (BiblioBazaar, 2010) p.&nbsp;37 Quote:\"the most intelligent person in the pueblo.

Though his wrath was dreaded by men as well as women, he was loved by all children, to whom he was ever kind\"</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn 1908, the first American defense of homosexuality was published.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> ''The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life'', was written by Edward Stevenson under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> This 600-page defense detailed Classical examples, but also modern literature and the homosexual subcultures of urban life.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> He dedicated the novel to Krafft-Ebing because he argued homosexuality was inherited and, in Stevenson's view and not necessarily Krafft-Ebing's, should not face prejudice. He also wrote one of the first homosexual novels\u2014''Imre: A Memorandum''.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Also in this era, the earliest known open homosexual in the United States, Claude Hartland, wrote an account of his sexual history.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 90\u201391.</ref> He affirmed that he wrote it to affront the naivety surrounding sexuality. It was in response to the ignorance he saw while being treated by doctors and psychologists that failed to \"cure\" him.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/> Hartland wished his attraction to men could be solely \"spiritual,\" but could not escape the \"animal.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/>\n\nBy this time, society was slowly becoming aware of the homosexual subculture. In an 1898 lecture in Massachusetts, a doctor gave a lecture on this development in modern cities.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> With a population around three million at the turn of the 20th century, New York's queer subculture had a strong sense of self-definition and began redefining itself on its own terms. \"Middle class queer,\" \"fairies,\" were among the terminology of the underground world of the Lower East Side.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> But with this growing public presence, backlash occurred. The YMCA, who ironically promoted a similar image to that of the Whitman's praise of male brotherhood and athletic prowess, took a chief place in the purity campaigns of the epoch. Anthony Comstock, a salesman and leader of YMCA in Connecticut and later head of his own New York Society for the Suppression of Vice successfully pressed Congress and many state legislatures to pass strict censorship laws.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Ironically, the YMCA became a site of homosexual conduct. In 1912, a scandal hit Oregon where more than 50 men, many prominent in the community were arrested for homosexual activity. In reaction to this scandal conflicting with public campaigns, YMCA leadership began to look the other way on this conduct.\n\n===1920s===\n[[File:WeMustGrowAMustache.jpg|thumb|Sheet music poking fun at the masculine traits many women adopted during the 1920s.]]\n\nThe 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. This was reflected in many of the films (see [[Pre-Code]]) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality. Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. One of these songs had the title \"Masculine Women, Feminine Men.\"<ref>The song was written by [[Edgar Leslie]] (words) and [[James Vincent Monaco|James V. Monaco]] (music) and featured in [[Hugh J. Ward]]'s production of the musical ''[[Lady, Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''.</ref> It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics:<ref>Artists who recorded this song include: 1.

Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as \"pansy clubs\". The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor [[William Haines]], regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover, [[Jimmie Shields]].<ref>Mann, William J., ''Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star.

'' New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 12\u201313, 80\u201383.</ref> In 1927, [[Mae West]] wrote a play about homosexuality called ''[[The Drag (play)|The Drag]]'', and alluded to the work of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic [[human rights]] issue, and was also an early advocate of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]]. With the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality.\n\n===Late 1930s===\nBy 1935, the United States had become conservative once again. [[Victorian morality|Victorian values]] and mores, which had been widely ridiculed during the 1920s became fashionable once again. During this period, life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many laws were passed against homosexuals during this period and it was declared to be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest homosexuals by using young undercover cops to get them to make propositions to them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.

The war effort greatly shifted American culture and by extension representations in entertainment of both the [[nuclear family]] and LGBT people. In mostly same sex quarters service members were more easily able to express their interests and find willing partners of all sexualities.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1947, WWII [[conscientious objectors]] in the US assigned to psychiatric hospitals under [[Civilian Public Service]] exposed abuses throughout the psychiatric care system and were instrumental in [[reform]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n===Stonewall riots===\n{{Main|Stonewall riots}}\n\nAlthough the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are generally considered the starting point of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the LGBT community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power. ''See: [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots]]''\n\nIn the autumn of 1959, the police force of New York City's Wagner administration began closing down the city's gay bars, which had numbered almost two dozen in Manhattan at the beginning of the year. This crackdown was largely the result of a sustained campaign by the right-wing ''NY Mirror'' newspaper columnist [[Lee Mortimer]]. Existing gay bars were quickly closed and new ones lasted only a short time. The election of [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, [[Dick Leitsch]], [[Craig Rodwell]] president and vice president respectively of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and Mattachine activist John Timmons staged the Sip-In at [[Julius (restaurant)|Julius' Bar]] on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the NY State Liquor Authority being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens, transsexuals, and butch lesbians against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 at about 1:20&nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small. It was the commemorative march one year later, organized by the impetus of [[Craig Rodwell]], owner of the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]], which drew 5,000 marchers up New York City's [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], that drew nationwide publicity and put the Stonewall events on the historical map and led to the modern-day pride marches. A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. Late in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.\n\n===1980s===\n {{Disputed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe 1980s in LGBT history are marked with the emergence of [[HIV]]. During the early period of the outbreak of HIV, the [[HIV and men who have sex with men|epidemic of HIV was commonly linked to gay men.]]\n\nIn the 1980s a renewed conservative movement spawned a new anti-gay movement in the United States, particularly with the help of the Religious Right ([[Evangelicals]] in particular). While it is a common belief within some circles of the LGBT community that [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] were anti-gay, some others believe that this is an exaggeration. Ronald Reagan spoke up for gay equality as early as 1978, when he came out against [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a ballot initiative that would have dismissed California teachers who \"advocated\" homosexuality, even off-campus. As President, he allocated 5.727 Billion dollars from 1982 until 1989 for AIDS research. Socially, the Reagans were well known for being tolerant of homosexuals. Robert G. Kaiser's news story in the March 18, 1984, Washington Post.\n\"The Reagans are also tolerant about homosexual men,\" Kaiser wrote. \"Their interior decorator, Ted Graber, who oversaw the redecoration of the White House, spent a night in the Reagans' private White House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case, when they came to Washington for Nancy Reagan's 60th birthday party\u2014a fact confirmed for the press by Mrs. Reagan's press secretary.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Murdock |first=Deroy |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/304207/gay-left-lies-about-reagan-again-deroy-murdock?pg=2: |title=The Gay Left Lies about Reagan \u2014 Again |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> However, by the later part of the decade the general public started to show more sympathy and even tolerance for gays as the toll for AIDS related deaths continued to rise to include heterosexuals as well as cultural icons such as [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Liberace]], who also died from the condition. Also, despite the more conservative period, life in general for gays and lesbians was considerably better in contrast to the pre-Stonewall era.\n \nTestifying to improved conditions, a 1991 [[Wall Street Journal]] survey found that homosexuals, in comparison with average Americans, were three times more likely to be college graduates, three times more likely to hold professional or managerial positions, with average salaries $30,000 higher than the norm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nayo9QVuJs8C&pg=PA139 \"The Pleasure Principle: Sex, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom\"], Michael Bronski.

Legal recognition of a marital union opens up a wide range of entitlements, including [[social security]], taxation, inheritance and other benefits unavailable to couples not married, in the eyes of the law. Restricting legal recognition to opposite-sex couples prevents same-sex couples from gaining access to the legal benefits of marriage. Though certain rights can be replicated by legal means other than marriage (for example, by drawing-up contracts), many cannot, such as inheritance, hospital visitation and immigration. Lack of legal recognition also makes it more difficult for same-sex couples to adopt children.\n\nThe first country to legalize same-sex marriages was the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (2001), while the first marriages were performed in the Amsterdam city hall on April 1, 2001. {{as of|2019|June}}, same-sex marriages are legal nationally in twenty-six countries: the Netherlands (2001), [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (without [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Northern Ireland]]\u2014May 22, 2015), [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] (2014), [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]] (2015),  [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]] (2016), [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]], [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] (2018) and in [[Same-sex marriage in Austria|Austria]], [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Ecuador|Ecuador]] (2019).

In 1990, a student group named The Other Ten Percentile (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8) was founded by a group of teachers and students in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], becoming the first LGBT organization in [[Jerusalem]]. Frequently, such groups have been banned or prohibited from meeting or receiving the same recognition as other student groups. For example, in September 2006, [[Touro University California]] briefly attempted to ban the school's GSA, the [[Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance]]. After student demonstrations and an outcry of support from the [[American Medical Student Association]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] and the [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] [[City council|City Council]], Touro University retracted its revocation of the school's GSA. The university went on to reaffirm its commitment to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nIn April 2016, the GSA Network changed their name from Gay-Straight Alliance Network to Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network in order to be more inclusive and reflective of youth who make up the organization.\n\n==Historical study of homosexuality==\n\n===19th century and early 20th century===\nWhen [[Heinrich H\u00f6ssli]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|K. H. Ulrichs]] began their pioneering homosexual scholarship in the late 19th century, they found little in the way of comprehensive historical data, except for material from ancient Greece and Islam.<ref>''Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia: Volume 2 of Encyclopedia of lesbian and gay histories and cultures'', George E. Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman, {{ISBN|0-8153-3354-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3354-8}}, Taylor & Francis, 2000, page 388.</ref> Some other information was added by the English scholars Richard Burton and [[Havelock Ellis]]. In Germany, [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] published a volume containing lists of famous homosexuals. By the end of the century, however, when the Berlin Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was formed it was realised that a comprehensive bibliographical search must be undertaken. The results of this inquiry were incorporated into the volumes of the ''Jahrbuch fur sexualle Zwischenstufen'' and Magnus Hirschfeld's ''Die Homoexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes'' (1914). The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[Nazism]] put a stop to most serious homosexual research.\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\nAs part of the growth of the contemporary gay movement in Southern California, a number of historical articles made their way into such movement periodicals as ''The Ladder'', ''Mattachine Review'', and ''One Quarterly''. In France ''Aracadie'' under the editorship of Marc Daniel published a considerable amount of historical material. Almost without exception, university scholars were afraid to touch the subject. As a result, much of the work was done by autodidacts toiling under less than ideal conditions. Since most of this scholarship was done under movement auspices, it tended to reflect relevant concerns; compiling a brief of injustices and biographical sketches of exemplary gay men and women of the past for example.\n\nThe atmosphere of the 1960s changed things. The sexual revolution made human sexuality an appropriate object of research. A new emphasis on social and intellectual history appeared, stemming in large measure from the group around the French periodical ''Annales''. Although several useful syntheses of the world [[history of homosexuality]] have appeared, much material, especially from [[Islam]], China and other non-Western cultures has not yet been properly studied and published, so that undoubtedly these will be superseded.<ref>Ed.

In its early years, such movies were referred to as '''Disney Channel Premiere Films'''. From late 1997 onward, these television films have been branded under the '''Disney Channel Original Movies''' ('''DCOM''') banner.<ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite news|author=Stacey Grant|title=14 Films Everyone Mistakes For Disney Channel Original Movies|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2752917/movies-that-are-not-disney-channel-original-movies-dcoms/|accessdate=2017-03-14|work=MTV News|date=March 11, 2016|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMost of these films were subsequently released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]], or, more recently, [[Blu-ray]]. However, many more in the Disney television film library have never been released in any home video format. Originally, DCOMs were released on DVD months after they premiered on Disney Channel, but starting with ''[[Princess Protection Program]]'', DVDs for DCOMs have been released one week after they premiere on Disney Channel. Also, although DCOMs have been produced in widescreen HD format since mid-2005, the 2009 release of ''[[Princess Protection Program]]'' became the first DCOM to receive a widescreen DVD transfer.\n\nThe highest-rated premiere for the brand came in August 2007, when ''[[High School Musical 2]]'' set a record for basic cable with 17.2 million viewers. The second highest-rated premiere is held by ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie]]'', which premiered with 11.4 million viewers. Other major DCOM franchises include ''[[Camp Rock]]'', ''[[The Cheetah Girls (film series)|The Cheetah Girls]]'', ''Twitches'', ''[[Halloweentown (film series)|Halloweentown]]'', the ''[[Teen Beach Movie|Teen Beach]]'' films, the ''[[Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century (film)|Zenon]]'' trilogy, and ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|The Descendants]]'' series.\n\nDuring the [[Memorial Day]] holiday weekend of 2016, Disney Channel began to air many of the older DCOMs in a marathon format. The marathon began in celebration of its 100th Disney Channel Original Movie, ''[[Adventures in Babysitting (2016 film)|Adventures in Babysitting]]''. Disney Channel broadcast all of the 99 Disney Channel Original Movies that came before it, beginning with the 51 most popular films airing over the four-day weekend, beginning May 27, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/20/disney-channel-memorial-day-schedule-dcom |last=Kickham |first=Dylan |title=Disney Channel airing DCOM Memorial Day mega-marathon: See the schedule |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 20, 2016 |access-date=2017-03-18}}</ref> The network continued to screen the rest of its original movies throughout the month of June 2016, before the June 24 premiere of the 100th Disney Channel Original Film.<ref name=\"BuzzFeed\" />\n\n==Disney Channel Premiere Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"date\" | Premiere date\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Abbr|Ref(s)|References}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| 1983\n|''[[Tiger Town]]''\n| October 9, 1983\n| <ref>{{cite news|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=2017-03-16|work=Kidscreen|publisher=Brunico Communications Ltd.|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> \n|-\n|''Just Like Mr. Sunny''\n| December 4, 1983\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| 1984\n|''[[Gone Are the Dayes]]''\n| May 6, 1984\n| \n|-\n|''Love Leads the Way''\n| October 7, 1984\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| 1985\n|''[[Lots of Luck]]''\n| February 3, 1985\n| \n|-\n|''The Undergrads''\n| May 5, 1985\n| \n|-\n|''The Caldercott Story''\n| August 2, 1985\n| \n|-\n|''[[The Blue Yonder]]''\n| November 17, 1985\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"5\"| 1986\n|''Help Wanted: Kids''\n| February 2, 1986\n| \n|-\n|''[[Mr. Boogedy]]''\n| April 20, 1986\n| \n|-\n|''[[The Parent Trap II]]''\n| July 26, 1986\n| \n|-\n|''[[Spot Marks the X]]''\n| October 18, 1986\n| \n|-\n|''Down the Long Hills''\n| November 15, 1986\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| 1987\n|''Strange Companions''\n| February 28, 1987\n| \n|-\n|''[[Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel|Anne of Avonlea: The Continuing Story of Anne of Green Gables]]''\n| May 19, 1987\n| \n|-\n|''[[Not Quite Human (film)|Not Quite Human]]''\n| June 19, 1987\n| \n|-\n|''The Christmas Visitor''\n| December 5, 1987\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"7\"| 1988\n|''Rock N Roll Mom''\n| February 7, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''Save the Dog''\n| March 19, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''[[Night Train to Kathmandu]]''\n| June 5, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''[[Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss]]''\n| August 6, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''A Friendship in Vienna''\n| August 27, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''Good Old Boy''\n| November 11, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''Goodbye, Miss 4th of July''\n| December 3, 1988\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| 1989\n| ''[[Parent Trap III]]''\n| April 9, 1989\n| \n|-\n|''[[Not Quite Human II]]''\n| September 23, 1989\n| \n|-\n|''[[Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon]]''\n| November 19, 1989\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"6\"| 1990\n|''[[Lantern Hill (film)|Lantern Hill]]''\n| January 27, 1990\n| \n|-\n| ''Chips, the War Dog''\n| March 24, 1990\n| \n|-\n|''[[Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme]]''\n| May 19, 1990\n| \n|-\n|''[[Back Home (film)|Back Home]]''\n| June 7, 1990\n| \n|-\n|''[[The Little Kidnappers (1990 film)|The Little Kidnappers]]''\n| August 17, 1990\n| \n|-\n|''[[Back to Hannibal: The Return of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn]]''\n| October 21, 1990\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| 1991\n|''Bejewelled''\n| January 20, 1991\n| \n|-\n|''[[Perfect Harmony (film)|Perfect Harmony]]''\n| March 31, 1991\n| \n|-\n|''Mark Twain and Me''\n| November 22, 1991\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1992\n| ''[[Still Not Quite Human]]''\n| May 31, 1992\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| 1993\n|''[[The Ernest Green Story]]''\n| January 17, 1993\n| \n|-\n|''Spies''\n| March 7, 1993\n| <ref>''The Disney Channel Magazine'', Vol. 11, no. 2, February/March 1993: pp. 38, 42.</ref>\n|-\n|''[[Heidi (miniseries)|Heidi]]''\n| July 18, 1993\n| \n|-\n|''[[Airborne (1993 film)|Airborne]]''\n| September 17, 1993\n| \n|-\n<!-- DO ''not'' ADD \"Hocus Pocus (1993 film)\" TO THIS LIST.

In its early years, such movies were referred to as '''Disney Channel Premiere Films'''. From late 1997 onward, these television films have been branded under the '''Disney Channel Original Movies''' ('''DCOM''') banner.<ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite news|author=Stacey Grant|title=14 Films Everyone Mistakes For Disney Channel Original Movies|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2752917/movies-that-are-not-disney-channel-original-movies-dcoms/|accessdate=2017-03-14|work=MTV News|date=March 11, 2016|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMost of these films were subsequently released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]], or, more recently, [[Blu-ray]]. However, many more in the Disney television film library have never been released in any home video format. Originally, DCOMs were released on DVD months after they premiered on Disney Channel, but starting with ''[[Princess Protection Program]]'', DVDs for DCOMs have been released one week after they premiere on Disney Channel. Also, although DCOMs have been produced in widescreen HD format since mid-2005, the 2009 release of ''[[Princess Protection Program]]'' became the first DCOM to receive a widescreen DVD transfer.\n\nThe highest-rated premiere for the brand came in August 2007, when ''[[High School Musical 2]]'' set a record for basic cable with 17.2 million viewers. The second highest-rated premiere is held by ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie]]'', which premiered with 11.4 million viewers. Other major DCOM franchises include ''[[Camp Rock]]'', ''[[The Cheetah Girls (film series)|The Cheetah Girls]]'', ''Twitches'', ''[[Halloweentown (film series)|Halloweentown]]'', the ''[[Teen Beach Movie|Teen Beach]]'' films, the ''[[Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century (film)|Zenon]]'' trilogy, and ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|The Descendants]]'' series.\n\nDuring the [[Memorial Day]] holiday weekend of 2016, Disney Channel began to air many of the older DCOMs in a marathon format. The marathon began in celebration of its 100th Disney Channel Original Movie, ''[[Adventures in Babysitting (2016 film)|Adventures in Babysitting]]''. Disney Channel broadcast all of the 99 Disney Channel Original Movies that came before it, beginning with the 51 most popular films airing over the four-day weekend, beginning May 27, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/20/disney-channel-memorial-day-schedule-dcom |last=Kickham |first=Dylan |title=Disney Channel airing DCOM Memorial Day mega-marathon: See the schedule |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 20, 2016 |access-date=2017-03-18}}</ref> The network continued to screen the rest of its original movies throughout the month of June 2016, before the June 24 premiere of the 100th Disney Channel Original Film.<ref name=\"BuzzFeed\" />\n\n==Disney Channel Premiere Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"date\" | Premiere date\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Abbr|Ref(s)|References}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| 1983\n|''[[Tiger Town]]''\n| October 9, 1983\n| <ref>{{cite news|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=2017-03-16|work=Kidscreen|publisher=Brunico Communications Ltd.|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> \n|-\n|''Just Like Mr. Sunny''\n| December 4, 1983\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| 1984\n|''[[Gone Are the Dayes]]''\n| May 6, 1984\n| \n|-\n|''Love Leads the Way''\n| October 7, 1984\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| 1985\n|''[[Lots of Luck]]''\n| February 3, 1985\n| \n|-\n|''The Undergrads''\n| May 5, 1985\n| \n|-\n|''The Caldercott Story''\n| August 2, 1985\n| \n|-\n|''[[The Blue Yonder]]''\n| November 17, 1985\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"5\"| 1986\n|''Help Wanted: Kids''\n| February 2, 1986\n| \n|-\n|''[[Mr. Boogedy]]''\n| April 20, 1986\n| \n|-\n|''[[The Parent Trap II]]''\n| July 26, 1986\n| \n|-\n|''[[Spot Marks the X]]''\n| October 18, 1986\n| \n|-\n|''Down the Long Hills''\n| November 15, 1986\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| 1987\n|''Strange Companions''\n| February 28, 1987\n| \n|-\n|''[[Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel|Anne of Avonlea: The Continuing Story of Anne of Green Gables]]''\n| May 19, 1987\n| \n|-\n|''[[Not Quite Human (film)|Not Quite Human]]''\n| June 19, 1987\n| \n|-\n|''The Christmas Visitor''\n| December 5, 1987\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"7\"| 1988\n|''Rock N Roll Mom''\n| February 7, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''Save the Dog''\n| March 19, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''[[Night Train to Kathmandu]]''\n| June 5, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''[[Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss]]''\n| August 6, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''A Friendship in Vienna''\n| August 27, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''Good Old Boy''\n| November 11, 1988\n| \n|-\n|''Goodbye, Miss 4th of July''\n| December 3, 1988\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| 1989\n| ''[[Parent Trap III]]''\n| April 9, 1989\n| \n|-\n|''[[Not Quite Human II]]''\n| September 23, 1989\n| \n|-\n|''[[Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon]]''\n| November 19, 1989\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"6\"| 1990\n|''[[Lantern Hill (film)|Lantern Hill]]''\n| January 27, 1990\n| \n|-\n| ''Chips, the War Dog''\n| March 24, 1990\n| \n|-\n|''[[Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme]]''\n| May 19, 1990\n| \n|-\n|''[[Back Home (film)|Back Home]]''\n| June 7, 1990\n| \n|-\n|''[[The Little Kidnappers (1990 film)|The Little Kidnappers]]''\n| August 17, 1990\n| \n|-\n|''[[Back to Hannibal: The Return of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn]]''\n| October 21, 1990\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| 1991\n|''Bejewelled''\n| January 20, 1991\n| \n|-\n|''[[Perfect Harmony (film)|Perfect Harmony]]''\n| March 31, 1991\n| \n|-\n|''Mark Twain and Me''\n| November 22, 1991\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1992\n| ''[[Still Not Quite Human]]''\n| May 31, 1992\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| 1993\n|''[[The Ernest Green Story]]''\n| January 17, 1993\n| \n|-\n|''Spies''\n| March 7, 1993\n| <ref>''The Disney Channel Magazine'', Vol. 11, no. 2, February/March 1993: pp. 38, 42.</ref>\n|-\n|''[[Heidi (miniseries)|Heidi]]''\n| July 18, 1993\n| \n|-\n|''[[Airborne (1993 film)|Airborne]]''\n| September 17, 1993\n| \n|-\n<!-- DO ''not'' ADD \"Hocus Pocus (1993 film)\" TO THIS LIST.
