When the Warrens rented a house in Oyster Bay for the summer of 1906, Mallon went along, too. From August 27 to September 3, six of the 11 people in the family came down with typhoid fever. The disease at that time was \"unusual\" in Oyster Bay, according to three medical doctors who practiced there.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Mallon was subsequently hired by other families, and outbreaks followed her.<ref name=TheStraightDope/>\n\n=== Investigation ===\nIn late 1906, one family hired a typhoid researcher named [[George Soper]] to investigate. Soper published the results on June 15, 1907, in the [[JAMA (journal)|''Journal of the American Medical Association'']]. He believed Mallon might have been the source of the outbreak.<ref name=Newsday>{{cite news|author=Ochs, Ridgely|date=2007|title=Dinner with Typhoid Mary|newspaper=[[Newsday]]}}</ref> He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>It was found that the family changed cooks on August 4. This was about three weeks before the typhoid epidemic broke out. The new cook, Mallon, remained in the family only a short time and left about three weeks after the outbreak occurred. Mallon was described as an Irish woman about 40 years of age, tall, heavy, single. She seemed to be in perfect health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orauportal.fda.gov/courseware/FD202W100/SCORM_FD202_Module_3_Microbiology/Module_3_Dinner_With_Typhoid_Mary.pdf|title=Dinner With Typhoid Mary|website=FDA}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSoper discovered that a female Irish cook, who fit the physical description he was given, was involved in all of the outbreaks. He was unable to locate her because she generally left after an outbreak began, without giving a forwarding address. Soper learned of an active outbreak in a penthouse on [[Park Avenue]] and discovered Mallon was the cook. Two of the household's servants were hospitalized, and the daughter of the family died of typhoid.<ref name=\"TheStraightDope\" />\n\nWhen Soper approached Mallon about her possible role in spreading typhoid, she adamantly rejected his request for urine and stool samples.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Soper|first = George A.|title = The work of a chronic typhoid germ distributor|journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]]|volume = 48|issue = 24|pages = 2019\u201322|date = June 15, 1907|doi=10.1001/jama.1907.25220500025002d|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1423366}}</ref> Since Mallon refused to give samples, he decided to compile a five-year history of Mallon's employment.

Porter, the [[New York State Commissioner of Health]], decided that disease carriers should no longer be kept in isolation and that Mallon could be freed if she agreed to stop working as a cook and take reasonable steps to prevent transmitting typhoid to others. On February 19, 1910, Mallon agreed that she was \"prepared to change her occupation (that of a cook), and would give assurance by affidavit that she would upon her release take such hygienic precautions as would protect those with whom she came in contact, from infection.\" She was released from quarantine and returned to the mainland.<ref name=\"isbe\"/>\n\n===Release and second quarantine (1915\u20131938)===\nUpon her release, Mallon was given a job as a laundress, which paid less than cooking. After several unsuccessful years of working as a laundress, she changed her name to Mary Brown and returned to her former occupation despite having been explicitly instructed not to. For the next five years, she worked in a number of kitchens; wherever she worked, there were outbreaks of typhoid. However, she changed jobs frequently, and Soper was unable to find her.<ref name=TheStraightDope/>\n\nIn 1915, Mallon started another major outbreak, this time at [[Sloane Hospital for Women]] in New York City.

When the Warrens rented a house in Oyster Bay for the summer of 1906, Mallon went along, too. From August 27 to September 3, six of the 11 people in the family came down with typhoid fever.

He was unable to locate her because she generally left after an outbreak began, without giving a forwarding address. Soper learned of an active outbreak in a penthouse on [[Park Avenue]] and discovered Mallon was the cook.

Porter, the [[New York State Commissioner of Health]], decided that disease carriers should no longer be kept in isolation and that Mallon could be freed if she agreed to stop working as a cook and take reasonable steps to prevent transmitting typhoid to others. On February 19, 1910, Mallon agreed that she was \"prepared to change her occupation (that of a cook), and would give assurance by affidavit that she would upon her release take such hygienic precautions as would protect those with whom she came in contact, from infection.\" She was released from quarantine and returned to the mainland.<ref name=\"isbe\"/>\n\n===Release and second quarantine (1915\u20131938)===\nUpon her release, Mallon was given a job as a laundress, which paid less than cooking.

However, she changed jobs frequently, and Soper was unable to find her.<ref name=TheStraightDope/>\n\nIn 1915, Mallon started another major outbreak, this time at [[Sloane Hospital for Women]] in New York City.

The Tri-State Tornado, however, appeared to have no gaps in the damage. A six-year reanalysis study by a team of severe convective storm meteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does conclude that it is likely that the beginning and ending of the path was resultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family.

[[Parabola]]<br />\n2. [[Circle]] and [[ellipse]]<br />\n3. [[Hyperbola]]]]\n[[File:Table of Conics, Cyclopaedia, volume 1, p 304, 1728.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of conics, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''conic section''' (or simply '''conic''') is a [[curve]] obtained as the intersection of the [[Conical surface|surface]] of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] with a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The three types of conic section are the [[hyperbola]], the [[parabola]], and the [[ellipse]]; the [[circle]] is a special case of the ellipse, though historically it was sometimes called a fourth type. The ancient Greek mathematicians studied conic sections, culminating around 200 BC with [[Apollonius of Perga]]'s systematic work on their properties.\n\nThe conic sections in the [[Euclidean plane]] have various distinguishing properties, many of which can be used as alternative definitions.  One such property defines a non-circular conic<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=319}}</ref> to be the set of those points whose distances to some particular point, called a ''[[Focus (geometry)|focus]]'', and some particular line, called a ''directrix'', are in a fixed ratio, called the ''[[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]''. The type of conic is determined by the value of the eccentricity. In [[analytic geometry]], a conic may be defined as a [[algebraic curve|plane algebraic curve]] of degree 2; that is, as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a [[quadratic equation]] in two variables. This equation may be written in matrix form, and some geometric properties can be studied as algebraic conditions.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane, the three types of conic sections appear quite different, but share many properties. By extending the Euclidean plane to include a line at infinity, obtaining a [[projective plane]], the apparent difference vanishes: the branches of a hyperbola meet in two points at infinity, making it a single closed curve; and the two ends of a parabola meet to make it a closed curve tangent to the line at infinity. Further extension, by expanding the [[Real number|real]] coordinates to admit [[Complex number|complex]] coordinates, provides the means to see this unification algebraically.\n\n==Euclidean geometry==\nThe conic sections have been studied for thousands of years and have provided a rich source of interesting and beautiful results in [[Euclidean geometry]].\n\n===Definition===\n[[File:Conic Sections.svg|300px|right|thumb|The black boundaries of the colored regions are conic sections. Not shown is the other half of the hyperbola, which is on the unshown other half of the double cone.]]\n\nA '''conic''' is the curve obtained as the intersection of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], called the ''cutting plane'', with the surface of a double [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] (a cone with two ''nappes''). It is usually assumed that the cone is a right circular cone for the purpose of easy description, but this is not required; any double cone with some circular cross-section will suffice. Planes that pass through the vertex of the cone will intersect the cone in a point, a line or a pair of intersecting lines. These are called '''[[#Degenerate cases|degenerate conics]]''' and some authors do not consider them to be conics at all. Unless otherwise stated, \"conic\" in this article will refer to a non-degenerate conic.\n\nThere are three types of conics: the [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], and [[hyperbola]].<!-- The order ellipse/parabola/hyperbola is important in discussions and applications; please retain. --> The [[circle]] is a special kind of ellipse, although historically Apollonius considered as a fourth type. Ellipses arise when the intersection of the cone and plane is a [[closed curve]]. The circle is obtained when the cutting plane is parallel to the plane of the generating circle of the cone; for a right cone, this means the cutting plane is perpendicular to the axis. If the cutting plane is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to exactly one generating line of the cone, then the conic is unbounded and is called a ''parabola''. In the remaining case, the figure is a ''hyperbola'': the plane intersects ''both'' halves of the cone, producing two separate unbounded curves.\n\n===Eccentricity, focus and directrix===\n[[File:Eccentricity.svg|right|thumb|280px|Circle (''e''=0), ellipse (''e''=1/2), parabola (''e''=1) and hyperbola (''e''=2) with fixed focus ''F'' and directrix (''e''=\u221e).]]\nAlternatively, one can define a conic section purely in terms of plane geometry: it is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all points {{mvar|P}} whose distance to a fixed point {{mvar|F}} (called the [[focus (geometry)|'''focus''']]) is a constant multiple (called the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|'''eccentricity''']] {{mvar|e}}) of the distance from {{mvar|P}} to a fixed line {{mvar|L}} (called the '''directrix''').\nFor {{math|0 < ''e'' < 1}} we obtain an ellipse, for {{math|1=''e'' = 1}} a parabola, and for {{math|''e'' > 1}} a hyperbola.\n\nA circle is a limiting case and is not defined by a focus and directrix in the Euclidean plane. The eccentricity of a circle is defined to be zero and its focus is the center of the circle, but its directrix can only be taken as the line at infinity in the projective plane.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=13}}</ref>\n\nThe eccentricity of an ellipse can be seen as a measure of how far the ellipse deviates from being circular.\n\nIf the angle between the surface of the cone and its axis is <math>\\beta</math> and the angle between the cutting plane and the axis is <math>\\alpha,</math> the eccentricity is<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Finney|1979|page=434}}</ref> <math>\\frac{\\cos\\alpha}{\\cos\\beta}.</math>\n\nA proof that the above curves defined by the focus-directrix property are the same as those obtained by planes intersecting a cone is facilitated by the use of [[Dandelin spheres]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=19}}; {{harvnb|Kendig|2005|pages=86, 141}}</ref>\n\n===Conic parameters===\n[[File:Ellipse parameters 2.svg|right|thumb|400px|Conic parameters in the case of an ellipse]]\n\nIn addition to the eccentricity (''e''), foci, and directrix, various geometric features and lengths are associated with a conic section. \n\nThe '''principal axis''' is the line joining the foci of an ellipse or hyperbola, and its midpoint is the curve's '''center'''. A parabola has no center. \n\nThe '''linear eccentricity''' ({{math|''c''}}) is the distance between the center and a focus.\n\nThe '''latus rectum''' is the [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] parallel to the directrix and passing through a focus; its half-length is the semi-latus rectum ({{math|''\u2113''}}).\n\nThe '''focal parameter''' ({{math|''p''}}) is the distance from a focus to the corresponding directrix.\n\nThe '''major axis''' is the chord between the two vertices: the longest chord of an ellipse, the shortest chord between the branches of a hyperbola. Its half-length is the [[semi-major axis]] ({{mvar|a}}). When an ellipse or hyperbola are in standard position as in the equations below, with foci on the {{mvar|x}}-axis and center at the origin, the vertices of the conic have coordinates {{math|(\u2212''a'', 0)}} and {{math|(''a'', 0)}}, with {{mvar|a}} non-negative.\n\nThe '''minor axis''' is the shortest chord of an ellipse, and its half-length is the semi-minor axis ({{math|''b''}}), the same value {{math|''b''}} as in the standard equation below. By analogy, for a hyperbola we also call the parameter {{math|''b''}} in the standard equation the semi-minor axis.\n\nThe following relations hold:<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|pages=13\u201316}}</ref>\n* <math>\\ \\ell = p e</math>\n* <math>\\ c = a e</math>\n* <math>\\ p+c = \\frac ae</math>\n\nFor conics in standard position, these parameters have the following values, taking <math>a ,b > 0</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! conic section\n! equation\n! eccentricity ({{math|''e''}})\n! linear eccentricity ({{math|''c''}})\n! semi-latus rectum ({{math|''\u2113''}})\n! focal parameter ({{math|''p''}})\n|-\n| [[circle]]\n|| <math>x^2+y^2=a^2 \\,</math>\n|| <math> 0 \\,</math>\n|| <math> 0 \\,</math>\n|| <math> a \\,</math>\n|| <math> \\infty</math>\n|-\n| [[ellipse]]\n|| <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</math>\n|| <math>\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}</math>\n|| <math>\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}</math>\n|| <math>\\frac{b^2}{a}</math>\n|| <math>\\frac{b^2}{\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}</math>\n|-\n| [[parabola]]\n|| <math>y^2=4ax \\,</math>\n|| <math> 1 \\,</math>\n|| N/A\n|| <math> 2a \\,</math>\n|| <math> 2a \\, </math>\n|-\n| [[hyperbola]]\n|| <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</math>\n|| <math>\\sqrt{1+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}</math>\n|| <math>\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</math>\n|| <math>\\frac{b^2}{a}</math>\n|| <math>\\frac{b^2}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</math>\n|}\n\n===Standard forms in Cartesian coordinates===\n[[File:Conic section - standard forms of an ellipse.png|thumb|280px|Standard forms of an ellipse]]\n[[File:Conic section - standard forms of a parabola.png|thumb|180px|left|Standard forms of a parabola]]\n[[File:Conic section - standard forms of a hyperbola.png|thumb|280px|Standard forms of a hyperbola]]\nAfter introducing [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]], the focus-directrix property can be used to produce the equations satisfied by the points of the conic section.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|pages=11\u201316}}</ref> By means of a change of coordinates ([[Rotation of axes#Rotation of conic sections|rotation]] and [[Translation of axes#Translation of conic sections|translation of axes]]) these equations can be put into ''standard forms''.<ref>{{harvnb|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=314\u2013328, 585\u2013589}}</ref> For ellipses and hyperbolas a standard form has the {{mvar|x}}-axis as principal axis and the origin (0,0) as center.

Formally, given any five points in the plane in [[general linear position]], meaning no three [[Line (geometry)|collinear]], there is a unique conic passing through them, which will be non-degenerate; this is true in both the Euclidean plane and its extension, the real projective plane. Indeed, given any five points there is a conic passing through them, but if three of the points are collinear the conic will be degenerate (reducible, because it contains a line), and may not be unique; see [[Degenerate conic#Points to define|further discussion]].\n\nFour points in the plane in general linear position determine a unique conic passing through the first three points and having the fourth point as its center. Thus knowing the center is equivalent to knowing two points on the conic for the purpose of determining the curve.<ref name=WW>[[William Allen Whitworth|Whitworth, William Allen]].

A point on just one tangent line is on the conic. A point on no tangent line is said to be an '''interior point''' (or '''inner point''') of the conic, while a point on two tangent lines is an '''exterior point''' (or '''outer point''').\n\nAll the conic sections share a ''reflection property'' that can be stated as: All mirrors in the shape of a non-degenerate conic section reflect light coming from or going toward one focus toward or away from the other focus. In the case of the parabola, the second focus needs to be thought of as infinitely far away, so that the light rays going toward or coming from the second focus are parallel.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|pages=36ff.}}</ref>\n\n[[Pascal's theorem]] concerns the collinearity of three points that are constructed from a set of six points on any non-degenerate conic. The theorem also holds for degenerate conics consisting of two lines, but in that case it is known as [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|Pappus's theorem]].\n\nNon-degenerate conic sections are always \"[[smoothness|smooth]]\".

Cones were constructed by rotating a right triangle about one of its legs so the hypotenuse generates the surface of the cone (such a line is called a [[wikt:generatrix|generatrix]]). Three types of cones were determined by their vertex angles (measured by twice the angle formed by the hypotenuse and the leg being rotated about in the right triangle). The conic section was then determined by intersecting one of these cones with a plane drawn perpendicular to a generatrix. The type of the conic is determined by the type of cone, that is, by the angle formed at the vertex of the cone: If the angle is acute then the conic is an ellipse; if the angle is right then the conic is a parabola; and if the angle is obtuse then the conic is a hyperbola (but only one branch of the curve).<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|1998|page=117}}</ref>\n\n[[Euclid]] (fl. 300 BCE) is said to have written four books on conics but these were lost as well.<ref>Heath, T.L., ''The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements'', Vol. I, Dover, 1956, pg.16</ref> [[Archimedes]] (died c.\u2009212 BCE) is known to have studied conics, having determined the area bounded by a parabola and a chord in ''Quadrature of the Parabola''.

This may account for why Apollonius considered circles a fourth type of conic section, a distinction that is no longer made.

Kepler first used the term ''foci'' in 1604.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|1998|page=126}}</ref>\n\n[[Girard Desargues]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] developed a theory of conics using an early form of [[projective geometry]] and this helped to provide impetus for the study of this new field. In particular, Pascal discovered a theorem known as the [[hexagrammum mysticum]] from which many other properties of conics can be deduced.\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre Fermat]] both applied their newly discovered [[analytic geometry]] to the study of conics. This had the effect of reducing the geometrical problems of conics to problems in algebra. However, it was [[John Wallis]] in his 1655 treatise ''Tractatus de sectionibus conicis'' who first defined the conic sections as instances of equations of second degree.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|page=110}}</ref> Written earlier, but published later, [[Jan de Witt]]'s ''Elementa Curvarum Linearum'' starts with Kepler's [[Kinematics|kinematic]] construction of the conics and then develops the algebraic equations.

If they are bound together, they will both trace out ellipses; if they are moving apart, they will both follow parabolas or hyperbolas. See [[two-body problem]].\n\nThe reflective properties of the conic sections are used in the design of searchlights, radio-telescopes and some optical telescopes.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=27}}</ref> A searchlight uses a parabolic mirror as the reflector, with a bulb at the focus; and a similar construction is used for a [[parabolic microphone]]. The 4.2 meter [[William Herschel Telescope|Herschel optical telescope]] on La Palma, in the Canary islands, uses a primary parabolic mirror to reflect light towards a secondary hyperbolic mirror, which reflects it again to a focus behind the first mirror.\n\n==In the real projective plane==\nThe conic sections have some very similar properties in the Euclidean plane and the reasons for this become clearer when the conics are viewed from the perspective of a larger geometry. The Euclidean plane may be embedded in the [[real projective plane]] and the conics may be considered as objects in this projective geometry. One way to do this is to introduce [[homogeneous coordinates]] and define a conic to be the set of points whose coordinates satisfy an irreducible quadratic equation in three variables (or equivalently, the zeros of an irreducible [[quadratic form]]). More technically, the set of points that are zeros of a quadratic form (in any number of variables) is called a [[quadric]], and the irreducible quadrics in a two dimensional projective space (that is, having three variables) are traditionally called conics.\n\nThe Euclidean plane {{math|''R''<sup>2</sup>}} is embedded in the real projective plane by adjoining a [[line at infinity]] (and its corresponding [[Point at infinity|points at infinity]]) so that all the lines of a parallel class meet on this line. On the other hand, starting with the real projective plane, a Euclidean plane is obtained by distinguishing some line as the line at infinity and removing it and all its points.\n\n===Intersection at infinity===\nIn a [[projective space]] over any division ring, but in particular over either the real or complex numbers, all non-degenerate conics are equivalent, and thus in projective geometry one simply speaks of \"a conic\" without specifying a type. That is, there is a projective transformation that will map any non-degenerate conic to any other non-degenerate conic.<ref>{{harvnb|Artzy|2008|loc=p. 158, Thm 3-5.1}}</ref>\n\nThe three types of conic sections will reappear in the affine plane obtained by choosing a line of the projective space to be the line at infinity. The three types are then determined by how this line at infinity intersects the conic in the projective space. In the corresponding affine space, one obtains an ellipse if the conic does not intersect the line at infinity, a parabola if the conic intersects the line at infinity in one [[double point]] corresponding to the axis, and a hyperbola if the conic intersects the line at infinity in two points corresponding to the asymptotes.<ref>{{harvnb|Artzy|2008|loc=p. 159}}</ref>\n\n===Homogeneous coordinates===\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]] a conic section can be represented as:\n\n:<math>Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 +Dxz + Eyz + Fz^2 = 0. </math>\n\nOr in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation\n\n: <math>\\left(\\begin{matrix}x & y & z\\end{matrix}\\right) \\left( \\begin{matrix}A & B/2 & D/2\\\\B/2 & C & E/2\\\\D/2&E/2&F\\end{matrix}\\right) \\left(\\begin{matrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{matrix}\\right) = 0. </math>\n\nThe 3 \u00d7 3 matrix above is called ''the matrix of the conic section''.\n\nSome authors prefer to write the general homogeneous equation as\n\n:<math>Ax^2 + 2Bxy + Cy^2 +2Dxz + 2Eyz + Fz^2 = 0, </math>\n\n(or some variation of this) so that the matrix of the conic section has the simpler form,\n\n:<math>M = \\left( \\begin{matrix}A & B & D\\\\B & C & E\\\\D&E&F\\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\nbut this notation is not used in this article.<ref>This form of the equation does not generalize to fields of characteristic two (see below)</ref>\n\nIf the determinant of the matrix of the conic section is zero, the conic section is [[#degenerate conics|degenerate]].\n\nAs multiplying all six coefficients by the same non-zero scalar yields an equation with the same set of zeros, one can consider conics, represented by {{math|(''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F'')}} as points in the five-dimensional [[projective space]] <math>\\mathbf{P}^5.</math>\n\n===Projective definition of a circle===\n[[Metric space|Metrical]] concepts of Euclidean geometry (concepts concerned with measuring lengths and angles) can not be immediately extended to the real projective plane.<ref>Consider finding the midpoint of a line segment with one endpoint on the line at infinity.</ref> They must be redefined (and generalized) in this new geometry.

Select two distinct points on the absolute line and refer to them as '''absolute points'''. Several metrical concepts can be defined with reference to these choices.

Since five points determine a conic, a circle (which may be degenerate) is determined by three points. To obtain the extended Euclidean plane, the absolute line is chosen to be the line at infinity of the Euclidean plane and the absolute points are two special points on that line called the [[circular points at infinity]]. Lines containing two points with real coordinates do not pass through the circular points at infinity, so in the Euclidean plane a circle, under this definition, is determined by three points that are not [[collinear]].<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3TwCIg_O2yMC&lpg=PP1&hl=cs&pg=PA72 72]}}</ref>{{rp|72}}\n\nIt has been mentioned that circles in the Euclidean plane can not be defined by the focus-directrix property. However, if one were to consider the line at infinity as the directrix, then by taking the eccentricity to be {{math|1=''e'' = 0}} a circle will have the focus-directrix property, but it is still not defined by that property.<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=320}}</ref> One must be careful in this situation to correctly use the definition of eccentricity as the ratio of the distance of a point on the circle to the focus (length of a radius) to the distance of that point to the directrix (this distance is infinite) which gives the limiting value of zero.\n\n===Steiner's projective conic definition===\n{{main|Steiner conic}}\n[[File:Steiner-erz-def-s.svg|thumb|Definition of the Steiner generation of a conic section]]\nA [[Synthetic geometry|synthetic]] (coordinate-free) approach to defining the conic sections in a projective plane was given by [[Jakob Steiner]] in 1867.\n* Given two pencils <math>B(U),B(V)</math> of lines at two points <math>U,V</math> (all lines containing <math>U</math> and  <math>V</math> resp.) and a [[projectivity|projective]] but not [[perspectivity|perspective]] mapping <math>\\pi</math> of <math>B(U)</math> onto <math>B(V)</math>.

These 5 items (2 points, 3 lines) uniquely determine the conic section.\n\n===Line conics===\nBy the [[Duality (projective geometry)|Principle of Duality]] in a projective plane, the dual of each point is a line, and the dual of a locus of points (a set of points satisfying some condition) is called an ''envelope'' of lines. Using Steiner's definition of a conic (this locus of points will now be referred to as a ''point conic'') as the meet of corresponding rays of two related pencils, it is easy to dualize and obtain the corresponding envelope consisting of the joins of corresponding points of two related ranges (points on a line) on different bases (the lines the points are on). Such an envelope is called a '''line conic''' (or '''dual conic''').\n\nIn the real projective plane, a point conic has the property that every line meets it in two points (which may coincide, or may be complex) and any set of points with this property is a point conic. It follows dually that a line conic has two of its lines through every point and any envelope of lines with this property is a line conic. At every point of a point conic there is a unique tangent line, and dually, on every line of a line conic there is a unique point called a ''point of contact''. An important theorem states that the tangent lines of a point conic form a line conic, and dually, the points of contact of a line conic form a point conic.<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3TwCIg_O2yMC&lpg=PP1&hl=cs&pg=PA48 48\u201349]}}.</ref>{{rp|48\u201349}}\n\n===Von Staudt's definition===\n{{main|Von Staudt conic}}\n[[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] defined a conic as the point set given by all the absolute points of a [[Pole and polar|polarity]] that has absolute points. Von Staudt introduced this definition in ''Geometrie der Lage'' (1847) as part of his attempt to remove all metrical concepts from projective geometry.\n\nA '''polarity''', {{pi}}, of a projective plane, {{mvar|''P''}}, is an involutory (i.e., of order two) [[bijection]] between the points and the lines of {{mvar|''P''}} that preserves the [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence relation]]. Thus, a polarity relates a point {{mvar|''Q''}} with a line {{mvar|''q''}} and, following [[Gergonne]], {{mvar|''q''}} is called the '''polar''' of {{mvar|''Q''}} and {{mvar|''Q''}} the '''pole''' of {{mvar|''q''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=60}}</ref> An '''absolute point''' ('''line''') of a polarity is one which is incident with its polar (pole).<ref>Coxeter and several other authors use the term ''self-conjugate'' instead of absolute.</ref>\n\nA von Staudt conic in the real projective plane is equivalent to a [[Steiner conic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=80}}</ref>\n\n===Constructions===\nNo continuous arc of a conic can be constructed with straightedge and compass.

Specifically, given five points, {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E''}} and a line passing through {{mvar|E}}, say {{math|{{overline|''EG''}}}}, \\a point {{mvar|F}} that lies on this line and is on the conic determined by the five points can be constructed.

Divide the side {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}} into {{mvar|n}} equal segments and use parallel projection, with respect to the diagonal {{math|{{overline|''AC''}}}}, to form equal segments on side {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} (the lengths of these segments will be {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} times the length of the segments on {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}}). On the side {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}} label the left-hand endpoints of the segments with {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''A''<sub>n</sub>}} starting at {{mvar|B}} and going towards {{mvar|C}}.

The labeling associates the lines of the pencil through {{mvar|A}} with the lines of the pencil through {{mvar|D}} projectively but not perspectively. The sought for conic is obtained by this construction since three points {{math|''A'', ''D''}} and {{mvar|P}} and two tangents (the vertical lines at {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|D}}) uniquely determine the conic. If another diameter (and its conjugate diameter) are used instead of the major and minor axes of the ellipse, a parallelogram that is not a rectangle is used in the construction, giving the name of the method. The association of lines of the pencils can be extended to obtain other points on the ellipse. The constructions for hyperbolas<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|page=14}}</ref> and parabolas<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|page=19}}</ref> are similar.\n\nYet another general method uses the polarity property to construct the tangent envelope of a conic (a line conic).<ref>{{harvnb|Akopyan|Zaslavsky|2007|page=70}}</ref>\n\n==In the complex projective plane==\n\nIn the complex plane '''C<sup>2</sup>''', ellipses and hyperbolas are not distinct: one may consider a hyperbola as an ellipse with an imaginary axis length. For example, the ellipse <math>x^2+y^2=1</math> becomes a hyperbola under the substitution <math>y=iw,</math> geometrically a complex rotation, yielding <math>x^2-w^2=1</math>. Thus there is a 2-way classification: ellipse/hyperbola and parabola. Extending the curves to the complex projective plane, this corresponds to intersecting the [[line at infinity]] in either 2 distinct points (corresponding to two asymptotes) or in 1 double point (corresponding to the axis of a parabola); thus the real hyperbola is a more suggestive real image for the complex ellipse/hyperbola, as it also has 2 (real) intersections with the line at infinity.\n\nFurther unification occurs in the [[complex projective plane]] '''CP<sup>2</sup>''': the non-degenerate conics cannot be distinguished from one another, since any can be taken to any other by a [[projective linear transformation]].\n\nIt can be proven that in '''CP<sup>2</sup>''', two conic sections have four points in common (if one accounts for [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]), so there are between 1 and 4 [[B\u00e9zout's theorem|intersection]] points. The intersection possibilities are: four distinct points, two singular points and one double point, two double points, one singular point and one with multiplicity 3, one point with multiplicity 4. If any intersection point has multiplicity > 1, the two curves are said to be [[tangent]]. If there is an intersection point of multiplicity at least 3, the two curves are said to be [[osculating curve|osculating]]. If there is only one intersection point, which has multiplicity 4, the two curves are said to be ''superosculating''.<ref>{{Citation |first=E.

If the intersection point is double, the line is a [[tangent line]].\nIntersecting with the line at infinity, each conic section has two points at infinity. If these points are real, the curve is a [[hyperbola]]; if they are imaginary conjugates, it is an [[ellipse]]; if there is only one double point, it is a [[parabola]]. If the points at infinity are the [[cyclic points]] {{math|(1, ''i'', 0)}} and {{math|(1, \u2013''i'', 0)}}, the conic section is a [[circle]]. If the coefficients of a conic section are real, the points at infinity are either real or [[complex conjugate]].\n\n{{anchor|Degenerate conics}}\n\n==Degenerate cases==\n{{details|Degenerate conic}}\n\nWhat should be considered as a '''degenerate case''' of a conic depends on the definition being used and the geometric setting for the conic section. There are some authors who define a conic as a two-dimensional nondegenerate quadric. With this terminology there are no degenerate conics (only degenerate quadrics), but we shall use the more traditional terminology and avoid that definition.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane, using the geometric definition, a degenerate case arises when the cutting plane passes through the [[wikt:apex|apex]] of the cone.\nThe degenerate conic is either: a [[point (geometry)|point]], when the plane intersects the cone only at the apex; a [[straight line]], when the plane is tangent to the cone (it contains exactly one generator of the cone); or a pair of intersecting lines (two generators of the cone).<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=6}}</ref> These correspond respectively to the limiting forms of an ellipse, parabola, and a hyperbola.\n\nIf a conic in the Euclidean plane is being defined by the zeros of a quadratic equation (that is, as a quadric), then the degenerate conics are: the [[empty set]], a point, or a pair of lines which may be parallel, intersect at a point, or coincide. The empty set case may correspond either to a pair of [[complex conjugate]] parallel lines such as with the equation <math>x^2+1=0,</math> or to an ''imaginary ellipse'', such as with the equation <math>x^2 +y^2+1=0.</math> An imaginary ellipse does not satisfy the general definition of a [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degeneracy]], and is thus not normally considered as degenerated.<ref>Korn, G. A., & Korn, T. M., ''Mathematical Handbook for Scientists and Engineers: Definitions, Theorems, and Formulas for Reference and Review'' ([[Mineola, New York|Mineola, NY]]: [[Dover Publications]], 1961), [https://books.google.com/books?id=A4XCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA42 p. 42].</ref> The two lines case occurs when the quadratic expression factors into two linear factors, the zeros of each giving a line. In the case that the factors are the same, the corresponding lines coincide and we refer to the line as\na ''double'' line (a line with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] 2) and this is the previous case of a tangent cutting plane.\n\nIn the real projective plane, since parallel lines meet at a point on the line at infinity, the parallel line case of the Euclidean plane can be viewed as intersecting lines. However, as the point of intersection is the apex of the cone, the cone itself degenerates to a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], i.e. with the apex at infinity. Other sections in this case are called ''cylindric sections''.<ref>{{cite web | title=MathWorld: Cylindric section| url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricSection.html}}</ref> The non-degenerate cylindrical sections are ellipses (or circles).\n\nWhen viewed from the perspective of the complex projective plane, the degenerate cases of a real quadric (i.e., the quadratic equation has real coefficients) can all be considered as a pair of lines, possibly coinciding. The empty set may be the line at infinity considered as a double line, a (real) point is the intersection of two [[complex conjugate line]]s and the other cases as previously mentioned.\n\nTo distinguish the degenerate cases from the non-degenerate cases (including the empty set with the latter) using matrix notation, let {{math|''\u03b2''}} be the determinant of the 3\u00d73 matrix of the conic section\u2014that is, {{math|1=''\u03b2 '' = (''AC'' \u2212 {{sfrac|''B''<sup>2</sup>|4}})''F'' + {{sfrac|''BED'' \u2212 ''CD''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''AE''<sup>2</sup>|4}}}}; and let {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = ''B''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 4''AC''}} be the discriminant. Then the conic section is non-degenerate if and only if {{math|''\u03b2'' \u2260 0}}.  If {{math|1=''\u03b2 ''= 0}} we have a point when {{math|''\u03b1'' < 0}}, two parallel lines (possibly coinciding) when {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = 0}}, or two intersecting lines when {{math|''\u03b1'' > 0}}.<ref>{{citation|last=Lawrence|first=J.

Through any point other than a base point, there passes a single conic of the pencil. This concept generalizes a [[pencil of circles]].\n\nIn a [[projective plane]] defined over an [[algebraically closed field]] any two conics meet in four points (counted with multiplicity) and so, determine the pencil of conics based on these four points. Furthermore, the four base points determine three line pairs ([[degenerate conic]]s through the base points, each line of the pair containing exactly two base points) and so each pencil of conics will contain at most three degenerate conics.<ref>{{harvnb|Samuel|1988|loc=pg. 50}}.</ref>\n\nA pencil of conics can represented algebraically in the following way. Let {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} be two distinct conics in a projective plane defined over an algebraically closed field {{math|''K''}}. For every pair {{math|''\u03bb'', ''\u03bc''}} of elements of {{math|''K''}}, not both zero, the expression:\n\n::<math>\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2</math>\n\nrepresents a conic in the pencil determined by {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}}. This symbolic representation can be made concrete with a slight abuse of notation (using the same notation to denote the object as well as the equation defining the object.) Thinking of {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}}, say, as a ternary [[quadratic form]], then {{math|1=''C''<sub>1</sub> = 0}} is the equation of the \"conic {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}}\". Another concrete realization would be obtained by thinking of {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} as the [[#Homogeneous coordinates|3\u00d73 symmetric matrix]] which represents it. If {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} have such concrete realizations then every member of the above pencil will as well. Since the setting uses homogeneous coordinates in a projective plane, two concrete representations (either equations or matrices) give the same conic if they differ by a non-zero multiplicative constant.\n\n== Intersecting two conics ==\nThe solutions to a system of two second degree equations in two variables may be viewed as the coordinates of the points of intersection of two generic conic sections.\nIn particular two conics may possess none, two or four possibly coincident intersection points.\nAn efficient method of locating these solutions exploits the homogeneous [[matrix representation of conic sections]], i.e. a 3x3 [[symmetric matrix]] which depends on six parameters.\n\nThe procedure to locate the intersection points follows these steps, where the conics are represented by matrices:\n* given the two conics <math>C_1</math> and <math>C_2</math>, consider the pencil of conics given by their linear combination <math>\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2.</math>\n* identify the homogeneous parameters <math>(\\lambda,\\mu)</math> which correspond to the degenerate conic of the pencil. This can be done by imposing the condition that <math>\\det(\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2) = 0</math> and solving for <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math>. These turn out to be the solutions of a third degree equation.\n* given the degenerate conic <math>C_0</math>, identify the two, possibly coincident, lines constituting it.\n* intersect each identified line with either one of the two original conics; this step can be done efficiently using the dual conic representation of <math>C_0</math>\n* the points of intersection will represent the solutions to the initial equation system.\n\n==Generalizations==\nConics may be defined over other fields (that is, in other [[pappian plane|pappian geometries]]).  However, some care must be used when the field has [[Characteristic (field)|characteristic]] 2, as some formulas can not be used. For example, the matrix representations used [[#General Cartesian form|above]] require division by 2.\n\nA generalization of a non-degenerate conic in a projective plane is an [[oval (projective plane)|oval]]. An oval is a point set that has the following properties, which are held by conics: 1) any line intersects an oval in none, one or two points, 2) at any point of the oval there exists a unique tangent line.\n\nGeneralizing the focus properties of conics to the case where there are more than two foci produces sets called [[generalized conic]]s.\n\n==In other areas of mathematics==\nThe classification into elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic is pervasive in mathematics, and often divides a field into sharply distinct subfields. The classification mostly arises due to the presence of a quadratic form (in two variables this corresponds to the associated [[discriminant]]), but can also correspond to eccentricity.\n\nQuadratic form classifications:\n;[[Quadratic form]]s: Quadratic forms over the reals are classified by [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], namely by their positive index, zero index, and negative index: a quadratic form in ''n'' variables can be converted to a [[diagonal form]], as <math>x_1^2+x_2^2+\\cdots+x_k^2-x_{k+1}^2-\\cdots-x_{k+\\ell}^2,</math> where the number of +1 coefficients, ''k,'' is the positive index, the number of \u22121 coefficients, ''\u2113'', is the negative index, and the remaining variables are the zero index ''m,'' so <math>k+\\ell+m=n.</math> In two variables the non-zero quadratic forms are classified as:\n:* <math>x^2+y^2</math> \u2013 positive-definite (the negative is also included), corresponding to ellipses,\n:* <math>x^2</math> \u2013 degenerate, corresponding to parabolas, and\n:* <math>x^2-y^2</math> \u2013 indefinite, corresponding to hyperbolas.\n:In two variables quadratic forms are classified by discriminant, analogously to conics, but in higher dimensions the more useful classification is as ''definite,'' (all positive or all negative), ''degenerate,'' (some zeros), or ''indefinite'' (mix of positive and negative but no zeros). This classification underlies many that follow.\n;Curvature: The [[Gaussian curvature]] of a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] describes the infinitesimal geometry, and may at each point be either positive \u2013 [[elliptic geometry]], zero \u2013 [[Euclidean geometry]] (flat, parabola), or negative \u2013 [[hyperbolic geometry]]; infinitesimally, to second order the surface looks like the graph of <math>x^2+y^2,</math> <math>x^2</math> (or 0), or <math>x^2-y^2</math>. Indeed, by the [[uniformization theorem]] every surface can be taken to be globally (at every point) positively curved, flat, or negatively curved.

[[Parabola]]<br />\n2. [[Circle]] and [[ellipse]]<br />\n3. [[Hyperbola]]]]\n[[File:Table of Conics, Cyclopaedia, volume 1, p 304, 1728.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of conics, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''conic section''' (or simply '''conic''') is a [[curve]] obtained as the intersection of the [[Conical surface|surface]] of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] with a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The three types of conic section are the [[hyperbola]], the [[parabola]], and the [[ellipse]]; the [[circle]] is a special case of the ellipse, though historically it was sometimes called a fourth type. The ancient Greek mathematicians studied conic sections, culminating around 200 BC with [[Apollonius of Perga]]'s systematic work on their properties.\n\nThe conic sections in the [[Euclidean plane]] have various distinguishing properties, many of which can be used as alternative definitions.  One such property defines a non-circular conic<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=319}}</ref> to be the set of those points whose distances to some particular point, called a ''[[Focus (geometry)|focus]]'', and some particular line, called a ''directrix'', are in a fixed ratio, called the ''[[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]''. The type of conic is determined by the value of the eccentricity. In [[analytic geometry]], a conic may be defined as a [[algebraic curve|plane algebraic curve]] of degree 2; that is, as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a [[quadratic equation]] in two variables. This equation may be written in matrix form, and some geometric properties can be studied as algebraic conditions.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane, the three types of conic sections appear quite different, but share many properties. By extending the Euclidean plane to include a line at infinity, obtaining a [[projective plane]], the apparent difference vanishes: the branches of a hyperbola meet in two points at infinity, making it a single closed curve; and the two ends of a parabola meet to make it a closed curve tangent to the line at infinity. Further extension, by expanding the [[Real number|real]] coordinates to admit [[Complex number|complex]] coordinates, provides the means to see this unification algebraically.\n\n==Euclidean geometry==\nThe conic sections have been studied for thousands of years and have provided a rich source of interesting and beautiful results in [[Euclidean geometry]].\n\n===Definition===\n[[File:Conic Sections.svg|300px|right|thumb|The black boundaries of the colored regions are conic sections. Not shown is the other half of the hyperbola, which is on the unshown other half of the double cone.]]\n\nA '''conic''' is the curve obtained as the intersection of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], called the ''cutting plane'', with the surface of a double [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] (a cone with two ''nappes''). It is usually assumed that the cone is a right circular cone for the purpose of easy description, but this is not required; any double cone with some circular cross-section will suffice. Planes that pass through the vertex of the cone will intersect the cone in a point, a line or a pair of intersecting lines. These are called '''[[#Degenerate cases|degenerate conics]]''' and some authors do not consider them to be conics at all. Unless otherwise stated, \"conic\" in this article will refer to a non-degenerate conic.\n\nThere are three types of conics: the [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], and [[hyperbola]].<!-- The order ellipse/parabola/hyperbola is important in discussions and applications; please retain. --> The [[circle]] is a special kind of ellipse, although historically Apollonius considered as a fourth type. Ellipses arise when the intersection of the cone and plane is a [[closed curve]]. The circle is obtained when the cutting plane is parallel to the plane of the generating circle of the cone; for a right cone, this means the cutting plane is perpendicular to the axis. If the cutting plane is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to exactly one generating line of the cone, then the conic is unbounded and is called a ''parabola''. In the remaining case, the figure is a ''hyperbola'': the plane intersects ''both'' halves of the cone, producing two separate unbounded curves.\n\n===Eccentricity, focus and directrix===\n[[File:Eccentricity.svg|right|thumb|280px|Circle (''e''=0), ellipse (''e''=1/2), parabola (''e''=1) and hyperbola (''e''=2) with fixed focus ''F'' and directrix (''e''=\u221e).]]\nAlternatively, one can define a conic section purely in terms of plane geometry: it is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all points {{mvar|P}} whose distance to a fixed point {{mvar|F}} (called the [[focus (geometry)|'''focus''']]) is a constant multiple (called the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|'''eccentricity''']] {{mvar|e}}) of the distance from {{mvar|P}} to a fixed line {{mvar|L}} (called the '''directrix''').\nFor {{math|0 < ''e'' < 1}} we obtain an ellipse, for {{math|1=''e'' = 1}} a parabola, and for {{math|''e'' > 1}} a hyperbola.\n\nA circle is a limiting case and is not defined by a focus and directrix in the Euclidean plane. The eccentricity of a circle is defined to be zero and its focus is the center of the circle, but its directrix can only be taken as the line at infinity in the projective plane.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=13}}</ref>\n\nThe eccentricity of an ellipse can be seen as a measure of how far the ellipse deviates from being circular.\n\nIf the angle between the surface of the cone and its axis is <math>\\beta</math> and the angle between the cutting plane and the axis is <math>\\alpha,</math> the eccentricity is<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|Finney|1979|page=434}}</ref> <math>\\frac{\\cos\\alpha}{\\cos\\beta}.</math>\n\nA proof that the above curves defined by the focus-directrix property are the same as those obtained by planes intersecting a cone is facilitated by the use of [[Dandelin spheres]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=19}}; {{harvnb|Kendig|2005|pages=86, 141}}</ref>\n\n===Conic parameters===\n[[File:Ellipse parameters 2.svg|right|thumb|400px|Conic parameters in the case of an ellipse]]\n\nIn addition to the eccentricity (''e''), foci, and directrix, various geometric features and lengths are associated with a conic section. \n\nThe '''principal axis''' is the line joining the foci of an ellipse or hyperbola, and its midpoint is the curve's '''center'''. A parabola has no center. \n\nThe '''linear eccentricity''' ({{math|''c''}}) is the distance between the center and a focus.\n\nThe '''latus rectum''' is the [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] parallel to the directrix and passing through a focus; its half-length is the semi-latus rectum ({{math|''\u2113''}}).\n\nThe '''focal parameter''' ({{math|''p''}}) is the distance from a focus to the corresponding directrix.\n\nThe '''major axis''' is the chord between the two vertices: the longest chord of an ellipse, the shortest chord between the branches of a hyperbola. Its half-length is the [[semi-major axis]] ({{mvar|a}}). When an ellipse or hyperbola are in standard position as in the equations below, with foci on the {{mvar|x}}-axis and center at the origin, the vertices of the conic have coordinates {{math|(\u2212''a'', 0)}} and {{math|(''a'', 0)}}, with {{mvar|a}} non-negative.\n\nThe '''minor axis''' is the shortest chord of an ellipse, and its half-length is the semi-minor axis ({{math|''b''}}), the same value {{math|''b''}} as in the standard equation below. By analogy, for a hyperbola we also call the parameter {{math|''b''}} in the standard equation the semi-minor axis.\n\nThe following relations hold:<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|pages=13\u201316}}</ref>\n* <math>\\ \\ell = p e</math>\n* <math>\\ c = a e</math>\n* <math>\\ p+c = \\frac ae</math>\n\nFor conics in standard position, these parameters have the following values, taking <math>a ,b > 0</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! conic section\n! equation\n! eccentricity ({{math|''e''}})\n! linear eccentricity ({{math|''c''}})\n! semi-latus rectum ({{math|''\u2113''}})\n! focal parameter ({{math|''p''}})\n|-\n| [[circle]]\n|| <math>x^2+y^2=a^2 \\,</math>\n|| <math> 0 \\,</math>\n|| <math> 0 \\,</math>\n|| <math> a \\,</math>\n|| <math> \\infty</math>\n|-\n| [[ellipse]]\n|| <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</math>\n|| <math>\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}</math>\n|| <math>\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}</math>\n|| <math>\\frac{b^2}{a}</math>\n|| <math>\\frac{b^2}{\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}</math>\n|-\n| [[parabola]]\n|| <math>y^2=4ax \\,</math>\n|| <math> 1 \\,</math>\n|| N/A\n|| <math> 2a \\,</math>\n|| <math> 2a \\, </math>\n|-\n| [[hyperbola]]\n|| <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</math>\n|| <math>\\sqrt{1+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}</math>\n|| <math>\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</math>\n|| <math>\\frac{b^2}{a}</math>\n|| <math>\\frac{b^2}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</math>\n|}\n\n===Standard forms in Cartesian coordinates===\n[[File:Conic section - standard forms of an ellipse.png|thumb|280px|Standard forms of an ellipse]]\n[[File:Conic section - standard forms of a parabola.png|thumb|180px|left|Standard forms of a parabola]]\n[[File:Conic section - standard forms of a hyperbola.png|thumb|280px|Standard forms of a hyperbola]]\nAfter introducing [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]], the focus-directrix property can be used to produce the equations satisfied by the points of the conic section.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|pages=11\u201316}}</ref> By means of a change of coordinates ([[Rotation of axes#Rotation of conic sections|rotation]] and [[Translation of axes#Translation of conic sections|translation of axes]]) these equations can be put into ''standard forms''.<ref>{{harvnb|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=314\u2013328, 585\u2013589}}</ref> For ellipses and hyperbolas a standard form has the {{mvar|x}}-axis as principal axis and the origin (0,0) as center.

Formally, given any five points in the plane in [[general linear position]], meaning no three [[Line (geometry)|collinear]], there is a unique conic passing through them, which will be non-degenerate; this is true in both the Euclidean plane and its extension, the real projective plane. Indeed, given any five points there is a conic passing through them, but if three of the points are collinear the conic will be degenerate (reducible, because it contains a line), and may not be unique; see [[Degenerate conic#Points to define|further discussion]].\n\nFour points in the plane in general linear position determine a unique conic passing through the first three points and having the fourth point as its center. Thus knowing the center is equivalent to knowing two points on the conic for the purpose of determining the curve.<ref name=WW>[[William Allen Whitworth|Whitworth, William Allen]].

A point on just one tangent line is on the conic. A point on no tangent line is said to be an '''interior point''' (or '''inner point''') of the conic, while a point on two tangent lines is an '''exterior point''' (or '''outer point''').\n\nAll the conic sections share a ''reflection property'' that can be stated as: All mirrors in the shape of a non-degenerate conic section reflect light coming from or going toward one focus toward or away from the other focus. In the case of the parabola, the second focus needs to be thought of as infinitely far away, so that the light rays going toward or coming from the second focus are parallel.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|pages=36ff.}}</ref>\n\n[[Pascal's theorem]] concerns the collinearity of three points that are constructed from a set of six points on any non-degenerate conic. The theorem also holds for degenerate conics consisting of two lines, but in that case it is known as [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|Pappus's theorem]].\n\nNon-degenerate conic sections are always \"[[smoothness|smooth]]\".

Cones were constructed by rotating a right triangle about one of its legs so the hypotenuse generates the surface of the cone (such a line is called a [[wikt:generatrix|generatrix]]). Three types of cones were determined by their vertex angles (measured by twice the angle formed by the hypotenuse and the leg being rotated about in the right triangle). The conic section was then determined by intersecting one of these cones with a plane drawn perpendicular to a generatrix. The type of the conic is determined by the type of cone, that is, by the angle formed at the vertex of the cone: If the angle is acute then the conic is an ellipse; if the angle is right then the conic is a parabola; and if the angle is obtuse then the conic is a hyperbola (but only one branch of the curve).<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|1998|page=117}}</ref>\n\n[[Euclid]] (fl. 300 BCE) is said to have written four books on conics but these were lost as well.<ref>Heath, T.L., ''The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements'', Vol. I, Dover, 1956, pg.16</ref> [[Archimedes]] (died c.\u2009212 BCE) is known to have studied conics, having determined the area bounded by a parabola and a chord in ''Quadrature of the Parabola''.

This may account for why Apollonius considered circles a fourth type of conic section, a distinction that is no longer made.

In particular, Pascal discovered a theorem known as the [[hexagrammum mysticum]] from which many other properties of conics can be deduced.\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre Fermat]] both applied their newly discovered [[analytic geometry]] to the study of conics. This had the effect of reducing the geometrical problems of conics to problems in algebra. However, it was [[John Wallis]] in his 1655 treatise ''Tractatus de sectionibus conicis'' who first defined the conic sections as instances of equations of second degree.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|page=110}}</ref> Written earlier, but published later, [[Jan de Witt]]'s ''Elementa Curvarum Linearum'' starts with Kepler's [[Kinematics|kinematic]] construction of the conics and then develops the algebraic equations.

If they are bound together, they will both trace out ellipses; if they are moving apart, they will both follow parabolas or hyperbolas. See [[two-body problem]].\n\nThe reflective properties of the conic sections are used in the design of searchlights, radio-telescopes and some optical telescopes.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=27}}</ref> A searchlight uses a parabolic mirror as the reflector, with a bulb at the focus; and a similar construction is used for a [[parabolic microphone]]. The 4.2 meter [[William Herschel Telescope|Herschel optical telescope]] on La Palma, in the Canary islands, uses a primary parabolic mirror to reflect light towards a secondary hyperbolic mirror, which reflects it again to a focus behind the first mirror.\n\n==In the real projective plane==\nThe conic sections have some very similar properties in the Euclidean plane and the reasons for this become clearer when the conics are viewed from the perspective of a larger geometry. The Euclidean plane may be embedded in the [[real projective plane]] and the conics may be considered as objects in this projective geometry. One way to do this is to introduce [[homogeneous coordinates]] and define a conic to be the set of points whose coordinates satisfy an irreducible quadratic equation in three variables (or equivalently, the zeros of an irreducible [[quadratic form]]). More technically, the set of points that are zeros of a quadratic form (in any number of variables) is called a [[quadric]], and the irreducible quadrics in a two dimensional projective space (that is, having three variables) are traditionally called conics.\n\nThe Euclidean plane {{math|''R''<sup>2</sup>}} is embedded in the real projective plane by adjoining a [[line at infinity]] (and its corresponding [[Point at infinity|points at infinity]]) so that all the lines of a parallel class meet on this line. On the other hand, starting with the real projective plane, a Euclidean plane is obtained by distinguishing some line as the line at infinity and removing it and all its points.\n\n===Intersection at infinity===\nIn a [[projective space]] over any division ring, but in particular over either the real or complex numbers, all non-degenerate conics are equivalent, and thus in projective geometry one simply speaks of \"a conic\" without specifying a type. That is, there is a projective transformation that will map any non-degenerate conic to any other non-degenerate conic.<ref>{{harvnb|Artzy|2008|loc=p. 158, Thm 3-5.1}}</ref>\n\nThe three types of conic sections will reappear in the affine plane obtained by choosing a line of the projective space to be the line at infinity. The three types are then determined by how this line at infinity intersects the conic in the projective space. In the corresponding affine space, one obtains an ellipse if the conic does not intersect the line at infinity, a parabola if the conic intersects the line at infinity in one [[double point]] corresponding to the axis, and a hyperbola if the conic intersects the line at infinity in two points corresponding to the asymptotes.<ref>{{harvnb|Artzy|2008|loc=p. 159}}</ref>\n\n===Homogeneous coordinates===\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]] a conic section can be represented as:\n\n:<math>Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 +Dxz + Eyz + Fz^2 = 0. </math>\n\nOr in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation\n\n: <math>\\left(\\begin{matrix}x & y & z\\end{matrix}\\right) \\left( \\begin{matrix}A & B/2 & D/2\\\\B/2 & C & E/2\\\\D/2&E/2&F\\end{matrix}\\right) \\left(\\begin{matrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{matrix}\\right) = 0. </math>\n\nThe 3 \u00d7 3 matrix above is called ''the matrix of the conic section''.\n\nSome authors prefer to write the general homogeneous equation as\n\n:<math>Ax^2 + 2Bxy + Cy^2 +2Dxz + 2Eyz + Fz^2 = 0, </math>\n\n(or some variation of this) so that the matrix of the conic section has the simpler form,\n\n:<math>M = \\left( \\begin{matrix}A & B & D\\\\B & C & E\\\\D&E&F\\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\nbut this notation is not used in this article.<ref>This form of the equation does not generalize to fields of characteristic two (see below)</ref>\n\nIf the determinant of the matrix of the conic section is zero, the conic section is [[#degenerate conics|degenerate]].\n\nAs multiplying all six coefficients by the same non-zero scalar yields an equation with the same set of zeros, one can consider conics, represented by {{math|(''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F'')}} as points in the five-dimensional [[projective space]] <math>\\mathbf{P}^5.</math>\n\n===Projective definition of a circle===\n[[Metric space|Metrical]] concepts of Euclidean geometry (concepts concerned with measuring lengths and angles) can not be immediately extended to the real projective plane.<ref>Consider finding the midpoint of a line segment with one endpoint on the line at infinity.</ref> They must be redefined (and generalized) in this new geometry.

Since five points determine a conic, a circle (which may be degenerate) is determined by three points. To obtain the extended Euclidean plane, the absolute line is chosen to be the line at infinity of the Euclidean plane and the absolute points are two special points on that line called the [[circular points at infinity]]. Lines containing two points with real coordinates do not pass through the circular points at infinity, so in the Euclidean plane a circle, under this definition, is determined by three points that are not [[collinear]].<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3TwCIg_O2yMC&lpg=PP1&hl=cs&pg=PA72 72]}}</ref>{{rp|72}}\n\nIt has been mentioned that circles in the Euclidean plane can not be defined by the focus-directrix property.

These 5 items (2 points, 3 lines) uniquely determine the conic section.\n\n===Line conics===\nBy the [[Duality (projective geometry)|Principle of Duality]] in a projective plane, the dual of each point is a line, and the dual of a locus of points (a set of points satisfying some condition) is called an ''envelope'' of lines. Using Steiner's definition of a conic (this locus of points will now be referred to as a ''point conic'') as the meet of corresponding rays of two related pencils, it is easy to dualize and obtain the corresponding envelope consisting of the joins of corresponding points of two related ranges (points on a line) on different bases (the lines the points are on). Such an envelope is called a '''line conic''' (or '''dual conic''').\n\nIn the real projective plane, a point conic has the property that every line meets it in two points (which may coincide, or may be complex) and any set of points with this property is a point conic. It follows dually that a line conic has two of its lines through every point and any envelope of lines with this property is a line conic. At every point of a point conic there is a unique tangent line, and dually, on every line of a line conic there is a unique point called a ''point of contact''. An important theorem states that the tangent lines of a point conic form a line conic, and dually, the points of contact of a line conic form a point conic.<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3TwCIg_O2yMC&lpg=PP1&hl=cs&pg=PA48 48\u201349]}}.</ref>{{rp|48\u201349}}\n\n===Von Staudt's definition===\n{{main|Von Staudt conic}}\n[[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] defined a conic as the point set given by all the absolute points of a [[Pole and polar|polarity]] that has absolute points. Von Staudt introduced this definition in ''Geometrie der Lage'' (1847) as part of his attempt to remove all metrical concepts from projective geometry.\n\nA '''polarity''', {{pi}}, of a projective plane, {{mvar|''P''}}, is an involutory (i.e., of order two) [[bijection]] between the points and the lines of {{mvar|''P''}} that preserves the [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence relation]]. Thus, a polarity relates a point {{mvar|''Q''}} with a line {{mvar|''q''}} and, following [[Gergonne]], {{mvar|''q''}} is called the '''polar''' of {{mvar|''Q''}} and {{mvar|''Q''}} the '''pole''' of {{mvar|''q''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=60}}</ref> An '''absolute point''' ('''line''') of a polarity is one which is incident with its polar (pole).<ref>Coxeter and several other authors use the term ''self-conjugate'' instead of absolute.</ref>\n\nA von Staudt conic in the real projective plane is equivalent to a [[Steiner conic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=80}}</ref>\n\n===Constructions===\nNo continuous arc of a conic can be constructed with straightedge and compass. However, there are several straightedge-and-compass constructions for any number of individual points on an arc.\n\nOne of them is based on the converse of Pascal's theorem, namely, ''if the points of intersection of opposite sides of a hexagon are collinear, then the six vertices lie on a conic.'' Specifically, given five points, {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E''}} and a line passing through {{mvar|E}}, say {{math|{{overline|''EG''}}}}, \\a point {{mvar|F}} that lies on this line and is on the conic determined by the five points can be constructed. Let {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} meet {{math|{{overline|''DE''}}}} in {{mvar|L}}, {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}} meet {{math|{{overline|''EG''}}}} in {{mvar|M}} and let {{math|{{overline|''CD''}}}} meet {{math|{{overline|''LM''}}}} at {{mvar|N}}.

Divide the side {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}} into {{mvar|n}} equal segments and use parallel projection, with respect to the diagonal {{math|{{overline|''AC''}}}}, to form equal segments on side {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} (the lengths of these segments will be {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} times the length of the segments on {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}}). On the side {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}} label the left-hand endpoints of the segments with {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''A''<sub>n</sub>}} starting at {{mvar|B}} and going towards {{mvar|C}}. On the side {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} label the upper endpoints {{math|''D''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''D''<sub>n</sub>}} starting at {{mvar|A}} and going towards {{mvar|B}}. The points of intersection, {{math|{{overline|''AA''}}<sub>i</sub> \u2229 {{overline|''DD''}}<sub>i</sub>}} for {{math|1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''n''}} will be points of the ellipse between {{mvar|A}} and {{math|''P''(0, ''b'')}}. The labeling associates the lines of the pencil through {{mvar|A}} with the lines of the pencil through {{mvar|D}} projectively but not perspectively. The sought for conic is obtained by this construction since three points {{math|''A'', ''D''}} and {{mvar|P}} and two tangents (the vertical lines at {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|D}}) uniquely determine the conic. If another diameter (and its conjugate diameter) are used instead of the major and minor axes of the ellipse, a parallelogram that is not a rectangle is used in the construction, giving the name of the method. The association of lines of the pencils can be extended to obtain other points on the ellipse. The constructions for hyperbolas<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|page=14}}</ref> and parabolas<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|page=19}}</ref> are similar.\n\nYet another general method uses the polarity property to construct the tangent envelope of a conic (a line conic).<ref>{{harvnb|Akopyan|Zaslavsky|2007|page=70}}</ref>\n\n==In the complex projective plane==\n\nIn the complex plane '''C<sup>2</sup>''', ellipses and hyperbolas are not distinct: one may consider a hyperbola as an ellipse with an imaginary axis length. For example, the ellipse <math>x^2+y^2=1</math> becomes a hyperbola under the substitution <math>y=iw,</math> geometrically a complex rotation, yielding <math>x^2-w^2=1</math>. Thus there is a 2-way classification: ellipse/hyperbola and parabola. Extending the curves to the complex projective plane, this corresponds to intersecting the [[line at infinity]] in either 2 distinct points (corresponding to two asymptotes) or in 1 double point (corresponding to the axis of a parabola); thus the real hyperbola is a more suggestive real image for the complex ellipse/hyperbola, as it also has 2 (real) intersections with the line at infinity.\n\nFurther unification occurs in the [[complex projective plane]] '''CP<sup>2</sup>''': the non-degenerate conics cannot be distinguished from one another, since any can be taken to any other by a [[projective linear transformation]].\n\nIt can be proven that in '''CP<sup>2</sup>''', two conic sections have four points in common (if one accounts for [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]), so there are between 1 and 4 [[B\u00e9zout's theorem|intersection]] points. The intersection possibilities are: four distinct points, two singular points and one double point, two double points, one singular point and one with multiplicity 3, one point with multiplicity 4. If any intersection point has multiplicity > 1, the two curves are said to be [[tangent]]. If there is an intersection point of multiplicity at least 3, the two curves are said to be [[osculating curve|osculating]]. If there is only one intersection point, which has multiplicity 4, the two curves are said to be ''superosculating''.<ref>{{Citation |first=E.

If the intersection point is double, the line is a [[tangent line]].\nIntersecting with the line at infinity, each conic section has two points at infinity. If these points are real, the curve is a [[hyperbola]]; if they are imaginary conjugates, it is an [[ellipse]]; if there is only one double point, it is a [[parabola]]. If the points at infinity are the [[cyclic points]] {{math|(1, ''i'', 0)}} and {{math|(1, \u2013''i'', 0)}}, the conic section is a [[circle]]. If the coefficients of a conic section are real, the points at infinity are either real or [[complex conjugate]].\n\n{{anchor|Degenerate conics}}\n\n==Degenerate cases==\n{{details|Degenerate conic}}\n\nWhat should be considered as a '''degenerate case''' of a conic depends on the definition being used and the geometric setting for the conic section. There are some authors who define a conic as a two-dimensional nondegenerate quadric. With this terminology there are no degenerate conics (only degenerate quadrics), but we shall use the more traditional terminology and avoid that definition.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane, using the geometric definition, a degenerate case arises when the cutting plane passes through the [[wikt:apex|apex]] of the cone.\nThe degenerate conic is either: a [[point (geometry)|point]], when the plane intersects the cone only at the apex; a [[straight line]], when the plane is tangent to the cone (it contains exactly one generator of the cone); or a pair of intersecting lines (two generators of the cone).<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=6}}</ref> These correspond respectively to the limiting forms of an ellipse, parabola, and a hyperbola.\n\nIf a conic in the Euclidean plane is being defined by the zeros of a quadratic equation (that is, as a quadric), then the degenerate conics are: the [[empty set]], a point, or a pair of lines which may be parallel, intersect at a point, or coincide. The empty set case may correspond either to a pair of [[complex conjugate]] parallel lines such as with the equation <math>x^2+1=0,</math> or to an ''imaginary ellipse'', such as with the equation <math>x^2 +y^2+1=0.</math> An imaginary ellipse does not satisfy the general definition of a [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degeneracy]], and is thus not normally considered as degenerated.<ref>Korn, G. A., & Korn, T. M., ''Mathematical Handbook for Scientists and Engineers: Definitions, Theorems, and Formulas for Reference and Review'' ([[Mineola, New York|Mineola, NY]]: [[Dover Publications]], 1961), [https://books.google.com/books?id=A4XCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA42 p. 42].</ref> The two lines case occurs when the quadratic expression factors into two linear factors, the zeros of each giving a line. In the case that the factors are the same, the corresponding lines coincide and we refer to the line as\na ''double'' line (a line with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] 2) and this is the previous case of a tangent cutting plane.\n\nIn the real projective plane, since parallel lines meet at a point on the line at infinity, the parallel line case of the Euclidean plane can be viewed as intersecting lines. However, as the point of intersection is the apex of the cone, the cone itself degenerates to a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], i.e. with the apex at infinity. Other sections in this case are called ''cylindric sections''.<ref>{{cite web | title=MathWorld: Cylindric section| url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricSection.html}}</ref> The non-degenerate cylindrical sections are ellipses (or circles).\n\nWhen viewed from the perspective of the complex projective plane, the degenerate cases of a real quadric (i.e., the quadratic equation has real coefficients) can all be considered as a pair of lines, possibly coinciding. The empty set may be the line at infinity considered as a double line, a (real) point is the intersection of two [[complex conjugate line]]s and the other cases as previously mentioned.\n\nTo distinguish the degenerate cases from the non-degenerate cases (including the empty set with the latter) using matrix notation, let {{math|''\u03b2''}} be the determinant of the 3\u00d73 matrix of the conic section\u2014that is, {{math|1=''\u03b2 '' = (''AC'' \u2212 {{sfrac|''B''<sup>2</sup>|4}})''F'' + {{sfrac|''BED'' \u2212 ''CD''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''AE''<sup>2</sup>|4}}}}; and let {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = ''B''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 4''AC''}} be the discriminant. Then the conic section is non-degenerate if and only if {{math|''\u03b2'' \u2260 0}}.  If {{math|1=''\u03b2 ''= 0}} we have a point when {{math|''\u03b1'' < 0}}, two parallel lines (possibly coinciding) when {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = 0}}, or two intersecting lines when {{math|''\u03b1'' > 0}}.<ref>{{citation|last=Lawrence|first=J.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=3TwCIg_O2yMC&lpg=PP1&hl=cs&pg=PA64 64]}}.</ref>{{rp|64}} The four common points are called the ''base points'' of the pencil. Through any point other than a base point, there passes a single conic of the pencil. This concept generalizes a [[pencil of circles]].\n\nIn a [[projective plane]] defined over an [[algebraically closed field]] any two conics meet in four points (counted with multiplicity) and so, determine the pencil of conics based on these four points. Furthermore, the four base points determine three line pairs ([[degenerate conic]]s through the base points, each line of the pair containing exactly two base points) and so each pencil of conics will contain at most three degenerate conics.<ref>{{harvnb|Samuel|1988|loc=pg. 50}}.</ref>\n\nA pencil of conics can represented algebraically in the following way. Let {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} be two distinct conics in a projective plane defined over an algebraically closed field {{math|''K''}}. For every pair {{math|''\u03bb'', ''\u03bc''}} of elements of {{math|''K''}}, not both zero, the expression:\n\n::<math>\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2</math>\n\nrepresents a conic in the pencil determined by {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}}. This symbolic representation can be made concrete with a slight abuse of notation (using the same notation to denote the object as well as the equation defining the object.) Thinking of {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}}, say, as a ternary [[quadratic form]], then {{math|1=''C''<sub>1</sub> = 0}} is the equation of the \"conic {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}}\". Another concrete realization would be obtained by thinking of {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} as the [[#Homogeneous coordinates|3\u00d73 symmetric matrix]] which represents it. If {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} have such concrete realizations then every member of the above pencil will as well. Since the setting uses homogeneous coordinates in a projective plane, two concrete representations (either equations or matrices) give the same conic if they differ by a non-zero multiplicative constant.\n\n== Intersecting two conics ==\nThe solutions to a system of two second degree equations in two variables may be viewed as the coordinates of the points of intersection of two generic conic sections.\nIn particular two conics may possess none, two or four possibly coincident intersection points.\nAn efficient method of locating these solutions exploits the homogeneous [[matrix representation of conic sections]], i.e. a 3x3 [[symmetric matrix]] which depends on six parameters.\n\nThe procedure to locate the intersection points follows these steps, where the conics are represented by matrices:\n* given the two conics <math>C_1</math> and <math>C_2</math>, consider the pencil of conics given by their linear combination <math>\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2.</math>\n* identify the homogeneous parameters <math>(\\lambda,\\mu)</math> which correspond to the degenerate conic of the pencil. This can be done by imposing the condition that <math>\\det(\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2) = 0</math> and solving for <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math>. These turn out to be the solutions of a third degree equation.\n* given the degenerate conic <math>C_0</math>, identify the two, possibly coincident, lines constituting it.\n* intersect each identified line with either one of the two original conics; this step can be done efficiently using the dual conic representation of <math>C_0</math>\n* the points of intersection will represent the solutions to the initial equation system.\n\n==Generalizations==\nConics may be defined over other fields (that is, in other [[pappian plane|pappian geometries]]).  However, some care must be used when the field has [[Characteristic (field)|characteristic]] 2, as some formulas can not be used. For example, the matrix representations used [[#General Cartesian form|above]] require division by 2.\n\nA generalization of a non-degenerate conic in a projective plane is an [[oval (projective plane)|oval]]. An oval is a point set that has the following properties, which are held by conics: 1) any line intersects an oval in none, one or two points, 2) at any point of the oval there exists a unique tangent line.\n\nGeneralizing the focus properties of conics to the case where there are more than two foci produces sets called [[generalized conic]]s.\n\n==In other areas of mathematics==\nThe classification into elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic is pervasive in mathematics, and often divides a field into sharply distinct subfields. The classification mostly arises due to the presence of a quadratic form (in two variables this corresponds to the associated [[discriminant]]), but can also correspond to eccentricity.\n\nQuadratic form classifications:\n;[[Quadratic form]]s: Quadratic forms over the reals are classified by [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], namely by their positive index, zero index, and negative index: a quadratic form in ''n'' variables can be converted to a [[diagonal form]], as <math>x_1^2+x_2^2+\\cdots+x_k^2-x_{k+1}^2-\\cdots-x_{k+\\ell}^2,</math> where the number of +1 coefficients, ''k,'' is the positive index, the number of \u22121 coefficients, ''\u2113'', is the negative index, and the remaining variables are the zero index ''m,'' so <math>k+\\ell+m=n.</math> In two variables the non-zero quadratic forms are classified as:\n:* <math>x^2+y^2</math> \u2013 positive-definite (the negative is also included), corresponding to ellipses,\n:* <math>x^2</math> \u2013 degenerate, corresponding to parabolas, and\n:* <math>x^2-y^2</math> \u2013 indefinite, corresponding to hyperbolas.\n:In two variables quadratic forms are classified by discriminant, analogously to conics, but in higher dimensions the more useful classification is as ''definite,'' (all positive or all negative), ''degenerate,'' (some zeros), or ''indefinite'' (mix of positive and negative but no zeros). This classification underlies many that follow.\n;Curvature: The [[Gaussian curvature]] of a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] describes the infinitesimal geometry, and may at each point be either positive \u2013 [[elliptic geometry]], zero \u2013 [[Euclidean geometry]] (flat, parabola), or negative \u2013 [[hyperbolic geometry]]; infinitesimally, to second order the surface looks like the graph of <math>x^2+y^2,</math> <math>x^2</math> (or 0), or <math>x^2-y^2</math>. Indeed, by the [[uniformization theorem]] every surface can be taken to be globally (at every point) positively curved, flat, or negatively curved. In higher dimensions the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] is a more complicated object, but [[manifolds with constant sectional curvature]] are interesting objects of study, and have strikingly different properties, as discussed at [[sectional curvature]].\n;Second order PDEs: [[Partial differential equation]]s (PDEs) of [[Partial differential equation#Equations of second order|second order]] are classified at each point as elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic, accordingly as their second order terms correspond to an elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic quadratic form. The behavior and theory of these different types of PDEs are strikingly different \u2013 representative examples is that the [[Poisson equation]] is elliptic, the [[heat equation]] is parabolic, and the [[wave equation]] is hyperbolic.\n\n[[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Analogous classifications|Eccentricity classifications]] include:\n;[[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s: Real M\u00f6bius transformations (elements of [[PSL2(R)|PSL<sub>2</sub>('''R''')]] or its 2-fold cover, [[SL2(R)|SL<sub>2</sub>('''R''')]]) are [[M\u00f6bius transformation#Classification|classified]] as elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic accordingly as their half-trace is <math>0\\leq |\\operatorname{tr}|/2 < 1,</math> <math>|\\operatorname{tr}|/2 = 1,</math> or <math>|\\operatorname{tr}|/2 > 1,</math> mirroring the classification by eccentricity.\n;[[Variance-to-mean ratio]]: The variance-to-mean ratio classifies several important families of [[discrete probability distribution]]s: the constant distribution as circular (eccentricity 0), [[binomial distribution]]s as elliptical, [[Poisson distribution]]s as parabolic, and [[negative binomial distribution]]s as hyperbolic. This is elaborated at [[Cumulant#Cumulants of some discrete probability distributions|cumulants of some discrete probability distributions]].\n\n[[File:conic section interactive visualisation.svg|thumb|In [[Special:Filepath/Conic section interactive visualisation.svg|this interactive SVG]], move left and right over the SVG image to rotate the double cone]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Circumconic and inconic]]\n* [[Conic Sections Rebellion]], protests by Yale university students\n* [[Director circle]]\n* [[Elliptic coordinate system]]\n* [[Equidistant set]]\n* [[Nine-point conic]]\n* [[Parabolic coordinates]]\n* [[Quadratic function]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |author1=Akopyan, A.V.  |author2=Zaslavsky, A.A. | title=Geometry of Conics | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-8218-4323-9 }}\n* {{citation|first=Rafael|last=Artzy|authorlink=Rafael Artzy|title=Linear Geometry|year=2008|origyear=1965|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-46627-9}}\n* {{citation|first=Carl B.|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=History of Analytic Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2T4i5fXZbOYC&printsec=frontcover|publisher=Dover|year=2004|origyear=1956|isbn=978-0-486-43832-0}}\n* {{citation|first1=David A.|last1=Brannan|first2=Matthew F.|last2=Esplen|first3=Jeremy J.|last3=Gray|title=Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q49lhAzXTFEC&printsec=frontcover|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59787-6}}\n* {{citation|first=H.S.M.|last=Coxeter|authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|title=Projective Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjAAI4FW0tsC&printsec=frontcover|publisher=Blaisdell|year=1964|isbn=9780387406237}}\n* {{citation|first=H.S.M.|last=Coxeter|title=The Real Projective Plane|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=1993}}\n* {{citation|first=J.W.|last=Downs|title=Practical Conic Sections: The geometric properties of ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PE7CAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover|year=2003|origyear=1993|publisher=Dover|isbn=0-486-42876-1}}\n* {{citation|first=Howard|last=Eves|authorlink=Howard Eves|title=A Survey of Geometry (Volume One)|year=1963|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|place=Boston}}\n* {{citation|first=Erich|last=Hartmann|title=Planar Circle Geometries, an Introduction to Moebius-, Laguerre- and Minkowski Planes|url=http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~ehartmann/circlegeom.pdf|accessdate= 20 September 2014}} (PDF; 891&nbsp;kB).\n* {{citation|first=Victor J.|last=Katz|authorlink=Victor J.

He represented [[Kent County Cricket Club]] and is a former member of the [[England cricket team|England]] [[Test cricket|Test match]] and [[One Day International]] sides.\n\nA right-handed [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsmen or openers|opening batsman]], Key made appearances at age-group level for Kent from the age of eleven, moving up until he made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut in 1998. He made eight first-class and 4 List A appearances for England's youth sides, and was a member of the side which won the [[Under 19 Cricket World Cup#1998|1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup]]. Following a season of heavy run-scoring, Key was called up to the [[England Lions cricket team|England A]] side in 1999.\n\nFollowing an injury to [[Marcus Trescothick]], Key made his Test debut against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 2002. He toured Australia during the [[2002\u201303 Ashes series]], where he justified his selection ahead of a more experienced player. His One Day International debut came in 2003, against [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], however he was dropped from both squads shortly after. Injury to [[Mark Butcher]] allowed Key back into the England side for the series against [[West Indies cricket team|the West Indies]] in 2004. He scored his maiden Test [[Century (cricket)|hundred]] in the first match of the series, which later became his maiden first-class double century as he scored 221. This performance, coupled with the 93 he scored in the third Test, earned him recognition as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year]]. Key's last Test matches came during England's tour of South Africa during 2004&ndash;05, where he managed to score 152&nbsp;runs without being consistent, and despite a one-match return during the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20]], he has remained on the fringes of selection.\n\nKey became Kent captain following the [[2006 English cricket season]], following [[David Fulton (cricketer)|David Fulton]]'s resignation. He led Kent to a County Championship 2nd Division Championship title in 2010, two [[Twenty20 Cup]] Finals Day appearances and a [[Friends Provident Trophy]] final. He resigned as Kent captain following the [[2012 English cricket season]] and [[James Tredwell]] became club captain. Key only had one season off as captain as Tredwell then himself resigned and Key was named as his replacement, captaining the county for another two years until the end of the 2015 season.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/24911757|title=Rob Key replaces James Tredwell as captain|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nKey was a regular commentator on [[Sky Sports]] TV's coverage of county cricket while still a player at Kent.

He represented [[Kent County Cricket Club]] and is a former member of the [[England cricket team|England]] [[Test cricket|Test match]] and [[One Day International]] sides.\n\nA right-handed [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsmen or openers|opening batsman]], Key made appearances at age-group level for Kent from the age of eleven, moving up until he made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut in 1998. He made eight first-class and 4 List A appearances for England's youth sides, and was a member of the side which won the [[Under 19 Cricket World Cup#1998|1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup]]. Following a season of heavy run-scoring, Key was called up to the [[England Lions cricket team|England A]] side in 1999.\n\nFollowing an injury to [[Marcus Trescothick]], Key made his Test debut against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 2002. He toured Australia during the [[2002\u201303 Ashes series]], where he justified his selection ahead of a more experienced player. His One Day International debut came in 2003, against [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], however he was dropped from both squads shortly after. Injury to [[Mark Butcher]] allowed Key back into the England side for the series against [[West Indies cricket team|the West Indies]] in 2004. He scored his maiden Test [[Century (cricket)|hundred]] in the first match of the series, which later became his maiden first-class double century as he scored 221. This performance, coupled with the 93 he scored in the third Test, earned him recognition as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year]]. Key's last Test matches came during England's tour of South Africa during 2004&ndash;05, where he managed to score 152&nbsp;runs without being consistent, and despite a one-match return during the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20]], he has remained on the fringes of selection.\n\nKey became Kent captain following the [[2006 English cricket season]], following [[David Fulton (cricketer)|David Fulton]]'s resignation. He led Kent to a County Championship 2nd Division Championship title in 2010, two [[Twenty20 Cup]] Finals Day appearances and a [[Friends Provident Trophy]] final. He resigned as Kent captain following the [[2012 English cricket season]] and [[James Tredwell]] became club captain. Key only had one season off as captain as Tredwell then himself resigned and Key was named as his replacement, captaining the county for another two years until the end of the 2015 season.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/24911757|title=Rob Key replaces James Tredwell as captain|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nKey was a regular commentator on [[Sky Sports]] TV's coverage of county cricket while still a player at Kent.
