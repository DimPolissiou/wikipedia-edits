at 330 pounds at birth. He was born on October 13, 2010, at Loro Parque. His mother, eight-year-old Kohana, showed no maternal interest in him at birth. As a result, Ad\u00e1n had to be bottle fed by staff until May 2011 when he was permanently moved onto fish. He had one little sister called Victoria, with whom Ad\u00e1n was very close to until her death. Ad\u00e1n spends a lot of time with the park's young female, Morgan.\n\nAd\u00e1n is a result of inbreeding between Kohana and Keto. Ad\u00e1n's only full-blooded sibling, Victoria, died in 2013. Ad\u00e1n has been introduced to all five orcas living in Loro Parque.\n\n====Amaya====\nAmaya is a female orca born on December 2, 2014, at SeaWorld San Diego. Her mother is Kalia and her father is Ulises. Amaya was Kalia's first calf. Amaya was confirmed a female on December 13. Kasatka was there to assist Kalia during the birth alongside Makani and Nakai (Kasatka's calves).  Amaya was born tail first and was a length of 6.5 feet and a weight of 350 pounds at birth.

She has also \"adopted\" some of the whales she has been with. She has been a surrogate mother to Sumar, Splash, Orkid, and Keet.

In 1982, Katina was moved to SeaWorld Ohio in [[Aurora, Ohio]] with another female named [[Kasatka]], with whom she was captured in 1978. For two years, the two would perform in the Ohio park during the summer months and then be moved back to San Diego for the winter.

Soon after, she was moved back to Sea World Ohio for the summer. The [[animal training|trainer]]s soon realized she was pregnant, so she was moved to Orlando at the end of the summer season, where she gave birth on September 26, 1985, to a female who was named [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]]. Although ten orca calves had been born in captivity prior to Kalina, none had survived past a few weeks. Kalina was the first orca calf to be successfully born and raised in captivity. Kalina was taken from her mother at 4 years 5 months and conducted on a trip around all four SeaWorld parks.<ref>[http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/orcareport.pdf \"Captive Orcas 'Dying to Entertain You'\"], Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society.

After an incident in which a trainer died he moved to a SeaWorld park. Kyuquot was very close to his mother, who died in 2001. Over time, Ky became very close to several females who came to Texas, but is now often grouped with his half-brother, Tuar.\n\nHe used to perform waterworks, though after several incidents, he was not allowed to anymore. Ky is a very large male and can still do many athletic behaviors such as front flips. He is the largest orca at San Antonio, weighing over 9,000 pounds and over 22 ft long. He is a reliable whale and is most often grouped with Tuar, though he likes spending time with Takara and can be seen with any of his pod mates.

Lolita is the oldest orca ever in captivity. She was a member of the L [[Cetacea|pod]]. Researchers believe she is the only living offspring of matriarch L-25 \"Ocean Sun\". When she was about five years old, she was captured on August 8, 1970, at Penn Cove, [[Puget Sound]], off the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The Penn Cove Capture became controversial due to the large number of wild orcas that were taken (seven) and the number of deaths that resulted: four juveniles died, as well as one adult female who drowned when she became tangled in a net while attempting to reach her calf.\n\nWhen she first arrived at Miami Seaquarium, Lolita was put in the 'Whale Bowl'. Miami Seaquarium had another orca, Hugo, who lived in a different tank, called the 'Celebrity Bowl', which now houses manatees. The two orcas would vocalize to each other, and Hugo was later moved into the Whale Bowl with Lolita. At first, they were aggressive with each other, but then became more compatible with each other and more aggressive towards their trainers. Lolita and Hugo mated several times, and it was reported that Lolita was pregnant from this. However, she never delivered a live offspring. Lolita has not seen another orca since Hugo died in 1980. She vocalizes in captivity, in the unique calls used only by her pod. When played recordings of her wild family members, she responded. She is still apparently healthy. She is a large orca, measuring {{convert|22|ft}} long and weighing {{convert|7800|lb}}. This makes her one of the largest female orcas in captivity. Lolita currently lives in the Miami Seaquarium's Whale and Dolphin Stadium, where she performs 1\u20132 shows daily, and shares her tank with four Pacific White-Sided dolphins. Despite her size, her tank is the smallest orca habitat in the United States, measuring 35 feet wide and 80 feet long. Lolita is the subject of the documentary ''Lolita: Slave to Entertainment'' released in 2008.<ref>[http://www.orcanetwork.org/captivity/lolitatoday.html \"Lolita's Life Today\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216034307/http://orcanetwork.org/captivity/lolitatoday.html |date=February 16, 2009 }} Orca Network.

Marineland confirmed that his name will not be changed. It is also confirmed that Ulises of SeaWorld San Diego is the father. The calf was conceived via artificial insemination.<ref name=\"moana_birth\"/>\n\nMoana became a big brother when his mother gave birth to Keijo on November 20, 2013.\n\n====Morgan====\n{{Main|Morgan (orca)}}\nMorgan was rescued from the [[Wadden Sea]] on June 23, 2010. The estimated 1.5 year-old orca was alone, malnourished and underweight. She was transferred to [[#Dolfinarium Harderwijk|Dolfinarium Harderwijk]] where she was taken care of for several months. After it became clear she couldn't been released into the wild, the Dolfinarium searched for another facility to take care of her, because their basins were too small. Morgan moved to [[#Loro Parque|Loro Parque]] on November 29, 2011. In 2012, Loro Parque announced there was a good possibility that Morgan is partially deaf. In December 2017, Loro Parque announced Morgan was pregnant with her first calf.\n\n====Nakai====\n[[File: Nakai Slideout.jpg|thumb|Nakai doing a slideout behavior during orca encounter]]\nOn September 1, 2001, Nakai was born to [[#Kasatka|Kasatka]], with [[#Tilikum|Tilikum]] being the father.

Nakai's dorsal fin is nearly {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall and is slightly leaning to the left. The right side of his tail fluke is curved under but the left side  has yet to curve.\n\n====Nalani====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Nalani Orca.jpg|thumb|Nalani performing with Trua in the all new show at Seaworld Orlando One Ocean]]\nNalani is orca the gender female who currently resides to SeaWorld Orlando, where she was born on September 18, 2006. Her parents are [[Katina (whale)|Katina]] and [[Taku (whale)|Taku]] (who is, due to inbreeding, also her brother). She is Katina's sixth calf, and was Taku's second. She is a very loving and curious youngster, but was very dependent on her mother in the first few years.  She is learning fast, as she is used in shows regularly alongside Trua, Malia, Kayla, and Katina. An easy way to identify Nalani is how plump she is. She's grown to be bulky, like her mom, has round eyepatches, her dorsal fin has started to lean to her left side, and is the longest baby at Sea World Orlando.\n\n====Orkid====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nOrkid was born September 23, 1988, in SeaWorld San Diego, California. Orkid's parents are Kandu V (her mother), and Orky II (her father). She was the first killer whale born in the San Diego Sea World Park successfully. Orky II died only three days after Orkid was born. She was named Orkid, in memory of her father (most likely a combination of \"Orky\" and \"kid\"). In August 1989, Kandu V charged Corky II during a live show. The blow broke Kandu V's jaw, and severed an artery in Kandu's head; apparently in an act of trying to assert her dominance over Corky II. As a result, she began spouting blood with every breath she took. Forty five minutes later Kandu V sank to the bottom of the pool and died, bleeding to death. Orkid witnessed this; for weeks after the incident, she would circle the tanks calling out and vocalizing. However, she was raised by Corky, and later befriended a male named Splash. Orkid has been artificially inseminated many times, but has never gotten pregnant. Orkid is highly intelligent (having been affectionately nicknamed by trainers the \"Rocket Scientist\") and knows hundreds of behaviors. Only the most senior trainers are to work with her, as she has shown aggression toward trainers in the past. After an incident in 2006 where she dragged a trainer to the bottom of the show pool, Orkid has been barred from performing waterworks with trainers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Sakari====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nSakari was born on January 7, 2010, at Sea World San Antonio. Her mother is Takara and her father is [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]]. Siblings on her mother's side include Kohana, Trua and Kamea. \"Sakari\" is an Inuit language word meaning \"sweet\".\n\n====Shouka====\nBorn on February 25, 1993, in Antibes, France, to Sharkan and Kim 2, the female killer whale's first nine years were spent with her parents and siblings. In 2002, she was moved to [[Geauga Lake|Six Flags Worlds of Adventure]] (former [[SeaWorld Ohio]]) in Aurora, Ohio, near Cleveland. After [[Geauga Lake|Worlds of Adventure]] was sold, in 2004 Shouka was moved to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (Marine World Africa USA) in Vallejo, California. She was the only orca at the park but had bottlenose dolphin companions named Merlin and Cupid for 7 years until they were relocated due to compatibility concerns. In July 2012, Shouka began to display aggressive behavior during one of her performances. She lifted a trainer into the air and knocked her trainer back into an open door area that leads to the back of the stage. Even after the trainer was gone, Shouka leaped two more times onto the stage. Six Flags moved Shouka to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] the next month in August 2012, where Corky immediately took her under her wing. She is currently fully integrated into the pod of ten killer whales and is a highly athletic animal who enjoys working with her trainers.  Shouka is known for her bottlenose dolphin vocalizations and for her unique upward-curving tail flukes, which she has had since birth.\n\n====Takara====\nTakara (Japanese for \"treasure\") was born on July 9, 1991, at SWC to Kasatka and Kotar. She was the second \"Baby Shamu\" born at SWC, after Orkid in 1988. She gave birth to her first calf, a female named Kohana on May 3, 2002. Kasatka was by her side during the labor and she and Takara helped assist Kohana to the surface to take her first breath. She was conceived via artificial insemination, the father being [[Tilikum (killer whale)|Tilikum]], a deceased bull orca who had been living on the other side of the country at [[SeaWorld Orlando]]. Takara is an average sized female measuring {{Convert|17.3|ft|adj=on}}, and weighs 5,100 LBs.\n\nTakara and Kohana were transferred to SeaWorld Orlando in 2004. A year later, Takara gave birth to her second calf, a male named [[Trua]], fathered by [[Taku (whale)|Taku]]. Kohana was later transferred out of Sea World Orlando to [[Loro Parque]], a Spanish amusement park in the [[Canary Islands]].\n\nTakara was transferred to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in February 2009 in a supposed effort to improve space at SeaWorld Orlando. The move angered many since it separated her from her son, Trua.  However, other SeaWorld visitors and workers reported that she would often act aggressively toward Trua. It was later confirmed she was pregnant at the time (again from Tilikum). On January 7, 2010, Takara gave birth to another female calf in the main tank of the \"Shamu Theatre\" at Sea World San Antonio. On March 16, 2010, she was named Sakari, which is an [[Inuit]] word for \"sweet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orcahome.de/orcasnews.htm|title=Orca News|website=www.orcahome.de}}</ref> Takara became a grandmother on October 12, 2010, when her calf Kohana gave birth to her first calf Ad\u00e1n on October 12, 2010.

Takara delivered her fourth calf on December 6, 2013, at 12:08 am Central Time. The calf is a healthy female named Kamea. She gave birth to her 5th calf (and SeaWorld's last breeding calf), a female named [[#Kyara|Kyara]], on April 19, 2017 at 2:33 PM(CST).

Chimo was the only partially albino orca ever exhibited in captivity. Years before her capture, another pure white orca was spotted in what is suspected to be the same pod, and named \"Alice\". Alice was never captured, and vanished in the 1960s. Chimo was captured when trying to find a mate for the park's star attraction, Haida. Chimo's probable mother was another orca by the name of Scarredjaw Cow (T3). She was captured alongside Chimo. Chimo died in 1972 from complications caused by [[Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome]], the syndrome which caused her [[albinism]]. Chimo never bore any calves.[1]\n\n====Freya====\nFreya was a 35-year-old female orca who lived at [[Marineland of Antibes]]. She was captured in October 1982 alongside Haida II, Kim II, Nootka IV, and an unnamed male. She and Kim went to Marineland Antibes from Hafnarfjordur Aquarium. She became the first European orca to become pregnant. Freya gave birth in March 1991 to a stillborn calf. She gave birth to another stillborn in March 1993. Sometime between this calf and her next, Freya had a tumor removed, leaving a white indent on her side. Freya gave birth to Valentin on February 13, 1996. In March 2001, Freya had yet another stillborn calf. In April 2003, Freya gave birth to her final calf and her fourth stillborn. She ceased to become pregnant due to birth control and the death of her mate Kim II in 2005. Freya was very depressed, but Valentin usually was able to cheer her up. Freya became a grandmother on November 20, 2013, when Valentin fathered a calf named Keijo, however, since the calf's mother Wikie was Valentin's half-sister, Valentin being the father has not been confirmed. After months of fighting an unknown illness, Freya lost her battle on June 20, 2015, leaving behind her son Valentin and likely grandson Keijo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedodo.com/32-year-old-orca-dead-after-nearly-a-lifetime-in-captivity-1210225849.html|title=32-Year-Old Orca Dead After Nearly A Lifetime In Captivity|first=Solon|last=Kelleher|date=June 21, 2015|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/64495333845/photos/a.65539343845.70470.64495333845/10153465214633846/?type=1&theater|title=MARINELAND|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>\n\n====Gudrun====\nGudrun (Goo drun) was an Icelandic female [[orca]] who lived at [[Dolfinarium Harderwijk]] in the [[Netherlands]]<ref name=Dolfinarium2008>Website Dolfinarium, Downloaded on November 5, 2008, from [http://www.dolfinarium.nl/index.php?do=content&id=210 Dolfinarium.nl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403221958/http://www.dolfinarium.nl/index.php?do=content&id=210 |date=April 3, 2009 }}</ref> and at [[SeaWorld]] [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] in Florida. Gudrun was caught close to the coast of Iceland on October 25, 1976. She was kept in captivity in the Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands, where she was the main attraction. In 1987, Gudrun was moved to [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in Florida, United States. Gudrun gave birth to [[Taima (whale)|Taima]] on July 11, 1989, at 16:45 EST during a thunderstorm. Gudrun gave birth to Nyar on December 31, 1993. Nyar suffered with illness often. She was so both mentally and physically ill, it was reported that Gudrun tried to drown her during several shows. Nyar died at the age of two years in April 1996. On February 21, 1996, Gudrun went into labor with her last calf, which was fathered by Tilikum. After 20 hours of labor, Gudrun was unable to deliver the calf. Eventually after the physical intervention of park staff, Gudrun delivered a stillborn calf of underermined sex. Due to complications from the delivery, she died four days later.\n\nIn 1982, Gudrun was the subject of an experiment in two-communications, designed to see if she could learn new words and incorporate them into her vocabulary.<ref>[http://phinventory.whale-web.com/downloads/gudrun.pdf \"An experiment in two-way communication in Orcinus orca L.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106143230/http://phinventory.whale-web.com/downloads/gudrun.pdf |date=January 6, 2009 }} Phinventory.

Initially named Peanuts, she was moved to the [[Windsor Safari Park]], where she was to stay until being moved to [[Ocean Park Hong Kong]] early in 1979, and where she was renamed Suzie Wong. Due to a dispute between [[SeaWorld]] and the safari park, she was transferred to Clacton Pier in August 1978 for the remainder of her training.

The captured whales were kept at Pender Harbour for some weeks before being transferred, and Natsidalia did not survive. Hyak was transferred to the [[Vancouver Aquarium]], where he was kept with Skana, an orca captured the previous year. After Skana died in 1980, the aquarium purchased four new orcas captured in Iceland, and two of them\u2014Finna and Bjossa\u2014were transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium. Hyak and Bjossa produced a calf in 1987, but it only survived a short time.

After a short stay at the Saedrysafnid Aquarium he arrived at Marineland Ontario in Canada on November 15, 1986. He did not settle in well at his new home, was hard to train, and did not get on well with his fellow orca tankmates. So Junior was put in a small tank in Marineland's warehouse, with no natural sunlight or air, and with noisy overhead fans. From time to time he shared his small tank with several dolphins. Marineland tried to keep Junior's conditions a secret, but members of the public released photos and films. Junior died in 1994.\n\n====K1/Taku====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nK1 was also named Taku. He was captured in August 1973 in Pedder Bay, British Columbia. While several other orcas that were caught with him were sold to other marine parks, K1 was too big to be sold. He was released on October 27, 1973, with a radio tag attached to his dorsal fin. Two nicks were cut by {{Citation needed span|text=Dr Michael Bigg|reason=specific person mentioned, should have a citation|date=January 2014}} into his dorsal fin to make it easier to identify and find him. He was given the adoption name of Taku. K1 reunited with his pod and was seen many times.  K1 disappeared in 1997 and was presumed to have died at the age of 41, as his year of birth was believed to be 1955. K1 was a full blooded Southern Resident orca. He was {{Convert|23|ft|m|sp=us}} long.\n\n====Kalina====\nKalina (September 26, 1985 \u2013 October 4, 2010) was the first captive-born orca calf to survive more than a few days. Kalina's mother is an Icelandic female named [[Katina (whale)|Katina]], and her father, [[Ramu III (Winston)|Winston]] (also known as Ramu III) was a Pacific Southern Resident, making Kalina an Atlantic/Pacific hybrid \u2013 a unique situation that would not have occurred in the wild. Kalina measured {{convert|17|ft|9|in}} and weighed approximately {{convert|6300|lb}}.\n\nKalina first appeared in shows at SeaWorld Orlando in 1986, billed as \"Baby [[Shamu]]\", performing with her mother. On February 12, 1990, Kalina was transferred to SeaWorld Ohio. She was moved again in October of that year to SeaWorld San Diego, and again on May 30, 1991, to SeaWorld San Antonio. In October 1994, Kalina was moved back to SeaWorld Orlando, where she lived with eight other killer whales, including her mother and a half sister.\n\nKalina gave birth to her first calf, a male named [[#Keet|Keet]], on February 2, 1993, at [[Sea World Texas]]. Kalina was only seven and a half years old at the time of Keet's birth \u2013 an extremely young age for an orca to become a mother. Kalina became pregnant again shortly after Keet's birth, and was moved back to SeaWorld Orlando in October 1994, where she gave birth to her second calf, another male, [[Keto (killer whale)|Keto]] on June 17, 1995. She gave birth to another male, Tuar, on June 22, 1999. Kalina bore her fourth calf and first daughter, on February 9, 2004, named Skyla. Skyla is now at Loro Parque along with Keto. Kalina was a gentle whale, learned quickly, and was used a lot in shows. She was used as a \"starter whale\" for new trainers. On Monday October 4, 2010, less than four months after Taima's death, Kalina died of preacute [[bacteremia]] [[sepsis]] at the age of 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/features_lifestyle_animal/2010/10/seaworlds-killer-whale-kalina-dies-unexpectedly.html |title=SeaWorld's killer whale Kalina dies unexpectedly |work=blogs.orlandosentinel.com |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=October 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006225536/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/features_lifestyle_animal/2010/10/seaworlds-killer-whale-kalina-dies-unexpectedly.html |archivedate=October 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> She has since become a great-grandmother with the birth of Amaya in December 2014.\n\n====Kandu V====\nKandu V was a dominant female Icelandic orca, caught in 1977 and kept at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California|California]].

When captured, he was about {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}} and weighed about {{convert|2600|lb}}, which made him about 4\u20135 years old. His mother is thought to be T7. He was sent to [[Sealand of the Pacific]], Victoria, and then sold to Marineland, Canada. In January 1987, he was sold and moved to [[SeaWorld Orlando]].\n\nWhile at Marineland of Canada, he did 'water work' with his trainers, but once at SeaWorld he was described as a \"moody and unpredictable\" whale and the 'water work' was stopped. At SeaWorld Orlando, Kanduke often fought with a younger Icelandic male named Kotar. The aggression became increasingly serious. After an incident in which Kotar bit Kanduke's [[penis]] and caused an infection and show cancellations, the exhibitors decided to move the smaller whale to the newly opened SeaWorld San Antonio. On September 20, 1990, Kanduke died of St. Louis encephalitis, which is transmitted by mosquitoes.<ref>Kirby, David. ''Death at Seaworld: Shamu and the Dark Side of Killer Whales in Captivity''. St. Martin's Press, New York, 2012</ref> The cause of his death was later determined using information from his [[necropsy]] report provided by the Freedom of Information Act. This disease is non-existent in wild killer whales because they don't spend enough time on the surface for mosquitoes to bite them. However, in captivity, the behavior of \"logging\" (i.e. just floating at the surface) puts killer whales at risk for mosquito-borne illnesses. Kanduke has since become a grandfather with the births of Sumar, Tekoa, and Malia.\n\n====Kasatka====\n[[Image:Shamu with trainer.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Kasatka at SeaWorld San Diego lifting a trainer out of the water]]\n{{Main|Kasatka}}\n\nKasatka was a 41-year-old female orca who lived at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] and the mother of Takara, Nakai, Kalia and Makani.

Her parents were Kenau and Orky II, both deceased. Kayla was about {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} long and weighed about {{convert|6200|lb}}. Kayla lived with her mother for the first two and a half years of her life. Kenau was moved to SeaWorld Orlando in January 1991, and Kayla was moved to SeaWorld Ohio in April 1991. Kayla lived there for the next eight years with another young female, named Katerina, who was three weeks older than she was. After Katerina was moved out, an older female named Winnie was moved in.\n\nIn November 1999, Kayla and Winnie were both transferred to SeaWorld San Antonio. Kayla and Winnie joined a female named Haida II and her son [[Kyuquot (killer whale)|Kyuquot]]. A young male named Keto arrived in March 2001. Haida II died on August 1 of that year, making Winnie the new dominant female. Winnie died on April 11, 2002. Kayla became the new dominant orca in the stadium and was until her relocation to Orlando in 2006. After the death of Winnie, only three whales were left in the park: Kayla, Kyuquot, and Keto. A young female by the name of [[Unna (whale)|Unna]] was moved to the park in December 2002 to settle down Kyuquot and Keto, because the two maturing males were constantly fighting over Kayla. In November 2006, Kayla was transferred to Sea World Orlando leaving behind a mate [[#Keet|Keet]], and their daughter Halyn was raised by Unna immediately after Kayla's transfer. Once Kayla arrived, she immediately gave up her dominant role to Katina, who has been the dominant female there since 1988. In spring 2007, Kayla miscarried a male calf, likely the son of Keet.\n\nKayla gave birth to her first calf on October 9, 2005, a female named Halyn. Halyn was moved to a special animal care facility to be hand raised. Halyn lived in Animal Care in a different part of the park, and in May joined her family at [[Shamu]] Stadium.

Keiko was captured near [[Iceland]] in 1979 and sold to the Icelandic aquarium in [[Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]]. Three years later, he was sold to Marineland of Canada, where he first started performing for the public and developed skin [[lesion]]s indicative of poor health. He was then sold to [[Reino Aventura]] (now named [[Six Flags Mexico]]), an [[amusement park]] in Mexico City, in 1985. He was the star of the movie ''[[Free Willy]]'' in 1993.\n\nThe publicity from his role in ''Free Willy'' led to an effort by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studio]] to find him a better home. Donations from the studio and [[Craig McCaw]] led to the establishment of the Free Willy Keiko Foundation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keiko.com/|title=Campaigns \u2013 Keiko Whale Rescue|website=www.keiko.com}}</ref> in February 1995. With donations from the foundation and millions of school children, the [[Oregon Coast Aquarium]] in [[Newport, Oregon]] spent over US$7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of returning him to the wild. He was airlifted by [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] to his new home on January 7, 1996, with a length of {{convert|24|ft|m|1}} and weighing {{convert|3500|kg|lb}}. During his years in Oregon, he gained over a [[ton]] in weight.\n\nOn September 9, 1998, he was flown to Klettsvik Bay in [[Vestmannaeyjar]] in Iceland, and gradually reintroduced to the wild, returning to the open sea in July 2002.

He was then sold to Marineland Antibes with Freya for reproduction. He sired many calves : Shouka, Inouk, Wikie and Valentin. Kim II was 6,3m long and weighted 5 tons. He was very close to his daughter Shouka but she was sent to Six Flags, later to SeaWorld San Diego. Kim II died on November 23, 2005, of pneumonia.\n\n====Kyara====\nKyara was a female orca, that was born at SeaWorld San Antonio on April 19, 2017. Her mother was [[#Takara|Takara]] and her father [[#Kyuquot|Kyuquot]], with Kyara's name being a combination of her parents names. Due to SeaWorld ending its orca breeding program, Kyara was the last orca to be born in its parks. On July 22 it was announced that she was showing signs of pneumonia. Because of this, she had been moved to SeaWorld's animal care hospital for treatment. She died on July 24, 2017.<ref name=\"herfamily.ie\"/>\n\n====Moby Doll====\n{{Main|Moby Doll}}\nMoby Doll was the second captive orca displayed in a public aquarium exhibit. The 15-foot (4.6m) long, 1-ton male was captured in 1964 near East Point, Saturna Island in British Columbia after being harpooned and shot. He was towed to Vancouver and displayed publicly until he died three months after his capture. Moby Doll was popular locally and abroad and scientists took advantage of this first opportunity to study an orca and orca sounds up close.<ref>\"A listing of dolphin/whale captures...\" at [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/etc/cron.html pbs.org]</ref>\n\n====Namu====\n{{Main|Namu (orca)}}\nNamu was only the third orca captured and displayed in an aquarium exhibit, and was the subject of [[Namu, the Killer Whale|a film]] that changed some people's attitudes toward orcas. In June 1965, William Lechkobit found a 22-foot (6.7m) male orca in his floating salmon net that had drifted close to shore near [[Namu, British Columbia]].

He and a capture mate Yaka were sold to a place called [[Marine World/Africa USA]] in California. The two orcas joined another female Kianu who had been at the park since 1968. Kianu wanted Nepo all to herself and she would attack Yaka whenever the other female was with Nepo. Nepo, who was very close to Yaka, protected her from Kianu's attacks. It got so bad that Kianu was transferred to a park in Japan. Nepo and Yaka continued to bond and even starred in the 1977 horror film ''[[Orca (movie)|Orca]]''. Nepo died from [[pneumonia]] on July 10, 1980. Yaka stayed by his side as he took his final breaths. Even when trainers arrived to take Nepo's body away, Yaka refused to leave him, and it took the trainers a while to separate the whales. Nepo was about 15 years old.\n\n====Nyar====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nNyar was born at SeaWorld Orlando Florida on New Year's Eve (December 31) 1993. She was born to parents Gudrun and Tilikum. Nyar suffered from many health problems. Sometimes trainers would have to separate Gudrun and Nyar because the mother would try to drown her daughter. They had some bonding moments together. Nyar was not able to perform in shows as she was a very slow learner. She was even put with her father Tilikum sometimes. He was very gentle with her. Nyar died on April 1, 1996. She was 2 years 4 months and 1 day old. The cause of death was Immune System Failure. The name \"Nyar\" (spelled N\u00fd\u00e1r in Icelandic) means \"New Year\" .\n\n====Orky II====\nOrky II was captured in April 1968 off of Pender Harbor,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N0JHLOQKomAC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=orky+2+pendor+harbor#v=onepage&q=orky+2+pendor+harbor&f=false|title=Death at SeaWorld: Shamu and the Dark Side of Killer Whales in Captivity|first=David|last=Kirby|date=July 17, 2012|publisher=Macmillan|via=Google Books|isbn=9781250002020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/orky2.html |title=Cetacean Cousins: Orky II profile |date=n.d. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220100134/http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/orky2.html |archive-date=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-27/local/me-2544_1_killer-whales|title=Orky, Oldest Killer Whale in Captivity, Dies|first=LINDA ROACH|last=MONROE|date=September 27, 1988|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref> is well remembered as the father of Orkid and Kayla. He spent many of his years in captivity at Marineland of the Pacific. Corky II accompanied him, and the two were thought to be cousins, as they were both from the same pod. He fathered all seven of Corky II's unsuccessful calves, too. Orky was transferred to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] California along with Corky II in the year 1986. There, he was soon put to the bottom of the dominancy ladder. Orky was involved in one trainer incident in 1987, where he accidentally breached on a miscue and landed on a trainer (John Sillick) while the trainer was riding Corky II as a stunt.\n\nWhile in service to Sea World, Orky mated with two of their females, Kandu V and Kenau. Kandu bore her first successful calf, Orkid, three days before he died on September 26, 1988. She was named in his memory: Orky's Kid. About two months later, Kenau also gave birth to her calf, another female who was later named Kayla. Orky's death was brought on by acute pneumonia and chronic wasting, which meant he lost a lot of weight before he died. His [[dorsal fin]] flopped completely over to his right rather than the left. His pectorals were huge and his flukes were curled completely. His enormous size can be seen in both of his daughters, who have grown up to be quite large females. Orky's only living (captive) relatives are Orkid and Kayla. At one time Orky was actually called \"Snorky\". At almost 22 feet long and 11,000 pounds, he was one of the largest whales ever held in any aquarium.\n\n====Samoa====\n{{Main|Samoa (orca)}}\nSamoa was a female captured off Iceland in 1983. Samoa was reported to have died due to complications of giving birth. However, her necropsy revealed she had a rare [[Saksenaea vasiformis]] fungal infection which likely caused the stillbirth and her death.<ref>http://withoutmethereisnou.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/the-truth-behind-samoas-death-captivity-disease-not-found-in-wild-orcas/</ref> On March 14, 1992, while held at [[SeaWorld Texas]], Samoa went into premature labour, and died giving birth to a female calf a few hours later. The calf was stillborn. It was the first reported death of a SeaWorld orca while giving birth. The age of Samoa at the time of her death was estimated to be 12\u201314.\n\n====Shamu====\n{{Main|Shamu}}\nCaptured by Ted Griffin in [[Puget Sound]] in 1965, Shamu was intended to be a companion for the orca Namu in Griffin's Seattle aquarium. Shamu was, however, quickly leased and eventually sold to [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. She performed in several SeaWorld shows and eventually died on August 23, 1971. The name Shamu has since been used for many different orcas in SeaWorld shows.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Sandra |date=2014 |title=Puget Sound Whales for Sale |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=The History Press}}</ref>\n\n====Skana====\nSkana was one of the first pod of Orcas captured, on February 15, 1967, in [[Yukon Harbor]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The entire [[K Pod|Southern Resident K Pod]], at that time 15 members, was captured.  Three died during capture, and five were transferred to the [[Seattle Marine Aquarium (Closed in 1977)]] for sale, including Skana, Ramu I and Kandu I.  The others were released.  Skana was believed to be six years old at the time of her capture.  She was sold and transferred to the [[Vancouver Aquarium]] on March 10, 1967. She was by herself in Vancouver until the end of 1968, when the recently captured [[#Hyak|Hyak II]] arrived. She died on October 5, 1980, at the approximate age of 19 years, from a mycotic infection.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://cetacousin.bplaced.net/orca/profile/skana.html \n |title=About Skana \n |work=cetacousin.bplaced.net \n |accessdate=July 25, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312083838/http://cetacousin.bplaced.net/orca/profile/skana.html \n |archivedate=March 12, 2010 \n |df=mdy-all \n}}</ref>\n\n====Splash====\nSplash was born in 1989 in Marineland in Canada, transferred to SeaWorld San Diego at the age of 3 and died there in 2005.

Unlike most orcas, he was born head first. He earned his name just for the holiday. Spooky was in good health at first, but it wasn't to last. Due to the circular tank the orcas were kept in, Corky had trouble nursing her son. Trainers took over and bottle fed Spooky hoping to help him survive. Spooky died 11 days later on November 10, 1978, from pneumonia and colitis. Spooky's breed was 100% Northern Resident orca.\n\n====Sumar====\nSumar (May 14, 1998 \u2013 September 7, 2010) was a male orca born at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]]. His mother was [[Taima (whale)|Taima]] and he was her first calf. Just six months after birth, an incident happened when, during a show, his mother attacked him, pushing him against the glass, trying to make him fall. The crowd was evacuated and the show canceled. The [[animal trainer|trainers]] tried to move Taima to another tank and finally separated her from her son. Since then, the two of them have been always separated and [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]] and [[Katina (whale)|Katina]] became his surrogate mothers until he was transferred to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California|California]] on March 8, 1999. Afterwards, he spent a few months at now-closed [[SeaWorld Ohio]] before being transferred back to the San Diego park.\n\nHe was considered very gentle with other orcas<ref name=\"SanDiego\">\n{{cite web\n |title=Deaths of marine mammals hit staffers especially hard \n |publisher=Union-Tribune Publishing Co.

At the time of his death he was one of three males at the park, and was seen as a possible breeding male in the future; Nakai, the younger male, is still too young to breed, and the older male Ulises seems to have a low sperm count. Sumar was approaching full size for a typical bull orca when he died: his dorsal fin was more and more leaning to its left and his flukes were beginning to curl under. He was about 4.6 m (17&nbsp;feet) long and weighed around {{convert|5300|lb}}. He was often used for shows in the park.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/beyondtheblue/sumar.htm \"Sumar\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009062626/http://www.freewebs.com/beyondtheblue/sumar.htm |date=October 9, 2008 }} Beyond the Blue.

Trainers noticed that the whale was not feeling well on Monday, September 6, 2010, which resulted in veterinarians being notified, blood samples drawn, and antibiotics administered. Despite measures taken by Sumar's veterinarian team, Sumar became increasingly ill by Tuesday. He died shortly before 1:45 PM (Pacific time). Sumar's death prompted the canceling of the park's orca shows for the day. His death was determined to be as a result of a twisted intestinal tract (intestinal volvulus). He was set to be the next captive breeding bull orca, after his father [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]].\n\n====Taima====\nTaima (pronounced Ty-EE-Ma) (July 11, 1989 \u2013 June 6, 2010) was a transient/Icelandic hybrid female orca who lived at [[Sea World Orlando]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]]. Her name purportedly comes from a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or Icelandic language, and means \"crash of thunder\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babynamespedia.com/meaning/Taima/f|title=Taima \u2013 Meaning of Taima, What does Taima mean? girl name|website=www.babynamespedia.com}}</ref> She was born tail-first around 16:45 [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] during a thunderstorm. <!-- Unfortunately, there is a conflict beetween if Taima means crash of thunder in the Icelandic or Native American language. Please do not remove/change unless the issue is solved.-->\n\nTaima was born to mother [[Gudrun (whale)|Gudrun]] and father [[Kanduke]]. In 1990, Kanduke died at the age of 20 from St. Louis encephalitis; Gudrun gave birth to Taima's half-sister Nyar in 1993. Nyar suffered frequent illness and it was reported that Gudrun tried to drown her during several shows. Trainers believe that this confused Taima, as she witnessed this and thought this was how to raise a calf. She was later reported to have performed this on her own calves, Sumar, Tekoa, and Malia. Gudrun died in 1996 from [[stillbirth]] complications, and Nyar died from an illness a few months later in April.\n\nOn May 14, 1998, Taima gave birth to a male calf named Sumar. They were separated when he was about eight months old because of the aggression between them. On one occasion while performing, Taima started biting Sumar, and throwing him out of the pool, onto the [[animal trainer|trainer]]'s platform. She then slid out herself and started biting him. The show was stopped, and Taima was pulled to the other swimming pool. A few months later Sumar was transferred to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California|California]].\n\nOn November 8, 2000, at 3:47 pm, Taima gave birth to a male named Tekoa. He began feeding overnight and was estimated to be 7 feet (2.2 m) long and weigh {{convert|350|lb}}. During the birth, [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]] assisted Taima and helped the calf to the surface for its first breath. Tekoa was sent to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in 2004, and was later sent to [[Loro Parque]] in [[Tenerife]] in February 2006, where he remains today. After Tekoa's attack, Taima was separated from all other whales except Tilikum, until she gave birth again to her first daughter Malia in 2007, on March 12.  \"At birth Malia (Hawaiian for \"calm and peaceful\") measured about 6 feet and weighed in at around 350 pounds. Her father is Tilikum.\"<ref name=\"orcahome.de\"/> Seaworld announced on May 18, 2010, that Taima was pregnant again.\n\nTaima died from complications to a stillborn male calf on June 6, 2010. Preliminary indications suggested that her death was caused by ''[[placenta previa]]'', a condition in which the placenta is delivered before the calf.\n\n====Taku====\nTaku (September 9, 1993 \u2013 October 17, 2007) was a male orca, who was born at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]]. After birth, Taku spent most of his time with his mother [[Katina (whale)|Katina]] or Nyar, his younger half-sister. Three years later, Katina gave birth again to a female, [[Unna]]. On August 25, 2002, Katina gave birth to her fifth calf: a male, [[Ikaika (killer whale)|Ikaika]]. Unna was later moved to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in December 2002. Afterwards, Ikaika and Taku bonded to the point where Ikaika swam in mother-calf-position with Taku. On November 18, 2006, Taku was moved to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] whereas Ikaika was moved to Marineland of Canada in Ontario.\n\nTakara soon became pregnant. On November 23, 2005, around 21:50 EST (4:50 PM), Takara went into labor with her second calf. Her daughter Kohana was at her side. Thirty-two minutes later around 22:22 EST (5:22 PM), Takara gave birth to a male calf (Taku's son/first calf) who was later to be named [[Trua]]. Taku sired another calf in 2006 with his mother Katina \u2013 Nalani, who was also his sister and the first surviving inbred calf.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/taku.html |title=Cetacean Cousins: Taku profile |date=n.d. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116101433/http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/taku.html |archive-date=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nTaku died unexpectedly on October 17, 2007, at the age of 14 and weighing over {{convert|7000|lb}} and at {{convert|22|ft}} long.

His first son, Kyuquot, was born to Haida II on December 24, 1991. Just a few months prior to the birth of Kyuquot, Tilikum was involved in the first incident involving a death. Seaworld requested an emergency transfer of Tilikum to their facility. Tilikum was moved to SeaWorld Orlando, Florida, on January 9, 1992. Sealand of the Pacific closed soon thereafter.\n\nFollowing his arrival at SeaWorld, Tilikum sired many calves with many different females. His first calf born in Orlando was to Katina. Katina gave birth to Taku on September 9, 1993. Taku died on October 17, 2007.\n\nTilikum's other calves are: Nyar (born 1993, died 1996), Unna (1996\u20132015), Sumar (1998\u20132010), Tuar (1999), Tekoa (2000), Nakai (2001), Kohana (2002), Ikaika (2002), Skyla (2004), Malia (2007), Sakari (2010) and Makaio (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://captivecetaceans-tragicallysad.blogspot.com/2014/03/challenging-things-seaworld-say_5.html|title=Captive Cetaceans Tragically Sad: Blackfish lies \u2013 Debunking Seaworld's website announcement|first=Captive Cetaceans|last=Tragicallysad|date=March 5, 2014|publisher=}}</ref>  On January 6, 2017, SeaWorld announced that Tilikum had died early in the morning of bacterial pneumonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wfla.com/2017/01/06/seaworld-announces-death-of-orca-whale-tilikum/|title=SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died|first=|last=|date=January 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wfla.com/2017/01/06/seaworld-announces-death-of-orca-whale-tilikum/|title=SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died|first=Associated|last=Press|date=January 6, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Unna====\nUnna was a female orca. She was born on December 27, 1996, at SeaWorld Orlando. Her parents were [[Katina (whale)|Katina]] (mother) and [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]]. She was Katina's fourth calf and Tilikum's seventh (fourth successful), and was the second calf to be born to the pair. Unna lived with her mother, father, siblings, and other whales at her birthplace in Orlando for the first six years of her life.\nIn December 2002, Unna was transferred to SeaWorld San Antonio. In late April 2006, Unna gave birth to a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] calf.

She came to [[Marine World Africa USA]] located in Redwood City California in December 1969 together with male [[List of captive orcas#Nepo|Nepo]] after being captured off the coast of British Columbia. Nepo and Yaka starred in the 1977 horror film [[Orca (movie)|Orca]]. Nepo died in July 1980, leaving Yaka alone. In November 1980, the Icelandic female killer whale Vigga became her tank mate. Yaka was 10 years older than Vigga. They made the move together when the park relocated to Vallejo, California, in 1986. Vigga died 3 years after Yaka in August 2000.\n\nYaka was a member of the [[A5 Pod]], as is [[Corky (killer whale)|Corky]].\n\n'''Juliet/malyshka'''\n\nShe lives in Moscow dolphinarium and aquarium Russia (is from Russia).

He was born on October 13, 2010, at Loro Parque. His mother, eight-year-old Kohana, showed no maternal interest in him at birth. As a result, Ad\u00e1n had to be bottle fed by staff until May 2011 when he was permanently moved onto fish. He had one little sister called Victoria, with whom Ad\u00e1n was very close to until her death. Ad\u00e1n spends a lot of time with the park's young female, Morgan.\n\nAd\u00e1n is a result of inbreeding between Kohana and Keto. Ad\u00e1n's only full-blooded sibling, Victoria, died in 2013. Ad\u00e1n has been introduced to all five orcas living in Loro Parque.\n\n====Amaya====\nAmaya is a female orca born on December 2, 2014, at SeaWorld San Diego. Her mother is Kalia and her father is Ulises. Amaya was Kalia's first calf. Amaya was confirmed a female on December 13. Kasatka was there to assist Kalia during the birth alongside Makani and Nakai (Kasatka's calves).  Amaya was born tail first and was a length of 6.5 feet and a weight of 350 pounds at birth. Amaya now weighs 2,400 pounds.  Amaya is 93.75% Icelandic and 6.25% southern resident. Amaya is a very energetic and playful whale and spends a lot of time with her mom and with some of the younger whales such as Makani. Amaya is very cooperative.\n\n====Corky====\n{{Main|Corky (killer whale)}}\n[[File:Orcas at SeaWorld show.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Corky performing at SeaWorld, San Diego, California]]\nCorky is a 55-year-old female orca at [[SeaWorld San Diego]].

However, the two orcas who she was captured with died after three years and she spent most of her time at Marineland with an orca bull named Orky. Corky has been pregnant seven times, resulting in four live births from 1977 to 1985 (with two failures in 1986 and 1987), none of which survived the first two months of life.<ref name=\"foreverseaworld.yolasite.com\">{{cite web|title=Forever Seaworld|url=http://www.foreverseaworld.yolasite.com/san-diego-orcas.php|website=foreverseaworld.yolasite.com|publisher=Forever Seaworld|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn January 21, 1987, during her seventh pregnancy, she and Orky were moved to SeaWorld San Diego. She settled well in the new environment, but she had problems with one of the Icelandic orcas, Kandu V. The two females fought for dominance and it peaked during a show in 1989, resulting in Kandu's death. Corky is also used as the \"Welcome Whale\" for new trainers and new orcas. She has also \"adopted\" some of the whales she has been with. She has been a surrogate mother to Sumar, Splash, Orkid, and Keet. Corky is easy to identify, mostly because of her large size for a female, her tall unbent dorsal fin, the small 'chips' in her dorsal fin, and a nick in her left dorsal fluke.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.orcahome.de/swprofiles2.pdf</ref> She also has experienced problems in aggression from a male named Ulises. \"At SeaWorld, Ulises is dominant over some of the female orcas, especially the oldest female, Corky.

In 1982, Katina was moved to SeaWorld Ohio in [[Aurora, Ohio]] with another female named [[Kasatka]], with whom she was captured in 1978. For two years, the two would perform in the Ohio park during the summer months and then be moved back to San Diego for the winter. Finally, in 1984, Katina was transferred to the SeaWorld in Orlando.\n\nKatina became pregnant in early spring of 1984 at SeaWorld San Diego from a male named [[Ramu III (Winston)|Winston]]. Soon after, she was moved back to Sea World Ohio for the summer. The [[animal training|trainer]]s soon realized she was pregnant, so she was moved to Orlando at the end of the summer season, where she gave birth on September 26, 1985, to a female who was named [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]]. Although ten orca calves had been born in captivity prior to Kalina, none had survived past a few weeks. Kalina was the first orca calf to be successfully born and raised in captivity. Kalina was taken from her mother at 4 years 5 months and conducted on a trip around all four SeaWorld parks.<ref>[http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/orcareport.pdf \"Captive Orcas 'Dying to Entertain You'\"], Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society.

Katina bore her second calf on November 4, 1988, a female named Katerina. In early 1991 at a very early age Katerina was transferred out of Orlando. Katerina died on May 5, 1999, at SeaWorld San Antonio at 10.5 years of age. A male named [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]] came to SeaWorld in January 1992. It wasn't long before Katina was pregnant again. She gave birth to her first son on September 9, 1993, named Taku. Katina's next calf came on December 27, 1996, a female named [[Unna (whale)|Unna]]. Her fifth calf was a male born on August 25, 2002, named Ikaika. Katina gave birth to her sixth calf, a female named Nalani, on September 18, 2006. She gave birth to her seventh calf, a male named Makaio on October 9, 2010, at 7:28&nbsp;p.m. The great-grandmother went into labor at 6:47&nbsp;p.m. and delivered a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}}-long, 350-pound male calf.

His parents are [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]] and [[Kotar (whale)|Kotar]]. Keet currently measures about {{convert|19|ft}} and weighs {{convert|7000|lb}}. Keet is also known as Grandbaby Shamu because his mother is the first orca to be born and raised under human care successfully.\n\nWhen he was 1 year and 8 months of age, his mother was moved to [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]] to support her next pregnancy, Keet's brother [[Keto (killer whale)|Keto]] was born in 1995. [[Katerina (killer whale)|Katerina]], his aunt, was moved in from [[SeaWorld Ohio]]. In 1995, his father, Kotar, died. On May 5, 1999, Katerina died. Five months later, two females named Kayla and Winnie were moved in. In November 1999, he was moved to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California|California]]. There, he met his brother, [[Keto (killer whale)|Keto]], and his playmate, [[Sumar (whale)|Sumar]]. All three whales were moved to SeaWorld Ohio in February 2000. On February 15, 2001, Keet was returned to California; Sumar followed three days later, while Keto was relocated to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|Texas]]. Keet's best friends were the bull Ulises and a maturing male named [[Splash (whale)|Splash]]. On April 24, 2004, Keet was moved to his birthplace, meeting [[Kyuquot (killer whale)|Kyuquot]], [[Unna (whale)|Unna]], Kayla, [[Keto (killer whale)|Keto]], Tuar, and [[Tekoa (killer whale)|Tekoa]].\n\nKeet is a gentle and agile performer. On December 21, 2004, he became a father for the first time when [[Kalia (killer whale)|Kalia]], his daughter, was born at [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. On October 9, 2005, his mate Kayla gave birth to his second daughter Halyn, at SeaWorld San Antonio. He may have fathered Unna's stillborn in April 2006 and Kayla's miscarriage in spring 2007. Keet may have fathered the possible 2 extra pregnancies of Unna claimed by Bridgette Pirtle. Keet was the lowest ranking adult orca in the dominance chain at SeaWorld Texas. He is very sweet and was often used as a \"starter whale\" for new trainers along with a younger male named Tuar. On June 15, 2008, SeaWorld announced Halyn died unexpectedly; a necropsy was performed and the test results have been announced.<ref name=\"WOAI\"/>\n\nKeet moved back to Seaworld San Diego on February 27, 2012, and he has been reunited with three of his old friends Corky, Ulises and Orkid.

Initial reports said that Kshamenk, along with three members of his pod, had stranded and been \"rescued\" by [[Mundo Marino]]. However, it was later revealed that Mundo Marino had \"force stranded\" the whales by placing a large net between the whales and the shore. When the tide went out, the whales were left stranded on the beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://keiko.com/alert3_history.html|title=Campaigns \u2013 Keiko Whale Rescue|website=keiko.com}}</ref> One was released, one died on the way to the aquarium, one beat himself to death on the walls of his enclosure, and one, Kshamenk, survived.<ref name=\"facebook.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/SaveKshamenk/info|title=Save Kshamenk|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>\n\nWhen Kshamenk arrived at Mundo Marino he was kept with a female orca, \"Belen.\" They performed in the orca show together for eight years.

Belen died shortly after in February 2000, leaving Kshamenk alone.<ref name=\"facebook.com\"/> After a veterinary evaluation in 2006, Kshamenk was considered non-releasable.\n\nIn November 2001 [[Geauga Lake|Six Flags Worlds of Adventure]], located in [[Aurora, Ohio]], filed a request to import Kshamenk with the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]. 35 anti-captivity organizations including, the Wild Earth Foundation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wefdirector.wixsite.com/weforg|title=WEF Wild Earth Foundation|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WEForg/|title=WEF Wild Earth Foundation|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> [[Humane Society of the United States]], [[Cetacean Society International]], and [[Earth Island Institute]], opposed the transfer of Kshamenk in favor of his rehabilitation and release. In July 2002 the Secretary of the Environment of Argentina and CITES Argentina denied the request of Mundo Marino to export the whale. In Argentina, it is illegal to export native fauna, and as a wild born orca, Kshamenk is a part of the commonwealth.\n\nKshamenk still resides at Mundo Marino.

His parents are Tilikum and Haida II, he was born on Christmas Eve in 1991, at Sealand Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nKy only lived here for a short amount of time. After an incident in which a trainer died he moved to a SeaWorld park. Kyuquot was very close to his mother, who died in 2001. Over time, Ky became very close to several females who came to Texas, but is now often grouped with his half-brother, Tuar.\n\nHe used to perform waterworks, though after several incidents, he was not allowed to anymore. Ky is a very large male and can still do many athletic behaviors such as front flips. He is the largest orca at San Antonio, weighing over 9,000 pounds and over 22 ft long. He is a reliable whale and is most often grouped with Tuar, though he likes spending time with Takara and can be seen with any of his pod mates. On April 19, 2017, Takara gave birth to Kyara, and after Kyara died at 3 months old, it was announced that DNA tests showed that Kyuquot was her father.\n\n====Lolita====\n{{Main|Lolita (orca)}}\nLolita (Low lita), originally known as Tokitae (Toh-kih-tay), is an orca at the [[Miami Seaquarium]]. Lolita is the oldest orca ever in captivity. She was a member of the L [[Cetacea|pod]]. Researchers believe she is the only living offspring of matriarch L-25 \"Ocean Sun\". When she was about five years old, she was captured on August 8, 1970, at Penn Cove, [[Puget Sound]], off the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The Penn Cove Capture became controversial due to the large number of wild orcas that were taken (seven) and the number of deaths that resulted: four juveniles died, as well as one adult female who drowned when she became tangled in a net while attempting to reach her calf.\n\nWhen she first arrived at Miami Seaquarium, Lolita was put in the 'Whale Bowl'. Miami Seaquarium had another orca, Hugo, who lived in a different tank, called the 'Celebrity Bowl', which now houses manatees. The two orcas would vocalize to each other, and Hugo was later moved into the Whale Bowl with Lolita. At first, they were aggressive with each other, but then became more compatible with each other and more aggressive towards their trainers. Lolita and Hugo mated several times, and it was reported that Lolita was pregnant from this. However, she never delivered a live offspring. Lolita has not seen another orca since Hugo died in 1980. She vocalizes in captivity, in the unique calls used only by her pod. When played recordings of her wild family members, she responded. She is still apparently healthy. She is a large orca, measuring {{convert|22|ft}} long and weighing {{convert|7800|lb}}. This makes her one of the largest female orcas in captivity. Lolita currently lives in the Miami Seaquarium's Whale and Dolphin Stadium, where she performs 1\u20132 shows daily, and shares her tank with four Pacific White-Sided dolphins. Despite her size, her tank is the smallest orca habitat in the United States, measuring 35 feet wide and 80 feet long. Lolita is the subject of the documentary ''Lolita: Slave to Entertainment'' released in 2008.<ref>[http://www.orcanetwork.org/captivity/lolitatoday.html \"Lolita's Life Today\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216034307/http://orcanetwork.org/captivity/lolitatoday.html |date=February 16, 2009 }} Orca Network.

His name was decided by a poll with three names to vote for on [[SeaWorld Orlando]]'s official Facebook page. The names were Nico, Greek for \"Victory\", Makaio, the Hawaiian form of the name Matthew, meaning \"Gift of God,\" or Haruki, Japanese for \"Shining Brightly.\" Makaio was the name chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationthemepark.com/2011/01/makaio-seaworlds-baby-killer-whale-gets-a-name/ |title=Makaio: SeaWorld's Baby Killer Whale Gets A Name|date=January 14, 2011|author=Donna |accessdate=2015-06-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071941/http://www.destinationthemepark.com/2011/01/makaio-seaworlds-baby-killer-whale-gets-a-name/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He can be seen in SeaWorld's new killer whale show One Ocean.\n\n====Makani====\nKasatka's fourth calf is a male, born on Valentine's Day 2013 at 6:33&nbsp;a.m. His name was chosen by a poll. The choices were \"Hako\", Norse for \"chosen son\", \"Valentino\", Italian for \"strong\", and \"Makani\", Hawaiian for \"the wind\". His name was announced on June 14, 2013.

Makani can also do complex behaviors. Makani's father, Kshamenk, is an Argentinian transient orca (origin unknown) and his mother, Kasatka, is a resident Icelandic orca, making him a hybrid of the two vastly different ecotypes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://keiko.com/alert3.html|title=Campaigns \u2013 Keiko Whale Rescue|website=keiko.com}}</ref> Other such hybrids include the late Taima, her deceased sister Katerina, Taima's three calves and Kamea.\n\n====Moana====\nOn March 16, 2011, Wikie gave birth to Moana, her first calf in [[Marineland of Antibes]]. Initially, it was stated that the calf was a girl so they had a naming contest on Facebook and the name \"Moana\" (Maori for \"ocean\") won, but a report in July confirmed that ''she'' was in fact a ''he''. Marineland confirmed that his name will not be changed. It is also confirmed that Ulises of SeaWorld San Diego is the father. The calf was conceived via artificial insemination.<ref name=\"moana_birth\"/>\n\nMoana became a big brother when his mother gave birth to Keijo on November 20, 2013.\n\n====Morgan====\n{{Main|Morgan (orca)}}\nMorgan was rescued from the [[Wadden Sea]] on June 23, 2010. The estimated 1.5 year-old orca was alone, malnourished and underweight. She was transferred to [[#Dolfinarium Harderwijk|Dolfinarium Harderwijk]] where she was taken care of for several months. After it became clear she couldn't been released into the wild, the Dolfinarium searched for another facility to take care of her, because their basins were too small. Morgan moved to [[#Loro Parque|Loro Parque]] on November 29, 2011. In 2012, Loro Parque announced there was a good possibility that Morgan is partially deaf. In December 2017, Loro Parque announced Morgan was pregnant with her first calf.\n\n====Nakai====\n[[File: Nakai Slideout.jpg|thumb|Nakai doing a slideout behavior during orca encounter]]\nOn September 1, 2001, Nakai was born to [[#Kasatka|Kasatka]], with [[#Tilikum|Tilikum]] being the father. Unlike most orcas, he was born head first. He was the first orca to be conceived through [[artificial insemination]] with a successful birth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> As of August 2017, he weighed {{convert|7000|lb|kg}} and was {{convert|19|ft|m}} long.<ref name=\"Orca Stats\"/> Currently, he lives at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] As a mature adolescent with nine other whales, including his half brother [[#Makani|Makani]], his half sister [[#Kalia|Kalia]] and his half brother [[#Ikaika|Ikaika]].<ref name=\"seaworld_animal_profiles2\"/><ref name=\"nakai_cousins\"/> He has lived there his entire life.

Nakai's dorsal fin is nearly {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall and is slightly leaning to the left. The right side of his tail fluke is curved under but the left side  has yet to curve.\n\n====Nalani====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Nalani Orca.jpg|thumb|Nalani performing with Trua in the all new show at Seaworld Orlando One Ocean]]\nNalani is orca the gender female who currently resides to SeaWorld Orlando, where she was born on September 18, 2006. Her parents are [[Katina (whale)|Katina]] and [[Taku (whale)|Taku]] (who is, due to inbreeding, also her brother). She is Katina's sixth calf, and was Taku's second. She is a very loving and curious youngster, but was very dependent on her mother in the first few years.  She is learning fast, as she is used in shows regularly alongside Trua, Malia, Kayla, and Katina. An easy way to identify Nalani is how plump she is. She's grown to be bulky, like her mom, has round eyepatches, her dorsal fin has started to lean to her left side, and is the longest baby at Sea World Orlando.\n\n====Orkid====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nOrkid was born September 23, 1988, in SeaWorld San Diego, California. Orkid's parents are Kandu V (her mother), and Orky II (her father). She was the first killer whale born in the San Diego Sea World Park successfully. Orky II died only three days after Orkid was born. She was named Orkid, in memory of her father (most likely a combination of \"Orky\" and \"kid\"). In August 1989, Kandu V charged Corky II during a live show. The blow broke Kandu V's jaw, and severed an artery in Kandu's head; apparently in an act of trying to assert her dominance over Corky II. As a result, she began spouting blood with every breath she took. Forty five minutes later Kandu V sank to the bottom of the pool and died, bleeding to death. Orkid witnessed this; for weeks after the incident, she would circle the tanks calling out and vocalizing. However, she was raised by Corky, and later befriended a male named Splash. Orkid has been artificially inseminated many times, but has never gotten pregnant. Orkid is highly intelligent (having been affectionately nicknamed by trainers the \"Rocket Scientist\") and knows hundreds of behaviors. Only the most senior trainers are to work with her, as she has shown aggression toward trainers in the past. After an incident in 2006 where she dragged a trainer to the bottom of the show pool, Orkid has been barred from performing waterworks with trainers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Sakari====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nSakari was born on January 7, 2010, at Sea World San Antonio. Her mother is Takara and her father is [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]]. Siblings on her mother's side include Kohana, Trua and Kamea. \"Sakari\" is an Inuit language word meaning \"sweet\".\n\n====Shouka====\nBorn on February 25, 1993, in Antibes, France, to Sharkan and Kim 2, the female killer whale's first nine years were spent with her parents and siblings. In 2002, she was moved to [[Geauga Lake|Six Flags Worlds of Adventure]] (former [[SeaWorld Ohio]]) in Aurora, Ohio, near Cleveland. After [[Geauga Lake|Worlds of Adventure]] was sold, in 2004 Shouka was moved to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (Marine World Africa USA) in Vallejo, California. She was the only orca at the park but had bottlenose dolphin companions named Merlin and Cupid for 7 years until they were relocated due to compatibility concerns. In July 2012, Shouka began to display aggressive behavior during one of her performances. She lifted a trainer into the air and knocked her trainer back into an open door area that leads to the back of the stage. Even after the trainer was gone, Shouka leaped two more times onto the stage. Six Flags moved Shouka to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] the next month in August 2012, where Corky immediately took her under her wing. She is currently fully integrated into the pod of ten killer whales and is a highly athletic animal who enjoys working with her trainers.  Shouka is known for her bottlenose dolphin vocalizations and for her unique upward-curving tail flukes, which she has had since birth.\n\n====Takara====\nTakara (Japanese for \"treasure\") was born on July 9, 1991, at SWC to Kasatka and Kotar. She was the second \"Baby Shamu\" born at SWC, after Orkid in 1988. She gave birth to her first calf, a female named Kohana on May 3, 2002. Kasatka was by her side during the labor and she and Takara helped assist Kohana to the surface to take her first breath. She was conceived via artificial insemination, the father being [[Tilikum (killer whale)|Tilikum]], a deceased bull orca who had been living on the other side of the country at [[SeaWorld Orlando]]. Takara is an average sized female measuring {{Convert|17.3|ft|adj=on}}, and weighs 5,100 LBs.\n\nTakara and Kohana were transferred to SeaWorld Orlando in 2004. A year later, Takara gave birth to her second calf, a male named [[Trua]], fathered by [[Taku (whale)|Taku]]. Kohana was later transferred out of Sea World Orlando to [[Loro Parque]], a Spanish amusement park in the [[Canary Islands]].\n\nTakara was transferred to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in February 2009 in a supposed effort to improve space at SeaWorld Orlando. The move angered many since it separated her from her son, Trua.  However, other SeaWorld visitors and workers reported that she would often act aggressively toward Trua. It was later confirmed she was pregnant at the time (again from Tilikum). On January 7, 2010, Takara gave birth to another female calf in the main tank of the \"Shamu Theatre\" at Sea World San Antonio. On March 16, 2010, she was named Sakari, which is an [[Inuit]] word for \"sweet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orcahome.de/orcasnews.htm|title=Orca News|website=www.orcahome.de}}</ref> Takara became a grandmother on October 12, 2010, when her calf Kohana gave birth to her first calf Ad\u00e1n on October 12, 2010. Kohana had also given birth to Victoria on August 3, 2012.\nVictoria died on June 16, 2013, when she was 10 months old, of intestinal issues. Takara delivered her fourth calf on December 6, 2013, at 12:08 am Central Time. The calf is a healthy female named Kamea. She gave birth to her 5th calf (and SeaWorld's last breeding calf), a female named [[#Kyara|Kyara]], on April 19, 2017 at 2:33 PM(CST).

His father is Tilikum and his mother is Kalina. He was born at SeaWorld Orlando on June 22, 1999. Tuar used to perform waterworks until they were stopped in 2010.\n\n====Trua====\n[[File:Trua Orca.jpg|thumb|Trua, who lives at Seaworld Orlando]]\nTrua is a male orca born at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] on November 23, 2005. His parents are Takara and Taku. Takara and Kohana (his sister) had just been moved to SeaWorld Orlando when she and Taku met. At the time of Trua's birth, Kohana was by Takara's side and thus acted as the midwife. Trua currently lives at Sea World Orlando with five other orcas: [[Katina (whale)|Katina]] (matriarch), [[Kayla (whale)|Kayla]], Nalani, [[Malia (whale)|Malia]] and Makaio.\nTrua had been learning waterworks before they were stopped in 2010.<ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-11-17/business/os-seaworld-osha-hearing-1116-20111116_1_dawn-brancheau-killer-whale-seaworld-orlando-s-shamu-stadium SeaWorld mounts its defense of trainers' 'water work' with killer whales].

He is believed to have a low sperm count.\n\n===Deceased===\n\nThis is a list of some notable orcas that died in captivity. It does not include every captive death.\n\n====Baby Shamu II====\nBaby Shamu II was born at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in California on January 5, 1986. Her parents were Kenau and Winston. Because she was the second orca born at a SeaWorld park, she was nicknamed Baby Shamu II. The original Baby Shamu, aka Kalina, was her older half-sister, though Kalina had a different mother. Baby Shamu II was never given a real name<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y_coAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U4QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5753,2498929&dq=shamu+is+born&hl=en|title=Aquatic arrival|date= January 7, 1986|work=The Deseret News|via=Google News Archive Search}}</ref> as she died on January 16, 1986, just 12 days after she was born. The cause of death was a heart defect. Young orcas are born with heart valves open and they should close soon after birth. Unfortunately, Baby Shamu II had a respiratory infection and this worsened her condition. One of the valves did not close which caused Baby Shamu II to pass away.  <ref>{{cite web |url=http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/babyshamu2.html |title=Cetacean Cousins: Baby Shamu II profile |date=n.d. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630100147/http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/babyshamu2.html |archive-date=30 June 2015}}</ref>  She was 7 feet (2.1m) long and she weighed 135&nbsp;kg (297&nbsp;lb).\n\n====Bingo====\nBingo was a 31-year-old male orca who lived at the [[Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium]].

Chimo was the only partially albino orca ever exhibited in captivity. Years before her capture, another pure white orca was spotted in what is suspected to be the same pod, and named \"Alice\". Alice was never captured, and vanished in the 1960s. Chimo was captured when trying to find a mate for the park's star attraction, Haida. Chimo's probable mother was another orca by the name of Scarredjaw Cow (T3). She was captured alongside Chimo. Chimo died in 1972 from complications caused by [[Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome]], the syndrome which caused her [[albinism]]. Chimo never bore any calves.[1]\n\n====Freya====\nFreya was a 35-year-old female orca who lived at [[Marineland of Antibes]]. She was captured in October 1982 alongside Haida II, Kim II, Nootka IV, and an unnamed male. She and Kim went to Marineland Antibes from Hafnarfjordur Aquarium. She became the first European orca to become pregnant. Freya gave birth in March 1991 to a stillborn calf. She gave birth to another stillborn in March 1993. Sometime between this calf and her next, Freya had a tumor removed, leaving a white indent on her side. Freya gave birth to Valentin on February 13, 1996. In March 2001, Freya had yet another stillborn calf. In April 2003, Freya gave birth to her final calf and her fourth stillborn. She ceased to become pregnant due to birth control and the death of her mate Kim II in 2005. Freya was very depressed, but Valentin usually was able to cheer her up. Freya became a grandmother on November 20, 2013, when Valentin fathered a calf named Keijo, however, since the calf's mother Wikie was Valentin's half-sister, Valentin being the father has not been confirmed. After months of fighting an unknown illness, Freya lost her battle on June 20, 2015, leaving behind her son Valentin and likely grandson Keijo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedodo.com/32-year-old-orca-dead-after-nearly-a-lifetime-in-captivity-1210225849.html|title=32-Year-Old Orca Dead After Nearly A Lifetime In Captivity|first=Solon|last=Kelleher|date=June 21, 2015|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/64495333845/photos/a.65539343845.70470.64495333845/10153465214633846/?type=1&theater|title=MARINELAND|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>\n\n====Gudrun====\nGudrun (Goo drun) was an Icelandic female [[orca]] who lived at [[Dolfinarium Harderwijk]] in the [[Netherlands]]<ref name=Dolfinarium2008>Website Dolfinarium, Downloaded on November 5, 2008, from [http://www.dolfinarium.nl/index.php?do=content&id=210 Dolfinarium.nl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403221958/http://www.dolfinarium.nl/index.php?do=content&id=210 |date=April 3, 2009 }}</ref> and at [[SeaWorld]] [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] in Florida. Gudrun was caught close to the coast of Iceland on October 25, 1976. She was kept in captivity in the Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands, where she was the main attraction. In 1987, Gudrun was moved to [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in Florida, United States. Gudrun gave birth to [[Taima (whale)|Taima]] on July 11, 1989, at 16:45 EST during a thunderstorm. Gudrun gave birth to Nyar on December 31, 1993. Nyar suffered with illness often. She was so both mentally and physically ill, it was reported that Gudrun tried to drown her during several shows. Nyar died at the age of two years in April 1996. On February 21, 1996, Gudrun went into labor with her last calf, which was fathered by Tilikum. After 20 hours of labor, Gudrun was unable to deliver the calf. Eventually after the physical intervention of park staff, Gudrun delivered a stillborn calf of underermined sex. Due to complications from the delivery, she died four days later.\n\nIn 1982, Gudrun was the subject of an experiment in two-communications, designed to see if she could learn new words and incorporate them into her vocabulary.<ref>[http://phinventory.whale-web.com/downloads/gudrun.pdf \"An experiment in two-way communication in Orcinus orca L.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106143230/http://phinventory.whale-web.com/downloads/gudrun.pdf |date=January 6, 2009 }} Phinventory.

Initially named Peanuts, she was moved to the [[Windsor Safari Park]], where she was to stay until being moved to [[Ocean Park Hong Kong]] early in 1979, and where she was renamed Suzie Wong. Due to a dispute between [[SeaWorld]] and the safari park, she was transferred to Clacton Pier in August 1978 for the remainder of her training.

He was captured with six other pod members, including [[#Corky|Corky II]] and Natsidalia, who was thought to be his mother. He was probably from the [[A5 Pod]]. The captured whales were kept at Pender Harbour for some weeks before being transferred, and Natsidalia did not survive. Hyak was transferred to the [[Vancouver Aquarium]], where he was kept with Skana, an orca captured the previous year. After Skana died in 1980, the aquarium purchased four new orcas captured in Iceland, and two of them\u2014Finna and Bjossa\u2014were transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium. Hyak and Bjossa produced a calf in 1987, but it only survived a short time.

After a short stay at the Saedrysafnid Aquarium he arrived at Marineland Ontario in Canada on November 15, 1986. He did not settle in well at his new home, was hard to train, and did not get on well with his fellow orca tankmates. So Junior was put in a small tank in Marineland's warehouse, with no natural sunlight or air, and with noisy overhead fans. From time to time he shared his small tank with several dolphins. Marineland tried to keep Junior's conditions a secret, but members of the public released photos and films. Junior died in 1994.\n\n====K1/Taku====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nK1 was also named Taku. He was captured in August 1973 in Pedder Bay, British Columbia. While several other orcas that were caught with him were sold to other marine parks, K1 was too big to be sold. He was released on October 27, 1973, with a radio tag attached to his dorsal fin. Two nicks were cut by {{Citation needed span|text=Dr Michael Bigg|reason=specific person mentioned, should have a citation|date=January 2014}} into his dorsal fin to make it easier to identify and find him. He was given the adoption name of Taku. K1 reunited with his pod and was seen many times.  K1 disappeared in 1997 and was presumed to have died at the age of 41, as his year of birth was believed to be 1955. K1 was a full blooded Southern Resident orca. He was {{Convert|23|ft|m|sp=us}} long.\n\n====Kalina====\nKalina (September 26, 1985 \u2013 October 4, 2010) was the first captive-born orca calf to survive more than a few days. Kalina's mother is an Icelandic female named [[Katina (whale)|Katina]], and her father, [[Ramu III (Winston)|Winston]] (also known as Ramu III) was a Pacific Southern Resident, making Kalina an Atlantic/Pacific hybrid \u2013 a unique situation that would not have occurred in the wild. Kalina measured {{convert|17|ft|9|in}} and weighed approximately {{convert|6300|lb}}.\n\nKalina first appeared in shows at SeaWorld Orlando in 1986, billed as \"Baby [[Shamu]]\", performing with her mother. On February 12, 1990, Kalina was transferred to SeaWorld Ohio. She was moved again in October of that year to SeaWorld San Diego, and again on May 30, 1991, to SeaWorld San Antonio. In October 1994, Kalina was moved back to SeaWorld Orlando, where she lived with eight other killer whales, including her mother and a half sister.\n\nKalina gave birth to her first calf, a male named [[#Keet|Keet]], on February 2, 1993, at [[Sea World Texas]]. Kalina was only seven and a half years old at the time of Keet's birth \u2013 an extremely young age for an orca to become a mother. Kalina became pregnant again shortly after Keet's birth, and was moved back to SeaWorld Orlando in October 1994, where she gave birth to her second calf, another male, [[Keto (killer whale)|Keto]] on June 17, 1995. She gave birth to another male, Tuar, on June 22, 1999. Kalina bore her fourth calf and first daughter, on February 9, 2004, named Skyla. Skyla is now at Loro Parque along with Keto. Kalina was a gentle whale, learned quickly, and was used a lot in shows. She was used as a \"starter whale\" for new trainers. On Monday October 4, 2010, less than four months after Taima's death, Kalina died of preacute [[bacteremia]] [[sepsis]] at the age of 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/features_lifestyle_animal/2010/10/seaworlds-killer-whale-kalina-dies-unexpectedly.html |title=SeaWorld's killer whale Kalina dies unexpectedly |work=blogs.orlandosentinel.com |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=October 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006225536/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/features_lifestyle_animal/2010/10/seaworlds-killer-whale-kalina-dies-unexpectedly.html |archivedate=October 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> She has since become a great-grandmother with the birth of Amaya in December 2014.\n\n====Kandu V====\nKandu V was a dominant female Icelandic orca, caught in 1977 and kept at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California|California]].

When captured, he was about {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}} and weighed about {{convert|2600|lb}}, which made him about 4\u20135 years old. His mother is thought to be T7. He was sent to [[Sealand of the Pacific]], Victoria, and then sold to Marineland, Canada. In January 1987, he was sold and moved to [[SeaWorld Orlando]].\n\nWhile at Marineland of Canada, he did 'water work' with his trainers, but once at SeaWorld he was described as a \"moody and unpredictable\" whale and the 'water work' was stopped. At SeaWorld Orlando, Kanduke often fought with a younger Icelandic male named Kotar. The aggression became increasingly serious. After an incident in which Kotar bit Kanduke's [[penis]] and caused an infection and show cancellations, the exhibitors decided to move the smaller whale to the newly opened SeaWorld San Antonio. On September 20, 1990, Kanduke died of St. Louis encephalitis, which is transmitted by mosquitoes.<ref>Kirby, David. ''Death at Seaworld: Shamu and the Dark Side of Killer Whales in Captivity''. St. Martin's Press, New York, 2012</ref> The cause of his death was later determined using information from his [[necropsy]] report provided by the Freedom of Information Act. This disease is non-existent in wild killer whales because they don't spend enough time on the surface for mosquitoes to bite them. However, in captivity, the behavior of \"logging\" (i.e. just floating at the surface) puts killer whales at risk for mosquito-borne illnesses. Kanduke has since become a grandfather with the births of Sumar, Tekoa, and Malia.\n\n====Kasatka====\n[[Image:Shamu with trainer.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Kasatka at SeaWorld San Diego lifting a trainer out of the water]]\n{{Main|Kasatka}}\n\nKasatka was a 41-year-old female orca who lived at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] and the mother of Takara, Nakai, Kalia and Makani.

Her parents were Kenau and Orky II, both deceased. Kayla was about {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} long and weighed about {{convert|6200|lb}}. Kayla lived with her mother for the first two and a half years of her life. Kenau was moved to SeaWorld Orlando in January 1991, and Kayla was moved to SeaWorld Ohio in April 1991. Kayla lived there for the next eight years with another young female, named Katerina, who was three weeks older than she was. After Katerina was moved out, an older female named Winnie was moved in.\n\nIn November 1999, Kayla and Winnie were both transferred to SeaWorld San Antonio. Kayla and Winnie joined a female named Haida II and her son [[Kyuquot (killer whale)|Kyuquot]]. A young male named Keto arrived in March 2001. Haida II died on August 1 of that year, making Winnie the new dominant female. Winnie died on April 11, 2002. Kayla became the new dominant orca in the stadium and was until her relocation to Orlando in 2006. After the death of Winnie, only three whales were left in the park: Kayla, Kyuquot, and Keto. A young female by the name of [[Unna (whale)|Unna]] was moved to the park in December 2002 to settle down Kyuquot and Keto, because the two maturing males were constantly fighting over Kayla. In November 2006, Kayla was transferred to Sea World Orlando leaving behind a mate [[#Keet|Keet]], and their daughter Halyn was raised by Unna immediately after Kayla's transfer. Once Kayla arrived, she immediately gave up her dominant role to Katina, who has been the dominant female there since 1988. In spring 2007, Kayla miscarried a male calf, likely the son of Keet.\n\nKayla gave birth to her first calf on October 9, 2005, a female named Halyn. Halyn was moved to a special animal care facility to be hand raised. Halyn lived in Animal Care in a different part of the park, and in May joined her family at [[Shamu]] Stadium.

Keiko died on December 12, 2003, after beaching himself during the night; pneumonia was later determined as the probable cause of death. Keiko was captured near [[Iceland]] in 1979 and sold to the Icelandic aquarium in [[Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]]. Three years later, he was sold to Marineland of Canada, where he first started performing for the public and developed skin [[lesion]]s indicative of poor health. He was then sold to [[Reino Aventura]] (now named [[Six Flags Mexico]]), an [[amusement park]] in Mexico City, in 1985. He was the star of the movie ''[[Free Willy]]'' in 1993.\n\nThe publicity from his role in ''Free Willy'' led to an effort by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studio]] to find him a better home. Donations from the studio and [[Craig McCaw]] led to the establishment of the Free Willy Keiko Foundation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keiko.com/|title=Campaigns \u2013 Keiko Whale Rescue|website=www.keiko.com}}</ref> in February 1995. With donations from the foundation and millions of school children, the [[Oregon Coast Aquarium]] in [[Newport, Oregon]] spent over US$7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of returning him to the wild. He was airlifted by [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] to his new home on January 7, 1996, with a length of {{convert|24|ft|m|1}} and weighing {{convert|3500|kg|lb}}. During his years in Oregon, he gained over a [[ton]] in weight.\n\nOn September 9, 1998, he was flown to Klettsvik Bay in [[Vestmannaeyjar]] in Iceland, and gradually reintroduced to the wild, returning to the open sea in July 2002.

He and a capture mate Yaka were sold to a place called [[Marine World/Africa USA]] in California. The two orcas joined another female Kianu who had been at the park since 1968. Kianu wanted Nepo all to herself and she would attack Yaka whenever the other female was with Nepo. Nepo, who was very close to Yaka, protected her from Kianu's attacks. It got so bad that Kianu was transferred to a park in Japan. Nepo and Yaka continued to bond and even starred in the 1977 horror film ''[[Orca (movie)|Orca]]''. Nepo died from [[pneumonia]] on July 10, 1980. Yaka stayed by his side as he took his final breaths. Even when trainers arrived to take Nepo's body away, Yaka refused to leave him, and it took the trainers a while to separate the whales. Nepo was about 15 years old.\n\n====Nyar====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nNyar was born at SeaWorld Orlando Florida on New Year's Eve (December 31) 1993. She was born to parents Gudrun and Tilikum. Nyar suffered from many health problems. Sometimes trainers would have to separate Gudrun and Nyar because the mother would try to drown her daughter. They had some bonding moments together. Nyar was not able to perform in shows as she was a very slow learner. She was even put with her father Tilikum sometimes. He was very gentle with her. Nyar died on April 1, 1996. She was 2 years 4 months and 1 day old. The cause of death was Immune System Failure. The name \"Nyar\" (spelled N\u00fd\u00e1r in Icelandic) means \"New Year\" .\n\n====Orky II====\nOrky II was captured in April 1968 off of Pender Harbor,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N0JHLOQKomAC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=orky+2+pendor+harbor#v=onepage&q=orky+2+pendor+harbor&f=false|title=Death at SeaWorld: Shamu and the Dark Side of Killer Whales in Captivity|first=David|last=Kirby|date=July 17, 2012|publisher=Macmillan|via=Google Books|isbn=9781250002020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/orky2.html |title=Cetacean Cousins: Orky II profile |date=n.d. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220100134/http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/orky2.html |archive-date=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-27/local/me-2544_1_killer-whales|title=Orky, Oldest Killer Whale in Captivity, Dies|first=LINDA ROACH|last=MONROE|date=September 27, 1988|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref> is well remembered as the father of Orkid and Kayla. He spent many of his years in captivity at Marineland of the Pacific. Corky II accompanied him, and the two were thought to be cousins, as they were both from the same pod. He fathered all seven of Corky II's unsuccessful calves, too. Orky was transferred to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] California along with Corky II in the year 1986. There, he was soon put to the bottom of the dominancy ladder. Orky was involved in one trainer incident in 1987, where he accidentally breached on a miscue and landed on a trainer (John Sillick) while the trainer was riding Corky II as a stunt.\n\nWhile in service to Sea World, Orky mated with two of their females, Kandu V and Kenau. Kandu bore her first successful calf, Orkid, three days before he died on September 26, 1988. She was named in his memory: Orky's Kid. About two months later, Kenau also gave birth to her calf, another female who was later named Kayla. Orky's death was brought on by acute pneumonia and chronic wasting, which meant he lost a lot of weight before he died. His [[dorsal fin]] flopped completely over to his right rather than the left. His pectorals were huge and his flukes were curled completely. His enormous size can be seen in both of his daughters, who have grown up to be quite large females. Orky's only living (captive) relatives are Orkid and Kayla. At one time Orky was actually called \"Snorky\". At almost 22 feet long and 11,000 pounds, he was one of the largest whales ever held in any aquarium.\n\n====Samoa====\n{{Main|Samoa (orca)}}\nSamoa was a female captured off Iceland in 1983. Samoa was reported to have died due to complications of giving birth. However, her necropsy revealed she had a rare [[Saksenaea vasiformis]] fungal infection which likely caused the stillbirth and her death.<ref>http://withoutmethereisnou.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/the-truth-behind-samoas-death-captivity-disease-not-found-in-wild-orcas/</ref> On March 14, 1992, while held at [[SeaWorld Texas]], Samoa went into premature labour, and died giving birth to a female calf a few hours later. The calf was stillborn. It was the first reported death of a SeaWorld orca while giving birth. The age of Samoa at the time of her death was estimated to be 12\u201314.\n\n====Shamu====\n{{Main|Shamu}}\nCaptured by Ted Griffin in [[Puget Sound]] in 1965, Shamu was intended to be a companion for the orca Namu in Griffin's Seattle aquarium. Shamu was, however, quickly leased and eventually sold to [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. She performed in several SeaWorld shows and eventually died on August 23, 1971. The name Shamu has since been used for many different orcas in SeaWorld shows.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Sandra |date=2014 |title=Puget Sound Whales for Sale |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=The History Press}}</ref>\n\n====Skana====\nSkana was one of the first pod of Orcas captured, on February 15, 1967, in [[Yukon Harbor]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The entire [[K Pod|Southern Resident K Pod]], at that time 15 members, was captured.  Three died during capture, and five were transferred to the [[Seattle Marine Aquarium (Closed in 1977)]] for sale, including Skana, Ramu I and Kandu I.  The others were released.  Skana was believed to be six years old at the time of her capture.  She was sold and transferred to the [[Vancouver Aquarium]] on March 10, 1967. She was by herself in Vancouver until the end of 1968, when the recently captured [[#Hyak|Hyak II]] arrived. She died on October 5, 1980, at the approximate age of 19 years, from a mycotic infection.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://cetacousin.bplaced.net/orca/profile/skana.html \n |title=About Skana \n |work=cetacousin.bplaced.net \n |accessdate=July 25, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312083838/http://cetacousin.bplaced.net/orca/profile/skana.html \n |archivedate=March 12, 2010 \n |df=mdy-all \n}}</ref>\n\n====Splash====\nSplash was born in 1989 in Marineland in Canada, transferred to SeaWorld San Diego at the age of 3 and died there in 2005. He was a well loved animal. \"He was the one that bonded the best with the trainers,\" said veterinarian Reidarson.<ref name=\"legacy.utsandiego.com\">{{cite web|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050424/news_1m24splash.html |title=Deaths of marine mammals hit staffers especially hard |last=Rodgers |first=Terry |date=April 24, 2005 |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}</ref> Splash was prone to seizures, and at one point had to have the teeth in his lower jaw removed due to a violent seizure injury. Splash was among the park's most sickly animals. \"We brought him back from life-threatening illnesses many times,\" Reidarson recalled.<ref name=\"legacy.utsandiego.com\"/> In 1994, Splash smashed face-first into the wall of his tank, ripping a book-sized patch of skin along his jaw that had to be repaired surgically. Splash died of an infection. Ex SeaWorld trainer [[John Hargrove (killer whale trainer)|John Hargrove]], who worked closely with Splash, suggested that Splash died so young partly due to consuming large quantities of sand, presumably because of the boredom of captivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedodo.com/the-life-and-death-of-splash-a-533538202.html |title=The Life -- And Death -- Of Splash, Another Disturbed SeaWorld Orca |date=May 2, 2014 |last=Batt |first=Elizabeth |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611134044/https://www.thedodo.com/the-life-and-death-of-splash-a-533538202.html |archivedate=June 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n====Spooky====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nSpooky was the second calf born to parents Corky II and Orky II at Marineland of the Pacific on [[Halloween]] of 1978 (October 31). Unlike most orcas, he was born head first. He earned his name just for the holiday. Spooky was in good health at first, but it wasn't to last. Due to the circular tank the orcas were kept in, Corky had trouble nursing her son. Trainers took over and bottle fed Spooky hoping to help him survive. Spooky died 11 days later on November 10, 1978, from pneumonia and colitis. Spooky's breed was 100% Northern Resident orca.\n\n====Sumar====\nSumar (May 14, 1998 \u2013 September 7, 2010) was a male orca born at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]]. His mother was [[Taima (whale)|Taima]] and he was her first calf. Just six months after birth, an incident happened when, during a show, his mother attacked him, pushing him against the glass, trying to make him fall. The crowd was evacuated and the show canceled. The [[animal trainer|trainers]] tried to move Taima to another tank and finally separated her from her son. Since then, the two of them have been always separated and [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]] and [[Katina (whale)|Katina]] became his surrogate mothers until he was transferred to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California|California]] on March 8, 1999. Afterwards, he spent a few months at now-closed [[SeaWorld Ohio]] before being transferred back to the San Diego park.\n\nHe was considered very gentle with other orcas<ref name=\"SanDiego\">\n{{cite web\n |title=Deaths of marine mammals hit staffers especially hard \n |publisher=Union-Tribune Publishing Co.

At the time of his death he was one of three males at the park, and was seen as a possible breeding male in the future; Nakai, the younger male, is still too young to breed, and the older male Ulises seems to have a low sperm count. Sumar was approaching full size for a typical bull orca when he died: his dorsal fin was more and more leaning to its left and his flukes were beginning to curl under. He was about 4.6 m (17&nbsp;feet) long and weighed around {{convert|5300|lb}}. He was often used for shows in the park.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/beyondtheblue/sumar.htm \"Sumar\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009062626/http://www.freewebs.com/beyondtheblue/sumar.htm |date=October 9, 2008 }} Beyond the Blue.

Trainers noticed that the whale was not feeling well on Monday, September 6, 2010, which resulted in veterinarians being notified, blood samples drawn, and antibiotics administered. Despite measures taken by Sumar's veterinarian team, Sumar became increasingly ill by Tuesday. He died shortly before 1:45 PM (Pacific time). Sumar's death prompted the canceling of the park's orca shows for the day. His death was determined to be as a result of a twisted intestinal tract (intestinal volvulus). He was set to be the next captive breeding bull orca, after his father [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]].\n\n====Taima====\nTaima (pronounced Ty-EE-Ma) (July 11, 1989 \u2013 June 6, 2010) was a transient/Icelandic hybrid female orca who lived at [[Sea World Orlando]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]]. Her name purportedly comes from a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or Icelandic language, and means \"crash of thunder\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babynamespedia.com/meaning/Taima/f|title=Taima \u2013 Meaning of Taima, What does Taima mean? girl name|website=www.babynamespedia.com}}</ref> She was born tail-first around 16:45 [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] during a thunderstorm. <!-- Unfortunately, there is a conflict beetween if Taima means crash of thunder in the Icelandic or Native American language. Please do not remove/change unless the issue is solved.-->\n\nTaima was born to mother [[Gudrun (whale)|Gudrun]] and father [[Kanduke]]. In 1990, Kanduke died at the age of 20 from St. Louis encephalitis; Gudrun gave birth to Taima's half-sister Nyar in 1993. Nyar suffered frequent illness and it was reported that Gudrun tried to drown her during several shows. Trainers believe that this confused Taima, as she witnessed this and thought this was how to raise a calf. She was later reported to have performed this on her own calves, Sumar, Tekoa, and Malia. Gudrun died in 1996 from [[stillbirth]] complications, and Nyar died from an illness a few months later in April.\n\nOn May 14, 1998, Taima gave birth to a male calf named Sumar. They were separated when he was about eight months old because of the aggression between them. On one occasion while performing, Taima started biting Sumar, and throwing him out of the pool, onto the [[animal trainer|trainer]]'s platform. She then slid out herself and started biting him. The show was stopped, and Taima was pulled to the other swimming pool. A few months later Sumar was transferred to [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California|California]].\n\nOn November 8, 2000, at 3:47 pm, Taima gave birth to a male named Tekoa. He began feeding overnight and was estimated to be 7 feet (2.2 m) long and weigh {{convert|350|lb}}. During the birth, [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]] assisted Taima and helped the calf to the surface for its first breath. Tekoa was sent to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in 2004, and was later sent to [[Loro Parque]] in [[Tenerife]] in February 2006, where he remains today. After Tekoa's attack, Taima was separated from all other whales except Tilikum, until she gave birth again to her first daughter Malia in 2007, on March 12.  \"At birth Malia (Hawaiian for \"calm and peaceful\") measured about 6 feet and weighed in at around 350 pounds. Her father is Tilikum.\"<ref name=\"orcahome.de\"/> Seaworld announced on May 18, 2010, that Taima was pregnant again.\n\nTaima died from complications to a stillborn male calf on June 6, 2010. Preliminary indications suggested that her death was caused by ''[[placenta previa]]'', a condition in which the placenta is delivered before the calf.\n\n====Taku====\nTaku (September 9, 1993 \u2013 October 17, 2007) was a male orca, who was born at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]]. After birth, Taku spent most of his time with his mother [[Katina (whale)|Katina]] or Nyar, his younger half-sister. Three years later, Katina gave birth again to a female, [[Unna]]. On August 25, 2002, Katina gave birth to her fifth calf: a male, [[Ikaika (killer whale)|Ikaika]]. Unna was later moved to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in December 2002. Afterwards, Ikaika and Taku bonded to the point where Ikaika swam in mother-calf-position with Taku. On November 18, 2006, Taku was moved to [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] whereas Ikaika was moved to Marineland of Canada in Ontario.\n\nTakara soon became pregnant. On November 23, 2005, around 21:50 EST (4:50 PM), Takara went into labor with her second calf. Her daughter Kohana was at her side. Thirty-two minutes later around 22:22 EST (5:22 PM), Takara gave birth to a male calf (Taku's son/first calf) who was later to be named [[Trua]]. Taku sired another calf in 2006 with his mother Katina \u2013 Nalani, who was also his sister and the first surviving inbred calf.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/taku.html |title=Cetacean Cousins: Taku profile |date=n.d. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116101433/http://cetacousin.com/captive/orca/profile/taku.html |archive-date=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nTaku died unexpectedly on October 17, 2007, at the age of 14 and weighing over {{convert|7000|lb}} and at {{convert|22|ft}} long.

His first son, Kyuquot, was born to Haida II on December 24, 1991. Just a few months prior to the birth of Kyuquot, Tilikum was involved in the first incident involving a death. Seaworld requested an emergency transfer of Tilikum to their facility. Tilikum was moved to SeaWorld Orlando, Florida, on January 9, 1992. Sealand of the Pacific closed soon thereafter.\n\nFollowing his arrival at SeaWorld, Tilikum sired many calves with many different females. His first calf born in Orlando was to Katina. Katina gave birth to Taku on September 9, 1993. Taku died on October 17, 2007.\n\nTilikum's other calves are: Nyar (born 1993, died 1996), Unna (1996\u20132015), Sumar (1998\u20132010), Tuar (1999), Tekoa (2000), Nakai (2001), Kohana (2002), Ikaika (2002), Skyla (2004), Malia (2007), Sakari (2010) and Makaio (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://captivecetaceans-tragicallysad.blogspot.com/2014/03/challenging-things-seaworld-say_5.html|title=Captive Cetaceans Tragically Sad: Blackfish lies \u2013 Debunking Seaworld's website announcement|first=Captive Cetaceans|last=Tragicallysad|date=March 5, 2014|publisher=}}</ref>  On January 6, 2017, SeaWorld announced that Tilikum had died early in the morning of bacterial pneumonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wfla.com/2017/01/06/seaworld-announces-death-of-orca-whale-tilikum/|title=SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died|first=|last=|date=January 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wfla.com/2017/01/06/seaworld-announces-death-of-orca-whale-tilikum/|title=SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died|first=Associated|last=Press|date=January 6, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Unna====\nUnna was a female orca.

She died on October 29, 1997, after 27 years in captivity. She was about 31 years old, the third oldest orca in captivity at the time. The cause of her death was supposedly pneumonia. She came to [[Marine World Africa USA]] located in Redwood City California in December 1969 together with male [[List of captive orcas#Nepo|Nepo]] after being captured off the coast of British Columbia. Nepo and Yaka starred in the 1977 horror film [[Orca (movie)|Orca]]. Nepo died in July 1980, leaving Yaka alone. In November 1980, the Icelandic female killer whale Vigga became her tank mate. Yaka was 10 years older than Vigga. They made the move together when the park relocated to Vallejo, California, in 1986. Vigga died 3 years after Yaka in August 2000.\n\nYaka was a member of the [[A5 Pod]], as is [[Corky (killer whale)|Corky]].\n\n'''Juliet/malyshka'''\n\nShe lives in Moscow dolphinarium and aquarium Russia (is from Russia).

Co-founder (in 1910) of the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] (PND), he served as a member of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], President of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Deputies' Assembly]] and [[Senate of Romania|Senate]], cabinet minister and briefly (1931\u201332) as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]]. A [[child prodigy]], [[polymath]] and [[polyglot (person)|polyglot]], Iorga produced an unusually large body of scholarly works, consecrating his international reputation as a [[Medievalism|medievalist]], [[Byzantine studies|Byzantinist]], [[Romance studies|Latinist]], [[Slavic studies|Slavist]], [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Philosophy of history|philosopher of history]]. Holding teaching positions at the [[University of Bucharest]], the [[University of Paris]] and several other academic institutions, Iorga was founder of the [[International Congress of Byzantine Studies]] and the [[Institute of South-East European Studies]] (ISSEE). His activity also included the transformation of [[V\u0103lenii de Munte]] town into a cultural and academic center.\n\nIn parallel with his scientific contributions, Nicolae Iorga was a prominent [[Right-wing politics|right-of-centre]] activist, whose political theory bridged [[conservatism]], [[Romanian nationalism]], and [[agrarianism]]. From [[Marxism|Marxist]] beginnings, he switched sides and became a maverick disciple of the ''[[Junimea]]'' movement. Iorga later became a leadership figure at ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'', the influential literary magazine with [[Populism|populist]] leanings, and militated within the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]], founding vocally conservative publications such as ''[[Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc]]'', ''[[Drum Drept]]'', ''[[Cuget Clar]]'' and ''[[Floarea Darurilor]]''. His support for the cause of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] made him a prominent figure in the pro-[[Allies of World War I|Entente]] camp by the time of [[World War I]], and ensured him a special political role during the [[interwar]] existence of [[Greater Romania]]. Initiator of large-scale campaigns to defend [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] in front of perceived threats, Iorga sparked most controversy with his [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] rhetoric, and was for long an associate of the [[far right]] ideologue [[A. C. Cuza]]. He was an adversary of the dominant [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberals]], later involved with the opposition [[Romanian National Party]].\n\nLate in his life, Iorga opposed the radically [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], and, after much oscillation, came to endorse its rival [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. Involved in a personal dispute with the Guard's leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], and indirectly contributing to his killing, Iorga was also a prominent figure in Carol's [[Corporatism|corporatist]] and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] party, the [[National Renaissance Front]]. He remained an independent voice of opposition after the Guard inaugurated its own [[National Legionary State|National Legionary]] dictatorship, but was ultimately assassinated by a Guardist [[commando]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Child prodigy and Marxist militant===\n[[File:Casa memorial\u0103 Nicolae Iorga, Boto\u0219ani.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Memorial house in [[Boto\u0219ani]]]]\n\nNicolae Iorga was a native of [[Boto\u0219ani]], and is generally believed to have been born on 17 January 1871 (although his birth certificate has 6 June).<ref>Iova, p. xxvii.

The unexpected [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|cession of Bessarabia to the Soviets]] shocked Romanian society and greatly angered Iorga.<ref name=\"ihstere2\"/><ref>Br\u0103tescu, p. 77</ref> At the two sessions of the Crown Council held on 27 June, he was one of six (out of 21) members to reject the Soviet ultimatum demanding Bessarabia's handover, instead calling vehemently for armed resistance.<ref name=\"ihstere2\"/> Later, the Nazi-mediated [[Second Vienna Award]] made [[Northern Transylvania]] a part of Hungary. This loss sparked a political and moral crisis, eventually leading to the establishment of a [[National Legionary State]] with Ion Antonescu as ''[[Conduc\u0103tor]]'' and the Iron Guard as a governing political force. In the wake of this reshuffling, Iorga decided to close down his ''Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc'', explaining: \"When a defeat is registered, the flag is not surrendered, but its fabric is wrapped around the heart. The heart of our struggle was the national cultural idea.\"<ref name=\"ivliv\"/> Perceived as Codreanu's murderer, he received renewed threats from the Iron Guard, including [[hate mail]], attacks in the movement's press (''[[Buna Vestire]]'' and ''[[Porunca Vremii]]'')<ref>Ornea (1995), p. 335.

Literary historian [[Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu]] opined that Iorga's scientific work was one of the \"illustrious accomplishments\" of the interwar years, on par with [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]'s sculptures and [[George Enescu]]'s music.<ref>Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p. 19</ref> Romanian historian of culture [[Alexandru Zub]] finds that Iorga's is \"surely the richest opus coming from the 20th century\",<ref>Zub (2000), p. 47</ref> while Maria Todorova calls Iorga \"Romania's greatest historian\", adding \"at least in terms of the size of his opus and his influence both at home and abroad\".<ref name=\"mt46\"/> According to philosopher Liviu Borda\u0219, Iorga's main topic of interest, the relation between Romania and the [[Eastern world]], was exhaustively covered: \"nothing escaped this sacred monster's attention: Iorga had read everything.\"<ref name=\"lbintoarcer\">{{in lang|ro}} Liviu Borda\u0219, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/polul-plus/articol/intoarcerea-radacinilor \"\u00centoarcerea r\u0103d\u0103cinilor\"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 360, January 2011</ref>\n\n===Method and biases===\nThe definition of history followed by Iorga was specified in his 1894 ''Despre concep\u021bia actual\u0103 a istoriei \u0219i geneza ei'': \"History is the systematic exposition, free from all unrelated purpose, of facts irrespective of their nature, methodically acquired, through which human activity manifested itself, irrespective of place and time.\"<ref name=\"ivxxxiv\"/> With [[Ioan Bogdan (historian)|Ioan Bogdan]] and [[Dimitrie Onciul]], young Iorga was considered an exponent of the \"new\" or \"[[Critical historiography|critical]]\" school, with which ''Junimism'' tackled [[Romantic nationalism]] in the name of objectivity.<ref>Boia (2000), pp. 82\u201383, 101; Nastas\u0103 (2003), pp. 63, 72\u201373, 167\u2013184; (2007), p. 44, 306\u2013307, 436, 502, 515\u2013521</ref> However, even at that stage, Iorga's ideas accommodated a belief that history needed to be written with a \"poetic talent\" that would make one \"relive\" the past.<ref>Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 67\u201368</ref>\n\nBy 1902, he had changed his approach in [[historiography]] to include and illustrate his belief in emotional attachment as a positive value of cultural nationalism.

See also Zub (2000), pp. 33\u201334</ref> Reflecting back on the transition, Iorga himself stated: \"The love for the past, for great figures of energy and sincerity,&nbsp;... the exact contrary of tendencies I had found existed among my contemporaries, had gripped me and, added to my political preoccupations, such awakenings served me, when it came to criticizing things present, more than any argument that is abstract, logical in nature.\"<ref name=\"ivxxxviii\"/> The point of his research, Iorga explained in 1922, was to show \"the nation itself as a living being\".<ref>Boia (2000), p. 99</ref> According to literary historian Victor Iova: \"[Iorga's] overall activity&nbsp;... did not just seek the communication of knowledge, but also expressly sought to define the social finality of his time, its ethical sense and his own [[Patriotism|patriotic]] ideal.\"<ref name=\"ivli\"/> The 1911 speech ''Dou\u0103 concep\u021bii istorice'' nevertheless provided a more nuanced outline, cautioning against a potential cult of heroes and suggesting that national histories were inextricably linked to each other: \"The life of a people is at all times mingled with the lives of others, existing in relation with these and at all times feeding into the others' lives.\"<ref name=\"ivxl\"/>\n\nAccording to George C\u0103linescu, Nicolae Iorga was overdependent on his memory, which could result in \"utterly fictitious\" [[critical apparatus]]es for his scientific works.<ref name=\"gc612\"/> C\u0103linescu suggests that Iorga was an \"anachronistic\" type in his context: \"approved only by failures\", aged before his time, modeling himself on ancient chroniclers and out of place in modern historiography.<ref name=\"gc612\"/> In the 1930s, Iorga's status in regulating the official historical narrative was challenged by [[Constantin C.

A significant portion of his contributions in the field detailed the impact of Byzantine influences on the Danubian Principalities and the Balkans at large. He described the \"Byzantine man\" as embodying the blend of several cultural universes: [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]], [[Levant]]ine and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]].<ref name=\"mmhomob\"/> In this context, Iorga was also exploring Romania's own identity issues as a confluence of Byzantine [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and a [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] linguistic imprint.<ref>Blokker, ''passim''; Santoro, pp. 115\u2013116; Spiridon, pp. 94\u201395, 104</ref>\n\nIorga's writings insisted on the importance of [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] and Levantine influences in the two countries after the [[fall of Constantinople]]: his notion of \"Byzantium after Byzantium\" postulated that the cultural forms produced by the Byzantine Empire had been preserved by the Principalities under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] (roughly, between the 16th and 18th centuries).<ref>Blokker, pp. 166\u2013170; Boia (2000), pp. 100, 181, 267; Djuvara, p. 339; Neubauer, p. 164; Spiridon, p. 104.

[[Semiotics|Semiotician]] [[Monica Spiridon]] writes: \"Iorga highly valued the idea of cultural confluence and hybridity.\"<ref>Spiridon, p. 104</ref> Similarly, [[Maria Todorova]] notes that, although it minimized the Ottoman contribution and displayed \"emotional or evaluative overtones\", such a perspective ran against the divisive interpretations of the Balkans, offering a working paradigm for a global history of the region: \"Although Iorga's theory may be today [ca. 2009] no more than an exotic episode in the development of Balkan historiography, his formulation ''Byzance apr\u00e8s Byzance'' is alive not only because it was a fortunate phrase but because it reflects more than its creator would intimate.

In some of his essays, Iorga identified Expressionism with the danger of [[Germanization]], a phenomenon he described as \"intolerable\" (although, unwittingly, he was also among the first Romanians to tackle Expressionism).<ref>Grigorescu, pp. 376\u2013377</ref> In an analogy present in a 1922 article for ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Iorga suggested that the same \"German\" threat was agitating the avant-garde voices of [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and Dadaist \"[[energumen]]s\" alike.<ref>Cernat, p. 125</ref> During the 1930s, as the cultural and political climate changed, Iorga's main accusation against [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Lucian Blaga]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Liviu Rebreanu]], [[George Mihail Zamfirescu]] and other Romanian modernists was their supposed practice of literary \"[[pornography]]\".<ref name=\"ascboxa\"/><ref>Ornea (1995), pp. 445\u2013446.

Iorga''';<ref name=\"ivxxvii\">Iova, p. xxvii.</ref> 17 January 1871 \u2013 27 November 1940) was a [[Romania]]n historian, politician, literary critic, memoirist, poet and playwright. Co-founder (in 1910) of the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] (PND), he served as a member of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], President of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Deputies' Assembly]] and [[Senate of Romania|Senate]], cabinet minister and briefly (1931\u201332) as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]]. A [[child prodigy]], [[polymath]] and [[polyglot (person)|polyglot]], Iorga produced an unusually large body of scholarly works, consecrating his international reputation as a [[Medievalism|medievalist]], [[Byzantine studies|Byzantinist]], [[Romance studies|Latinist]], [[Slavic studies|Slavist]], [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Philosophy of history|philosopher of history]]. Holding teaching positions at the [[University of Bucharest]], the [[University of Paris]] and several other academic institutions, Iorga was founder of the [[International Congress of Byzantine Studies]] and the [[Institute of South-East European Studies]] (ISSEE). His activity also included the transformation of [[V\u0103lenii de Munte]] town into a cultural and academic center.\n\nIn parallel with his scientific contributions, Nicolae Iorga was a prominent [[Right-wing politics|right-of-centre]] activist, whose political theory bridged [[conservatism]], [[Romanian nationalism]], and [[agrarianism]]. From [[Marxism|Marxist]] beginnings, he switched sides and became a maverick disciple of the ''[[Junimea]]'' movement. Iorga later became a leadership figure at ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'', the influential literary magazine with [[Populism|populist]] leanings, and militated within the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]], founding vocally conservative publications such as ''[[Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc]]'', ''[[Drum Drept]]'', ''[[Cuget Clar]]'' and ''[[Floarea Darurilor]]''. His support for the cause of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] made him a prominent figure in the pro-[[Allies of World War I|Entente]] camp by the time of [[World War I]], and ensured him a special political role during the [[interwar]] existence of [[Greater Romania]]. Initiator of large-scale campaigns to defend [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] in front of perceived threats, Iorga sparked most controversy with his [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] rhetoric, and was for long an associate of the [[far right]] ideologue [[A. C. Cuza]]. He was an adversary of the dominant [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberals]], later involved with the opposition [[Romanian National Party]].\n\nLate in his life, Iorga opposed the radically [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], and, after much oscillation, came to endorse its rival [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. Involved in a personal dispute with the Guard's leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], and indirectly contributing to his killing, Iorga was also a prominent figure in Carol's [[Corporatism|corporatist]] and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] party, the [[National Renaissance Front]]. He remained an independent voice of opposition after the Guard inaugurated its own [[National Legionary State|National Legionary]] dictatorship, but was ultimately assassinated by a Guardist [[commando]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Child prodigy and Marxist militant===\n[[File:Casa memorial\u0103 Nicolae Iorga, Boto\u0219ani.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Memorial house in [[Boto\u0219ani]]]]\n\nNicolae Iorga was a native of [[Boto\u0219ani]], and is generally believed to have been born on 17 January 1871 (although his birth certificate has 6 June).<ref>Iova, p. xxvii.

T. Laurian National College|A. T. Laurian]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and high school after 1881, the young Iorga received top honors, and, beginning 1883, began tutoring some of his colleagues to increase his family's main revenue (according to Iorga, a \"miserable pension of pittance\").<ref>Iova, pp. xxix\u2013xxx</ref> Aged thirteen, while on extended visit to his maternal uncle Emanuel \"Manole\" Arghiropol, he also made his press debut with paid contributions to Arghiropol's ''Romanul''<!-- sic --> newspaper, including [[anecdote]]s and editorial pieces on European politics.<ref>Iova, p. xxix</ref> The year 1886 was described by Iorga as \"the catastrophe of my school life in Boto\u0219ani\": on temporary suspension for not having greeted a teacher, Iorga opted to leave the city and apply for the [[Ia\u0219i National College|National High School]] ([[:ro:Colegiul Na\u021bional din Ia\u0219i|ro]]) of [[Ia\u0219i]], being received into the [[scholarship]] program and praised by his new principal, the philologist [[Vasile Burl\u0103]].<ref>Iova, pp. xxix\u2013xxxi</ref> The adolescent was already fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], later referring to [[Hellenic studies|Greek studies]] as \"the most refined form of human reasoning\".<ref name=\"ivxxx\">Iova, p. xxx</ref>\n\nBy age seventeen, Iorga was becoming more rebellious. This was the time when he first grew interested in political activities, but displaying convictions which he later strongly disavowed: a self-confessed [[Marxism|Marxist]], Iorga promoted the [[left-wing]] magazine ''[[Via\u021ba Social\u0103]]'', and lectured on ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name=\"ivxxx\"/> Seeing himself confined in the National College's \"ugly and disgusting\" [[boarding school]], he defied its rules and was suspended a second time, losing scholarship privileges.<ref name=\"ivxxxi\">Iova, p. xxxi</ref> Before readmission, he decided not to fall back on his family's financial support, and instead returned to tutoring others.<ref name=\"ivxxxi\"/> Again expelled for reading during a teacher's lesson, Iorga still graduated in the top \"first prize\" category (with a 9.24 average) and subsequently took his [[Romanian Baccalaureate|Baccalaureate]] with honors.<ref>Iova, p .xxxi.

D. Xenopol]], Iorga was honored by the faculty with a special banquet. Three academics (Xenopol, [[Nicolae Culianu]], [[Ioan Caragiani]]) formally brought Iorga to the attention of the Education Ministry, proposing him for the state-sponsored program which allowed academic achievers to study abroad.<ref>Iova, p. xxxii. See also Nastas\u0103 (2003), pp. 62\u201363, 174\u2013175; (2007), pp. 238\u2013239</ref>\n\nThe interval witnessed Iorga's brief affiliation with ''[[Junimea]]'', a literary club with [[Conservatism|conservative]] leanings, whose informal leader was literary and political theorist [[Titu Maiorescu]]. In 1890, literary critic [[\u0218tefan V\u00e2rgolici]] and cultural promoter [[Iacob Negruzzi]] published Iorga's essay on poet [[Veronica Micle]] in the ''Junimist'' tribune ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.<ref>Iova, p. xxxii.

Ionescu-Caion]].<ref>Iova, p. xxxii. See also Nastas\u0103 (2003), p. 65</ref> He expanded his contribution as an opinion journalist, publishing with some regularity in various local or national periodicals of various leanings, from the socialist ''[[Contemporanul]]'' and ''[[Era Nou\u0103]]'' to [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]]'s ''Revista Nou\u0103''.<ref>Iova, p. xxxii. See also C\u0103linescu, p. 988</ref> This period saw his debut as a [[Socialism|socialist]] poet (in ''Contemporanul'') and critic (in both ''[[Lupta]]'' and ''[[Literatur\u0103 \u0219i \u0218tiin\u021b\u0103]]'').<ref>[[Constantin Kiri\u021bescu]], \"''O via\u021b\u0103, o lume, o epoc\u0103'': Ani de ucenicie \u00een mi\u0219carea socialist\u0103\", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 1977, pp. 14, 17</ref>\n\nAlso in 1890, Iorga married Maria Tasu, whom he was to divorce in 1900.<ref>Iova, pp. xxxii, xxxvii; Nastas\u0103 (2003), pp. 61, 64\u201371, 74, 105, 175</ref> He had previously been in love with an Ecaterina C.

Literary historian [[Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu]] opined that Iorga's scientific work was one of the \"illustrious accomplishments\" of the interwar years, on par with [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]'s sculptures and [[George Enescu]]'s music.<ref>Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p. 19</ref> Romanian historian of culture [[Alexandru Zub]] finds that Iorga's is \"surely the richest opus coming from the 20th century\",<ref>Zub (2000), p. 47</ref> while Maria Todorova calls Iorga \"Romania's greatest historian\", adding \"at least in terms of the size of his opus and his influence both at home and abroad\".<ref name=\"mt46\"/> According to philosopher Liviu Borda\u0219, Iorga's main topic of interest, the relation between Romania and the [[Eastern world]], was exhaustively covered: \"nothing escaped this sacred monster's attention: Iorga had read everything.\"<ref name=\"lbintoarcer\">{{in lang|ro}} Liviu Borda\u0219, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/polul-plus/articol/intoarcerea-radacinilor \"\u00centoarcerea r\u0103d\u0103cinilor\"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 360, January 2011</ref>\n\n===Method and biases===\nThe definition of history followed by Iorga was specified in his 1894 ''Despre concep\u021bia actual\u0103 a istoriei \u0219i geneza ei'': \"History is the systematic exposition, free from all unrelated purpose, of facts irrespective of their nature, methodically acquired, through which human activity manifested itself, irrespective of place and time.\"<ref name=\"ivxxxiv\"/> With [[Ioan Bogdan]] and [[Dimitrie Onciul]], young Iorga was considered an exponent of the \"new\" or \"[[Critical historiography|critical]]\" school, with which ''Junimism'' tackled [[Romantic nationalism]] in the name of objectivity.<ref>Boia (2000), pp. 82\u201383, 101; Nastas\u0103 (2003), pp. 63, 72\u201373, 167\u2013184; (2007), p. 44, 306\u2013307, 436, 502, 515\u2013521</ref> However, even at that stage, Iorga's ideas accommodated a belief that history needed to be written with a \"poetic talent\" that would make one \"relive\" the past.<ref>Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 67\u201368</ref>\n\nBy 1902, he had changed his approach in [[historiography]] to include and illustrate his belief in emotional attachment as a positive value of cultural nationalism.

See also Zub (2000), pp. 33\u201334</ref> Reflecting back on the transition, Iorga himself stated: \"The love for the past, for great figures of energy and sincerity,&nbsp;... the exact contrary of tendencies I had found existed among my contemporaries, had gripped me and, added to my political preoccupations, such awakenings served me, when it came to criticizing things present, more than any argument that is abstract, logical in nature.\"<ref name=\"ivxxxviii\"/> The point of his research, Iorga explained in 1922, was to show \"the nation itself as a living being\".<ref>Boia (2000), p. 99</ref> According to literary historian Victor Iova: \"[Iorga's] overall activity&nbsp;... did not just seek the communication of knowledge, but also expressly sought to define the social finality of his time, its ethical sense and his own [[Patriotism|patriotic]] ideal.\"<ref name=\"ivli\"/> The 1911 speech ''Dou\u0103 concep\u021bii istorice'' nevertheless provided a more nuanced outline, cautioning against a potential cult of heroes and suggesting that national histories were inextricably linked to each other: \"The life of a people is at all times mingled with the lives of others, existing in relation with these and at all times feeding into the others' lives.\"<ref name=\"ivxl\"/>\n\nAccording to George C\u0103linescu, Nicolae Iorga was overdependent on his memory, which could result in \"utterly fictitious\" [[critical apparatus]]es for his scientific works.<ref name=\"gc612\"/> C\u0103linescu suggests that Iorga was an \"anachronistic\" type in his context: \"approved only by failures\", aged before his time, modeling himself on ancient chroniclers and out of place in modern historiography.<ref name=\"gc612\"/> In the 1930s, Iorga's status in regulating the official historical narrative was challenged by [[Constantin C. Giurescu]], [[P. P.

Some of Iorga's studies focused specifically on the original events in the process: ancient [[Dacia]]'s conquest by the [[Roman Empire]] ([[Trajan's Dacian Wars]]), and the subsequent foundation of [[Roman Dacia]].

Despite the separate histories and conflicting allegiances these regions had during the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], he tended to group the two Principalities and [[History of Transylvania|medieval Transylvania]] together, into a vague non-stately entity he named \"the Romanian Land\".<ref>Boia (2000), pp. 180\u2013181</ref> Iorga cautioned about the emergence of states from a [[stateless society]] such as the proto-Romanian one: \"The state is a late, very elevated, very delicate form that, under certain conditions, may be reached by a people.&nbsp;... There was therefore no state, but a Romanian mass living in the midst of forests, in those villages harbored by protective forests, where it is just as true that a certain way of life could emerge, sometimes on a rather elevated level.\"<ref>Pecican, pp. 110\u2013111</ref>\n\nEchoing his political conservatism, Iorga's theory proposed that the Romanized Dacians, or all their [[Vlach|Vlach-Romanian]] successors, had created peasant republics to defend themselves against the [[Age of Migrations|invading nomads]].
