The fighter has vastly improved avionics and weapon systems, notably new precision-guided targeting capability and the uniquely designed [[infra-red search and track|optical locator system]], which relieves the aircraft from relying on [[ground-controlled interception]] systems and enables it to conduct independent multirole missions. There is also an option for [[active electronically scanned array|AESA radar]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThere were references in the late 1980s to a very different design also identified as \"MiG-35\". This design was a single-engined combat aircraft for air-to-air and secondary air-to-ground roles. According to unidentified Indian sources, the aircraft was evaluated by Indian pilots in the Soviet Union and was probably suggested as an alternative for the [[HAL Tejas|Indian LCA]] being developed at that time.<ref>''Jane's Defence Weekly,'' 13 August 1988, p. 235.</ref>\n\n===Procurement===\n[[File:Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-35 MAKS'2007 Pichugin.jpg|thumb|MiG-35D at the 2007 [[Aero India]] air show]]\nRussia unveiled the MiG-35 at the 2007 [[Aero India]] [[air show]] in [[Bangalore]],<ref name=\"Unveil_MiG-35\">[http://www.india-defence.com/print/2858 \"Russia to Unveil Latest MiG-35 at Bangalore During Aero India 2007.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626135918/https://www.india-defence.com/print/2858 |date=26 June 2018 }} ''India Defence'', 2 February 2007.</ref> amid Moscow's keenness to sell these planes to India. The MiG-35 was a contender with the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], [[Dassault Rafale]], [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]], and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] in the [[Indian MRCA competition]] for 126 [[multirole combat aircraft]] to be procured by the [[Indian Air Force]].

The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with [[Qantas]], the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out 'E' zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the ''Boeing Signature Interior'', which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).\n\nThe 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), which replaced the six [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays found on the Boeing {{not a typo|747-400}}. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/747ER.pdf | title=Introducing the 747ER and 747 | date= January 2003 | publisher=Boeing Aero magazine}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the [[jatropha]] plant. [[Air New Zealand]] carried out the first commercial flight using jatropha oil for fuel; the airline's 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% [[jatropha oil]] and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data.

As most 747-400s are now more than 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have been retiring the model, replacing it with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in most cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range, such as the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/boeing-747-heading-retirement/any-other-business/article/1360694|title=The Boeing 747 is heading for retirement|publisher=}}</ref> Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s ordered the [[Airbus A380]] rather than the updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].\n\nFor example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to [[Narita International Airport]] that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]].<ref>Schofield, Adriean, et al., Jumbos bow out, Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 15, 2014, pp. 21-22</ref> Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with [[Airbus A330]] or [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]] aircraft (both of which are twinjets). Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/042415/deltas-boeing-747s-are-flying-sunset-ba-dal-ual.aspx|title=Delta's Boeing 747s Are Flying Off Into the Sunset|publisher=Investopedia|date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, economic weakness in air cargo markets has slowed demand for cargo conversions. Since the cost of replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the {{not a typo|747-400}} to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta flew through a violent hailstorm, the company indicated it was likely the aircraft would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft's value before the incident at about $8 million.

The -400F can be easily distinguished from the passenger -400 by its shorter upper-deck hump and lack of windows along the main deck.\n\nThe model's first flight was on May 4, 1993, and entered service with [[Cargolux]] on November 17, 1993. Major customers included [[Atlas Air]], Cargolux, [[China Airlines]], [[Korean Air]], [[Nippon Cargo Airlines]], [[Polar Air Cargo]], and [[Singapore Airlines]].\n\nThe 747-400F has a main deck nose door and a mechanized cargo handling system. The nose door swings up so that pallets or containers up to {{cvt|40|ft}} can be loaded straight in on motor-driven rollers. An optional main deck side cargo door (like the 747-400M Combi) allows loading of dimensionally taller cargo modules. A lower deck (\"belly\") side door allows loading of unit load devices (ULD) up to 163&nbsp;cm in height.

Winglets would provide minimal benefits on short-haul routes while adding extra weight and cost. The -400D may be converted to the long-range version if needed. The 747-400D can be distinguished from the otherwise similar-looking 747-300 by the extra windows on the upper deck.

The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional {{cvt|3240|USgal|L}} body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however, Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by [[Marshall Aerospace]], these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks feature a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200LR]] and [[Boeing P-8A Poseidon]]. Other changes to the 747-400ER include the relocation of oxygen system components and the [[potable water]] system tanks and pumps, since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.<ref name=\"auto\">Boeing Field Service Introduction Data 2012</ref>{{nonspecific|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe first 747-400ER was used as a test flight airplane and painted in Boeing colours, registration N747ER.

The flight test airplane was later refurbished, repainted in standard QANTAS livery, and registered as VH-OEE.

The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with [[Qantas]], the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out 'E' zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the ''Boeing Signature Interior'', which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).\n\nThe 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), which replaced the six [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays found on the Boeing {{not a typo|747-400}}. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/747ER.pdf | title=Introducing the 747ER and 747 | date= January 2003 | publisher=Boeing Aero magazine}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the [[jatropha]] plant.

As most 747-400s are now more than 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have been retiring the model, replacing it with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in most cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range, such as the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/boeing-747-heading-retirement/any-other-business/article/1360694|title=The Boeing 747 is heading for retirement|publisher=}}</ref> Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s ordered the [[Airbus A380]] rather than the updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].\n\nFor example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to [[Narita International Airport]] that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]].<ref>Schofield, Adriean, et al., Jumbos bow out, Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 15, 2014, pp. 21-22</ref> Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with [[Airbus A330]] or [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]] aircraft (both of which are twinjets). Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/042415/deltas-boeing-747s-are-flying-sunset-ba-dal-ual.aspx|title=Delta's Boeing 747s Are Flying Off Into the Sunset|publisher=Investopedia|date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, economic weakness in air cargo markets has slowed demand for cargo conversions. Since the cost of replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the {{not a typo|747-400}} to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta flew through a violent hailstorm, the company indicated it was likely the aircraft would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft's value before the incident at about $8 million.

The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional {{cvt|3240|USgal|L}} body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however, Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by [[Marshall Aerospace]], these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks feature a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200LR]] and [[Boeing P-8A Poseidon]]. Other changes to the 747-400ER include the relocation of oxygen system components and the [[potable water]] system tanks and pumps, since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.<ref name=\"auto\">Boeing Field Service Introduction Data 2012</ref>{{nonspecific|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe first 747-400ER was used as a test flight airplane and painted in Boeing colours, registration N747ER.

The flight test airplane was later refurbished, repainted in standard QANTAS livery, and registered as VH-OEE.

After the secession of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland changed its name to the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].}} Colonization efforts began in the 16th century with efforts by the Kingdom of England to establish colonies in [[North America]], but the first permanent British colony was established in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607. Over the next several centuries more colonies were established in North America, [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Though most British colonies in the Americas eventually gained independence, and kick Britons butt with farmers, some colonies have opted to remain under Britain's jurisdiction as [[British Overseas Territories]].\n\nNorth America had been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]]s for thousands of years of prior to 1492, but European exploration of North America began after [[Christopher Columbus]]'s 1492 expedition across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. English exploration of the continent commenced in the late 15th century, and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] established short-lived [[Roanoke Colony]] in 1585. With the settlement of Jamestown on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], the English established their first successful, permanent colony in North America, which became known as the [[Colony of Virginia]]. In 1620, a group of [[Puritans]] established a second permanent colony on the coast of [[Cape Cod]], and several other English colonies were established in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries. With the authorization of a royal charter, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] established the territory of [[Rupert's Land]] in the [[Hudson Bay drainage basin]]. The English also established or conquered several colonies in the [[Caribbean]], including [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]].\n\nEngland captured the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the mid-17th century, leaving North American divided among the English, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[French colonial empire|French empires]]. After decades of warring with France, Britain took control of the [[Canada (New France)|French colony of Canada]], as well as several Caribbean territories, in 1763. With the assistance of France and Spain, many of the North American colonies gained independence from Britain through victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], which ended in 1783. Historians sometimes refer to the British Empire after 1783 as the \"Second British Empire\"; this period saw Britain increasingly focus on Asia and Africa instead of the Americas, and increasingly focus on the expansion of trade rather than territorial possessions. Nonetheless, Britain continued to colonize parts of the Americas in the 19th century, taking control of [[British Columbia]] and establishing the colonies of the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[British Honduras]]. Britain also gained control of several colonies, including [[Trinidad]] and [[British Guiana]], following the defeat of France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Britain began the process of granting self-government to its remaining colonies in North America. Most of these colonies joined the Confederation of [[Canada]] in the 1860s or 1870s, though [[Newfoundland]] would not join Canada until 1949. Canada gained full autonomy following the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], though it retained various ties to Britain and still recognizes the British monarch as [[head of state]]. Following the onset of the [[Cold War]] most of the remaining British colonies in the Americas gained independence between 1962 and 1983.

After the secession of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland changed its name to the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].}} Colonization efforts began in the 16th century with efforts by the Kingdom of England to establish colonies in [[North America]], but the first permanent British colony was established in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607. Over the next several centuries more colonies were established in North America, [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Though most British colonies in the Americas eventually gained independence, some colonies have opted to remain under Britain's jurisdiction as [[British Overseas Territories]].\n\nNorth America had been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]]s for thousands of years of prior to 1492, but European exploration of North America began after [[Christopher Columbus]]'s 1492 expedition across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. English exploration of the continent commenced in the late 15th century, and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] established short-lived [[Roanoke Colony]] in 1585. With the settlement of Jamestown on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], the English established their first successful, permanent colony in North America, which became known as the [[Colony of Virginia]]. In 1620, a group of [[Puritans]] established a second permanent colony on the coast of [[Cape Cod]], and several other English colonies were established in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries. With the authorization of a royal charter, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] established the territory of [[Rupert's Land]] in the [[Hudson Bay drainage basin]]. The English also established or conquered several colonies in the [[Caribbean]], including [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]].\n\nEngland captured the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the mid-17th century, leaving North American divided among the English, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[French colonial empire|French empires]]. After decades of warring with France, Britain took control of the [[Canada (New France)|French colony of Canada]], as well as several Caribbean territories, in 1763. With the assistance of France and Spain, many of the North American colonies gained independence from Britain through victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], which ended in 1783. Historians sometimes refer to the British Empire after 1783 as the \"Second British Empire\"; this period saw Britain increasingly focus on Asia and Africa instead of the Americas, and increasingly focus on the expansion of trade rather than territorial possessions. Nonetheless, Britain continued to colonize parts of the Americas in the 19th century, taking control of [[British Columbia]] and establishing the colonies of the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[British Honduras]]. Britain also gained control of several colonies, including [[Trinidad]] and [[British Guiana]], following the defeat of France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Britain began the process of granting self-government to its remaining colonies in North America. Most of these colonies joined the Confederation of [[Canada]] in the 1860s or 1870s, though [[Newfoundland]] would not join Canada until 1949. Canada gained full autonomy following the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], though it retained various ties to Britain and still recognizes the British monarch as [[head of state]]. Following the onset of the [[Cold War]] most of the remaining British colonies in the Americas gained independence between 1962 and 1983. Many of the former British colonies are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a political association chiefly consisting of former colonies of the British Empire.\n\n==Background: early exploration and colonization of the Americas==\n{{Further|Pre-Columbian era|Age of Discovery|European colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Spanish Empire in 1598.png|thumb|upright=1.0|By the end of the 16th century, the [[Iberian Union]] of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] had colonized much of the [[Americas]], but other parts of the Americas had not yet been colonized by European powers]]\n\nFollowing the first voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] established colonies in the [[New World]], beginning the [[European colonization of the Americas]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 69-70</ref> [[France]] and [[England]], the two other major powers of 15th-century [[Western Europe]], employed explorers soon after the return of Columbus's first voyage. In 1497, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England dispatched an expedition led by [[John Cabot]] to explore the coast of North America, but the lack of precious metals or other riches discouraged both the Spanish and English from permanently settling in North America during the early 16th century.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 83-85</ref> Later explorers such as [[Martin Frobisher]] and [[Henry Hudson]] sailed to the New World in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] between the Atlantic Ocean and Asia, but were unable to find a viable route.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 121-123</ref> Europeans established [[Cod fishing in Newfoundland|fisheries]] in the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], and traded metal, glass, and cloth for food and fur, beginning the [[North American fur trade]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 129-130</ref> During mid-1585 [[Bernard Drake]] launched an [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|expedition to Newfoundland]] which crippled the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets there from which they never recovered. This would have consequences in terms of English colonial expansion and settlement.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Meanwhile, in the [[Caribbean Sea]], English sailors defied Spanish trade restrictions and preyed on [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish treasure ships]].<ref>James (1997), pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nIn the late sixteenth century, [[Protestant]] England became embroiled in a [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|religious war]] with [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Spain. Seeking to weaken Spain's economic and military power, English [[privateer]]s such as [[Francis Drake]] and [[Humphrey Gilbert]] harassed Spanish shipping.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 98-100</ref> Gilbert proposed the colonization of North America on the Spanish model, with the goal of creating a profitable English empire that could also serve as a base for the privateers. After Gilbert's death, [[Walter Raleigh]] took up the cause of North American colonization, sponsoring an expedition of 500 men to [[Roanoke Island]]. In 1584, the colonists established the first permanent English colony in North America,<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 100-102</ref> but the colonists were poorly prepared for life in the New World, and by 1590, the colonists had disappeared.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 103-107</ref> A separate colonization attempt in [[Newfoundland]] also failed.<ref>James (1997), p. 5</ref> Despite the failure of these early colonies, the English remained interested in the colonization of North America for economic and military reasons.<ref>Richter (2011), p. 112</ref>\n\n==Early colonization, 1607\u20131630==\n{{Further|English overseas possessions}}\n[[File:James I of England 404446.jpg|thumb|Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America, was established during the reign of King [[James VI and I|James I of England]]]]\n\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in North America.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account.

There is also a research-oriented language under development called Vyper (a [[Strong and weak typing|strongly-typed]] [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-derived [[Recursive language|decidable language]]).\n\nSmart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained [[provably fair]] casinos.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Piasecki |first=Piotr J. |year=2016 |title=Gaming Self-Contained Provably Fair Smart Contract Casinos |url=http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/29 |journal=[[Ledger (journal)|Ledger]] |volume=1 |pages=99\u2013110 |doi=10.5195/ledger.2016.29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224031048/http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/29 |archivedate=24 December 2016 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nOne issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.<ref name=\"Peck20160528\">{{cite web |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium |title=Ethereum's $150-Million Blockchain-Powered Fund Opens Just as Researchers Call For a Halt |first=M. |last=Peck |date=28 May 2016 |work=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530202345/https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium |archivedate=30 May 2016 }}</ref> One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.<ref name=\"NYTDAOHACK\" />\n\nThere is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account.

In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), which is a hybrid Proof of Work and Proof of Stake scheme, and Casper Correct-By-Construction (CBC), a separate Proof of Stake design of Casper, are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/06/11/ethereums-total-supply/|title=Ethereum's supply has crossed 100M, here's what that means|last=Varshney|first=Neer|date=11 June 2018|website=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web|language=en-us|access-date=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Markets and stores===\nEther can be traded by regular currency [[brokers]], [[cryptocurrency exchanges]], as well as many online [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fans-of-digital-currency-ether-can-now-buy-etns-in-sweden|title=Fans of Digital Currency Ether Can Now Buy ETNs\u2014In Sweden|author=Olga Kharif|date=11 October 2017|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n\n=== Virtual Machine ===\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.

The group released their first full-length mixtape, ''ShoreLineDoThatShit'', in November 2017. That album was re-released by Atlantic in May 2018. In August 2018, they also released an EP titled ''Party Pack'' through Atlantic. In September 2019, they released \u201cParty Pack Vol. 2\u201d through Atlantic Records as well.\n\n==History==\nShoreline Mafia was composed of 4 members: Ohgeesy (real name, Alejandro Carranza), Rob Vicious (Robert Magee), Fenix Flexin (Fenix Rypinski), Master Kato (Malik Carson).<ref name=\"UPR\">{{cite news | last=Williams| first=Aaron| title =Shoreline Mafia Gets A Big Budget Update For Their Raucous \u2018Musty\u2019 Video After Signing To Atlantic| newspaper =| publisher =Uproxx| date = 8 May 2018 | url =https://uproxx.com/hiphop/shoreline-mafia-musty-video/| accessdate =14 November 2018}}</ref> Ohgeesy and Fenix met in 2012 while doing [[graffiti]] in Los Angeles.

In February 2016, Harris signed a distribution deal with [[Roc Nation]] and later another deal with [[Epic Records]] in September 2018.

In November 2013, Harris announced that he had signed with [[Columbia Records]] after his 10-year contract with Atlantic came to an end. He released his Columbia debut ''[[Paperwork (T.I. album)|Paperwork]]'' in October 2014. In February 2016, Harris signed a distribution deal with [[Roc Nation]] and later another deal with [[Epic Records]] in September 2018.

My problem, or conflict, at the time, was now this is what I've been called all my life, what do I change my name to? So, I guess, that began to hold my project up. 'What are we gonna call him?' You know what I'm saying? So at that point we had to come to some sort of a resolution. And KP, who signed me to LaFace, he just said, 'OK, look man, how about T.I.?' Cause on this one record I had, it was like, 'T-I-P.' I was like, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute. No. That was \u2014 you left out a letter still!' You know what I'm saying?

The same day T.I. went on a [[Houston]], Texas radio station talking about the altercation. He revealed that he had the tape and he was going to release it with an upcoming mixtape, but that did not happen because [[James Prince]] stopped him from distributing the tape.

To move to the Netherlands in style befitting a governor, a strong army had to accompany him. Travel by ship from Spain was not an option as it would expose him to risk of battle with the Dutch navy in the then-ongoing [[Eighty Years' War]], so in 1633, he went to [[Genoa]], having quit his governorship of [[Catalonia]] where he had been trained.  He met with an army from Milan for a planned march through the famous [[Spanish Road|Spanish Way]] across [[Lombardy]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], and [[Swabia]], and then following the [[Rhine]] to the Netherlands. Ferdinand also planned to secure this supply route with a string of garrisons, and to support the army of King [[Ferdinand III of Hungary]], his brother-in-law the emperor's son and heir, who was leading the Imperial army facing the [[Gustavus Adolphus|Swedes]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nSince disease delayed his travels, he sent half of his army ahead under the command of the [[Gomez Suarez de Figueroa y C\u00f3rdoba, Duke of Feria|Duke of Feria]]. However, this army was severely depleted during fighting with the Swedish army of [[Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]] and [[Gustaf Horn]]. The Spanish requested 4000 cavalries from the Imperial general [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]], but this being denied, the Spanish had to fund the troops on their own. The Cardinal-Infante was able to continue his travels in 1634, collecting in [[Bavaria]] the remains of the army of G\u00f3mez Su\u00e1rez, who had died in January 1634.\n\n=== Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen ===\n{{Main article|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)}}\n\nMeanwhile, Ferdinand of Hungary was able to defeat the Swedish army at [[Regensburg]] in July 1634. Ferdinand and his cousin, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, then raced to merge their armies. The Swedish forces of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn desperately tried to prevent this merger but were unable to catch up with Ferdinand of Hungary. The Cardinal-Infante crossed the [[Danube]] in August 1634. In September, both armies were able to merge, and camped south of [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] in [[Swabia]]. At that time, N\u00f6rdlingen was protected by a small Swedish garrison. Shortly after that, the armies of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn also reached N\u00f6rdlingen, preparing the events for the decisive [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]]. Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand and his cousin [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] then prepared for battle, ignoring the advice of the more experienced generals, such as the Imperial general [[Matthias Gallas]]. Bernhard and Horn also prepared for battle, but they were by now rivals and in disagreement with each other. They also underestimated the numerically superior enemy forces, due to incorrect reports that did not realize the Spanish Army of the late Duke of Feria had joined the Cardinal-Infante and believed that the enemy forces numbered only 7,000, not 21,000 infantry, compared to 16,000 Swedish infantry. During the battle, almost anything that could go wrong went wrong for the Swedish forces, due to the strong defensive efforts of the Spanish Infantry (the most feared ''[[Tercios]] Viejos'', mainly those commanded by Fuenclara, Idi\u00e1quez and Toralto) after pushing back fifteen Swedish assaults against Blue and Yellow Horn regiments on the hill of Albuch they protected, so the two Ferdinands achieved a notable military victory. Gustaf Horn was captured, the Swedish army was destroyed, and the remainder that fled to [[Heilbronn]] was only a shadow of the former glorious army. As a whole, this battle proved that the deployment improvements devised by Maurice of Orange and the late Swedish King did not match the old Tercio yet when Spanish troops were engaged in the fighting.\n\n=== The Spanish Netherlands ===\n[[File:Archduke Ferdinand (1635) by Peter Paul Rubens. Ringling Museum.jpg|thumb|Archduke Ferdinand in 1635, depicted by Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens. Collection of John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]]\nThe King of Hungary tried to convince his cousin to stay and to strengthen their hold on Germany. Still, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand moved his troops almost immediately after the battle to continue to [[Brussels]]. At the end of 1634, he entered Brussels with all the glory befitting a Governor-General. Due to the unpopularity of the clergy in Brussels, he downplayed his religious status and instead emphasized his worldly ranks. Ferdinand was a skilled politician and diplomat and quickly reformed the government and the military. He especially managed to win the support of the [[Flemings]] against France. However, his powers were secretly limited, and the leader of his army was instructed to follow Spanish orders instead of Ferdinand's orders if necessary. \n\nIn 1635 the French attacked [[Namur (city)|Namur]], planning to merge with the Dutch near [[Maastricht]] but were held off by well-prepared defenses while Ferdinand brought the full weight of the Army of Flanders to bear on the Dutch invaders. At the siege of [[Leuven]], the invading Franco-Dutch forces suffered a major defeat, which allowed Spanish forces under Ferdinand to go on the offensive. The Dutch were driven back, and the French retreated. Ferdinand subsequently was able to capture [[Diest]], [[Goch]], [[Gennep]], [[Limbourg]], and [[Schenk]].\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria.svg|thumb|left|230px|Coat of Arms of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Spain.]]\n[[File:Antoon van den Heuvel - Ferdinand Receives the Keys of the City from the Virgin of Ghent.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|\"Ferdinand Receives the Keys of the City from the Virgin of Ghent,\" print after a painting made by [[Antoon van den Heuvel]] for the [[Joyous Entry]] by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand into [[Ghent]] in 1635]]\n\nIn 1636 Ferdinand disempowered the last Protestant priests in the Spanish Netherlands, and continued his military counter-offensive by capturing [[Hirson]], [[Le Catelet]], and [[La Capelle]], and securing [[Luxembourg]] using the usually mixed nationalities typical of the early modern age that included [[Croatia]]n troops, and reaching as far a stronghold in France as [[Corbie]], threatening Paris.\n\n=== Fall from grace ===\nWith Spanish forces concentrated in the fight with the French, a relatively lightly defended [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] was recaptured in 1637 after a 10-month siege by the [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]] after being under Spanish control for 12 years. The loss of Breda was a blow to Spanish prestige but of minor strategic importance compared to the gains made by Ferdinand that year by taking the towns of [[Venlo]] and [[Roermond]] in the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]], effectively cutting [[Maastricht]] from the Dutch Republic and, thus, preventing further Dutch attacks on the Spanish Netherlands from the east.<ref>Van Nimwegen, Olaf: ''The Dutch Army and the Military Revolutions, 1588-1688''.

Numerous rumors and lies floated about, and it was claimed that Ferdinand was planning to become an independent ruler of the Spanish Netherlands with the help of the French King, an enemy of Spain. This rumor was enhanced by another story that the French court was planning to marry Ferdinand to [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier]], the (eldest) daughter of [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], the French king's brother. The former claim was untrue; however his sister [[Anne of Austria]] did suggest a marriage between Ferdinand and Anne Marie Louise, the greatest heiress in Europe.\n\nAt the same time, the Spanish empire was in a bad state, both military and financially. The Cardinal-Infante was even given conflicting orders to send troops to Spain to aid against the 1640 [[Portuguese Restoration War|Portuguese uprising]].\n\n==Death==\nFerdinand fell ill during battles in 1641, and died on 9 November 1641 in [[Brussels]] at age 32.<ref>Griffis, William Elliot, ''Belgium: the land of art: its history, legends, industry and modern expansion'', (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1919), 231.</ref> It was thought that death was caused by exhaustion combined with ill health. Reports talk about a [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcer]], but rumors also claimed that he was [[poison]]ed. Before his death, he had an [[illegitimate]] daughter, Marie Anne de la Croix, born in Brussels in 1641 and died a [[nun]] in Madrid in 1715.\n\nHis body was brought to Spain in 1643, and 12,000 [[requiem Masses]] were performed following his last wishes. He was buried in the Pante\u00f3n de Infantes.\n\nDisputes about his successor as the Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands destroyed the alliance between the Emperor in [[Vienna]] and the Spanish in Madrid. The Emperor (by now the Cardinal-Infante's old comrade in arms, Ferdinand III) favored his brother [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], a militarily unfortunate but otherwise a capable ruler. Madrid preferred [[John of Austria the Younger]], the twelve-year-old illegitimate son of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and the actress [[Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n]]. The [[inauguration]] of the unpopular bastard was delayed, and the rule of the Spanish Netherlands was taken over by [[Francisco de Mello, Marquis of Terceira]].\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

To move to the Netherlands in a style befitting a governor, a strong army had to accompany him. Travel by ship from Spain was not an option as it would expose him to risk of battle with the Dutch navy in the then ongoing [[Eighty Years' War]], so in 1633, he went to [[Genoa]], having quit his governorship of [[Catalonia]] where he had been trained.  He met with an army from Milan for a planned march through the famous [[Spanish Road|Spanish Way]] across [[Lombardy]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], and [[Swabia]], and then following the [[Rhine]] to the Netherlands. Ferdinand also planned to secure this supply route with a string of garrisons, and to support the army of King [[Ferdinand III of Hungary]], his brother-in-law the emperor's son and heir, who was leading the Imperial army facing the [[Gustavus Adolphus|Swedes]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nSince disease delayed his travels, he sent half of his army ahead under the command of the [[Gomez Suarez de Figueroa y C\u00f3rdoba, Duke of Feria|Duke of Feria]]. However, this army was severely depleted during fighting with the Swedish army of [[Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]] and [[Gustaf Horn]]. The Spanish requested 4000 cavalry from the Imperial general [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]], but this being denied, the Spanish had to fund the troops on their own. The Cardinal-Infante was able to continue his travels in 1634, collecting in [[Bavaria]] the remains of the army of G\u00f3mez Su\u00e1rez, who had died in January 1634.\n\n=== Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen ===\n{{Main article|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)}}\n\nMeanwhile, Ferdinand of Hungary was able to defeat the Swedish army at [[Regensburg]] in July 1634. Ferdinand and his cousin the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand then raced to merge their armies. The Swedish forces of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn desperately tried to prevent this merger, but were unable to catch up with Ferdinand of Hungary. The Cardinal-Infante crossed the [[Danube]] in August 1634. In September both armies were able to merge, and camped south of [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] in [[Swabia]]. At that time N\u00f6rdlingen was protected by a small Swedish garrison. Shortly thereafter, the armies of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn also reached N\u00f6rdlingen, preparing the events for the decisive [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]]. Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand and his cousin [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] then prepared for battle, ignoring the advice of the more experienced generals, such as the Imperial general [[Matthias Gallas]]. Bernhard and Horn also prepared for battle, but they were by now rivals and in disagreement with each other. They also underestimated the numerically superior enemy forces, due to incorrect reports that did not realize the Spanish Army of the late Duke of Feria had joined the Cardinal-Infante and believed that the enemy forces numbered only 7,000, not 21,000 infantry, compared to 16,000 Swedish infantry. During the battle, almost anything that could go wrong went wrong for the Swedish forces, due to the strong defensive efforts of the Spanish Infantry (the most feared ''[[Tercios]] Viejos'', mainly those commanded by Fuenclara, Idi\u00e1quez and Toralto) after pushing back fifteen Swedish assaults against Blue and Yellow Horn regiments on the hill of Albuch they protected, so the two Ferdinands achieved an outstanding military victory. Gustaf Horn was captured, the Swedish army was destroyed, and the remainder that fled to [[Heilbronn]] was only a shadow of the former glorious army. As a whole this battle proved that the deployment improvements devised by Maurice of Orange and the late Swedish King did not match yet the old Tercio when Spanish troops were engaged in the fighting.\n\n=== The Spanish Netherlands ===\n[[File:Archduke Ferdinand (1635) by Peter Paul Rubens. Ringling Museum.jpg|thumb|Archduke Ferdinand in 1635 depicted by Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens. Collection of John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]]\nThe King of Hungary tried to convince his cousin to stay and to strengthen their hold on Germany, but the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand moved his troops almost immediately after the battle to continue to [[Brussels]]. At the end of 1634 he entered Brussels with all the glory befitting a Governor-General. Due to the unpopularity of the clergy in Brussels, he downplayed his religious status and instead emphasized his worldly ranks. Ferdinand was a skilled politician and diplomat, and quickly reformed the government and the military. He especially managed to win the support of the [[Flemings]] against France. However, his powers were secretly limited, and the leader of his army was instructed to follow Spanish orders instead of Ferdinand's orders if necessary. \n\nIn 1635 the French attacked [[Namur (city)|Namur]], planning to merge with the Dutch near [[Maastricht]] but were held off by well prepared defenses while Ferdinand brought the full weight of the Army of Flanders to bear on the Dutch invaders. At the siege of [[Leuven]], the invading Franco-Dutch forces suffered a major defeat which allowed Spanish forces under Ferdinand to go on the offensive. The Dutch were driven back and the French retreated.

The loss of Breda was a blow to Spanish prestige but of minor strategic importance compared to the gains made by Ferdinand that year by taking the towns of [[Venlo]] and [[Roermond]] in the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]], effectively cutting [[Maastricht]] from the Dutch Republic and, thus, preventing further Dutch attacks on the Spanish Netherlands from the east.<ref>Van Nimwegen, Olaf: ''The Dutch Army and the Military Revolutions, 1588-1688''.

Numerous rumors and lies floated about, and it was claimed that Ferdinand was planning to become an independent ruler of the Spanish Netherlands with the help of the French King, an enemy of Spain. This rumor was enhanced by another rumor that the French court was planning to marry Ferdinand to [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier]], the (eldest) daughter of [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], the French king's brother. The former claim was untrue however his sister [[Anne of Austria]] did suggest a marriage between Ferdinand and Anne Marie Louise, the greatest heiress in Europe .\n\nAt the same time, the Spanish empire was in a bad state both military and financially. The Cardinal-Infante was even given conflicting orders to send troops to Spain to aid against the 1640 [[Portuguese Restoration War|Portuguese uprising]].\n\n==Death==\nFerdinand fell ill during battles in 1641, and died on 9 November 1641 in [[Brussels]] at age 32.<ref>Griffis, William Elliot, ''Belgium: the land of art: its history, legends, industry and modern expansion'', (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1919), 231.</ref> It was thought that death was caused by exhaustion combined with ill health. Reports talk about a [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcer]], but rumors also claimed that he was [[poison]]ed. Before his death he had an [[illegitimate]] daughter, Marie Anne de la Croix, born in Brussels in 1641 and died a [[nun]] in Madrid in 1715.\n\nHis body was brought to Spain in 1643, and 12,000 [[requiem Masses]] were performed in accordance with his last wishes. He was buried in the Pante\u00f3n de Infantes.\n\nDisputes about his successor as the Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands destroyed the alliance between the Emperor in [[Vienna]] and the Spanish in Madrid. The Emperor (by now the Cardinal-Infante's old comrade in arms, Ferdinand III) favored his brother [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], a militarily unfortunate but otherwise a capable ruler. Madrid favored [[John of Austria the Younger]], the twelve-year-old illegitimate son of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and the actress [[Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n]]. The [[inauguration]] of the unpopular bastard was delayed, and the rule of the Spanish Netherlands was taken over by [[Francisco de Mello, Marquis of Terceira]].\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.
