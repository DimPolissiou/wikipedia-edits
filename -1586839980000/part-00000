Spacey began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s, obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the 1990s that culminated in his first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the [[neo-noir]] crime thriller ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the [[midlife crisis]]-themed drama ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999).\n\nSpacey's other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1994), the psychological thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), the neo-noir crime film ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997), the drama ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000), the science fiction-mystery film ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-PAX]]'' (2001), the musical biopic ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004), the superhero film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), and the action film ''[[Baby Driver]]'' (2017).\n\nIn [[Broadway theatre]], Spacey won a [[Tony Award]] in 1991 for his role in ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. In 2017, he hosted the [[71st Tony Awards]]. He was the artistic director of [[the Old Vic]] theatre in [[London]] from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. From 2013 to 2017, he played [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] in the [[Netflix]] political drama series ''[[House of Cards (American TV series)|House of Cards]]'', which won him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama]] and two consecutive [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series|Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]].\n\nIn October 2017, actor [[Anthony Rapp]] accused Spacey of making a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Numerous other men subsequently came forward alleging that Spacey had [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] or [[sexual assault|assaulted]] them. In December 2018, Spacey was charged with [[indecent assault|indecent assault and battery]] in relation to an accusation by anchorwoman [[Heather Unruh]] that he sexually assaulted her 18-year-old son, but by July 2019, the criminal charge had been dropped.\n\nAs a result of the allegations, Netflix cut ties with Spacey, shelving his film ''Gore'' and removing him from the last season of ''House of Cards''. Spacey's role as [[J. Paul Getty]] in [[Ridley Scott]]'s film ''[[All the Money in the World]]'' (2017) was reshot with actor [[Christopher Plummer]] in his place. In 2018, ''[[Billionaire Boys Club (2018 film)|Billionaire Boys Club]]'' (which had been completed before the allegations surfaced) was released with Spacey's role unchanged.\n\n==Early life==\nKevin Spacey Fowler was born in [[South Orange, New Jersey]], to Kathleen Ann (''n\u00e9e'' Knutson), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a [[technical writer]] and data consultant.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Fischer |title=The Alien World of Kevin Spacey |work=FilmMonthly |url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=October 20, 2001 |archivedate=January 24, 2007 |access-date=June 2, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124110051/http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=dlrehioho>(1990), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=92bJlWbPeKMC&q=Kevin+Spacey Fowler, Kevin Spacey]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Marquis Who's Who | title = Who's who in the world, 1991\u20131992 (Volume 10) |page=348 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | location = Wilmette, Illinois | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780837911106 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> Spacey has an older brother, Randy Fowler, who is a [[limousine]] driver and [[Rod Stewart]] impersonator in [[Boise, Idaho]], and a sister, Julie Ann Fowler Keir, an office worker.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Ashley|last=Feinberg|url=http://gawker.com/kevin-spaceys-brother-is-a-limo-driving-rod-stewart-imp-1728756763|title=Kevin Spacey's Brother Is a Limo-Driving Rod Stewart Impersonator in Boise|website=[[Gawker]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=April 9, 2015 |accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Randy Fowler Memoir\">{{Cite news |first=Kyle|last=Zach|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/business/article41570688.html |title=Meet Randy Fowler, Boise's Rod Stewart-impersonating, limo-driving brother of Kevin Spacey|newspaper=[[Idaho Statesman]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|location=Boise, Idaho|date=September 27, 2015|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref> His family relocated to [[Southern California]] when he was four years old.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/kevin-spacey-9489645 |title=Kevin Spacey Biography | website = biography.com |publisher=[[Biography (TV series)#A&E|A&E]] |access-date=November 15, 2015}}</ref> Randy Fowler (from whom Spacey is [[family estrangement|estranged]])<ref name=\"Estranged Brothers\">{{Cite news |first1=Nicole | last1=Blanchard | first2 = Dana |last2 = Oland|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/article181803111.html |title=Sex allegation against Spacey revives his Boise brother's story of their abusive dad |newspaper=[[Idaho Statesman]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|location=Boise, Idaho|date= October 30, 2017| accessdate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> has stated that their father, whom he described as a [[racism|racist]] \"[[Nazi]] supporter\", was [[child sexual abuse|sexually]] and [[physical abuse|physically abusive]], and that Spacey had shut down emotionally and become \"very sly and smart\" to avoid whippings.<ref>{{cite news | first = Maya| last = Oppenheim | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/kevin-spacey-brother-father-sexual-abuse-actor-randall-fowler-thomas-geoffrey-fowler-a8029776.html| title = Kevin Spacey's brother claims 'Nazi' father sexually abused him | newspaper = [[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|date = October 31, 2017 | accessdate = October 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSpacey attended Northridge Military Academy, [[Canoga Park High School]] in the 10th and 11th grades.

Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a [[Tony Award]] for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in [[Neil Simon]]'s Broadway hit ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known.<ref name=\"abc\" />\n\nSome of Spacey's early roles include a widowed, eccentric millionaire on ''[[L.A. Law]]''; the television miniseries ''[[The Murder of Mary Phagan]]'' (1988), opposite Lemmon; and the comedy ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]''. Spacey quickly developed a reputation as a [[character actor]], and was cast in bigger roles, including the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), one-half of a bickering [[Connecticut]] couple in the [[dark comedy]] film ''[[The Ref]]'' (1994), and a malicious [[Hollywood]] studio boss in the satire ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1995), gaining him positive notices by critics.

Spacey made his directorial debut with the film ''[[Albino Alligator]]'' (1996). The film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $339,379 with a budget of $6&nbsp;million, but critics praised Spacey's direction.

The latter was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, co-producing and starring duties in the biography/musical about Darin's life, career and relationship with actress [[Sandra Dee]]. Facing little interest for backing in the U.S., Spacey went to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]] for funding. Almost all of the film was made in [[Berlin]].<ref name=\"parade\" /> Spacey provided his own vocals on the film's soundtrack and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of its release. Spacey received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance.

Spacey began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s, obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the 1990s that culminated in his first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the [[neo-noir]] crime thriller ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the [[midlife crisis]]-themed drama ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999).\n\nSpacey's other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1994), the psychological thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), the neo-noir crime film ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997), the drama ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000), the science fiction-mystery film ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-PAX]]'' (2001), the musical biopic ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004), the superhero film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), and the action film ''[[Baby Driver]]'' (2017).\n\nIn [[Broadway theatre]], Spacey won a [[Tony Award]] in 1991 for his role in ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. In 2017, he hosted the [[71st Tony Awards]]. He was the artistic director of [[the Old Vic]] theatre in [[London]] from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. From 2013 to 2017, he played [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] in the [[Netflix]] political drama series ''[[House of Cards (American TV series)|House of Cards]]'', which won him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama]] and two consecutive [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series|Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]].\n\nIn October 2017, actor [[Anthony Rapp]] accused Spacey of making a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Numerous other men subsequently came forward alleging that Spacey had [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] or [[sexual assault|assaulted]] them.

Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"[[modesty|modestly]]\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\n[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n:<blockquote>\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'\"</blockquote>In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> How gender roles are honored is largely cultural.

It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.<ref name=\":1\" /> Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages.<ref name=\":1\"/> Traditional gendered roles view the man as a \u201cpro-creator, a protector, and a provider,\u201d and the woman as \u201cpretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.\u201d <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Marriage and Families: Changes, Choices, and Constrains|last=Benokraits|first=Nijole|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn=978-0-13-034177-8|location=New Jersey|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/marriagesfamilie0004beno}}</ref> Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views.

Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings.

Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179\u2013180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}</ref>\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]].

These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.\n\nIt has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aubrey |first1=Jennifer Stevens |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |title=The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions. |journal=Media Psychology |date=May 2004 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013142 |doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1}}</ref> In another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited, the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960 is examined. While studies between 1960 and 1990 show an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children's television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.</ref>\n\n====Changing gender roles in marriage====\nOver the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.<ref name=\":0\"/> \n\nAfter around the year 1980, divorce rates in the United States stabilized.<ref name=\":03\">{{cite journal | last1 = Greenstein | first1 = Theodore N | year = 1995| title = Gender Ideology, Marital Disruption, and the Employment of Married Women | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 31\u201342 | doi = 10.2307/353814 | jstor = 353814 }}</ref> Scholars in the area of sociology explain that this stabilization was due to several factors including, but not limited to, the shift in gender roles,.

Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\n* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,\n* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and\n* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722\u201341 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles.

In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\".<ref name=\"Bag\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641\u201372 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}</ref> The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups \u2014 for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\n\n==Communication==\n{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\n\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}</ref> Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.<ref>DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough.

She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\n\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A.

Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.\n\nGender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the \u201cGender Labeling Test\u201d, had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]].

Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.\n\nThese implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the [[Implicit-association test]] (IAT).\n\nOne example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females.

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities.

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"<ref>''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}</ref>\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]\u2019s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, \u201cabasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\u201d<ref>Shuttleworth, Sally. \"Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era.\" Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science.

In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].\n\nMany leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.\n\nChristian traditions that officially recognize \"[[saint]]s\", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the [[beatific vision]] ([[heaven]]), do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair.

It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.<ref name=\":1\" /> Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals.

The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179\u2013180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}</ref>\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]].

Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.</ref>\n\n====Changing gender roles in marriage====\nOver the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.<ref name=\":0\"/> \n\nAfter around the year 1980, divorce rates in the United States stabilized.<ref name=\":03\">{{cite journal | last1 = Greenstein | first1 = Theodore N | year = 1995| title = Gender Ideology, Marital Disruption, and the Employment of Married Women | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 31\u201342 | doi = 10.2307/353814 | jstor = 353814 }}</ref> Scholars in the area of sociology explain that this stabilization was due to several factors including, but not limited to, the shift in gender roles,. The attitude concerning the shift in gender roles can be classified into two perspectives: traditional and egalitarian.

Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A.

The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the \u201cGender Labeling Test\u201d, had more traditional family values.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]]. The media tends to focus on the seductress woman's sex appeal and physical appearance in opposition to her policy stances and [[rhetoric]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlin|first=Diana B.|authorlink=Diana Carlin|date=Fall 2009|title=Have You Come a Long Way, Baby?

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities.

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary.

In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

Therefore, lesbians, gay men and bisexual people may be viewed as exempt from some or all components of gender roles or as having different \"rules\" they are expected to follow by society.\n\nThese modified \"rules\" for lesbian, gay and bisexual people may also be oppressive.

Recently, frameworks allow the development of native apps for all platforms using languages other than each standard native language. \n* Hybrid apps embed a mobile web site inside a native app, possibly using a hybrid framework.  This allows development using web technologies (and possibly directly copying code from an existing mobile web site) while also retaining certain advantages of native apps (e.g. direct access to device hardware, offline operation, app store visibility).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\nIn earlier computing models like client\u2013server, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally.  In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client program which served as its [[user interface]] and had to be separately installed on each user's [[personal computer]]. An upgrade to the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the [[technical support|support]] cost and decreasing [[productivity]].  In addition, both the client and server components of the application were usually tightly bound to a particular [[computer architecture]] and [[operating system]] and [[porting]] them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest applications.  (Nowadays, [[native app]]s for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or all of the foregoing issues.)\n\nIn contrast, web applications use [[web document]]s written in a standard format such as [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]], which are supported by a variety of web browsers. Web applications can be considered as a specific variant of client\u2013server software where the client software is downloaded to the client machine when visiting the relevant web page, using standard procedures such as [[HTTP]]. Client web software updates may happen each time the web page is visited. During the session, the web browser interprets and displays the pages, and acts as the ''universal'' client for any web application.\n\nIn the early days of the [[World Wide Web|Web]], each individual web page was delivered to the client as a static document, but the sequence of pages could still provide an interactive experience, as user input was returned through web [[Form (web)|form]] elements embedded in the page markup. However, ''every'' significant change to the web page required a round trip back to the server to refresh the entire page.\n\nIn 1995, [[Netscape]] introduced a [[client-side scripting]] language called [[JavaScript]] allowing programmers to add some [[Dynamic HTML|dynamic elements]] to the user interface that ran on the client side. So instead of sending data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation or showing/hiding parts of the page.\n\nIn 1996, Macromedia introduced [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], a [[vector graphics|vector animation]] player that could be added to browsers as a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] to embed animations on the web pages. It allowed the use of a scripting language to program interactions on the client side with no need to communicate with the server.\n\nIn 1999, the \"web application\" concept was introduced in the Java language in the Servlet Specification version 2.2. [2.1?].<ref name=\"jgurufaq\">{{cite web | url = http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=129328 | title = What is a web application (or \"webapp\")? | author = Alex Chaffee | date = 2000-08-17 | accessdate = 2008-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url = http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html | title = Java Servlet Specification (\"Specification\") Version: 2.2 Final Release | author = James Duncan Davidson, Danny Coward | publisher = [[Sun Microsystems]] | pages = 43\u201346 | date = 1999-12-17 | accessdate = 2008-07-27}}</ref> At that time both JavaScript and [[XML]] had already been developed, but [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] had still not yet been coined and the [[XMLHttpRequest]] object had only been recently introduced on Internet Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object.<ref name=\"apple\">{{cite web |url = https://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html | title = Dynamic HTML and XML: The XMLHttpRequest Object | publisher = Apple Inc | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the term Ajax was coined, and applications like [[Gmail]] started to make their client sides more and more interactive. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page.\n\nIn 2011, [[HTML5]] was finalized, which provides graphic and multimedia capabilities without the need of client side plug-ins. HTML5 also enriched the semantic content of documents. The APIs and [[document object model]] (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. [[WebGL]] API paved the way for advanced 3D graphics based on HTML5 canvas and JavaScript language. These have significant importance in creating truly platform and browser independent [[Rich Internet application|rich web applications]].\n\n==Interface==\nThrough [[Java (Sun)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[DHTML]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] and other technologies, application-specific methods such as drawing on the screen, playing audio, and access to the keyboard and mouse are all possible. Many services have worked to combine all of these into a more familiar interface that adopts the appearance of an operating system. General purpose techniques such as [[drag and drop]] are also supported by these technologies. Web developers often use client-side scripting to add functionality, especially to create an interactive experience that does not require page reloading. Recently, technologies have been developed to coordinate client-side scripting with server-side technologies such as [[ASP.NET]], [[J2ee|J2EE]], [[Plack (software)|Perl/Plack]] and [[PHP]].\n\n[[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], a web development technique using a combination of various technologies, is an example of technology which creates a more interactive experience.\n\n==Structure==\nApplications are usually broken into logical chunks called \"tiers\", where every tier is assigned a role.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Traditional applications consist only of 1 tier, which resides on the client machine, but web applications lend themselves to an n-tiered approach by nature.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the [[Three-tier (computing)|three-tiered]] application.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> In its most common form, the three tiers are called ''presentation'', ''application'' and ''storage'', in this order. A web browser is the first tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such as [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], [[ColdFusion]], [[Dart (programming language)|Dart]], [[Java Servlet|JSP/Java]], [[Node.js]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Ruby on Rails]]) is the middle tier (application logic), and a database is the third tier (storage).<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface. \n\nFor more complex applications, a 3-tier solution may fall short, and it may be beneficial to use an n-tiered approach, where the greatest benefit is breaking the business logic, which resides on the application tier, into a more fine-grained model.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Another benefit may be adding an integration tier that separates the data tier from the rest of tiers by providing an easy-to-use interface to access the data.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> For example, the client data would be accessed by calling a \"list_clients()\" function instead of making an SQL query directly against the client table on the database. This allows the underlying database to be replaced without making any change to the other tiers.<ref name=\"ntiered\" />\n\nThere are some who view a web application as a two-tier architecture. This can be a \"smart\" client that performs all the work and queries a \"dumb\" server, or a \"dumb\" client that relies on a \"smart\" server.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> The client would handle the presentation tier, the server would have the database (storage tier), and the business logic (application tier) would be on one of them or on both.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> While this increases the scalability of the applications and separates the display and the database, it still doesn't allow for true specialization of layers, so most applications will outgrow this model.<ref name=\"ntiered\">{{cite web|url=http://krunal-ajax-javascript.blogspot.bg/2008/09/benefits-of-using-n-tiered-approach-for.html|title=Benefits of using the n-tiered approach for web applications|author=Jeremy Petersen|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Business use==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n\nAn emerging strategy for application software companies is to provide web access to software previously distributed as local applications.  Depending on the type of application, it may require the development of an entirely different browser-based interface, or merely adapting an existing application to use different presentation technology. These programs allow the user to pay a monthly or yearly fee for use of a software application without having to install it on a local hard drive. A company which follows this strategy is known as an [[application service provider]] (ASP), and ASPs are currently receiving much attention in the software industry.\n\nSecurity breaches on these kinds of applications are a major concern because it can involve both enterprise information and private customer data. Protecting these assets is an important part of any web application and there \nare some key operational areas that must be included in the development process.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/secure-app-development.aspx|title= Top Tips for Secure App Development|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref> This includes processes for authentication, authorization, asset handling, input, and logging and auditing. Building security into the applications from the beginning can be more effective and less disruptive in the long run.\n\n[[Cloud computing]] model web applications are [[software as a service]] (SaaS). There are business applications provided as SaaS for enterprises for a fixed or usage-dependent fee. Other web applications are offered free of charge, often generating income from advertisements shown in web application interface.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Web application development}}\nWriting web applications is often simplified by the use of [[web application framework]]. These frameworks facilitate [[rapid application development]] by allowing a development team to focus on the parts of their application which are unique to their goals without having to resolve common development issues such as user management.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Web_application_framework | title=Web application framework | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-06 }}</ref> Many of the frameworks in use are [[open-source software]].\n\nThe use of web application frameworks can often reduce the number of errors in a program, both by making the code simpler, and by allowing one team to concentrate on the framework while another focuses on a specified use case.  In applications which are exposed to constant [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] attempts on the Internet, [[Software Development Security|security-related]] problems can be caused by errors in the program. Frameworks can also promote the use of best practices<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Framework | title=Framework | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-06 }}</ref> such as [[Post/Redirect/Get|GET after POST]].\n\nIn addition, there is potential for the development of applications on [[Internet operating system]]s, although currently there are not many viable platforms that fit this model.\n\n==Applications==\nExamples of browser applications are simple office software ([[word processor]]s, [[List of online spreadsheets|online spreadsheets]], see how to convert excel to a web app<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nocodeappbuilder.fastmoneynews.com/make-excel-look-like-an-application/|title=Make excel look like an application|date=2020-04-09|website=No Code App Builder|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> and [[Web based presentation tools|presentation tools]]), but can also include more advanced applications such as project management, [[computer-aided design]], [[video editing]], and [[Point of sale|point-of-sale]].\n\n<br />\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Internet}}\n*[[Software as a service|Software as a service (SaaS)]]\n*[[Web 2.0]]\n*[[Web engineering]]\n*[[Web service]]s\n*[[Web Science]]s\n*[[Web widget]]\n*[[Single-page application]]\n*[[Ajax (programming)]]\n*[[Web development tools]]\n*[[Browser game]]\n* [[API economy]]\n* [[Mobile app]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Web-based applications}}\n*[http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/ HTML5 Draft recommendation],  changes to HTML and related APIs to ease authoring of web-based applications.\n*[http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html The Other Road Ahead] &mdash; An article arguing that the future lies on the server, not rich interfaces on the client\n*{{Curlie|Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Web_Applications|Web Applications}}\n*[http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/ Web Applications Working Group] at the [http://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium] (W3C)\n\n{{Web interfaces}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Web Application}}\n[[Category:Software architecture]]\n[[Category:Web applications| ]]\n[[Category:Web development]]\n[[Category:User interface techniques]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Horde-portal.png|thumb|[[Horde (software)|Horde]] [[groupware]] is an [[open-source software|open-source]] web application.]]\nIn computing, a '''web application''' or '''web app''' is a [[Client\u2013server model|client\u2013server]] [[computer program]] that the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser.

HTML5 also enriched the semantic content of documents. The APIs and [[document object model]] (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. [[WebGL]] API paved the way for advanced 3D graphics based on HTML5 canvas and JavaScript language. These have significant importance in creating truly platform and browser independent [[Rich Internet application|rich web applications]].\n\n==Interface==\nThrough [[Java (Sun)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[DHTML]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] and other technologies, application-specific methods such as drawing on the screen, playing audio, and access to the keyboard and mouse are all possible. Many services have worked to combine all of these into a more familiar interface that adopts the appearance of an operating system. General purpose techniques such as [[drag and drop]] are also supported by these technologies. Web developers often use client-side scripting to add functionality, especially to create an interactive experience that does not require page reloading. Recently, technologies have been developed to coordinate client-side scripting with server-side technologies such as [[ASP.NET]], [[J2ee|J2EE]], [[Plack (software)|Perl/Plack]] and [[PHP]].\n\n[[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], a web development technique using a combination of various technologies, is an example of technology which creates a more interactive experience.\n\n==Structure==\nApplications are usually broken into logical chunks called \"tiers\", where every tier is assigned a role.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Traditional applications consist only of 1 tier, which resides on the client machine, but web applications lend themselves to an n-tiered approach by nature.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the [[Three-tier (computing)|three-tiered]] application.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> In its most common form, the three tiers are called ''presentation'', ''application'' and ''storage'', in this order. A web browser is the first tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such as [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], [[ColdFusion]], [[Dart (programming language)|Dart]], [[Java Servlet|JSP/Java]], [[Node.js]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Ruby on Rails]]) is the middle tier (application logic), and a database is the third tier (storage).<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface.\n\nFor more complex applications, a 3-tier solution may fall short, and it may be beneficial to use an n-tiered approach, where the greatest benefit is breaking the business logic, which resides on the application tier, into a more fine-grained model.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Another benefit may be adding an integration tier that separates the data tier from the rest of tiers by providing an easy-to-use interface to access the data.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> For example, the client data would be accessed by calling a \"list_clients()\" function instead of making an SQL query directly against the client table on the database. This allows the underlying database to be replaced without making any change to the other tiers.<ref name=\"ntiered\" />\n\nThere are some who view a web application as a two-tier architecture. This can be a \"smart\" client that performs all the work and queries a \"dumb\" server, or a \"dumb\" client that relies on a \"smart\" server.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> The client would handle the presentation tier, the server would have the database (storage tier), and the business logic (application tier) would be on one of them or on both.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> While this increases the scalability of the applications and separates the display and the database, it still doesn't allow for true specialization of layers, so most applications will outgrow this model.<ref name=\"ntiered\">{{cite web|url=http://krunal-ajax-javascript.blogspot.bg/2008/09/benefits-of-using-n-tiered-approach-for.html|title=Benefits of using the n-tiered approach for web applications|author=Jeremy Petersen|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Business use==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n\nAn emerging strategy for application software companies is to provide web access to software previously distributed as local applications.  Depending on the type of application, it may require the development of an entirely different browser-based interface, or merely adapting an existing application to use different presentation technology. These programs allow the user to pay a monthly or yearly fee for use of a software application without having to install it on a local hard drive. A company which follows this strategy is known as an [[application service provider]] (ASP), and ASPs are currently receiving much attention in the software industry.\n\nSecurity breaches on these kinds of applications are a major concern because it can involve both enterprise information and private customer data. Protecting these assets is an important part of any web application and there \nare some key operational areas that must be included in the development process.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/secure-app-development.aspx|title= Top Tips for Secure App Development|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref> This includes processes for authentication, authorization, asset handling, input, and logging and auditing. Building security into the applications from the beginning can be more effective and less disruptive in the long run.\n\n[[Cloud computing]] model web applications are [[software as a service]] (SaaS). There are business applications provided as SaaS for enterprises for a fixed or usage-dependent fee. Other web applications are offered free of charge, often generating income from advertisements shown in web application interface.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Web application development}}\nWriting web applications is often simplified by the use of [[web application framework]]. These frameworks facilitate [[rapid application development]] by allowing a development team to focus on the parts of their application which are unique to their goals without having to resolve common development issues such as user management.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Web_application_framework | title=Web application framework | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-06 }}</ref> Many of the frameworks in use are [[open-source software]].\n\nThe use of web application frameworks can often reduce the number of errors in a program, both by making the code simpler, and by allowing one team to concentrate on the framework while another focuses on a specified use case.  In applications which are exposed to constant [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] attempts on the Internet, [[Software Development Security|security-related]] problems can be caused by errors in the program. Frameworks can also promote the use of best practices<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Framework | title=Framework | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-06 }}</ref> such as [[Post/Redirect/Get|GET after POST]].\n\nIn addition, there is potential for the development of applications on [[Internet operating system]]s, although currently there are not many viable platforms that fit this model.\n\n==Applications==\nExamples of browser applications are simple office software ([[word processor]]s, [[List of online spreadsheets|online spreadsheets]], and [[Web based presentation tools|presentation tools]]), but can also include more advanced applications such as project management, [[computer-aided design]], [[video editing]], and [[Point of sale|point-of-sale]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Internet}}\n*[[Software as a service|Software as a service (SaaS)]]\n*[[Web 2.0]]\n*[[Web engineering]]\n*[[Web service]]s\n*[[Web Science]]s\n*[[Web widget]]\n*[[Single-page application]]\n*[[Ajax (programming)]]\n*[[Web development tools]]\n*[[Browser game]]\n* [[API economy]]\n* [[Mobile app]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Web-based applications}}\n*[http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/ HTML5 Draft recommendation],  changes to HTML and related APIs to ease authoring of web-based applications.\n*[http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html The Other Road Ahead] &mdash; An article arguing that the future lies on the server, not rich interfaces on the client\n*{{Curlie|Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Web_Applications|Web Applications}}\n*[http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/ Web Applications Working Group] at the [http://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium] (W3C)\n\n{{Web interfaces}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Web Application}}\n[[Category:Software architecture]]\n[[Category:Web applications| ]]\n[[Category:Web development]]\n[[Category:User interface techniques]]\n", "name_user": "Nocodeappbuilder", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:see an example of excel to web app", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application"}

Currently, it is maintained as an open-source project hosted on GitHub.<ref>[https://github.com/artoolkit ARToolKit GitHub page.]</ref> ARToolKit is a very widely used AR tracking library with over 160,000 downloads on its last public release in 2004.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=116280&ugn=artoolkit&type=prdownload ARToolKit download statistics.]</ref>{{Obsolete source|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn order to create strong augmented reality, it uses video tracking capabilities that calculate the real camera position and orientation relative to square physical markers or natural feature markers in real time. Once the real camera position is known a virtual camera can be positioned at the same point and 3D computer graphics models drawn exactly overlaid on the real marker.

The first little pig builds a house of [[straw]], but a wolf blows it down and devours him. The second little pig builds a house of [[Branch|sticks]], which the wolf also blows down, and the second little pig is also devoured. Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases, namely: \n\n{{poemquote|\"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"\n\"No, no, by the hair on my chinny chin chin.\"\n\"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite book | title = English Fairy Tales | first = Joseph| last = Jacobs | publisher = Oxford University | year = 1890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-EOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA69 | pages = 69}}</ref>}}\n\nThe third little pig builds a house of [[brick]]s, which the wolf fails to blow down. He then attempts to trick the pig out of the house by asking to meet him at various places, but he is outwitted each time. Finally, the wolf resolves to come down the [[chimney]], whereupon the pig catches the wolf in a [[Cookware and bakeware|pot]] of boiling water, slams the lid on, then cooks and eats him.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn some versions, the first and second little pigs are not eaten by the wolf after he demolishes their homes, but instead run to their brother's/sister's house, and after the wolf goes down the chimney he either dies like in the original, or runs away and never returns to eat the three little pigs, who all survive in either case.\n\nThe story uses the literary [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]], expressed in this case as a \"contrasting three\", as the third pig's brick house turns out to be the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.<ref>{{cite book|title = [[The Seven Basic Plots|The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories]] | first = Christopher | last= Booker | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 2005 | pages = 230\u2013231 | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujDvUEpY10C&pg=PA230 | chapter = The Rule of Three}}</ref>\nVariations of the tale appeared in ''[[Uncle Remus]]: His Songs and Sayings'' in 1881. The story also made an appearance in ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' in 1883, both by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], in which the pigs were replaced by [[Brer Rabbit]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]'', published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing interaction between them. The antagonist of this version is a fox, not a wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.\n\n==Later adaptations==\n\n===Disney cartoon===\n{{Main|The Three Little Pigs (film)}}\nThe most well-known version of the story {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} is the award-winning 1933 ''[[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon, which was produced by [[Walt Disney]]. The production cast the title characters as ''Fifer Pig'', ''Fiddler Pig'', and ''Practical Pig''. The first two are depicted as both frivolous and arrogant. The story has been somewhat softened. The first two pigs still get their houses blown down, but escape from the wolf. Also, the wolf is not boiled to death but simply burns his behind and runs away. Three sequels soon followed in 1934, 1936 and 1939 respectively as a result of the short film's popularity.\n\nFifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf appeared in the 2001 series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' in many episodes, and again in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. The three pigs can be seen in [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as greetable characters.<ref name=Waldman>{{cite journal|title=In search of the real three little pigs - different versions of the story 'The Three Little Pigs' |magazine=Washington Monthly |date=November 1996 |first=Steven |last=Waldman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134443/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Warner Brothers and MGM versions===\nIn 1943, there was a [[Merrie Melodies]] version, ''[[Pigs in a Polka]]'', which was a serious musical treatment, plus the usual [[Friz Freleng]] visual humor. It parodies both the Disney version, and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' itself.\n\nOther versions of the tale were also made. One was an [[MGM]] [[Tex Avery]] cartoon named ''[[Blitz Wolf]]'', a 1942 wartime version with the Wolf as a Nazi. Another animated spoof was a 1952 [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon called ''[[The Turn-Tale Wolf]]'', directed by Robert McKimson. This cartoon tells the story from the wolf's point of view and makes the pigs out to be the villains. Another Warner Brothers spoof was [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[The Three Little Bops]]'' (1957), which depicts the three little pigs as jazz musicians who refuse to let the wolf join their band and their \"houses\" as the nightclubs they play at, each named accordingly.\n\n===Subsequent retellings===\nOne of [[Uncle Remus]]' stories, \"The Story of the Pigs\" (alt. title: \"Brer Wolf and the Pigs\"), found in ''Nights with Uncle Remus'' (1883), is a re-telling of the story, with the following differences:\n* There are five pigs in this version: Big Pig, Little Pig, Speckle Pig, Blunt and Runt.\n* Blunt is the only male; all the rest are females.\n* Big Pig builds a brush house, Little Pig builds a stick house, Speckle Pig builds a mud house, Blunt builds a plank house and Runt builds a stone house.   \n* The Wolf's verse goes: ''\"If you'll open the door and let me in, I'll warm my hands and go home again.\"''\n\nIn 1953, [[Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins]] narrated a jazz version of The Three Little Pigs on a Brunswick Records 78 r.p.m. record album titled \"steve allen's grimm fairy tales for hip kids\" with piano blues accompaniment by Lou Stein. Also in 1953, Tex Avery did a [[Droopy]] cartoon, \"The Three Little Pups\". In it, the wolf is a [[Southern American English|Southern-accented]] dog catcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) trying to catch Droopy and his brothers, Snoopy and Loopy, to put in the dog pound. Though successfully blowing the first two houses down, he meets his match when he fails to blow down Droopy's house of bricks. The dog catcher makes several failed attempts to destroy the house and catch the pups. His last failed attempt ends with him \"going into television\" where he is playing a cowboy on the TV show the pups were watching.\n\nIn 1985, the story was re-told as the first episode of Season Four of ''[[Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', with [[Billy Crystal]] as artistic \"Larry Pig\" (the smart third pig), [[Jeff Goldblum]] as henpecked \"Buck Wolf\", [[Stephen Furst]] as capitalistic \"Peter Pig\" (the first pig), [[Fred Willard]] as [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] \"Paul Pig\" (the second pig), [[Doris Roberts]] as \"Mother Pig\" and [[Valerie Perrine]] as love interest \"Tina Pig\". In this version, all three pigs buy their building materials from the same junk salesman ([[Larry Hankin]]). \n\nThe 1989 parody ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'' is presented as a first-person narrative by the wolf, who portrays the entire incident as a misunderstanding; he had gone to the pigs to borrow some sugar, had destroyed their houses in a sneezing fit, ate the first two pigs to not waste food (since they'd died in the house collapse anyway), and was caught attacking the third pig's house after the pig had continually insulted him.<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\nThe 1992 [[Green Jell\u00f6]] song, ''[[Three Little Pigs (song)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (and its [[claymation]] music video) sets the story in [[Los Angeles]]. The wolf drives a [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle, the first little pig is an aspiring [[guitarist]], the second is a [[cannabis smoking]], [[dumpster diving]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and the third holds a [[Master of Architecture]] degree from [[Harvard University]]. In the end, with all three pigs barricaded in the brick house, the third pig calls [[9-1-1]]. [[John Rambo]] is dispatched to the scene, and kills the wolf with a [[machine gun]].\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''[[The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig]]'' inverts the cast and makes a few changes to the plot: the wolves build a brick house, then a concrete house, then a steel house, and finally a house of flowers. The pig is unable to blow the houses down, destroying them by other means, but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house, and becomes friends with the wolves.\n\nIn one [[Shining Time Station]] episode, ''Schemer's Alone'', Midge Smoot reads a version of this story to Schemer who paid her an [[IOU]] instead of real money, despite the fact that he's tricking his friends.\n\n[[List_of_Shrek_characters#Three_Little_Pigs|The three pigs]] and the [[List_of_Shrek_characters#The_Big_Bad_Wolf|wolf]] appear in the four [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' films]], and the specials ''[[Shrek the Halls]]'' and ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Belgium|Flemish]] company [[Studio 100]] created a musical called ''Three Little Pigs'' ({{lang-nl|De 3 Biggetjes}}), which follows the three daughters of the pig with the house of stone with new original songs, introducing a completely new story loosely based on the original story. The musical was specially written for the band [[K3 (band)|K3]], who play the three little pigs, Pirky, Parky and Porky ({{lang-nl|Knirri, Knarri and Knorri}}).<ref name=\"DiscogsK3\">{{cite web |title=De 3 Biggetjes* - Studio 100 Cd-Collectie 3/10 - Het Beste Van De 3 Biggetjes ! |url=https://www.discogs.com/De-3-Biggetjes-Studio-100-Cd-Collectie-310-Het-Beste-Van-De-3-Biggetjes-/release/2858284 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=2018-11-21 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"BOLK3\">{{cite web |title=bol.com {{!}} De 3 Biggetjes, Various {{!}} CD (album) {{!}} Muziek |url=https://www.bol.com/nl/p/de-3-biggetjes/1000004003213480/ |publisher=[[bol.com]] |accessdate=2018-11-21 |language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Peter Lund]] let the three little pigs live together in a village in the musical ''[[Grimm (musical)|Grimm]]'' with [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and other fairy tale characters.\n\nIn 2019, Simon Hood published a contemporary version of the story where the three little pig characters were both [[male]] and [[female]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sooperbooks.com/story/the-three-little-pigs-story/|title=Story Of The Three Little Pigs (Free) {{!}} SooperBooks\u00a9 [2019 Award-winners]|website=Sooper Books|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> Both the [[language]] and the [[Illustration|illustrations]] modernised the story, while the plot itself remained close to traditional versions.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource}}\n{{Commons category|Three little pigs}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=z2oKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=pig&f=false The nursery rhymes of England By James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps], pp.&nbsp;37\u201341 on [[books.google.com]]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/nurseryrhymesofe00hall#page/37/mode/1up The Story of the Three Little Pigs] in The nursery rhymes of England, by Halliwell, pp.&nbsp;37\u201341 on [[Archive.org]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081219171434/http://www.shol.com/agita/pigpsych.htm The Three Little Pigs: Pleasure principle versus reality principle], from: ''[[The Uses of Enchantment|The Uses of Enchantment, The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales]]'', by Bruno Bettelheim, Vintage Books, NY, 1975\n* [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0124.html 19th century versions of the Three Little Pigs story]\n* {{librivox book|title=The Three Little Pigs|author=L.

Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases, namely: \n\n{{poemquote|\"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"\n\"No, no, by the hair on my chinny chin chin.\"\n\"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite book | title = English Fairy Tales | first = Joseph| last = Jacobs | publisher = Oxford University | year = 1890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-EOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA69 | pages = 69}}</ref>}}\n\nThe third little pig builds a house of [[brick]]s, which the wolf fails to blow down. He then attempts to trick the pig out of the house by asking to meet him at various places, but he is outwitted each time. Finally, the wolf resolves to come down the [[chimney]], whereupon the pig catches the wolf in a [[Cookware and bakeware|pot]] of boiling water, slams the lid on, then cooks and eats him.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn some versions, the first and second little pigs are not eaten by the wolf after he demolishes their homes, but instead run to their brother's/sister's house, and after the wolf goes down the chimney he either dies like in the original, or runs away and never returns to eat the three little pigs, who all survive in either case.\n\nThe story uses the literary [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]], expressed in this case as a \"contrasting three\", as the third pig's brick house turns out to be the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.<ref>{{cite book|title = [[The Seven Basic Plots|The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories]] | first = Christopher | last= Booker | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 2005 | pages = 230\u2013231 | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujDvUEpY10C&pg=PA230 | chapter = The Rule of Three}}</ref>\nVariations of the tale appeared in ''[[Uncle Remus]]: His Songs and Sayings'' in 1881. The story also made an appearance in ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' in 1883, both by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], in which the pigs were replaced by [[Brer Rabbit]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]'', published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing interaction between them. The antagonist of this version is a fox, not a wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.\n\n==Later adaptations==\n\n===Disney cartoon===\n{{Main|The Three Little Pigs (film)}}\nThe most well-known version of the story {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} is the award-winning 1933 ''[[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon, which was produced by [[Walt Disney]]. The production cast the title characters as ''Fifer Pig'', ''Fiddler Pig'', and ''Practical Pig''. The first two are depicted as both frivolous and arrogant. The story has been somewhat softened. The first two pigs still get their houses blown down, but escape from the wolf. Also, the wolf is not boiled to death but simply burns his behind and runs away. Three sequels soon followed in 1934, 1936 and 1939 respectively as a result of the short film's popularity.\n\nFifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf appeared in the 2001 series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' in many episodes, and again in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. The three pigs can be seen in [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as greetable characters.<ref name=Waldman>{{cite journal|title=In search of the real three little pigs - different versions of the story 'The Three Little Pigs' |magazine=Washington Monthly |date=November 1996 |first=Steven |last=Waldman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134443/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Warner Brothers and MGM versions===\nIn 1943, there was a [[Merrie Melodies]] version, ''[[Pigs in a Polka]]'', which was a serious musical treatment, plus the usual [[Friz Freleng]] visual humor. It parodies both the Disney version, and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' itself.\n\nOther versions of the tale were also made. One was an [[MGM]] [[Tex Avery]] cartoon named ''[[Blitz Wolf]]'', a 1942 wartime version with the Wolf as a Nazi. Another animated spoof was a 1952 [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon called ''[[The Turn-Tale Wolf]]'', directed by Robert McKimson. This cartoon tells the story from the wolf's point of view and makes the pigs out to be the villains. Another Warner Brothers spoof was [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[The Three Little Bops]]'' (1957), which depicts the three little pigs as jazz musicians who refuse to let the wolf join their band and their \"houses\" as the nightclubs they play at, each named accordingly.\n\n===Subsequent retellings===\nOne of [[Uncle Remus]]' stories, \"The Story of the Pigs\" (alt. title: \"Brer Wolf and the Pigs\"), found in ''Nights with Uncle Remus'' (1883), is a re-telling of the story, with the following differences:\n* There are five pigs in this version: Big Pig, Little Pig, Speckle Pig, Blunt and Runt.\n* Blunt is the only male; all the rest are females.\n* Big Pig builds a brush house, Little Pig builds a stick house, Speckle Pig builds a mud house, Blunt builds a plank house and Runt builds a stone house.   \n* The Wolf's verse goes: ''\"If you'll open the door and let me in, I'll warm my hands and go home again.\"''\n\nIn 1953, [[Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins]] narrated a jazz version of The Three Little Pigs on a Brunswick Records 78 r.p.m. record album titled \"steve allen's grimm fairy tales for hip kids\" with piano blues accompaniment by Lou Stein. Also in 1953, Tex Avery did a [[Droopy]] cartoon, \"The Three Little Pups\". In it, the wolf is a [[Southern American English|Southern-accented]] dog catcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) trying to catch Droopy and his brothers, Snoopy and Loopy, to put in the dog pound. Though successfully blowing the first two houses down, he meets his match when he fails to blow down Droopy's house of bricks. The dog catcher makes several failed attempts to destroy the house and catch the pups. His last failed attempt ends with him \"going into television\" where he is playing a cowboy on the TV show the pups were watching.\n\nIn 1985, the story was re-told as the first episode of Season Four of ''[[Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', with [[Billy Crystal]] as artistic \"Larry Pig\" (the smart third pig), [[Jeff Goldblum]] as henpecked \"Buck Wolf\", [[Stephen Furst]] as capitalistic \"Peter Pig\" (the first pig), [[Fred Willard]] as [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] \"Paul Pig\" (the second pig), [[Doris Roberts]] as \"Mother Pig\" and [[Valerie Perrine]] as love interest \"Tina Pig\". In this version, all three pigs buy their building materials from the same junk salesman ([[Larry Hankin]]). \n\nThe 1989 parody ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'' is presented as a first-person narrative by the wolf, who portrays the entire incident as a misunderstanding; he had gone to the pigs to borrow some sugar, had destroyed their houses in a sneezing fit, ate the first two pigs to not waste food (since they'd died in the house collapse anyway), and was caught attacking the third pig's house after the pig had continually insulted him.<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\nThe 1992 [[Green Jell\u00f6]] song, ''[[Three Little Pigs (song)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (and its [[claymation]] music video) sets the story in [[Los Angeles]]. The wolf drives a [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle, the first little pig is an aspiring [[guitarist]], the second is a [[cannabis smoking]], [[dumpster diving]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and the third holds a [[Master of Architecture]] degree from [[Harvard University]]. In the end, with all three pigs barricaded in the brick house, the third pig calls [[9-1-1]]. [[John Rambo]] is dispatched to the scene, and kills the wolf with a [[machine gun]].\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''[[The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig]]'' inverts the cast and makes a few changes to the plot: the wolves build a brick house, then a concrete house, then a steel house, and finally a house of flowers. The pig is unable to blow the houses down, destroying them by other means, but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house, and becomes friends with the wolves.\n\nIn one [[Shining Time Station]] episode, ''Schemer's Alone'', Midge Smoot reads a version of this story to Schemer who paid her an [[IOU]] instead of real money, despite the fact that he's tricking his friends.\n\n[[List_of_Shrek_characters#Three_Little_Pigs|The three pigs]] and the [[List_of_Shrek_characters#The_Big_Bad_Wolf|wolf]] appear in the four [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' films]], and the specials ''[[Shrek the Halls]]'' and ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Belgium|Flemish]] company [[Studio 100]] created a musical called ''Three Little Pigs'' ({{lang-nl|De 3 Biggetjes}}), which follows the three daughters of the pig with the house of stone with new original songs, introducing a completely new story loosely based on the original story. The musical was specially written for the band [[K3 (band)|K3]], who play the three little pigs, Pirky, Parky and Porky ({{lang-nl|Knirri, Knarri and Knorri}}).<ref name=\"DiscogsK3\">{{cite web |title=De 3 Biggetjes* - Studio 100 Cd-Collectie 3/10 - Het Beste Van De 3 Biggetjes ! |url=https://www.discogs.com/De-3-Biggetjes-Studio-100-Cd-Collectie-310-Het-Beste-Van-De-3-Biggetjes-/release/2858284 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=2018-11-21 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"BOLK3\">{{cite web |title=bol.com {{!}} De 3 Biggetjes, Various {{!}} CD (album) {{!}} Muziek |url=https://www.bol.com/nl/p/de-3-biggetjes/1000004003213480/ |publisher=[[bol.com]] |accessdate=2018-11-21 |language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Peter Lund]] let the three little pigs live together in a village in the musical ''[[Grimm (musical)|Grimm]]'' with [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and other fairy tale characters.\n\nIn 2019, Simon Hood published a contemporary version of the story where the three little pig characters were both [[male]] and [[female]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sooperbooks.com/story/the-three-little-pigs-story/|title=Story Of The Three Little Pigs (Free) {{!}} SooperBooks\u00a9 [2019 Award-winners]|website=Sooper Books|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> Both the [[language]] and the [[Illustration|illustrations]] modernised the story, while the plot itself remained close to traditional versions.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource}}\n{{Commons category|Three little pigs}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=z2oKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=pig&f=false The nursery rhymes of England By James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps], pp.&nbsp;37\u201341 on [[books.google.com]]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/nurseryrhymesofe00hall#page/37/mode/1up The Story of the Three Little Pigs] in The nursery rhymes of England, by Halliwell, pp.&nbsp;37\u201341 on [[Archive.org]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081219171434/http://www.shol.com/agita/pigpsych.htm The Three Little Pigs: Pleasure principle versus reality principle], from: ''[[The Uses of Enchantment|The Uses of Enchantment, The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales]]'', by Bruno Bettelheim, Vintage Books, NY, 1975\n* [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0124.html 19th century versions of the Three Little Pigs story]\n* {{librivox book|title=The Three Little Pigs|author=L.

He was born in [[Switzerland]] and became a [[France|French citizen]] in 1930. His career spanned five decades, and he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, and North and South America.\n\nDedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM). Le Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of [[Chandigarh]] in [[India]], and contributed specific designs for several buildings there, specially the government buildings.\n\nOn 17 July 2016, seventeen projects by Le Corbusier in seven countries were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as [[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier|The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1528/|title=The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life (1887\u20131904)==\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, Still Life, oil on canvas, 80.9 x 99.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|80.9|x|99.7|cm|1|abbr=on}}, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]\n\nCharles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret was born on 6 October 1887 in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], a small city in the French-speaking [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel canton]] in north-western Switzerland, in the [[Jura mountains]], {{convert|5|km|mi}} across the border from France. It was an industrial town, devoted to manufacturing watches. (He adopted the pseudonym ''Le Corbusier'' in 1920.) His father was an artisan who enameled boxes and watches, and his mother taught piano. His elder brother Albert was an amateur violinist.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  He attended a kindergarten that used [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Fr\u00f6belian]] methods.<ref>Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier et l'urbain \u2013 la rectification du damier froebelien, pp. 93\u2013117.</ref><ref>Actes du colloque La ville et l'urbanisme apr\u00e8s Le Corbusier, \u00e9ditions d'en Haut 1993 \u2013 {{ISBN|2-88251-033-0}}.</ref><ref>Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier entre Raphael et Fr\u00f6bel, pp. 9\u201327, Journal d'histoire de l'architecture N\u00b01, Presses universitaires de Grenoble 1988 \u2013 {{ISBN|2-7061-0325-6}}.</ref>\n\nLike his contemporaries [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]], Le Corbusier lacked formal training as an architect.  He was attracted to the visual arts; at the age of fifteen he entered the municipal art school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds which taught the applied arts connected with watchmaking.  Three years later he attended the higher course of decoration, founded by the painter [[Charles L'Eplattenier]], who had studied in [[Budapest]] and Paris. Le Corbusier wrote later that L'Eplattenier had made him \"a man of the woods\" and taught him painting from nature.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  His father frequently took him into the mountains around the town.  He wrote later, \"we were constantly on mountaintops; we grew accustomed to a vast horizon.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourdhui'' (1925), p. 198.</ref> His architecture teacher in the Art School was architect Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier's earliest house designs.  He reported later that it was the art teacher L'Eplattenier who made him choose architecture. \"I had a horror of architecture and architects,\" he wrote. \"...I was sixteen, I accepted the verdict and I obeyed.  I moved into architecture.\"<ref>Cited by Jean Petit, ''Le Corbusier lui-meme'',  Rousseau, Geneva 1970, p. 28.</ref>\n\n==Travel and first houses (1905\u20131914)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Cdffallet.jpg|Le Corbusier's student project, the [[Villa Fallet]], a chalet in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland (1905)\nFile:Maison blanche 01.jpg|The \"Maison Blanche\", built for Le Corbusier's parents in La Chaux-de-Fonds (1912)\nFile:Maison blanche 05.jpg|Open Interior of the \"Maison Blanche\" (1912)\nFile:Villa Favre-Jacot 2.JPG|The Villa Favre-Jacot in [[Le Locle]], Switzerland (1912)\n</gallery>\n\nLe Corbusier began teaching himself by going to the library to read about architecture and philosophy, by visiting museums, by sketching buildings, and by constructing them.  In 1905, he and two other students, under the supervision of their teacher, Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, designed and built his first house, the [[Villa Fallet]], for the engraver Louis Fallet, a friend of his teacher Charles L'Eplattenier. Located on the forested hillside near Chaux-de-fonds, it was a large chalet with a steep roof in the local alpine style and carefully crafted colored geometric patterns on the fa\u00e7ade.  The success of this house led to his construction of two similar houses, the Villas Jacquemet and Stotzer, in the same area.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=49}}\n\nIn September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; then that winter traveling through Budapest to Vienna, where he stayed for four months and met [[Gustav Klimt]] and tried, without success, to meet [[Josef Hoffmann]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=48}}  In Florence, he visited the [[Florence Charterhouse]] in [[Galluzzo]], which made a lifelong impression on him. \"I would have liked to live in one of what they called their cells,\"  he wrote later. \"It was the solution for a unique kind of worker's housing, or rather for a terrestrial paradise.\"<ref>Letter to Eplattenier in Dumont, ''Le Corbusier, Lettres a ses maitres'', vol. 2, pp. 82\u201383.</ref>  He traveled to Paris, and during fourteen months between 1908 until 1910 he worked as a draftsman in the office of the architect [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of the use of reinforced [[concrete]] in residential construction and the architect of the [[Art Deco]] landmark [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]].  Two years later, between October 1910 and March 1911, he traveled to Germany and worked four months in the office [[Peter Behrens]], where [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]] were also working and learning.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1911, he traveled again with his friend [[August Klipstein]] for five months;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Klip and Corb on the road|last=\u017dakni\u0107|first=Ivan|publisher=Scheidegger & Spiess|year=2019|isbn=978-3-85881-817-1|location=Z\u00fcrich|pages=}}</ref> this time he journeyed to the [[Balkans]] and visited [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], as well as [[Pompeii]] and [[Rome]], filling nearly 80 sketchbooks with renderings of what he saw\u2014including many sketches of the [[Parthenon]], whose forms he would later praise in his work ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'' (1923).  He spoke of what he saw during this trip in many of his books, and it was the subject of his last book, ''Le Voyage d'Orient''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1912, he began his most ambitious project; a new house for his parents. also located on the forested hillside near La-Chaux-de-Fonds.  The Jeanneret-Perret house was larger than the others, and in a more innovative style; the horizontal planes contrasted dramatically with the steep alpine slopes, and the white walls and lack of decoration were in sharp contrast with the other buildings on the hillside. The interior spaces were organized around the four pillars of the salon in the center, foretelling the open interiors he would create in his later buildings.  The project was more expensive to build than he imagined; his parents were forced to move from the house within ten years, and relocate in a more modest house.  However, it led to a commission to build an even more imposing villa in the nearby village of [[Le Locle]]  for a wealthy watch manufacturer, Georges Favre-Jacot. Le Corbusier designed the new house in less than a month. The building was carefully designed to fit its hillside site, and interior plan was spacious and designed around a courtyard for maximum light, significant departure from the traditional house.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=48\u20139}}\n\n==Dom-ino House and Schwob House (1914\u20131918)==\n[[File:Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), 1914-15, Maison Dom-Ino.jpg|thumb|left|Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret, 1914\u201315, [[Dom-ino House|''Maison Dom-Ino (Dom-ino House)'']] ]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Le Corbusier taught at his old school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds.

He had first discovered concrete working in the office of  [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of reinforced concrete architecture in Paris, but now wanted to use it in new ways.\n\n\"Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources,\" he wrote later, \"and variety, and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be rhythm of a palace, and a Pompieen tranquility.\"<ref>Letter to Auguste Perret (1915), cited in ''Lettres a ces Maitres'', vol. 1, p. 33.</ref>  This led him to his plan for the [[Dom-ino House|Dom-Ino House]] (1914\u201315).

Although some of these were never built, they illustrated his basic architectural ideas which would dominate his works throughout the 1920s. He refined the idea in his 1927 book on the ''Five Points of a New Architecture''. This design, which called for the disassociation of the structure from the walls, and the freedom of plans and fa\u00e7ades, became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50\u201351}}\n\nIn August 1916, Le Corbusier received his largest commission ever, to construct a villa for the Swiss watchmaker Anatole Schwob, for whom he had already completed several small remodeling projects. He was given a large budget and the freedom to design not only the house, but also to create the interior decoration and choose the furniture.  Following the precepts of Auguste Perret, he built the structure out of reinforced concrete and filled the gaps with brick. The center of the house is a large concrete box with two semicolumn structures on both sides, which reflects his ideas of pure geometrical forms. A large open hall with a chandelier occupied the center of the building.  \"You can see,\" he wrote to Auguste Perret in July 1916, \"that Auguste Perret left more in me than Peter Behrens.\"<ref>cited in ''Lettres a css maitres'', vol. 1, p. 181.</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier's grand ambitions collided with the ideas and budget of his client, and led to bitter conflicts.  Schwob went to court and denied Le Corbusier access to site, or the right to claim to be the architect. Le Corbusier responded, \"Whether you like it or not, my presence is inscribed in every corner of your house.\" Le Corbusier took great pride in the house, and reproduced pictures in several of his books.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50}}\n\n==Painting, Cubism, Purism and ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' (1918\u20131922)==\n[[File:Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte, oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Le Corbusier, 1921, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles Edouard Jeanneret), 1922, Nature morte verticale (Vertical Still Life), oil on canvas, 146.3 x 89.3 cm, Kunstmuseum, Basel.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, 1922, ''Nature morte verticale'' (''Vertical Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|146.3|x|89.3|cm|1|abbr=in}}, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]] ]]\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, Guitare verticale (2\u00e8me version), oil on canvas, 100 x 81 cm, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, 1920, ''Guitare verticale'' (2\u00e8me version), oil on canvas, {{convert|100|x|81|cm|0|abbr=on}}, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris]]\n\nLe Corbusier moved to Paris definitively in 1917 and began his own architectural practice with his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (1896\u20131967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the [[World War II]] years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Le_Corbusier/129220|title=Encyclop\u00e9die Larousse en ligne \u2013 Charles \u00c9douard Jeanneret dit Le Corbusier|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|date=|work=larousse.fr}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Le Corbusier met the [[Cubism|Cubist]] painter [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]], in whom he recognised a kindred spirit.

Ozenfant and Le Corbusier began writing for a new journal,  ''[[L'Esprit Nouveau]]'', and promoted with energy and imagination his ideas of architecture.\n\nIn the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted '''Le Corbusier''' (an altered form of his maternal grandfather's name, Lecorb\u00e9sier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOKNzunERUwC&pg=PA161|title=Le Corbusier: choix de lettres|first1=Le|last1=Corbusier|first2=Jean|last2=Jenger|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|via=Google Books|isbn=9783764364557}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.asso.fr/repbio_us.htm Rep\u00e8res biographiques, Fondation Le Corbusier].

They resigned and founded the Union of Modern Artists (\u201c[[Union des artistes modernes]]\u201d: UAM).\n\nHis theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models. Among these, was the Maison \"Citrohan.\"  The project's name was a reference to the French [[Citro\u00ebn]] automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials Le Corbusier advocated using in the house's construction as well as the way in which he intended the homes would be consumed, similar to other commercial products, like the automobile.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anti-object : the dissolution and disintegration of architecture|last=Kuma, Kengo, 1954-|date=2008|publisher=Architectural Association|others=Architectural Association (Great Britain)|isbn=978-1-902902-52-4|location=London|oclc=67375498}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Maison Citrohan model, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor. The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace. On the exterior Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the fa\u00e7ades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames. Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs. Interior walls also were left white.\n\n==''Toward an Architecture'' (1920\u20131923)==\nIn 1922 and 1923, Le Corbusier devoted himself to advocating his new concepts of architecture and urban planning in a series of polemical articles published in ''L'Esprit Nouveau''. At the Paris Salon d'Automne in 1922, he presented his plan for the [[Ville Contemporaine]], a model city for three million people, whose residents would live and work in a group of identical sixty-story tall apartment buildings surrounded by lower zig-zag apartment blocks and a large park. In 1923, he collected his essays from ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' published his first and most influential book, ''[[Toward an Architecture|Towards an Architecture]]''. He presented his ideas for the future of architecture in a series of maxims, declarations, and exhortations. commencing with \"A grand epoch has just begun. There exists a new spirit. There already exist a crowd of works in the new spirit, they are found especially in industrial production. Architecture is suffocating in its current uses. \"Styles\" are a lie. Style is a unity of principles which animates all the work of a period and which result in a characteristic spirit...Our epoch determines each day its style..-Our eyes, unfortunately don't know how to see it yet,\" and his most famous maxim, \"A house is a machine to live in.\"  Most of the many photographs and drawings in the book came from outside the world of traditional architecture;   the cover showed the promenade deck of an ocean liner, while others showed racing cars, airplanes, factories, and the huge concrete and steel arches of [[zeppelin]] hangars.{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1923|pages=1\u2013150}}\n\n==L'Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1925)==\n[[File:Pavillon L'Esprit Nouveau.jpg|thumb|The Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau (1925)]]\n[[File:Plan Voisin model.jpg|thumb|The model of the [[Plan Voisin]] for the reconstruction of Paris displayed at the Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau]]\n\nAn important early work of Le Corbusier was the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, built for the 1925 Paris [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]], the event which later gave [[Art Deco]] its name. Le Corbusier built the pavilion in collaboration with [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]] and with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant had broken with [[Cubism]] and formed the [[Purism]] movement in 1918 and in 1920 founded their journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau''.  In his new journal, Le Corbusier vividly denounced the decorative arts:  \"Decorative Art, as opposed to the machine phenomenon, is the final twitch of the old manual modes, a dying thing.\"  To illustrate his ideas, he and Ozenfant decided to create small pavilion at the Exposition, representing his idea of the future urban housing unit. A house, he wrote, \"is a cell within the body of a city. The cell is made up of the vital elements which are the mechanics of a house...Decorative art is antistandarizational. Our pavilion will contain only standard things created by industry in factories and mass produced, objects truly of the style of today...my pavilion will therefore be a cell extracted from a huge apartment building.\"{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}\n\nLe Corbusier and his collaborators were given a plot of land located behind the [[Grand Palais]] in the center of the Exposition. The plot was forested, and exhibitors could not cut down trees, so Le Corbusier built his pavilion with a tree in the center, emerging through a hole in the roof. The building was a stark white box with an interior terrace and square glass windows. The interior was decorated with a few cubist paintings and with a few pieces of mass-produced commercially available furniture, entirely different from the expensive, one-of-a-kind pieces in the other pavilions.  The chief organizers of the Exposition were furious, and built a fence to partially hide the pavilion. Le Corbusier had to appeal to the Ministry of Fine Arts, which ordered that fence be taken down.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}\n\nBesides the furniture, the pavilion exhibited a model of his [[Plan Voisin]]  his provocative plan for rebuilding a large part of the centre of Paris. He proposed to bulldoze a large area north of the Seine and replace the narrow streets, monuments and houses with giant sixty-story cruciform towers placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favorable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs. The plan was never seriously considered, but it provoked discussion concerning how to deal with the overcrowded poor working-class neighborhoods of Paris, and it later saw partial realization in the housing developments built in the Paris suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe Pavilion was ridiculed by many critics, but Le Corbusier, undaunted, wrote:  \"Right now one thing is sure. 1925 marks the decisive turning point in the quarrel between the old and new. After 1925, the antique-lovers will have virtually ended their lives . . . Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the 'new'.\"{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=49}}\n\n==''The Decorative Art of Today'' (1925)==\nIn 1925, Le Corbusier combined a series of articles about decorative art from \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" into a book, ''L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'' (''The Decorative Art of Today'').<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif d\u2019aujourd'hui'', Paris, G.

His basic premise, repeated throughout the book, was: \"Modern decorative art has no decoration.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'', (originally 1925, Flammarion edition of 1996, ISBN+978-2-0812-2062-1.</ref>  He attacked with enthusiasm the styles presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts:  \"The desire to decorate everything about one is a false spirit and an abominable small perversion....The religion of beautiful materials is in its final death agony...The almost hysterical onrush in recent years toward this quasi-orgy of decor is only the last spasm of a death already predictable.\"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|page=98}} He cited the 1912 book of the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] \"Ornament and crime\", and quoted Loos's dictum, \"The more a people are cultivated, the more decor disappears.\"   He attacked the deco revival of classical styles, what he called \"Louis Philippe and Louis XVI moderne\";  he condemned the \"symphony of color\" at the Exposition, and called it \"the triumph of assemblers of colors and materials. They were swaggering in colors... They were making stews out of fine cuisine.\"   He condemned the exotic styles presented at the Exposition based on the art of China, Japan, India and Persia.  \"It takes energy today to affirm our western styles.\" He criticized the \"precious and useless objects that accumulated on the shelves\" in the new style. He attacked the \"rustling silks, the marbles which twist and turn, the vermilion whiplashes, the silver blades of Byzantium and the Orient\u2026Let's be done with it!\"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70\u201381}}\n\n\"Why call bottles, chairs, baskets and objects decorative?\" Le Corbusier asked. \"They are useful tools\u2026.Decor is not necessary. Art is necessary.\" He declared that in the future the decorative arts industry would produce only \"objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution, and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style.\"  He described the future of decoration in these terms:  \"The ideal is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign.\" He concluded by repeating \"Modern decoration has no decoration\".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70\u201381}}\n\nThe book became a manifesto for those who opposed the more traditional styles of the decorative arts;  In the 1930s, as Le Corbusier predicted, the modernized versions of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI furniture and the brightly colored wallpapers of stylized roses were replaced by a more sober, more streamlined style.  Gradually the modernism and functionality proposed by Le Corbusier overtook the more ornamental style.  The shorthand titles that Le Corbusier used in the book, ''1925 Expo: Arts Deco'' was adapted in 1966 by the art historian [[Bevis Hillier]] for a catalog of an exhibition on the style, and in 1968 in the title of a book, ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''. And thereafter the term \"Art Deco\" was commonly used as the name of the style.<ref>Benton, Charlotte, Benton, Tim, Wood, Ghislaine, ''Art D\u00e9co dans le monde- 1910\u201339'', 2010, Renaissance du Livre, {{ISBN|9782507003906}}, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Five Points of Architecture to Villa Savoye (1923\u20131931)==\n{{Main|Villa Savoye|Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa La Roche 2013.jpg|The Villa La Roche-Jeanneret (now [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]) in Paris (1923)\nFile:Weissenhofsiedlung.jpg|Corbusier Haus (right) and Citrohan Haus in Weissenhof, Stuttgart, Germany (1927)\nFile:VillaSavoye.jpg|The [[Villa Savoye]] in [[Poissy]] (1928\u20131931)\n</gallery>\n\nThe notoriety that Le Corbusier achieved from his writings and the Pavilion at the 1925 Exposition led to commissions to build a dozen residences in Paris and in the Paris region in his \"purist style.\" These included the [[Maison La Roche|Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret]] (1923\u20131925), which now houses the [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]; the [[Maison Guiette]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium (1926); a residence for [[Jacques Lipchitz]]; the [[Maison Cook]], and the [[Maison Planeix]].  In 1927, he was invited by the German [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] to build three houses in the model city of Weissenhof near [[Stuttgart]], based on the Citrohan House and other theoretical models he had published. He described this project in detail one of his best-known essays, the ''Five Points of Architecture''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=37}}\n\nThe following year he began the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928\u20131931), which became one of the most famous of Le Corbusier's works, and an icon of modernist architecture. Located in [[Poissy]], in a landscape surrounded by trees and large lawn, the house is an elegant white box poised on rows of slender pylons, surrounded by a horizontal band of windows which fill the structure with light. The service areas (parking, rooms for servants and laundry room)  are located under the house.  Visitors enter a vestibule from which a gentle ramp leads to the house itself.  The bedrooms and salons of the house are distributed around a suspended garden;  the rooms look both out at the landscape and into the garden, which provides additional light and air. Another ramp leads up to the roof, and a stairway leads down to the cellar under the pillars.\n\nVilla Savoye succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' and the book ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'', which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by ''[[piloti]]s'', reinforced concrete stilts. These ''pilotis'', in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free fa\u00e7ade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an [[free plan|open floor plan]], meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, and which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the [[roof garden]] to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for a [[promenade architecturale]] through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial \"ocean-liner\" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired.\n\nLe Corbusier was quite rhapsodic when describing the house in ''Pr\u00e9cisions'' in 1930: \"the plan is pure, exactly made for the needs of the house. It has its correct place in the rustic landscape of Poissy.  It is Poetry and lyricism, supported by technique.\"{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}  The house had its problems;  the roof persistently leaked, due to construction faults;  but it became a landmark of modern architecture and one of the best-known works of Le Corbusier.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}\n\n==League of Nations Competition and Pessac Housing Project (1926\u20131930)==\n[[File:Pessac Quartiers Modernes Frug\u00e8s 004.jpg|thumb|Low-cost housing units built by Le Corbusier in the [[Quartiers Modernes Frug\u00e8s]] in [[Pessac]] (1927)]]\nThanks to his passionate articles in L'Esprit Nouveau, his participation in the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition and the conferences he gave on the new spirit of architecture, Le Corbusier had become well known in the architectural world, though he had only built residences for wealthy clients. In 1926, he entered the competition for the construction of a headquarters for the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva with a plan for an innovative lakeside complex of modernist white concrete office buildings and meeting halls. There were three-hundred thirty seven projects in competition.  It appeared that the Corbusier's project was the first choice of the architectural jury, but after much behind-the scenes maneuvering the jury declared it was unable to pick a single winner, and the project was given instead to the top five architects, who were all neoclassicists. Le Corbusier was not discouraged; he presented his own plans to the public in articles and lectures to show the opportunity that the League of Nations had missed.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=116}}\n\nIn 1927, Le Corbusier received the opportunity he had been looking for; he was commissioned by a Bordeaux industrialist, Henry Frug\u00e8s a fervent admirer of his ideas on urban planning, to build a complex of worker housing, the [[Quartiers Modernes Frug\u00e8s]], at [[Pessac]], near Bordeaux. Le Corbusier described Pessac as \"A little like a Balzac novel\", a chance to create a whole community for living and working. The Fruges quarter became his first laboratory for a residential housing;  a series of rectangular blocks composed of modular housing units located in a garden setting. Like the unit displayed at the 1925 Exposition, each housing unit had its own small terrace.  The earlier villas he constructed all had white exterior walls, but for Pessac, at the request of his clients, he added color; panels of brown, yellow and jade green, coordinated by Le Corbusier. Originally planned to have some two hundred units, it finally contained about fifty to seventy housing units, in eight buildings. Pessac became the model on a small scale for his later and much larger Cit\u00e9 Radieuse projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/arts/architecture-view-le-corbusier-s-housing-project-flexible-enough-endure-ada.html|title=Architecture View; Le Corbusier's Housing Project-Flexible Enough to Endure; by Ada Louise Huxtable|author=|date=15 March 1981|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Founding of CIAM (1928) and Athens Charter==\nIn 1928, Le Corbusier took a major step toward establishing modernist architecture as the dominant European style. Le Corbusier had met with many of the leading German and Austrian modernists during the competition for the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]]. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses;  Le Corbusier and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a ch\u00e2teau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland 26\u201328 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic \"Rational methods for groups of habitations\".  A third meeting, on \"The functional city\", was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Le Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1943 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84\u201385}}\n\n==Moscow projects (1928\u20131934)==\n{{Main|Le Corbusier in the USSR}}\n[[File:Centrosoyuz Moscow - Ak Sakharova view.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], headquarters of Soviet trade unions, Moscow (1928\u201334)]]\n\nLe Corbusier saw the new society founded in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution as a promising laboratory for his architectural ideas. He met the Russian architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] during the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and admired the construction of Melnikov's constructvist USSR pavilion, the only truly modernist building in the Exposition other than his own Esprit Nouveau pavilion. At Melnikov's invitation he traveled to Moscow, where found that his writings had been published in Russian; he gave lectures and interviews, and between 1928 and 1932 he constructed an office building for the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], the headquarters of Soviet trade unions.\n\nIn 1932, he was invited to take part in an international competition for the new [[Palace of the Soviets]] in Moscow, which was to be built on the site of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], demolished on Stalin's orders.  Le Corbusier contributed a highly original plan, a low-level complex of circular and rectangular buildings and a rainbow-like arch from which the roof of the main meeting hall was suspended. To Le Corbusier's distress, his plan was rejected by Stalin in favor of a plan for a massive neoclassical tower, the highest in Europe, crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin.  The Palace was never built;  construction was stopped by World War II, a swimming pool took its place;  and after the collapse of the USSR the cathedral was rebuilt on its original site.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=128}}\n\n==Cit\u00e9 Universitaire, Immeuble Clart\u00e9 and Cit\u00e9 de Refuge (1928\u20131933)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Geneve immeuble Clarte 2011-08-02 13 55 36 PICT3664.JPG|The [[Immeuble Clart\u00e9]] in [[Geneva]] (1930\u20131932)\nFile:La fondation suisse (Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris) n3.jpg|The Swiss Foundation in the [[Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris]] (1929\u20131933)\n</gallery>\nBetween 1928 and 1934, as Le Corbusier's reputation grew, he received commissions to construct a wide variety of buildings. In 1928 he received a commission from the Soviet government to construct the headquarters of the Tsentrosoyuz, or central office of trade unions, a large office building whose glass walls alternated with plaques of stone. He built the Villa de Madrot in [[Le Pradet]] (1929\u20131931); and an apartment in Paris for Charles de Bestigui at the top of an existing building on the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] 1929\u20131932, (later demolished). In 1929\u20131930 he constructed a floating homeless shelter for the Salvation Army on the left bank of the Seine at the [[Pont d'Austerlitz]]. Between 1929 and 1933, he built a larger and more ambitious project for the Salvation Army, the [[Cit\u00e9 de Refuge]], on rue Cantagrel in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.  He also constructed the Swiss Pavilion in the [[Cit\u00e9 Universitaire]] in Paris with 46 units of student housing, (1929\u201333).  He designed furniture to go with the building;  the main salon was decorated with a montage of black-and-white photographs of nature.  In 1948, he replaced this with a colorful mural he painted himself. In Geneva he built a glass-walled apartment building with forty-five units, the [[Immeuble Clart\u00e9]]. Between 1931 and 1945 he built an apartment building with fifteen units, including an apartment and studio for himself on the 6th and 7th floors, at 4 rue Nungesser-et-Coli in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. overlooking the [[Bois de Boulogne]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=210}}  His apartment and studio are owned today by the Fondation Le Corbusier, and can be visited.\n\n==Ville Contemporaine, Plan Voisin and Cit\u00e9 Radieuse (1922\u20131939)==\n{{See also|Unit\u00e9 d'habitation|Ville Radieuse}}\nAs the global [[Great Depression]] enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted more and more time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d'Automne in Paris.  His plan featured tall office towers with surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that \"analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it.\"{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=98}} The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and to replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do.  The plan included a multi-level transportation hub that included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: \"The center of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is in reality a diamond mine...To abandon the center of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy.\" {{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=100}}\n\nAs no doubt Le Corbusier expected, no one hurried to implement the Plan Voisin, but he continued working on variations of the idea and recruiting followers. In 1929, he traveled to Brazil where he gave conferences on his architectural ideas. He returned with drawings of his own vision for Rio de Janeiro; he sketched serpentine multi-story apartment buildings on pylons, like inhabited highways, winding through [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\nIn 1931, he developed a visionary plan for another city [[Algiers]], then part of France.  This plan, like his Rio Janeiro plan, called for the construction of an elevated viaduct of concrete, carrying residential units, which would run from one end of the city to the other. This plan, unlike his early Plan Voisin, was more conservative, because it did not call for the destruction of the old city of Algiers; the residential housing would be over the top of the old city.  This plan, like his Paris plans, provoked discussion, but never came close to realization.\n\nIn 1935, Le Corbusier made his first visit to the United States. He was asked by American journalists what he thought about New York City skyscrapers; he responded, characteristically, that he found them \"much too small\".<ref>Time Magazine, article on Man of the Year, 5 May 1961</ref>  He wrote a book describing his experiences in the States, ''Quand les Cath\u00e9drales etait blanc-  voyages au pays des timides'' (When Cathedrals were White; voyage to the land of the timid) whose title expressed his view of the lack of boldness in American architecture.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=218}}\n\nHe wrote a great deal but built very little in the late 1930s.  The titles of his books expressed the combined urgency and optimism of his messages: ''Cannons? Munitions? No thank you, Lodging please!'' (1938) and ''The lyricism of modern times and urbanism'' (1939).\n\nIn 1928, the French Minister of Labour, [[Louis Loucheur]], won the passage of a French law on public housing, calling for the construction of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project.  These units were {{convert|45|m2|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, made with metal frames, and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors.  The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the ''Ville Radieuse'' or \"radiant city\", in a new book which published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principle functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be clearly separated into their own neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.\n\n==World War II and Reconstruction; [[Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation]] in Marseille (1939\u20131952)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:M\u00f3dulo de vivienda tipo de Unit\u00e9 d\u00b4Habitation.jpg|The modular design of the apartments inserted into the building\nFile:Cit\u00e9 radieuse.

He moved to [[Vichy]] for a time, where the collaborationist government of Marshal [[Philippe Petain]] was located, offering his services for architectural projects, including his plan for the reconstruction of Algiers, but they were rejected. He continued writing, completing ''Sur les Quatres routes'' (On the Four Routes) in 1941. After 1942, Le Corbusier left Vichy for Paris.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|pages=244\u2013246}}  He became for a time a technical adviser at [[Alexis Carrel]]'s eugenic foundation, he resigned from this position on 20 April 1944.<ref name=Libe>{{cite journal|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/2015/03/18/le-corbusier-plus-facho-que-fada_1223411|title=Le Corbusier plus facho que fada|journal=Liberation|date= 18 March 2015|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref> In 1943, he founded a new association of modern architects and builders, the Ascoral, the Assembly of Constructors for a renewal of architecture, but there were no projects to build.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=215}}\n\nWhen the war ended, Le Corbusier was nearly sixty years old, and he had not had a single project realized in ten years. He tried, without success, to obtain commissions for several of the first large reconstruction projects, but his proposals for the reconstruction of the town of [[Saint-Di\u00e9]] and for [[La Rochelle]] were rejected. Still, he persisted; Le Corbusier finally found a willing partner in [[Raoul Dautry]], the new Minister of Reconstruction and Urbanism. Dautry agreed to fund one of his projects, a \"[[Unit\u00e9 d'habitation|Unit\u00e9 d'habitation de grandeur conforme]]\", or housing units of standard size, with the first one to be built in [[Marseille]], which had been heavily damaged during the war.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=143}}\n\nThis was his first public commission, and was a major breakthrough for Le Corbusier. He gave the building the name of his pre-war theoretical project, the ''Cit\u00e9 Radieuse'', and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, he proposed a giant reinforced concrete framework, into which modular apartments would be fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 people. Each module was three stories high, and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran from one side of the building to the other, and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the ventilator shafts on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.\n\nThe building was designed not just to be a residence, but to offer all the services needed for living. Every third floor, between the modules, there was a wide corridor, like an interior street, which ran the length of the building from one end of the building to the other. This served as a sort of commercial street, with shops, eating places, a nursery school and recreational facilities. A running track and small stage for theater performances was located in the roof. The building itself was surrounded by trees and a small park.\n\nLe Corbusier wrote later that the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation concept was inspired by the visit he had made to the [[Florence Charterhouse]] at [[Galluzzo]] in Italy, in 1907 and 1910 during his early travels. He wanted to recreate, he wrote, an ideal place \"for meditation and contemplation.\"  He also learned from the monastery, he wrote, that \"standardization led to perfection,\" and that \"all of his life a man labours under this impulse: to make the home the temple of the family.\"{{sfn|Journel|2015|page=139}}\n\nThe Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation marked a turning point in the career of Le Corbusier; in 1952, he was made a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour|L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] in a ceremony held on the roof of his new building. He had progressed from being an outsider and critic of the architectural establishment to its centre, as the most prominent French architect.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=152\u2013158}}\n\n==Postwar projects, United Nations headquarters (1947\u20131952)==\n[[File:67\u00ba Per\u00edodo de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|right|The [[headquarters of the United Nations]] designed by Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Wallace K.

In the post-Second World War decades Le Corbusier\u2019s fame moved beyond architectural and planning circles as he became one of the leading intellectual figures of the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=426}}</ref> \n\nIn early 1947 Le Corbusier submitted a design for the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], which was to be built beside the East River in New York. Instead of competition, the design was to be selected by a Board of Design Consultants composed of leading international architects nominated by member governments, including Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] of Brazil, [[Howard Robertson (architect)|Howard Robertson]] from Britain, Nikolai Bassov of the Soviet Union, and five others from around the world. The committee was under the direction of the American architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], who was also architect for the Rockefeller family, which had donated the site for the building.\n\nLe Corbusier had submitted his plan for the Secretariat, called Plan 23 of the 58 submitted. In Le Corbusier's plan offices, council chambers and General Assembly hall were in a single block in the center of the site.  He lobbied hard for his project, and asked the younger Brazilian architect, Niemeyer, to support and assist him on his plan. Niemeyer, to help Le Corbusier, refused to submit his own design and did not attend the meetings until the Director, Harrison, insisted. Niemeyer then submitted his plan, Plan 32, with the office building and councils and General Assembly in separate buildings. After much discussion, the Committee chose Niemeyer's plan, but suggested that he collaborate with Le Corbusier on the final project. Le Corbusier urged Niemeyer to put the General Assembly Hall in the center of the site, though this would eliminate Niemeyer's plan to have a large plaza in the center. Niemeyer agreed with Le Corbusier's suggestion, and the headquarters was built, with minor modifications, according to their joint plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archives.un.org/content/oscar-niemeyer-and-united-nations-headquarters |title=Oscar Niemeyer and the United Nations Headquarters (1947\u20131949) |work=[[United Nations]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Religious architecture (1950\u20131963)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:RonchampCorbu.jpg|The [[Notre Dame du Haut|chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] in [[Ronchamp]] (1950\u20131955)\nFile:Sainte Marie de La Tourette 2007.jpg|The convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] near [[Lyon]] (1953\u20131960)\nFile:Couvent de la Tourette - 11.JPG|Meeting room inside the Convent of Sainte Marie de la Tourette\nFile:EgliseSaintPierreLeCorbusierFirminy.jpg|[[Saint-Pierre, Firminy|Church of Saint-Pierre]], [[Firminy]] (1960\u20132006)\nFile:Church @ Firminy, France.jpg|Interior of the Church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy.  The sunlight through the roof projects the Constellation Orion on the walls. (1960\u20132006)\n</gallery>\nLe Corbusier was an avowed atheist, but he also had a strong belief in the ability of architecture to create a sacred and spiritual environment. In the postwar years, he designed two important religious buildings; the [[Notre Dame du Haut|chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]] (1950\u20131955); and the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] (1953\u20131960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, P\u00e8re Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.\n\nLe Corbusier first visited the remote mountain site of Ronchamp in May 1950, saw the ruins of the old chapel, and drew sketches of possible forms. He wrote afterwards: \"In building this chapel, I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of prayer, of interior joy. The feeling of the sacred animated our effort.  Some things are sacred, others aren't, whether they're religious or not.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Ronchamp'', Hatje, Stuttgart, (1925), p. 25.</ref>\n\nThe second major religious project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in [[L'Arbresle]] in the Rhone Department (1953\u20131960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier to visit the starkly simple and imposing 12th\u201313th century [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns.  For the living space he used the same [[Modulor]] concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of {{convert|2.26|m|abbr=off}}; and width {{convert|1.83|m|abbr=off}}.{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|pages=154\u201355}}\n\nLe Corbusier used raw concrete to construct the convent, which is placed on the side of a hill.  The three blocks of dormitories U, closed by the chapel, with a courtyard in the center. The Convent has a flat roof, and is placed on sculpted concrete pillars. Each of the residential cells has small loggia with a concrete sunscreen looking out at the countryside.  The centerpiece of the convent is the chapel, a plain box of concrete, which he called his \"Box of miracles.\"  Unlike the highly finished fa\u00e7ade of the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation, the fa\u00e7ade of the chapel is raw, unfinished concrete. He described the building in a letter to [[Albert Camus]] in 1957: \"I'm taken with the idea of a \"box of miracles\"....as the name indicates, it is a rectangual box made of concrete. It doesn't have any of the traditional theatrical tricks, but the possibility, as its name suggests, to make miracles.\"<ref>Letter to Albert Camus, 13 February 1957, FLC (Fondation Le Corbusier), E1-12-154)</ref> The interior of the chapel is extremely simple, only benches in a plain, unfinished concrete box, with light coming through a single square in the roof and six small band on the sides. The Crypt beneath has intense blue, red and yellow walls, and illumination by sunlight channeled from above.  The monastery has other unusual features, including floor to ceiling panels of glass in the meeting rooms, window panels that fragmented the view into pieces, and a system of concrete and metal tubes like gun barrels which aimed sunlight through colored prisms and projected it onto the walls of sacristy and to the secondary altars of the crypt on the level below. These were whimsically termed the \"\"machine guns\" of the sacristy and the \"light cannons\" of the crypt.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=184\u2013185}}\n\nIn 1960, Le Corbusier began a third religious building, the Church of Saint Pierre in the new town of Firminy-Vert, where he had built a Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation and a cultural and sports centre. While he made the original design, construction did not begin until five years after his death, and work continued under different architects until it was completed in 2006. The most spectacular feature of the church is the sloping concrete tower that covers the entire interior. similar to that in the Assembly Building in his complex at [[Chandigarh]]. Windows high in the tower illuminate the interior. Le Corbusier originally proposed that tiny windows also project the form of a constellation on the walls. Later architects designed the church to project the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|page=165}}\n\n==Chandigarh (1951\u20131956)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chandigarh High Court.jpg|The High Court of Justice, Chandigarh (1951\u20131956)\nFile:Chandigarh Secretariat.jpg|Secretariat Building, Chandigarh (1952\u20131958)\nFile:Palace of Assembly Chandigarh 2006.jpg|[[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)]] (1952\u20131961)\nFile:Chandigarh High Court sun.jpg|[[Punjab and Haryana High Court|Chandigarh High Court]]\n</gallery>\nLe Corbusier's largest and most ambitious project was the design of [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] States of India, created after India received independence in 1947. Le Corbusier was contacted in 1950 by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and invited to propose a project. An American architect, [[Albert Mayer (planner)|Albert Mayer]], had made a plan in 1947 for a city of 150,000 inhabitants, but the Indian government wanted a grander and more monumental city. Corbusier worked on the plan with two British specialists in urban design and tropical climate architecture, [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], and with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, who moved to India and supervised the construction until his death.\n\nLe Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic about his project; \"It will be a city of trees,\" he wrote, \"of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those at the time of Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of mathematics will reign.\".<ref>Letter to his wife Yvonne, 27 February 1951, FLC-R1-12-87. Cited by Journel, p. 182.</ref>  His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and a transportation infrastructure.  In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}  From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, \"Like a forced laborer.\" He dismissed the earlier American plan as \"Faux-Moderne\" and overly filled with parking spaces roads. His intent was to present what he had learned in forty years of urban study, and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}} His design made use of many of his favorite ideas: an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the [[Modulor]] to give a correct human scale to each element; and his favourite symbol, the open hand (\"The hand is open to give and to receive\"). He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nLe Corbusier's design called for the use of raw concrete, whose surface not smoothed or polished and which showed the marks of the forms in which it dried. Pierre Jeanneret wrote to his cousin that he was in a continual battle with the construction workers, who could not resist the urge to smooth and finish the raw concrete, particularly when important visitors were coming to the site. At one point one thousand workers were employed on the site of the High Court of Justice.  Le Corbusier wrote to his mother, \"It is an architectural symphony which surpasses all my hopes, which flashes and develops under the light in a way which is unimaginable and unforgettable. From far, from up close, it provokes astonishment; all made with raw concrete and a cement cannon. Adorable, and grandiose. In all the centuries no one has seen that.\"<ref>letter to his mother, 19 November 1954, FLC-R2-103. Cited by Journlet, p. 184.</ref>\n\nThe High Court of Justice, begun in 1951, was finished in 1956. The building was radical in its design; a parallelogram topped with an inverted parasol.  Along the walls were high concrete grills {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=off}} thick which served as sunshades. The entry featured a monumental ramp and columns that allowed the air to circulate.  The pillars were originally white limestone, but in the 1960s they were repainted in bright colors, which better resisted the weather.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nThe Secretariat, the largest building that housed the government offices, was constructed between 1952 and 1958.  It is an enormous block {{convert|250|m|abbr=off}} long and eight levels high, served by a ramp which extends from the ground to the top level. The ramp was designed to be partly sculptural and partly practical. Since there were no modern building cranes at the time of construction, the ramp was the only way to get materials to the top of the construction site. The Secretariat had two features which were borrowed from his design for the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille: concrete grill sunscreens over the windows and a roof terrace.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nThe most important building of the capitol complex was the [[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)|Palace of Assembly]] (1952\u201361), which faced the High Court at the other end of a five hundred meter esplanade with a large reflecting pool in the front. This building features a central courtyard, over which is the main meeting hall for the Assembly.  On the roof on the rear of the building is a signature feature of Le Corbusier, a large tower, similar in form to the smokestack of a ship or the ventilation tower of a heating plant. Le Corbusier added touches of color and texture with an immense tapestry in the meeting hall and large gateway decorated with enamel.  He wrote of this building, \"A Palace magnificent in its effect, from the new art of raw concrete. It is magnificent and terrible; terrible meaning that there is nothing cold about it to the eyes.\"<ref>Letter to his brother Albert, 26 March 1961, FLC-R1-10-586, cited by Journel, p. 185.</ref>\n\n==Later life and work (1955\u20131965)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:National museum of western art05s3200.jpg|The [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo (1954\u20131959)\nFile:Carpenter center.jpg|[[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] (1960\u20131963)\nFile:Centre Le Corbusier - 'Teich' - Blatterwiese 2013-09-21 17-48-26.JPG|The [[Centre Le Corbusier]] in Z\u00fcrich (1962\u20131967)\n</gallery>\nThe 1950s and 1960s, were a difficult period for Le Corbusier's personal life;  his wife Yvonne died in 1957, and his mother, to whom he was closely attached, died in 1960. He remained active in a wide variety of fields; in 1955 he published ''Po\u00e9me de l'angle droits'', a portfolio of lithographs, published in the same collection as the book ''Jazz'' by [[Henri Matisse]]. In 1958 he collaborated with the composer [[Edgar Var\u00e8se]] on a work called ''Le [[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]]'', a show of sound and light, for the Philips Pavilion at the International Exposition in Brussels. In 1960 he published a new book, ''L'Atelier de la recherch\u00e9 patiente'' ''The workshop of patient research''), simultaneously published in four languages.  He received growing recognition for his pioneering work in modernist architecture;  in 1959, a successful international campaign was launched to have his Villa Savoye, threatened with demolition, declared an historic monument; it was the first time that a work by a living architect received this distinction.  In 1962, in the same year as the dedication of the Palace of the Assembly in Chandigarh, the first retrospective exhibit on his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1964, in a ceremony held in his atelier on rue de S\u00e8vres, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Culture Minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}\n\nHis later architectural work was extremely varied, and often based on designs of earlier projects. In 1952\u20131958, he designed a series of tiny vacation cabins, {{convert|2.26|x|2.26|x|2.6|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, for a site next to the Mediterranean at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]. He built a similar cabin for himself, but the rest of the project was not realized until after his death. In 1953\u20131957, he designed a residential building for Brazilian students for the Cit\u00e9 de la Universit\u00e9 in Paris. Between 1954 and 1959, he built the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo. His other projects included a cultural centre and stadium for the town of [[Firminy]], where he had built his first housing project (1955\u20131958); and a stadium in Baghdad, Iraq (much altered since its construction).  He also constructed three new ''Unit\u00e9s d'Habitation'', apartment blocks on the model of the original in Marseille, the first in Berlin (1956\u20131958), the second in Briey-en-For\u00eat in the [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] Department; and the third (1959\u20131967) in Firminy.  In 1960\u20131963, he built his only building in the United States; the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}\n\nAt the time of his death in 1965, several projects were on the drawing boards; the church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy, finally completed in modified form in 2006; a Palace of Congresses for Strasbourg (1962\u201365), and a hospital in Venice, (1961\u20131965) which were never built. Le Corbusier designed an art gallery beside the lake in Z\u00fcrich for gallery owner [[Heidi Weber]] in 1962\u20131967.

They summarized the lessons he had learned in the previous years, which he put literally into concrete form in his villas constructed of the late 1920s, most dramatically in the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928\u20131931)\n\nThe five points are:\n\n* The '''Pilotis''', or pylon. The building is raised up on reinforced concrete pylons, which allows for free circulation on the ground level, and eliminates dark and damp parts of the house.\n* The '''Roof Terrace'''. The sloping roof is replaced by a flat roof; the roof can be used as a garden, for promenades, sports or a swimming pool.\n* The '''Free Plan'''. Load-bearing walls are replaced by steel or reinforced concrete columns, so the interior can be freely designed, and interior walls can put anywhere, or left out entirely. The structure of the building is not visible from the outside.\n* The '''Ribbon Window'''. Since the walls do not support the house, the windows can run the entire length of the house, so all rooms can get equal light.\n* The '''Free Fa\u00e7ade'''. Since the building is supported by columns in the interior, the fa\u00e7ade can be much lighter and more open, or made entirely of glass. There is no need for lintels or other structure around the windows.\n\n===\"Architectural Promenade\"===\nThe \"Architectural Promenade\" was another idea dear to Le Corbusier, which he particularly put into play in his design of the [[Villa Savoye]]. In 1928, in ''Une Maison, un Palais'', he described it: \"Arab architecture gives us a precious lesson: it is best appreciated in walking, on foot. It is in walking, in going from one place to another, that you see develop the features of the architecture. In this house ([[Villa Savoye]]) you find a veritable architectural promenade, offering constantly varying aspects, unexpected, sometimes astonishing.\" The promenade at Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier wrote, both in the interior of the house and on the roof terrace, often erased the traditional difference between the inside and outside.<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Une maison \u2013 un palais'', G. Cr\u00e8s & Cie (1928), pp. 70\u201378</ref>\n\n===''Ville Radieuse'' and Urbanism===\nIn the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in ''[[Ville Radieuse|La Ville radieuse]]'' (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position.{{Sfn|Fishman|1982|p=231}} Some have read dark overtones into ''The Radiant City'': from the \"astonishingly beautiful assemblage of buildings\" that was Stockholm, for example, Le Corbusier saw only \"frightening chaos and saddening monotony.\" He dreamed of \"cleaning and purging\" the city, bringing \"a calm and powerful architecture\"\u2014referring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete. Although Le Corbusier's designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly \"destroyed\" the city with them.<ref name=dalrymple>{{cite journal|last=Dalrymple|first=Theodore|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian: Le Corbusier's baleful influence|journal=City Journal|date=Autumn 2009 |volume=19 |issue=4|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient [[Scientific management|Taylorist]] and [[Fordism|Fordist]] strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society. As Norma Evenson has put it, \"the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient.\"<ref name=evenson>{{cite book|last=Evenson|first=Norma|title=Le Corbusier: The Machine and the Grand Design|publisher=George Braziller|location=New York|year=1969|page=7}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier \"His ideas\u2014his urban planning and his architecture\u2014are viewed separately,\" Perelman noted, \"whereas they are one and the same thing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-books-claim-le-corbusier-fascist-289334|title=New Books Claim Le Corbusier Was a Fascist|last=Munro|first=Cait|date=17 April 2005|website=Artnet news|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn ''La Ville radieuse'', he conceived an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|page=228}}\n\nLe Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. There is a noteworthy resemblance between the concept of the unit\u00e9 and Fourier's [[phalanstery]].<ref name=serenyi>{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Serenyi|title=Le Corbusier, Fourier, and the Monastery of Ema|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=49|number=4|date=December 1967|page=282|doi=10.2307/3048487|jstor=3048487}}</ref> From Fourier, Le Corbusier adopted at least in part his notion of administrative, rather than political, government.\n\n===Modulor===\n{{Main|Modulor}}\n\nThe [[Modulor]] was a standard model of the human form which Le Corbusier devised to determine the correct amount of living space needed for residents in his buildings. It was also his rather original way of dealing with differences between the metric system and British or American system, since the Modulor was not attached to either one.\n\nLe Corbusier explicitly used the [[golden ratio]] in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s \"[[Vitruvian Man]]\", the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the [[golden ratio]], Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. Many scholars see the Modulor as a humanistic expression but it is also argued that: \"It's exactly the opposite (...) It's the mathematicization of the body, the standardization of the body, the rationalization of the body.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/arts/design/le-corbusiers-architecture-and-his-politics-are-revisited.html|title=New York Times|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=12 July 2015|website=nytimes.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHe took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.\n\nLe Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.<ref name=padovan>{{cite book|last=Padovan|first=Richard|title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture|date=2 November 1999|page=320|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-419-22780-9|quote=from Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.35: \"Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section.\"}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier placed systems of harmony and proportion at the centre of his design philosophy, and his faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden section and the Fibonacci series, which he described as \"rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in Man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages, and the learned.\"{{sfn|padovan|1999|page=316}}\n\n===Open Hand===\n[[File:Open Hand Monument in Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|''[[Open Hand Monument]]'' in Chandigarh, India]]\n\nThe Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\" The largest of the many Open Hand sculptures that Le Corbusier created is a {{convert|26|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} version in Chandigarh, India known as ''[[Open Hand Monument]]''.\n\n==Furniture==\n{{Main|Le Corbusier's Furniture}}\n\nLe Corbusier was an eloquent critic of the finely crafted, hand-made furniture, made with rare and exotic woods, inlays and coverings, presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts. Following his usual method, Le Corbusier first wrote a book with his theories of furniture, complete with memorable slogans.  In his 1925 book ''L'Art D\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'', he called for furniture that used inexpensive materials and could be mass-produced. Le Corbusier described three different furniture types: ''type-needs'', ''type-furniture'', and ''human-limb objects''. He defined human-limb objects as: \"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony\".  He further declared, \"Chairs are architecture, sofas are [[bourgeois]]\",\n[[File:LC4 Chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand 1927-28.jpg|thumb|Frame of an LC4 chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand (1927\u201328) at Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris]]\nLe Corbusier first relied on ready-made furniture from Thonet to furnish his projects, such as his pavilion at the 1925 Exposition.  In 1928, following the publication of his theories, he began experimenting with furniture design.  In 1928, he invited the architect [[Charlotte Perriand]] to join his studio as a furniture designer. His cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]], also collaborated on many of the designs. For the manufacture of his furniture, he turned to the German firm [[Gebr\u00fcder Thonet]], which had begun making chairs with tubular steel, a material originally used for bicycles, in the early 1920s. Le Corbusier admired the design of [[Marcel Breuer]] and the [[Bauhaus]], who in 1925 had begun making sleek modern tubular club chairs. [[Mies van der Rohe]] had begun making his own version in a sculptural curved form with a cane seat in 1927.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=382}}\n\nThe first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three types of chairs made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames: The [[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|LC4]], Chaise Longue, (1927\u201328), with a covering of cowhide, which gave it a touch of exoticism; the ''Fauteuil Grand Confort'' (LC3) (1928\u201329), a club chair with a tubular frame which resembled the comfortable Art Deco club chairs that became popular in the 1920s; and the ''Fauteuil \u00e0 dossier basculant'' (LC4) (1928\u201329), a low seat suspended in a tubular steel frame, also with a cowhide upholstery. These chairs were designed specifically for two of his projects, the ''Maison la Roche'' in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. All three clearly showed the influence of Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. The line of furniture was expanded with additional designs for Le Corbusier's 1929 ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' installation, 'Equipment for the Home'. Despite the intention of Le Corbusier that his furniture should be inexpensive and mass-produced, his pieces were originally costly to make and were not mass-produced until many years later, when he was famous. {{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=383}}\n\n==Politics==\nThe political views of Le Corbusier were rather variable over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In the 1920s, he co-founded and contributed articles about urbanism to the fascist journals ''Plans'', ''Pr\u00e9lude'' and ''L'Homme R\u00e9el''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brott|first=Simone|date=2013|title=In the Shadow of the Enlightenment Le Corbusier, Le Faisceau and Georges Valois|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand|volume=2|issue=30|pages=777\u2013789|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/63644/|quote=\"his contribution to three fascist revues: Plans, Pr\u00e9lude and L\u2019Homme R\u00e9el\"}}</ref><ref name=\"simone 2\">{{Cite journal |last=Brott |first=Simone |date=2017-12-08 |title=The Le Corbusier Scandal, or, was Le Corbusier a Fascist? |journal=Fascism |language=en |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=196\u2013227 |doi=10.1163/22116257-00602003 |issn=2211-6249}}</ref> He also penned pieces in favour of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] for those journals, as well as \"hateful editorials\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11543431/Le-Corbusier-was-militant-fascist-two-new-books-on-French-architect-claim.html |title=Le Corbusier was 'militant fascist', two new books on French architect claim |last=Samuel |first=Henry |date=2015-04-16 |quote=\"Mr Jarcy said that in \"Plans\" Le Corbusier wrote in support of Nazi anti-Semitism and in \"Prelude\" co-wrote \"hateful editorials\"}}</ref> Between 1925 and 1928, Le Corbusier had connections to [[Le Faisceau]], a short-lived French fascist party led by [[Georges Valois]].

In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, particularly the redesign of [[Marseille]] after its Jewish population had been forcefully removed,<ref name=\"simone 2\" /> he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Alexis Carrel]], a [[eugenics|eugenicist]] surgeon, appointed Le Corbusier to the Department of Bio-Sociology of the ''Foundation for the Study of Human Problems'', an institute promoting eugenics policies under the Vichy regime.<ref name=\"simone 2\" />\n\nLe Corbusier has been accused of anti-semitism. He wrote to his mother in October 1940, prior to a referendum held by the Vichy government: \"The Jews are having a bad time. I occasionally feel sorry. But it appears their blind lust for money has rotted the country\". He was also accused of belittling the Muslim population of Algeria, then part of France. When Le Corbusier proposed a plan for the rebuilding of Algiers, he condemned the existing housing for European Algerians, complaining that it was inferior to that inhabited by indigenous Algerians: \"the civilized live like rats in holes\", while \"the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being.\"<ref name=celik>{{cite book|last=Celik|first=Zeynep|title=Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers under French Rule|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=28 July 1997|page=4|isbn=978-0520204577|accessdate=}}</ref>  His plan for rebuilding Algiers was rejected, and thereafter Le Corbusier mostly avoided politics.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Antliff|first=Mark |title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909\u20131939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADTdniFtnuwC|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-9047-3}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nFew other 20th-century architects were praised, or criticized, as much as Le Corbusier. In his eulogy to Le Corbusier at the memorial ceremony for the architect in the courtyard of the Louvre on 1 September 1965, French Culture Minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] declared, \"Le Corbusier had some great rivals, but none of them had the same significance in the revolution of architecture, because none bore insults so patiently and for so long.\"<ref>Andr\u00e9 Malraux, funeral oration for Le Corbusier, 1 September 1965, cited in Journal (2015), p. 3.1</ref>\n\nLater criticism of Le Corbusier was directed at his ideas of urban planning. In 1998 the architectural historian [[Witold Rybczynski]] wrote in ''Time'' magazine: <blockquote> \"He called it the Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City. Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic. Wherever it was tried\u2014in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers\u2014it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan, socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighborhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy.\"<ref>Rybcznski, Witold, ''Time'' magazine, 8 June 1998.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[:Category:Historians of technology|Technological historian]] and architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] wrote in ''Yesterday's City of Tomorrow'' that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier's skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities. The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter. By \"mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had, in fact, produced a sterile hybrid.\"\n\nThe public housing projects influenced by his ideas have been criticized for isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community's development. One of his most influential detractors has been [[Jane Jacobs]], who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier's urban design theories in her seminal work ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.\n\nFor some critics, the urbanism of Le Corbusier's was the model for a fascist state.<ref>{{Cite book\n            |chapter=La Cit\u00e9 francaise: George Valois, Le Corbusier, and Fascist Theories of Urbanism\n            |pages=134\u2013170\n            |last=Antliff\n            |first=Mark\n            |title=Fascist Visions: Art and Ideology in France and Italy\n            |editor1-last=Antliff\n            |editor1-first=Mark\n            |editor2-last=Affron\n            |editor2-first=Matthew\n            |publisher=Princeton University Press\n            |year=1997\n            |isbn=978-0-691027388\n            |location=\n            |via=}}</ref> These critics cited Le Corbusier himself when he wrote that \"not all citizens could become leaders.

He thought that industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape. He was a leader of the modernist movement to create better living conditions and a better society through housing.

The large spartan structures in cities, but not part of it, have been criticized for being boring and unfriendly to pedestrians.<ref>The Most Important People of the 20th Century (Part-II): Artists & Entertainers, Page 144</ref>\n\nSeveral of the many architects who worked for Le Corbusier in his studio became prominent, including painter-architect [[Nadir Afonso]], who absorbed Le Corbusier's ideas into his own aesthetics theory. [[L\u00facio Costa]]'s [[urban planning|city plan]] of [[Bras\u00edlia]] and the industrial city of [[Zl\u00edn]] planned by [[Franti\u0161ek Lydie Gahura]] in the Czech Republic are based on his ideas.  Le Corbusier's thinking had profound effects on city planning and architecture in the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivist]] era.\n\nLe Corbusier harmonized and lent credence to the idea of space as a set of destinations between which mankind moved continuously.  He gave credibility to the automobile as transporter, and to freeways in urban spaces. His philosophies were useful to urban real estate developers in the American post-World War II period because they justified and lent intellectual support to the desire to raze traditional urban space for high density, high profit urban concentration. The freeways connected this new urbanism to low density, low cost, highly profitable suburban locales available to be developed for middle class single-family housing.\n\nMissing from this scheme of movement was connectivity between isolated urban villages created for lower-middle and working classes, and the destination points in Le Corbusier's plan: suburban and rural areas, and urban commercial centers. The freeways as designed traveled over, at, or beneath grade levels of the living spaces of the urban poor, for example the [[Cabrini\u2013Green]] housing project in Chicago. Such projects with no freeway exit ramps, cut off by freeway rights-of-way, became isolated from jobs and services concentrated at Le Corbusier's nodal transportation end points. As jobs migrated to the suburbs, urban village dwellers found themselves without freeway access points in their communities or public mass transit that could economically reach suburban job centers. Late in the post-War period, suburban job centers found labor shortages to be such a critical problem that they sponsored urban-to-suburban shuttle bus services to fill vacant working class and lower-middle class jobs, which did not typically pay enough to afford car ownership.\n<!--NOTE: highly editorialized presentation (\"prophet who could do no wrong\", \"incompetence\", \"Machiavellian\", \"absurd\") -- use neutral tone and include citations or quotes if appropriate.. Le Corbusier deliberately created a myth about himself and was revered in his lifetime, and after death, by a generation of followers who believed Le Corbusier was a prophet who could do no wrong. But in the 1950s the first doubts began to appear, notably in some essays by his greatest admirers such as [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Colin Rowe]], who denounced as catastrophic his ideas on the city. Later critics revealed his technical incompetence as an architect. In his book ''Arm\u00e9e du Salut'', Brian Brace Taylor went into great detail about Le Corbusier's Machiavellian activities to create this commission for himself, his many ill-judged design decisions about building technologies, and the sometimes absurd solutions he then proposed. -->\n<!--NOTE: We cannot say \"more recently\" -- that's [[WP:DATED]].

It now owns Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (which form the foundation's headquarters), as well as the apartment occupied by Le Corbusier from 1933 to 1965 at rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris 16e, and the \"Small House\" he built for his parents in [[Corseaux]] on the shores of [[Lac Leman]] (1924).\n\nMaison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (1923\u201324), also known as the La Roche-Jeanneret house, is a pair of semi-detached houses that was Le Corbusier's third commission in Paris. They are laid out at right angles to each other, with iron, concrete, and blank, white fa\u00e7ades setting off a curved two-story gallery space. Maison La Roche is now a museum containing about 8,000 original drawings, studies and plans by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with [[Pierre Jeanneret]] from 1922 to 1940), as well as about 450 of his paintings, about 30 enamels, about 200 other works on paper, and a sizable collection of written and photographic archives. It describes itself as the world's largest collection of Le Corbusier drawings, studies, and plans.<ref name=foundation/><ref name=parisinfo>{{cite web|title=Mus\u00e9e: Fondation Le Corbusier \u2013 Maison La Roche|url=http://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71409/Fondation-Le-Corbusier-Maison-La-Roche|publisher=Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* In 1937, Le Corbusier was named Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour#Membership|L\u00e9gion d'honneur]].

He was born in [[Switzerland]] and became a [[France|French citizen]] in 1930. His career spanned five decades, and he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, and North and South America.\n\nDedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM). Le Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of [[Chandigarh]] in [[India]], and contributed specific designs for several buildings there, specially the government buildings.\n\nOn 17 July 2016, seventeen projects by Le Corbusier in seven countries were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as [[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier|The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1528/|title=The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life (1887\u20131904)==\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, Still Life, oil on canvas, 80.9 x 99.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|80.9|x|99.7|cm|1|abbr=on}}, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]\n\nCharles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret was born on 6 October 1887 in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], a small city in the French-speaking [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel canton]] in north-western Switzerland, in the [[Jura mountains]], {{convert|5|km|mi}} across the border from France. It was an industrial town, devoted to manufacturing watches. (He adopted the pseudonym ''Le Corbusier'' in 1920.) His father was an artisan who enameled boxes and watches, and his mother taught piano. His elder brother Albert was an amateur violinist.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  He attended a kindergarten that used [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Fr\u00f6belian]] methods.<ref>Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier et l'urbain \u2013 la rectification du damier froebelien, pp. 93\u2013117.</ref><ref>Actes du colloque La ville et l'urbanisme apr\u00e8s Le Corbusier, \u00e9ditions d'en Haut 1993 \u2013 {{ISBN|2-88251-033-0}}.</ref><ref>Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier entre Raphael et Fr\u00f6bel, pp. 9\u201327, Journal d'histoire de l'architecture N\u00b01, Presses universitaires de Grenoble 1988 \u2013 {{ISBN|2-7061-0325-6}}.</ref>\n\nLike his contemporaries [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]], Le Corbusier lacked formal training as an architect.  He was attracted to the visual arts; at the age of fifteen he entered the municipal art school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds which taught the applied arts connected with watchmaking.  Three years later he attended the higher course of decoration, founded by the painter [[Charles L'Eplattenier]], who had studied in [[Budapest]] and Paris. Le Corbusier wrote later that L'Eplattenier had made him \"a man of the woods\" and taught him painting from nature.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  His father frequently took him into the mountains around the town.  He wrote later, \"we were constantly on mountaintops; we grew accustomed to a vast horizon.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourdhui'' (1925), p. 198.</ref> His architecture teacher in the Art School was architect Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier's earliest house designs.  He reported later that it was the art teacher L'Eplattenier who made him choose architecture. \"I had a horror of architecture and architects,\" he wrote. \"...I was sixteen, I accepted the verdict and I obeyed.  I moved into architecture.\"<ref>Cited by Jean Petit, ''Le Corbusier lui-meme'',  Rousseau, Geneva 1970, p. 28.</ref>\n\n==Travel and first houses (1905\u20131914)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Cdffallet.jpg|Le Corbusier's student project, the [[Villa Fallet]], a chalet in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland (1905)\nFile:Maison blanche 01.jpg|The \"Maison Blanche\", built for Le Corbusier's parents in La Chaux-de-Fonds (1912)\nFile:Maison blanche 05.jpg|Open Interior of the \"Maison Blanche\" (1912)\nFile:Villa Favre-Jacot 2.JPG|The Villa Favre-Jacot in [[Le Locle]], Switzerland (1912)\n</gallery>\n\nLe Corbusier began teaching himself by going to the library to read about architecture and philosophy, by visiting museums, by sketching buildings, and by constructing them.  In 1905, he and two other students, under the supervision of their teacher, Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz, designed and built his first house, the [[Villa Fallet]], for the engraver Louis Fallet, a friend of his teacher Charles L'Eplattenier. Located on the forested hillside near Chaux-de-fonds, it was a large chalet with a steep roof in the local alpine style and carefully crafted colored geometric patterns on the fa\u00e7ade.  The success of this house led to his construction of two similar houses, the Villas Jacquemet and Stotzer, in the same area.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=49}}\n\nIn September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; then that winter traveling through Budapest to Vienna, where he stayed for four months and met [[Gustav Klimt]] and tried, without success, to meet [[Josef Hoffmann]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=48}}  In Florence, he visited the [[Florence Charterhouse]] in [[Galluzzo]], which made a lifelong impression on him. \"I would have liked to live in one of what they called their cells,\"  he wrote later. \"It was the solution for a unique kind of worker's housing, or rather for a terrestrial paradise.\"<ref>Letter to Eplattenier in Dumont, ''Le Corbusier, Lettres a ses maitres'', vol. 2, pp. 82\u201383.</ref>  He traveled to Paris, and during fourteen months between 1908 until 1910 he worked as a draftsman in the office of the architect [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of the use of reinforced [[concrete]] in residential construction and the architect of the [[Art Deco]] landmark [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]].  Two years later, between October 1910 and March 1911, he traveled to Germany and worked four months in the office [[Peter Behrens]], where [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]] were also working and learning.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1911, he traveled again with his friend [[August Klipstein]] for five months;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Klip and Corb on the road|last=\u017dakni\u0107|first=Ivan|publisher=Scheidegger & Spiess|year=2019|isbn=978-3-85881-817-1|location=Z\u00fcrich|pages=}}</ref> this time he journeyed to the [[Balkans]] and visited [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], as well as [[Pompeii]] and [[Rome]], filling nearly 80 sketchbooks with renderings of what he saw\u2014including many sketches of the [[Parthenon]], whose forms he would later praise in his work ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'' (1923).  He spoke of what he saw during this trip in many of his books, and it was the subject of his last book, ''Le Voyage d'Orient''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32\u201333}}\n\nIn 1912, he began his most ambitious project; a new house for his parents. also located on the forested hillside near La-Chaux-de-Fonds.  The Jeanneret-Perret house was larger than the others, and in a more innovative style; the horizontal planes contrasted dramatically with the steep alpine slopes, and the white walls and lack of decoration were in sharp contrast with the other buildings on the hillside. The interior spaces were organized around the four pillars of the salon in the center, foretelling the open interiors he would create in his later buildings.  The project was more expensive to build than he imagined; his parents were forced to move from the house within ten years, and relocate in a more modest house.  However, it led to a commission to build an even more imposing villa in the nearby village of [[Le Locle]]  for a wealthy watch manufacturer, Georges Favre-Jacot. Le Corbusier designed the new house in less than a month. The building was carefully designed to fit its hillside site, and interior plan was spacious and designed around a courtyard for maximum light, significant departure from the traditional house.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=48\u20139}}\n\n==Dom-ino House and Schwob House (1914\u20131918)==\n[[File:Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), 1914-15, Maison Dom-Ino.jpg|thumb|left|Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret, 1914\u201315, [[Dom-ino House|''Maison Dom-Ino (Dom-ino House)'']] ]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Le Corbusier taught at his old school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds.

He had first discovered concrete working in the office of  [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of reinforced concrete architecture in Paris, but now wanted to use it in new ways.\n\n\"Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources,\" he wrote later, \"and variety, and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be rhythm of a palace, and a Pompieen tranquility.\"<ref>Letter to Auguste Perret (1915), cited in ''Lettres a ces Maitres'', vol. 1, p. 33.</ref>  This led him to his plan for the [[Dom-ino House|Dom-Ino House]] (1914\u201315). This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of three concrete slabs supported by six thin [[reinforced concrete column]]s, with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan.<ref name=\"Tim Benton\">Tim Benton, ''Les Villas de Le Corbusier 1920\u20131929'', Philippe Sers \u00e9d.

He described it in his patent application as \"a juxtiposable system of construction according to an infinite number of combinations of plans.  This would permit, he wrote, \"the construction of the dividing walls at any point on the fa\u00e7ade or the interior.\"\n\n[[File:CF05.jpg|thumb|The Anatole Schwob House in La-Chaux-de-Fonds (1916\u20131918)]]\n\nUnder this system, the structure of the house did not have to appear on the outside, but could be hidden behind a glass wall, and the interior could be arranged in any way the architect liked.<ref>cited by Turner, Paul, \"La Formation de Le Corbusier\", Paris, Macula, 1987, p. 218.</ref> After it was patented, Le Corbusier designed a number of houses according to the system, which were all white concrete boxes. Although some of these were never built, they illustrated his basic architectural ideas which would dominate his works throughout the 1920s. He refined the idea in his 1927 book on the ''Five Points of a New Architecture''. This design, which called for the disassociation of the structure from the walls, and the freedom of plans and fa\u00e7ades, became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50\u201351}}\n\nIn August 1916, Le Corbusier received his largest commission ever, to construct a villa for the Swiss watchmaker Anatole Schwob, for whom he had already completed several small remodeling projects. He was given a large budget and the freedom to design not only the house, but also to create the interior decoration and choose the furniture.  Following the precepts of Auguste Perret, he built the structure out of reinforced concrete and filled the gaps with brick. The center of the house is a large concrete box with two semicolumn structures on both sides, which reflects his ideas of pure geometrical forms. A large open hall with a chandelier occupied the center of the building.  \"You can see,\" he wrote to Auguste Perret in July 1916, \"that Auguste Perret left more in me than Peter Behrens.\"<ref>cited in ''Lettres a css maitres'', vol. 1, p. 181.</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier's grand ambitions collided with the ideas and budget of his client, and led to bitter conflicts.  Schwob went to court and denied Le Corbusier access to site, or the right to claim to be the architect. Le Corbusier responded, \"Whether you like it or not, my presence is inscribed in every corner of your house.\" Le Corbusier took great pride in the house, and reproduced pictures in several of his books.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50}}\n\n==Painting, Cubism, Purism and ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' (1918\u20131922)==\n[[File:Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte, oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Le Corbusier, 1921, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles Edouard Jeanneret), 1922, Nature morte verticale (Vertical Still Life), oil on canvas, 146.3 x 89.3 cm, Kunstmuseum, Basel.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, 1922, ''Nature morte verticale'' (''Vertical Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|146.3|x|89.3|cm|1|abbr=in}}, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]] ]]\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), 1920, Guitare verticale (2\u00e8me version), oil on canvas, 100 x 81 cm, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, 1920, ''Guitare verticale'' (2\u00e8me version), oil on canvas, {{convert|100|x|81|cm|0|abbr=on}}, Fondation Le Corbusier, Paris]]\n\nLe Corbusier moved to Paris definitively in 1917 and began his own architectural practice with his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (1896\u20131967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the [[World War II]] years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Le_Corbusier/129220|title=Encyclop\u00e9die Larousse en ligne \u2013 Charles \u00c9douard Jeanneret dit Le Corbusier|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|date=|work=larousse.fr}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Le Corbusier met the [[Cubism|Cubist]] painter [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]], in whom he recognised a kindred spirit.

Ozenfant and Le Corbusier began writing for a new journal,  ''[[L'Esprit Nouveau]]'', and promoted with energy and imagination his ideas of architecture.\n\nIn the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted '''Le Corbusier''' (an altered form of his maternal grandfather's name, Lecorb\u00e9sier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOKNzunERUwC&pg=PA161|title=Le Corbusier: choix de lettres|first1=Le|last1=Corbusier|first2=Jean|last2=Jenger|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|via=Google Books|isbn=9783764364557}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.asso.fr/repbio_us.htm Rep\u00e8res biographiques, Fondation Le Corbusier].

They resigned and founded the Union of Modern Artists (\u201c[[Union des artistes modernes]]\u201d: UAM).\n\nHis theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models. Among these, was the Maison \"Citrohan.\"  The project's name was a reference to the French [[Citro\u00ebn]] automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials Le Corbusier advocated using in the house's construction as well as the way in which he intended the homes would be consumed, similar to other commercial products, like the automobile.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anti-object : the dissolution and disintegration of architecture|last=Kuma, Kengo, 1954-|date=2008|publisher=Architectural Association|others=Architectural Association (Great Britain)|isbn=978-1-902902-52-4|location=London|oclc=67375498}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Maison Citrohan model, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor. The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace. On the exterior Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the fa\u00e7ades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames. Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs. Interior walls also were left white.\n\n==''Toward an Architecture'' (1920\u20131923)==\nIn 1922 and 1923, Le Corbusier devoted himself to advocating his new concepts of architecture and urban planning in a series of polemical articles published in ''L'Esprit Nouveau''. At the Paris Salon d'Automne in 1922, he presented his plan for the [[Ville Contemporaine]], a model city for three million people, whose residents would live and work in a group of identical sixty-story tall apartment buildings surrounded by lower zig-zag apartment blocks and a large park. In 1923, he collected his essays from ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' published his first and most influential book, ''[[Toward an Architecture|Towards an Architecture]]''. He presented his ideas for the future of architecture in a series of maxims, declarations, and exhortations. commencing with \"A grand epoch has just begun. There exists a new spirit. There already exist a crowd of works in the new spirit, they are found especially in industrial production. Architecture is suffocating in its current uses. \"Styles\" are a lie. Style is a unity of principles which animates all the work of a period and which result in a characteristic spirit...Our epoch determines each day its style..-Our eyes, unfortunately don't know how to see it yet,\" and his most famous maxim, \"A house is a machine to live in.\"  Most of the many photographs and drawings in the book came from outside the world of traditional architecture;   the cover showed the promenade deck of an ocean liner, while others showed racing cars, airplanes, factories, and the huge concrete and steel arches of [[zeppelin]] hangars.{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1923|pages=1\u2013150}}\n\n==L'Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1925)==\n[[File:Pavillon L'Esprit Nouveau.jpg|thumb|The Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau (1925)]]\n[[File:Plan Voisin model.jpg|thumb|The model of the [[Plan Voisin]] for the reconstruction of Paris displayed at the Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau]]\n\nAn important early work of Le Corbusier was the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, built for the 1925 Paris [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]], the event which later gave [[Art Deco]] its name. Le Corbusier built the pavilion in collaboration with [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]] and with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant had broken with [[Cubism]] and formed the [[Purism]] movement in 1918 and in 1920 founded their journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau''.  In his new journal, Le Corbusier vividly denounced the decorative arts:  \"Decorative Art, as opposed to the machine phenomenon, is the final twitch of the old manual modes, a dying thing.\"  To illustrate his ideas, he and Ozenfant decided to create small pavilion at the Exposition, representing his idea of the future urban housing unit. A house, he wrote, \"is a cell within the body of a city. The cell is made up of the vital elements which are the mechanics of a house...Decorative art is antistandarizational. Our pavilion will contain only standard things created by industry in factories and mass produced, objects truly of the style of today...my pavilion will therefore be a cell extracted from a huge apartment building.\"{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}\n\nLe Corbusier and his collaborators were given a plot of land located behind the [[Grand Palais]] in the center of the Exposition. The plot was forested, and exhibitors could not cut down trees, so Le Corbusier built his pavilion with a tree in the center, emerging through a hole in the roof. The building was a stark white box with an interior terrace and square glass windows. The interior was decorated with a few cubist paintings and with a few pieces of mass-produced commercially available furniture, entirely different from the expensive, one-of-a-kind pieces in the other pavilions.  The chief organizers of the Exposition were furious, and built a fence to partially hide the pavilion. Le Corbusier had to appeal to the Ministry of Fine Arts, which ordered that fence be taken down.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}\n\nBesides the furniture, the pavilion exhibited a model of his [[Plan Voisin]]  his provocative plan for rebuilding a large part of the centre of Paris. He proposed to bulldoze a large area north of the Seine and replace the narrow streets, monuments and houses with giant sixty-story cruciform towers placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favorable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs. The plan was never seriously considered, but it provoked discussion concerning how to deal with the overcrowded poor working-class neighborhoods of Paris, and it later saw partial realization in the housing developments built in the Paris suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe Pavilion was ridiculed by many critics, but Le Corbusier, undaunted, wrote:  \"Right now one thing is sure. 1925 marks the decisive turning point in the quarrel between the old and new. After 1925, the antique-lovers will have virtually ended their lives . . . Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the 'new'.\"{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=49}}\n\n==''The Decorative Art of Today'' (1925)==\nIn 1925, Le Corbusier combined a series of articles about decorative art from \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" into a book, ''L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'' (''The Decorative Art of Today'').<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif d\u2019aujourd'hui'', Paris, G.

His basic premise, repeated throughout the book, was: \"Modern decorative art has no decoration.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''L'art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'', (originally 1925, Flammarion edition of 1996, ISBN+978-2-0812-2062-1.</ref>  He attacked with enthusiasm the styles presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts:  \"The desire to decorate everything about one is a false spirit and an abominable small perversion....The religion of beautiful materials is in its final death agony...The almost hysterical onrush in recent years toward this quasi-orgy of decor is only the last spasm of a death already predictable.\"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|page=98}} He cited the 1912 book of the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] \"Ornament and crime\", and quoted Loos's dictum, \"The more a people are cultivated, the more decor disappears.\"   He attacked the deco revival of classical styles, what he called \"Louis Philippe and Louis XVI moderne\";  he condemned the \"symphony of color\" at the Exposition, and called it \"the triumph of assemblers of colors and materials. They were swaggering in colors... They were making stews out of fine cuisine.\"   He condemned the exotic styles presented at the Exposition based on the art of China, Japan, India and Persia.  \"It takes energy today to affirm our western styles.\" He criticized the \"precious and useless objects that accumulated on the shelves\" in the new style. He attacked the \"rustling silks, the marbles which twist and turn, the vermilion whiplashes, the silver blades of Byzantium and the Orient\u2026Let's be done with it!\"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70\u201381}}\n\n\"Why call bottles, chairs, baskets and objects decorative?\" Le Corbusier asked. \"They are useful tools\u2026.Decor is not necessary. Art is necessary.\" He declared that in the future the decorative arts industry would produce only \"objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution, and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style.\"  He described the future of decoration in these terms:  \"The ideal is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign.\" He concluded by repeating \"Modern decoration has no decoration\".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70\u201381}}\n\nThe book became a manifesto for those who opposed the more traditional styles of the decorative arts;  In the 1930s, as Le Corbusier predicted, the modernized versions of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI furniture and the brightly colored wallpapers of stylized roses were replaced by a more sober, more streamlined style.  Gradually the modernism and functionality proposed by Le Corbusier overtook the more ornamental style.  The shorthand titles that Le Corbusier used in the book, ''1925 Expo: Arts Deco'' was adapted in 1966 by the art historian [[Bevis Hillier]] for a catalog of an exhibition on the style, and in 1968 in the title of a book, ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''. And thereafter the term \"Art Deco\" was commonly used as the name of the style.<ref>Benton, Charlotte, Benton, Tim, Wood, Ghislaine, ''Art D\u00e9co dans le monde- 1910\u201339'', 2010, Renaissance du Livre, {{ISBN|9782507003906}}, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Five Points of Architecture to Villa Savoye (1923\u20131931)==\n{{Main|Villa Savoye|Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa La Roche 2013.jpg|The Villa La Roche-Jeanneret (now [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]) in Paris (1923)\nFile:Weissenhofsiedlung.jpg|Corbusier Haus (right) and Citrohan Haus in Weissenhof, Stuttgart, Germany (1927)\nFile:VillaSavoye.jpg|The [[Villa Savoye]] in [[Poissy]] (1928\u20131931)\n</gallery>\n\nThe notoriety that Le Corbusier achieved from his writings and the Pavilion at the 1925 Exposition led to commissions to build a dozen residences in Paris and in the Paris region in his \"purist style.\" These included the [[Maison La Roche|Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret]] (1923\u20131925), which now houses the [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]; the [[Maison Guiette]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium (1926); a residence for [[Jacques Lipchitz]]; the [[Maison Cook]], and the [[Maison Planeix]].  In 1927, he was invited by the German [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] to build three houses in the model city of Weissenhof near [[Stuttgart]], based on the Citrohan House and other theoretical models he had published. He described this project in detail one of his best-known essays, the ''Five Points of Architecture''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=37}}\n\nThe following year he began the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928\u20131931), which became one of the most famous of Le Corbusier's works, and an icon of modernist architecture. Located in [[Poissy]], in a landscape surrounded by trees and large lawn, the house is an elegant white box poised on rows of slender pylons, surrounded by a horizontal band of windows which fill the structure with light. The service areas (parking, rooms for servants and laundry room)  are located under the house.  Visitors enter a vestibule from which a gentle ramp leads to the house itself.  The bedrooms and salons of the house are distributed around a suspended garden;  the rooms look both out at the landscape and into the garden, which provides additional light and air. Another ramp leads up to the roof, and a stairway leads down to the cellar under the pillars.\n\nVilla Savoye succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' and the book ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'', which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by ''[[piloti]]s'', reinforced concrete stilts. These ''pilotis'', in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free fa\u00e7ade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an [[free plan|open floor plan]], meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, and which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the [[roof garden]] to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for a [[promenade architecturale]] through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial \"ocean-liner\" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired.\n\nLe Corbusier was quite rhapsodic when describing the house in ''Pr\u00e9cisions'' in 1930: \"the plan is pure, exactly made for the needs of the house. It has its correct place in the rustic landscape of Poissy.  It is Poetry and lyricism, supported by technique.\"{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}  The house had its problems;  the roof persistently leaked, due to construction faults;  but it became a landmark of modern architecture and one of the best-known works of Le Corbusier.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}\n\n==League of Nations Competition and Pessac Housing Project (1926\u20131930)==\n[[File:Pessac Quartiers Modernes Frug\u00e8s 004.jpg|thumb|Low-cost housing units built by Le Corbusier in the [[Quartiers Modernes Frug\u00e8s]] in [[Pessac]] (1927)]]\nThanks to his passionate articles in L'Esprit Nouveau, his participation in the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition and the conferences he gave on the new spirit of architecture, Le Corbusier had become well known in the architectural world, though he had only built residences for wealthy clients. In 1926, he entered the competition for the construction of a headquarters for the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva with a plan for an innovative lakeside complex of modernist white concrete office buildings and meeting halls. There were three-hundred thirty seven projects in competition.  It appeared that the Corbusier's project was the first choice of the architectural jury, but after much behind-the scenes maneuvering the jury declared it was unable to pick a single winner, and the project was given instead to the top five architects, who were all neoclassicists. Le Corbusier was not discouraged; he presented his own plans to the public in articles and lectures to show the opportunity that the League of Nations had missed.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=116}}\n\nIn 1927, Le Corbusier received the opportunity he had been looking for; he was commissioned by a Bordeaux industrialist, Henry Frug\u00e8s a fervent admirer of his ideas on urban planning, to build a complex of worker housing, the [[Quartiers Modernes Frug\u00e8s]], at [[Pessac]], near Bordeaux. Le Corbusier described Pessac as \"A little like a Balzac novel\", a chance to create a whole community for living and working. The Fruges quarter became his first laboratory for a residential housing;  a series of rectangular blocks composed of modular housing units located in a garden setting. Like the unit displayed at the 1925 Exposition, each housing unit had its own small terrace.  The earlier villas he constructed all had white exterior walls, but for Pessac, at the request of his clients, he added color; panels of brown, yellow and jade green, coordinated by Le Corbusier. Originally planned to have some two hundred units, it finally contained about fifty to seventy housing units, in eight buildings. Pessac became the model on a small scale for his later and much larger Cit\u00e9 Radieuse projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/arts/architecture-view-le-corbusier-s-housing-project-flexible-enough-endure-ada.html|title=Architecture View; Le Corbusier's Housing Project-Flexible Enough to Endure; by Ada Louise Huxtable|author=|date=15 March 1981|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Founding of CIAM (1928) and Athens Charter==\nIn 1928, Le Corbusier took a major step toward establishing modernist architecture as the dominant European style. Le Corbusier had met with many of the leading German and Austrian modernists during the competition for the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]]. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses;  Le Corbusier and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a ch\u00e2teau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland 26\u201328 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic \"Rational methods for groups of habitations\".  A third meeting, on \"The functional city\", was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Le Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1943 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84\u201385}}\n\n==Moscow projects (1928\u20131934)==\n{{Main|Le Corbusier in the USSR}}\n[[File:Centrosoyuz Moscow - Ak Sakharova view.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], headquarters of Soviet trade unions, Moscow (1928\u201334)]]\n\nLe Corbusier saw the new society founded in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution as a promising laboratory for his architectural ideas. He met the Russian architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] during the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and admired the construction of Melnikov's constructvist USSR pavilion, the only truly modernist building in the Exposition other than his own Esprit Nouveau pavilion. At Melnikov's invitation he traveled to Moscow, where found that his writings had been published in Russian; he gave lectures and interviews, and between 1928 and 1932 he constructed an office building for the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], the headquarters of Soviet trade unions.\n\nIn 1932, he was invited to take part in an international competition for the new [[Palace of the Soviets]] in Moscow, which was to be built on the site of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], demolished on Stalin's orders.  Le Corbusier contributed a highly original plan, a low-level complex of circular and rectangular buildings and a rainbow-like arch from which the roof of the main meeting hall was suspended. To Le Corbusier's distress, his plan was rejected by Stalin in favor of a plan for a massive neoclassical tower, the highest in Europe, crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin.  The Palace was never built;  construction was stopped by World War II, a swimming pool took its place;  and after the collapse of the USSR the cathedral was rebuilt on its original site.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=128}}\n\n==Cit\u00e9 Universitaire, Immeuble Clart\u00e9 and Cit\u00e9 de Refuge (1928\u20131933)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Geneve immeuble Clarte 2011-08-02 13 55 36 PICT3664.JPG|The [[Immeuble Clart\u00e9]] in [[Geneva]] (1930\u20131932)\nFile:La fondation suisse (Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris) n3.jpg|The Swiss Foundation in the [[Cit\u00e9 internationale universitaire de Paris]] (1929\u20131933)\n</gallery>\nBetween 1928 and 1934, as Le Corbusier's reputation grew, he received commissions to construct a wide variety of buildings. In 1928 he received a commission from the Soviet government to construct the headquarters of the Tsentrosoyuz, or central office of trade unions, a large office building whose glass walls alternated with plaques of stone. He built the Villa de Madrot in [[Le Pradet]] (1929\u20131931); and an apartment in Paris for Charles de Bestigui at the top of an existing building on the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] 1929\u20131932, (later demolished). In 1929\u20131930 he constructed a floating homeless shelter for the Salvation Army on the left bank of the Seine at the [[Pont d'Austerlitz]]. Between 1929 and 1933, he built a larger and more ambitious project for the Salvation Army, the [[Cit\u00e9 de Refuge]], on rue Cantagrel in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.  He also constructed the Swiss Pavilion in the [[Cit\u00e9 Universitaire]] in Paris with 46 units of student housing, (1929\u201333).  He designed furniture to go with the building;  the main salon was decorated with a montage of black-and-white photographs of nature.  In 1948, he replaced this with a colorful mural he painted himself. In Geneva he built a glass-walled apartment building with forty-five units, the [[Immeuble Clart\u00e9]]. Between 1931 and 1945 he built an apartment building with fifteen units, including an apartment and studio for himself on the 6th and 7th floors, at 4 rue Nungesser-et-Coli in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. overlooking the [[Bois de Boulogne]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=210}}  His apartment and studio are owned today by the Fondation Le Corbusier, and can be visited.\n\n==Ville Contemporaine, Plan Voisin and Cit\u00e9 Radieuse (1922\u20131939)==\n{{See also|Unit\u00e9 d'habitation|Ville Radieuse}}\nAs the global [[Great Depression]] enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted more and more time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d'Automne in Paris.  His plan featured tall office towers with surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that \"analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it.\"{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=98}} The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and to replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do.  The plan included a multi-level transportation hub that included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: \"The center of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is in reality a diamond mine...To abandon the center of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy.\" {{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=100}}\n\nAs no doubt Le Corbusier expected, no one hurried to implement the Plan Voisin, but he continued working on variations of the idea and recruiting followers. In 1929, he traveled to Brazil where he gave conferences on his architectural ideas. He returned with drawings of his own vision for Rio de Janeiro; he sketched serpentine multi-story apartment buildings on pylons, like inhabited highways, winding through [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\nIn 1931, he developed a visionary plan for another city [[Algiers]], then part of France.  This plan, like his Rio Janeiro plan, called for the construction of an elevated viaduct of concrete, carrying residential units, which would run from one end of the city to the other. This plan, unlike his early Plan Voisin, was more conservative, because it did not call for the destruction of the old city of Algiers; the residential housing would be over the top of the old city.  This plan, like his Paris plans, provoked discussion, but never came close to realization.\n\nIn 1935, Le Corbusier made his first visit to the United States. He was asked by American journalists what he thought about New York City skyscrapers; he responded, characteristically, that he found them \"much too small\".<ref>Time Magazine, article on Man of the Year, 5 May 1961</ref>  He wrote a book describing his experiences in the States, ''Quand les Cath\u00e9drales etait blanc-  voyages au pays des timides'' (When Cathedrals were White; voyage to the land of the timid) whose title expressed his view of the lack of boldness in American architecture.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=218}}\n\nHe wrote a great deal but built very little in the late 1930s.  The titles of his books expressed the combined urgency and optimism of his messages: ''Cannons? Munitions? No thank you, Lodging please!'' (1938) and ''The lyricism of modern times and urbanism'' (1939).\n\nIn 1928, the French Minister of Labour, [[Louis Loucheur]], won the passage of a French law on public housing, calling for the construction of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project.  These units were {{convert|45|m2|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, made with metal frames, and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors.  The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the ''Ville Radieuse'' or \"radiant city\", in a new book which published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principle functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be clearly separated into their own neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.\n\n==World War II and Reconstruction; [[Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation]] in Marseille (1939\u20131952)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:M\u00f3dulo de vivienda tipo de Unit\u00e9 d\u00b4Habitation.jpg|The modular design of the apartments inserted into the building\nFile:Cit\u00e9 radieuse.

He moved to [[Vichy]] for a time, where the collaborationist government of Marshal [[Philippe Petain]] was located, offering his services for architectural projects, including his plan for the reconstruction of Algiers, but they were rejected. He continued writing, completing ''Sur les Quatres routes'' (On the Four Routes) in 1941. After 1942, Le Corbusier left Vichy for Paris.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|pages=244\u2013246}}  He became for a time a technical adviser at [[Alexis Carrel]]'s eugenic foundation, he resigned from this position on 20 April 1944.<ref name=Libe>{{cite journal|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/2015/03/18/le-corbusier-plus-facho-que-fada_1223411|title=Le Corbusier plus facho que fada|journal=Liberation|date= 18 March 2015|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref> In 1943, he founded a new association of modern architects and builders, the Ascoral, the Assembly of Constructors for a renewal of architecture, but there were no projects to build.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=215}}\n\nWhen the war ended, Le Corbusier was nearly sixty years old, and he had not had a single project realized in ten years. He tried, without success, to obtain commissions for several of the first large reconstruction projects, but his proposals for the reconstruction of the town of [[Saint-Di\u00e9]] and for [[La Rochelle]] were rejected. Still, he persisted; Le Corbusier finally found a willing partner in [[Raoul Dautry]], the new Minister of Reconstruction and Urbanism. Dautry agreed to fund one of his projects, a \"[[Unit\u00e9 d'habitation|Unit\u00e9 d'habitation de grandeur conforme]]\", or housing units of standard size, with the first one to be built in [[Marseille]], which had been heavily damaged during the war.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=143}}\n\nThis was his first public commission, and was a major breakthrough for Le Corbusier. He gave the building the name of his pre-war theoretical project, the ''Cit\u00e9 Radieuse'', and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, he proposed a giant reinforced concrete framework, into which modular apartments would be fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 people. Each module was three stories high, and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran from one side of the building to the other, and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the ventilator shafts on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.\n\nThe building was designed not just to be a residence, but to offer all the services needed for living. Every third floor, between the modules, there was a wide corridor, like an interior street, which ran the length of the building from one end of the building to the other. This served as a sort of commercial street, with shops, eating places, a nursery school and recreational facilities. A running track and small stage for theater performances was located in the roof. The building itself was surrounded by trees and a small park.\n\nLe Corbusier wrote later that the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation concept was inspired by the visit he had made to the [[Florence Charterhouse]] at [[Galluzzo]] in Italy, in 1907 and 1910 during his early travels. He wanted to recreate, he wrote, an ideal place \"for meditation and contemplation.\"  He also learned from the monastery, he wrote, that \"standardization led to perfection,\" and that \"all of his life a man labours under this impulse: to make the home the temple of the family.\"{{sfn|Journel|2015|page=139}}\n\nThe Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation marked a turning point in the career of Le Corbusier; in 1952, he was made a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour|L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] in a ceremony held on the roof of his new building. He had progressed from being an outsider and critic of the architectural establishment to its centre, as the most prominent French architect.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=152\u2013158}}\n\n==Postwar projects, United Nations headquarters (1947\u20131952)==\n[[File:67\u00ba Per\u00edodo de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|right|The [[headquarters of the United Nations]] designed by Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Wallace K.

W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=426}}</ref> \n\nIn early 1947 Le Corbusier submitted a design for the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], which was to be built beside the East River in New York. Instead of competition, the design was to be selected by a Board of Design Consultants composed of leading international architects nominated by member governments, including Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] of Brazil, [[Howard Robertson (architect)|Howard Robertson]] from Britain, Nikolai Bassov of the Soviet Union, and five others from around the world. The committee was under the direction of the American architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], who was also architect for the Rockefeller family, which had donated the site for the building.\n\nLe Corbusier had submitted his plan for the Secretariat, called Plan 23 of the 58 submitted. In Le Corbusier's plan offices, council chambers and General Assembly hall were in a single block in the center of the site.  He lobbied hard for his project, and asked the younger Brazilian architect, Niemeyer, to support and assist him on his plan. Niemeyer, to help Le Corbusier, refused to submit his own design and did not attend the meetings until the Director, Harrison, insisted. Niemeyer then submitted his plan, Plan 32, with the office building and councils and General Assembly in separate buildings. After much discussion, the Committee chose Niemeyer's plan, but suggested that he collaborate with Le Corbusier on the final project. Le Corbusier urged Niemeyer to put the General Assembly Hall in the center of the site, though this would eliminate Niemeyer's plan to have a large plaza in the center. Niemeyer agreed with Le Corbusier's suggestion, and the headquarters was built, with minor modifications, according to their joint plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archives.un.org/content/oscar-niemeyer-and-united-nations-headquarters |title=Oscar Niemeyer and the United Nations Headquarters (1947\u20131949) |work=[[United Nations]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Religious architecture (1950\u20131963)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:RonchampCorbu.jpg|The [[Notre Dame du Haut|chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] in [[Ronchamp]] (1950\u20131955)\nFile:Sainte Marie de La Tourette 2007.jpg|The convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] near [[Lyon]] (1953\u20131960)\nFile:Couvent de la Tourette - 11.JPG|Meeting room inside the Convent of Sainte Marie de la Tourette\nFile:EgliseSaintPierreLeCorbusierFirminy.jpg|[[Saint-Pierre, Firminy|Church of Saint-Pierre]], [[Firminy]] (1960\u20132006)\nFile:Church @ Firminy, France.jpg|Interior of the Church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy.

(1960\u20132006)\n</gallery>\nLe Corbusier was an avowed atheist, but he also had a strong belief in the ability of architecture to create a sacred and spiritual environment. In the postwar years, he designed two important religious buildings; the [[Notre Dame du Haut|chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]] (1950\u20131955); and the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] (1953\u20131960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, P\u00e8re Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.\n\nLe Corbusier first visited the remote mountain site of Ronchamp in May 1950, saw the ruins of the old chapel, and drew sketches of possible forms. He wrote afterwards: \"In building this chapel, I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of prayer, of interior joy. The feeling of the sacred animated our effort.  Some things are sacred, others aren't, whether they're religious or not.\"<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Ronchamp'', Hatje, Stuttgart, (1925), p. 25.</ref>\n\nThe second major religious project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in [[L'Arbresle]] in the Rhone Department (1953\u20131960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier to visit the starkly simple and imposing 12th\u201313th century [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns.  For the living space he used the same [[Modulor]] concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of {{convert|2.26|m|abbr=off}}; and width {{convert|1.83|m|abbr=off}}.{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|pages=154\u201355}}\n\nLe Corbusier used raw concrete to construct the convent, which is placed on the side of a hill.  The three blocks of dormitories U, closed by the chapel, with a courtyard in the center. The Convent has a flat roof, and is placed on sculpted concrete pillars. Each of the residential cells has small loggia with a concrete sunscreen looking out at the countryside.  The centerpiece of the convent is the chapel, a plain box of concrete, which he called his \"Box of miracles.\"  Unlike the highly finished fa\u00e7ade of the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation, the fa\u00e7ade of the chapel is raw, unfinished concrete. He described the building in a letter to [[Albert Camus]] in 1957: \"I'm taken with the idea of a \"box of miracles\"....as the name indicates, it is a rectangual box made of concrete. It doesn't have any of the traditional theatrical tricks, but the possibility, as its name suggests, to make miracles.\"<ref>Letter to Albert Camus, 13 February 1957, FLC (Fondation Le Corbusier), E1-12-154)</ref> The interior of the chapel is extremely simple, only benches in a plain, unfinished concrete box, with light coming through a single square in the roof and six small band on the sides. The Crypt beneath has intense blue, red and yellow walls, and illumination by sunlight channeled from above.  The monastery has other unusual features, including floor to ceiling panels of glass in the meeting rooms, window panels that fragmented the view into pieces, and a system of concrete and metal tubes like gun barrels which aimed sunlight through colored prisms and projected it onto the walls of sacristy and to the secondary altars of the crypt on the level below. These were whimsically termed the \"\"machine guns\" of the sacristy and the \"light cannons\" of the crypt.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=184\u2013185}}\n\nIn 1960, Le Corbusier began a third religious building, the Church of Saint Pierre in the new town of Firminy-Vert, where he had built a Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation and a cultural and sports centre. While he made the original design, construction did not begin until five years after his death, and work continued under different architects until it was completed in 2006. The most spectacular feature of the church is the sloping concrete tower that covers the entire interior. similar to that in the Assembly Building in his complex at [[Chandigarh]]. Windows high in the tower illuminate the interior. Le Corbusier originally proposed that tiny windows also project the form of a constellation on the walls. Later architects designed the church to project the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|page=165}}\n\n==Chandigarh (1951\u20131956)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chandigarh High Court.jpg|The High Court of Justice, Chandigarh (1951\u20131956)\nFile:Chandigarh Secretariat.jpg|Secretariat Building, Chandigarh (1952\u20131958)\nFile:Palace of Assembly Chandigarh 2006.jpg|[[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)]] (1952\u20131961)\nFile:Chandigarh High Court sun.jpg|[[Punjab and Haryana High Court|Chandigarh High Court]]\n</gallery>\nLe Corbusier's largest and most ambitious project was the design of [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] States of India, created after India received independence in 1947. Le Corbusier was contacted in 1950 by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and invited to propose a project. An American architect, [[Albert Mayer (planner)|Albert Mayer]], had made a plan in 1947 for a city of 150,000 inhabitants, but the Indian government wanted a grander and more monumental city. Corbusier worked on the plan with two British specialists in urban design and tropical climate architecture, [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], and with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, who moved to India and supervised the construction until his death.\n\nLe Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic about his project; \"It will be a city of trees,\" he wrote, \"of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those at the time of Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of mathematics will reign.\".<ref>Letter to his wife Yvonne, 27 February 1951, FLC-R1-12-87. Cited by Journel, p. 182.</ref>  His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and a transportation infrastructure.  In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}  From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, \"Like a forced laborer.\" He dismissed the earlier American plan as \"Faux-Moderne\" and overly filled with parking spaces roads. His intent was to present what he had learned in forty years of urban study, and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}} His design made use of many of his favorite ideas: an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the [[Modulor]] to give a correct human scale to each element; and his favourite symbol, the open hand (\"The hand is open to give and to receive\"). He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nLe Corbusier's design called for the use of raw concrete, whose surface not smoothed or polished and which showed the marks of the forms in which it dried. Pierre Jeanneret wrote to his cousin that he was in a continual battle with the construction workers, who could not resist the urge to smooth and finish the raw concrete, particularly when important visitors were coming to the site. At one point one thousand workers were employed on the site of the High Court of Justice.  Le Corbusier wrote to his mother, \"It is an architectural symphony which surpasses all my hopes, which flashes and develops under the light in a way which is unimaginable and unforgettable. From far, from up close, it provokes astonishment; all made with raw concrete and a cement cannon. Adorable, and grandiose. In all the centuries no one has seen that.\"<ref>letter to his mother, 19 November 1954, FLC-R2-103. Cited by Journlet, p. 184.</ref>\n\nThe High Court of Justice, begun in 1951, was finished in 1956. The building was radical in its design; a parallelogram topped with an inverted parasol.  Along the walls were high concrete grills {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=off}} thick which served as sunshades. The entry featured a monumental ramp and columns that allowed the air to circulate.  The pillars were originally white limestone, but in the 1960s they were repainted in bright colors, which better resisted the weather.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nThe Secretariat, the largest building that housed the government offices, was constructed between 1952 and 1958.  It is an enormous block {{convert|250|m|abbr=off}} long and eight levels high, served by a ramp which extends from the ground to the top level. The ramp was designed to be partly sculptural and partly practical. Since there were no modern building cranes at the time of construction, the ramp was the only way to get materials to the top of the construction site. The Secretariat had two features which were borrowed from his design for the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille: concrete grill sunscreens over the windows and a roof terrace.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}\n\nThe most important building of the capitol complex was the [[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)|Palace of Assembly]] (1952\u201361), which faced the High Court at the other end of a five hundred meter esplanade with a large reflecting pool in the front. This building features a central courtyard, over which is the main meeting hall for the Assembly.  On the roof on the rear of the building is a signature feature of Le Corbusier, a large tower, similar in form to the smokestack of a ship or the ventilation tower of a heating plant. Le Corbusier added touches of color and texture with an immense tapestry in the meeting hall and large gateway decorated with enamel.  He wrote of this building, \"A Palace magnificent in its effect, from the new art of raw concrete.

In 1960 he published a new book, ''L'Atelier de la recherch\u00e9 patiente'' ''The workshop of patient research''), simultaneously published in four languages.  He received growing recognition for his pioneering work in modernist architecture;  in 1959, a successful international campaign was launched to have his Villa Savoye, threatened with demolition, declared an historic monument; it was the first time that a work by a living architect received this distinction.  In 1962, in the same year as the dedication of the Palace of the Assembly in Chandigarh, the first retrospective exhibit on his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1964, in a ceremony held in his atelier on rue de S\u00e8vres, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Culture Minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}\n\nHis later architectural work was extremely varied, and often based on designs of earlier projects. In 1952\u20131958, he designed a series of tiny vacation cabins, {{convert|2.26|x|2.26|x|2.6|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, for a site next to the Mediterranean at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]. He built a similar cabin for himself, but the rest of the project was not realized until after his death. In 1953\u20131957, he designed a residential building for Brazilian students for the Cit\u00e9 de la Universit\u00e9 in Paris. Between 1954 and 1959, he built the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo. His other projects included a cultural centre and stadium for the town of [[Firminy]], where he had built his first housing project (1955\u20131958); and a stadium in Baghdad, Iraq (much altered since its construction).  He also constructed three new ''Unit\u00e9s d'Habitation'', apartment blocks on the model of the original in Marseille, the first in Berlin (1956\u20131958), the second in Briey-en-For\u00eat in the [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] Department; and the third (1959\u20131967) in Firminy.  In 1960\u20131963, he built his only building in the United States; the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}\n\nAt the time of his death in 1965, several projects were on the drawing boards; the church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy, finally completed in modified form in 2006; a Palace of Congresses for Strasbourg (1962\u201365), and a hospital in Venice, (1961\u20131965) which were never built. Le Corbusier designed an art gallery beside the lake in Z\u00fcrich for gallery owner [[Heidi Weber]] in 1962\u20131967. Now called the [[Centre Le Corbusier]], it is one of his last finished works.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=212}}\n\n==Estate==\n[[File:Cabanon Le Corbusier.jpg|thumb|The holiday cabin where he spent his last days in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]]]\n\nThe Fondation Le Corbusier (FLC) functions as his official estate.<ref name=foundation>{{cite web|title=Foundation: History|url=http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysId=19&IrisObjectId=7778&sysLanguage=en-en&itemPos=1&sysParentId=19&clearQuery=1|publisher=Fondation Le Corbusier |accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> The US copyright representative for the Fondation Le Corbusier is the [[Artists Rights Society]].<ref name=rights>{{cite web|url=http://arsny.com/requested.html |title=Our Most Frequently Requested Prominent Artists |publisher=Artists Rights Society |year=2003 |accessdate=18 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131000000/http://arsny.com/requested.html |archivedate=31 January 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Ideas==\n===''The Five Points of a Modern Architecture''===\n{{Main|Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture}}\nLe Corbusier defined the principles of his new architecture in ''Les cinq points de l'architecture moderne'', published in 1927, and co-authored by his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]].  They summarized the lessons he had learned in the previous years, which he put literally into concrete form in his villas constructed of the late 1920s, most dramatically in the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928\u20131931)\n\nThe five points are:\n\n* The '''Pilotis''', or pylon. The building is raised up on reinforced concrete pylons, which allows for free circulation on the ground level, and eliminates dark and damp parts of the house.\n* The '''Roof Terrace'''. The sloping roof is replaced by a flat roof; the roof can be used as a garden, for promenades, sports or a swimming pool.\n* The '''Free Plan'''. Load-bearing walls are replaced by steel or reinforced concrete columns, so the interior can be freely designed, and interior walls can put anywhere, or left out entirely. The structure of the building is not visible from the outside.\n* The '''Ribbon Window'''. Since the walls do not support the house, the windows can run the entire length of the house, so all rooms can get equal light.\n* The '''Free Fa\u00e7ade'''. Since the building is supported by columns in the interior, the fa\u00e7ade can be much lighter and more open, or made entirely of glass. There is no need for lintels or other structure around the windows.\n\n===\"Architectural Promenade\"===\nThe \"Architectural Promenade\" was another idea dear to Le Corbusier, which he particularly put into play in his design of the [[Villa Savoye]]. In 1928, in ''Une Maison, un Palais'', he described it: \"Arab architecture gives us a precious lesson: it is best appreciated in walking, on foot. It is in walking, in going from one place to another, that you see develop the features of the architecture. In this house ([[Villa Savoye]]) you find a veritable architectural promenade, offering constantly varying aspects, unexpected, sometimes astonishing.\" The promenade at Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier wrote, both in the interior of the house and on the roof terrace, often erased the traditional difference between the inside and outside.<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Une maison \u2013 un palais'', G. Cr\u00e8s & Cie (1928), pp. 70\u201378</ref>\n\n===''Ville Radieuse'' and Urbanism===\nIn the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in ''[[Ville Radieuse|La Ville radieuse]]'' (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position.{{Sfn|Fishman|1982|p=231}} Some have read dark overtones into ''The Radiant City'': from the \"astonishingly beautiful assemblage of buildings\" that was Stockholm, for example, Le Corbusier saw only \"frightening chaos and saddening monotony.\" He dreamed of \"cleaning and purging\" the city, bringing \"a calm and powerful architecture\"\u2014referring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete. Although Le Corbusier's designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly \"destroyed\" the city with them.<ref name=dalrymple>{{cite journal|last=Dalrymple|first=Theodore|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian: Le Corbusier's baleful influence|journal=City Journal|date=Autumn 2009 |volume=19 |issue=4|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient [[Scientific management|Taylorist]] and [[Fordism|Fordist]] strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society. As Norma Evenson has put it, \"the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient.\"<ref name=evenson>{{cite book|last=Evenson|first=Norma|title=Le Corbusier: The Machine and the Grand Design|publisher=George Braziller|location=New York|year=1969|page=7}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier \"His ideas\u2014his urban planning and his architecture\u2014are viewed separately,\" Perelman noted, \"whereas they are one and the same thing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-books-claim-le-corbusier-fascist-289334|title=New Books Claim Le Corbusier Was a Fascist|last=Munro|first=Cait|date=17 April 2005|website=Artnet news|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn ''La Ville radieuse'', he conceived an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|page=228}}\n\nLe Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. There is a noteworthy resemblance between the concept of the unit\u00e9 and Fourier's [[phalanstery]].<ref name=serenyi>{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Serenyi|title=Le Corbusier, Fourier, and the Monastery of Ema|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=49|number=4|date=December 1967|page=282|doi=10.2307/3048487|jstor=3048487}}</ref> From Fourier, Le Corbusier adopted at least in part his notion of administrative, rather than political, government.\n\n===Modulor===\n{{Main|Modulor}}\n\nThe [[Modulor]] was a standard model of the human form which Le Corbusier devised to determine the correct amount of living space needed for residents in his buildings. It was also his rather original way of dealing with differences between the metric system and British or American system, since the Modulor was not attached to either one.\n\nLe Corbusier explicitly used the [[golden ratio]] in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s \"[[Vitruvian Man]]\", the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the [[golden ratio]], Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. Many scholars see the Modulor as a humanistic expression but it is also argued that: \"It's exactly the opposite (...) It's the mathematicization of the body, the standardization of the body, the rationalization of the body.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/arts/design/le-corbusiers-architecture-and-his-politics-are-revisited.html|title=New York Times|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=12 July 2015|website=nytimes.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHe took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.\n\nLe Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.<ref name=padovan>{{cite book|last=Padovan|first=Richard|title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture|date=2 November 1999|page=320|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-419-22780-9|quote=from Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.35: \"Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section.\"}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier placed systems of harmony and proportion at the centre of his design philosophy, and his faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden section and the Fibonacci series, which he described as \"rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in Man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages, and the learned.\"{{sfn|padovan|1999|page=316}}\n\n===Open Hand===\n[[File:Open Hand Monument in Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|''[[Open Hand Monument]]'' in Chandigarh, India]]\n\nThe Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\" The largest of the many Open Hand sculptures that Le Corbusier created is a {{convert|26|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} version in Chandigarh, India known as ''[[Open Hand Monument]]''.\n\n==Furniture==\n{{Main|Le Corbusier's Furniture}}\n\nLe Corbusier was an eloquent critic of the finely crafted, hand-made furniture, made with rare and exotic woods, inlays and coverings, presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts. Following his usual method, Le Corbusier first wrote a book with his theories of furniture, complete with memorable slogans.  In his 1925 book ''L'Art D\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui'', he called for furniture that used inexpensive materials and could be mass-produced. Le Corbusier described three different furniture types: ''type-needs'', ''type-furniture'', and ''human-limb objects''. He defined human-limb objects as: \"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony\".  He further declared, \"Chairs are architecture, sofas are [[bourgeois]]\",\n[[File:LC4 Chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand 1927-28.jpg|thumb|Frame of an LC4 chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand (1927\u201328) at Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris]]\nLe Corbusier first relied on ready-made furniture from Thonet to furnish his projects, such as his pavilion at the 1925 Exposition.  In 1928, following the publication of his theories, he began experimenting with furniture design.  In 1928, he invited the architect [[Charlotte Perriand]] to join his studio as a furniture designer. His cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]], also collaborated on many of the designs. For the manufacture of his furniture, he turned to the German firm [[Gebr\u00fcder Thonet]], which had begun making chairs with tubular steel, a material originally used for bicycles, in the early 1920s. Le Corbusier admired the design of [[Marcel Breuer]] and the [[Bauhaus]], who in 1925 had begun making sleek modern tubular club chairs. [[Mies van der Rohe]] had begun making his own version in a sculptural curved form with a cane seat in 1927.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=382}}\n\nThe first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three types of chairs made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames: The [[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|LC4]], Chaise Longue, (1927\u201328), with a covering of cowhide, which gave it a touch of exoticism; the ''Fauteuil Grand Confort'' (LC3) (1928\u201329), a club chair with a tubular frame which resembled the comfortable Art Deco club chairs that became popular in the 1920s; and the ''Fauteuil \u00e0 dossier basculant'' (LC4) (1928\u201329), a low seat suspended in a tubular steel frame, also with a cowhide upholstery. These chairs were designed specifically for two of his projects, the ''Maison la Roche'' in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. All three clearly showed the influence of Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. The line of furniture was expanded with additional designs for Le Corbusier's 1929 ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' installation, 'Equipment for the Home'. Despite the intention of Le Corbusier that his furniture should be inexpensive and mass-produced, his pieces were originally costly to make and were not mass-produced until many years later, when he was famous. {{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=383}}\n\n==Politics==\nThe political views of Le Corbusier were rather variable over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In the 1920s, he co-founded and contributed articles about urbanism to the fascist journals ''Plans'', ''Pr\u00e9lude'' and ''L'Homme R\u00e9el''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brott|first=Simone|date=2013|title=In the Shadow of the Enlightenment Le Corbusier, Le Faisceau and Georges Valois|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand|volume=2|issue=30|pages=777\u2013789|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/63644/|quote=\"his contribution to three fascist revues: Plans, Pr\u00e9lude and L\u2019Homme R\u00e9el\"}}</ref><ref name=\"simone 2\">{{Cite journal |last=Brott |first=Simone |date=2017-12-08 |title=The Le Corbusier Scandal, or, was Le Corbusier a Fascist? |journal=Fascism |language=en |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=196\u2013227 |doi=10.1163/22116257-00602003 |issn=2211-6249}}</ref> He also penned pieces in favour of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] for those journals, as well as \"hateful editorials\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11543431/Le-Corbusier-was-militant-fascist-two-new-books-on-French-architect-claim.html |title=Le Corbusier was 'militant fascist', two new books on French architect claim |last=Samuel |first=Henry |date=2015-04-16 |quote=\"Mr Jarcy said that in \"Plans\" Le Corbusier wrote in support of Nazi anti-Semitism and in \"Prelude\" co-wrote \"hateful editorials\"}}</ref> Between 1925 and 1928, Le Corbusier had connections to [[Le Faisceau]], a short-lived French fascist party led by [[Georges Valois]].

In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, particularly the redesign of [[Marseille]] after its Jewish population had been forcefully removed,<ref name=\"simone 2\" /> he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Alexis Carrel]], a [[eugenics|eugenicist]] surgeon, appointed Le Corbusier to the Department of Bio-Sociology of the ''Foundation for the Study of Human Problems'', an institute promoting eugenics policies under the Vichy regime.<ref name=\"simone 2\" />\n\nLe Corbusier has been accused of anti-semitism. He wrote to his mother in October 1940, prior to a referendum held by the Vichy government: \"The Jews are having a bad time. I occasionally feel sorry. But it appears their blind lust for money has rotted the country\". He was also accused of belittling the Muslim population of Algeria, then part of France. When Le Corbusier proposed a plan for the rebuilding of Algiers, he condemned the existing housing for European Algerians, complaining that it was inferior to that inhabited by indigenous Algerians: \"the civilized live like rats in holes\", while \"the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being.\"<ref name=celik>{{cite book|last=Celik|first=Zeynep|title=Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers under French Rule|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=28 July 1997|page=4|isbn=978-0520204577|accessdate=}}</ref>  His plan for rebuilding Algiers was rejected, and thereafter Le Corbusier mostly avoided politics.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Antliff|first=Mark |title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909\u20131939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADTdniFtnuwC|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-9047-3}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nFew other 20th-century architects were praised, or criticized, as much as Le Corbusier. In his eulogy to Le Corbusier at the memorial ceremony for the architect in the courtyard of the Louvre on 1 September 1965, French Culture Minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] declared, \"Le Corbusier had some great rivals, but none of them had the same significance in the revolution of architecture, because none bore insults so patiently and for so long.\"<ref>Andr\u00e9 Malraux, funeral oration for Le Corbusier, 1 September 1965, cited in Journal (2015), p. 3.1</ref>\n\nLater criticism of Le Corbusier was directed at his ideas of urban planning.  In 1998 the architectural historian Witold Rybczynski wrote in ''Time'' magazine: <blockquote> \"He called it the Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City.  Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic.  Wherever it was tried\u2014in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers\u2014it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan, socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighborhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy.\"<ref>Rybcznski, Witold, ''Time'' magazine, 8 June 1998.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[:Category:Historians of technology|Technological historian]] and architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] wrote in ''Yesterday's City of Tomorrow'' that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier's skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities. The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter. By \"mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had, in fact, produced a sterile hybrid.\"\n\nThe public housing projects influenced by his ideas have  been criticized for isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community's development. One of his most influential detractors has been [[Jane Jacobs]], who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier's urban design theories in her seminal work ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.\n\nFor some critics, the urbanism of Le Corbusier's was the model for a fascist state.<ref>{{Cite book\n            |chapter=La Cit\u00e9 francaise: George Valois, Le Corbusier, and Fascist Theories of Urbanism\n            |pages=134\u2013170\n            |last=Antliff\n            |first=Mark\n            |title=Fascist Visions: Art and Ideology in France and Italy\n            |editor1-last=Antliff\n            |editor1-first=Mark\n            |editor2-last=Affron\n            |editor2-first=Matthew\n            |publisher=Princeton University Press\n            |year=1997\n            |isbn=978-0-691027388\n            |location=\n            |via=}}</ref>  These critics cited  Le Corbusier himself when he wrote that \"not all citizens could become leaders.

He thought that industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape. He was a leader of the modernist movement to create better living conditions and a better society through housing. [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s ''Garden Cities of Tomorrow'' heavily influenced Le Corbusier and his contemporaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=FITTING|first=PETER|date=2002|title=Urban Planning/Utopian Dreaming: Le Corbusier's Chandigarh Today|journal=Utopian Studies|volume=13|issue=1|pages=69\u201393|issn=1045-991X|jstor=20718410}}</ref>\n\nLe Corbusier revolutionized [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/le-corbusier-1483|title=Le Corbusier (Charles-Edouard Jeanneret) 1887-1965|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref>  One of the first to realize how the [[automobile]] would change human society, Le Corbusier conceived the city of the future with large apartment buildings isolated in a park-like setting on [[piloti]]s.

In Great Britain urban planners turned to Le Corbusier's \"Cities in the Sky\" as a cheaper method of building public housing from the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pash-living.co.uk/blog/contemporary-designers/le-corbusier-enfant-terrible-of-modernist-architecture.html|title=Le Corbusier \u2013 enfant terrible of Modernist Architecture? / Pash Living Blog|author=|date=|work=pash-living.co.uk}}</ref> Le Corbusier criticized any effort at ornamentation of the buildings. The large spartan structures in cities, but not part of it, have been criticized for being boring and unfriendly to pedestrians.<ref>The Most Important People of the 20th Century (Part-II): Artists & Entertainers, Page 144</ref>\n\nSeveral of the many architects who worked for Le Corbusier in his studio became prominent, including painter-architect [[Nadir Afonso]], who absorbed Le Corbusier's ideas into his own aesthetics theory. [[L\u00facio Costa]]'s [[urban planning|city plan]] of [[Bras\u00edlia]] and the industrial city of [[Zl\u00edn]] planned by [[Franti\u0161ek Lydie Gahura]] in the Czech Republic are based on his ideas.  Le Corbusier's thinking had profound effects on city planning and architecture in the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivist]] era.\n\nLe Corbusier harmonized and lent credence to the idea of space as a set of destinations between which mankind moved continuously.  He gave credibility to the automobile as transporter, and to freeways in urban spaces. His philosophies were useful to urban real estate developers in the American post-World War II period because they justified and lent intellectual support to the desire to raze traditional urban space for high density, high profit urban concentration. The freeways connected this new urbanism to low density, low cost, highly profitable suburban locales available to be developed for middle class single-family housing.\n\nMissing from this scheme of movement was connectivity between isolated urban villages created for lower-middle and working classes, and the destination points in Le Corbusier's plan: suburban and rural areas, and urban commercial centers. The freeways as designed traveled over, at, or beneath grade levels of the living spaces of the urban poor, for example the [[Cabrini\u2013Green]] housing project in Chicago. Such projects with no freeway exit ramps, cut off by freeway rights-of-way, became isolated from jobs and services concentrated at Le Corbusier's nodal transportation end points. As jobs migrated to the suburbs, urban village dwellers found themselves without freeway access points in their communities or public mass transit that could economically reach suburban job centers. Late in the post-War period, suburban job centers found labor shortages to be such a critical problem that they sponsored urban-to-suburban shuttle bus services to fill vacant working class and lower-middle class jobs, which did not typically pay enough to afford car ownership.\n<!--NOTE: highly editorialized presentation (\"prophet who could do no wrong\", \"incompetence\", \"Machiavellian\", \"absurd\") -- use neutral tone and include citations or quotes if appropriate.. Le Corbusier deliberately created a myth about himself and was revered in his lifetime, and after death, by a generation of followers who believed Le Corbusier was a prophet who could do no wrong. But in the 1950s the first doubts began to appear, notably in some essays by his greatest admirers such as [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Colin Rowe]], who denounced as catastrophic his ideas on the city. Later critics revealed his technical incompetence as an architect. In his book ''Arm\u00e9e du Salut'', Brian Brace Taylor went into great detail about Le Corbusier's Machiavellian activities to create this commission for himself, his many ill-judged design decisions about building technologies, and the sometimes absurd solutions he then proposed. -->\n<!--NOTE: We cannot say \"more recently\" -- that's [[WP:DATED]]. We cannot says \"there has been much discussion\" -- we have to say WHO discussed this and GIVE A CITATION.   More recently still there has been much discussion about Le Corbusier's right-wing politics, and his open flirtation with Fascism in the 1930s, when he tried to persuade Benito Mussolini to commission him to design a new capital city for Ethiopia after Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935 using nerve-gas, in breach of League of Nations rules.-->\n\nLe Corbusier influenced architects and urbanists worldwide. In the United States, [[Shadrach Woods]]; in Spain, [[Francisco Javier S\u00e1enz de Oiza]]; in Brazil, [[Oscar Niemeyer]]; In [[Mexico]], [[Mario Pani Darqui]]; in [[Chile]], [[Roberto Matta]]; in [[Argentina]], [[Antoni Bonet i Castellana]] (a Catalan exile), Juan Kurchan, Jorge Ferrari Hardoy, [[Amancio Williams]], and [[Clorindo Testa]] in his first era; in [[Uruguay]], the professors Justino Serralta and Carlos G\u00f3mez Gavazzo; in [[Colombia]], Germ\u00e1n Samper Gnecco, [[Rogelio Salmona]], and Dicken Castro; in [[Peru]], Abel Hurtado and Jos\u00e9 Carlos Ortecho.\n\n==Fondation Le Corbusier==\n[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret), reproduced in \u017divot 2 (1922).jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, work reproduced in \u017divot 2 (1922)]]\nThe [[Fondation Le Corbusier]] is a private foundation and archive honoring the work of Le Corbusier. It operates Maison La Roche, a museum located in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]] at 8\u201310, square du Dr Blanche, Paris, France, which is open daily except Sunday.\n\nThe foundation was established in 1968. It now owns Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (which form the foundation's headquarters), as well as the apartment occupied by Le Corbusier from 1933 to 1965 at rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris 16e, and the \"Small House\" he built for his parents in [[Corseaux]] on the shores of [[Lac Leman]] (1924).\n\nMaison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (1923\u201324), also known as the La Roche-Jeanneret house, is a pair of semi-detached houses that was Le Corbusier's third commission in Paris. They are laid out at right angles to each other, with iron, concrete, and blank, white fa\u00e7ades setting off a curved two-story gallery space. Maison La Roche is now a museum containing about 8,000 original drawings, studies and plans by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with [[Pierre Jeanneret]] from 1922 to 1940), as well as about 450 of his paintings, about 30 enamels, about 200 other works on paper, and a sizable collection of written and photographic archives. It describes itself as the world's largest collection of Le Corbusier drawings, studies, and plans.<ref name=foundation/><ref name=parisinfo>{{cite web|title=Mus\u00e9e: Fondation Le Corbusier \u2013 Maison La Roche|url=http://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71409/Fondation-Le-Corbusier-Maison-La-Roche|publisher=Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* In 1937, Le Corbusier was named Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour#Membership|L\u00e9gion d'honneur]].

It has been serialized in [[Square Enix]]'s [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Monthly G Fantasy]]'' since 2014. It has been collected in twelve ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The manga is licensed in North America by [[Yen Press]]. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Lerche (studio)|Lerche]] premiered on January 9, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nKamome Academy is known for its famous Seven Mysteries and supernatural occurrences, popularized by student rumors. Nene Yashiro, a first-year occult-loving student who yearns for a boyfriend, decides to summon the seventh mystery [[Hanako-san|\"Hanako-san of the Toilet\"]], a girl who died in the bathroom a long time ago and can grant wishes for the right price. However, upon summoning the ghost, Hanako-san is revealed to be a boy. With a turn of events, Nene becomes his assistant and the story follows their adventures in maintaining the balance between the spirit world and the human world, as well as her discovery of the many secrets revolving around Hanako.\n\n==Characters==\n===Protagonists===\n;{{Nihongo|Nene Yashiro|\u516b\u5c0b \u5be7\u3005|Yashiro Nene}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akari Kit\u014d]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-11-08/toilet-bound-hanako-kun-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-january-9-premiere/.153101|title=Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, January 9 Premiere|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 8, 2019|accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref>|[[Tia Ballard]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Nene is a 15-year-old high school student at Kamome Academy known for being a hopeless romantic, which resulted in her summoning Hanako from the school's seventh mystery in the level 3 female toilet in order to get a crush to like her back. A desperate measure on her part led her to become bound to Hanako as his assistant, inflicted with a mermaid's curse causing her to develop scales and at worst turn into a fish upon contact with water. Along with her romantic tendencies, Yashiro possesses a kind and trusting personality. Her best friend is Aoi Akane and a running gag in the series are how her ankles are much larger than a normal person's, getting called radishes/daikons and swollen.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hanako-kun|\u82b1\u5b50\u304f\u3093}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Justin Briner]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\">{{cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/forum/topic/19359/master-thread-toilet-bound-hanako-kun-dubbed|title=[Master Thread] Toilet-bound Hanako-kun (Dubbed)|website=Funimation|accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref>}}\n:Known as the seventh mystery of Kamome Academy, tasked with the duty of maintaining the balance between the spirit and human world. His rumor \"Hanako-san of the Toilet\" states that he grants wishes to those who summon him provided they pay a suitable price, prompting Yashiro to approach him. As the leader of the Seven Mysteries, he possesses incredible power and fights with a knife. When Yashiro inflicted the curse of the mermaid on herself that caused her to turn into a fish, he ingested the other half of the curse in the form of a scale to help lessen its effects and allow her to only transform upon contact with water, in return for her being his assistant. He is often seen as cheerful, childish, and extremely mischievous, but these frequently serve to mask his emotions. He cares deeply about Yashiro.  \n:Not much has been revealed about his past. Hanako was once a student at Kamome Academy under the name {{Nihongo|Amane Yugi|\u67da\u6728 \u666e|Yugi Amane}} who was bullied badly during his childhood. As a student, he harbored a love for astronomy and was destined to become an astronomy teacher, until he killed his younger twin brother Tsukasa Yugi.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kou Minamoto|\u6e90 \u5149|Minamoto K\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sh\u014dya Chiba]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|Tyson Rinehart<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Kou is part of the middle school division at Kamome Academy and the second son of a family of exorcists. He initially came to this school to exorcise Hanako, but soon becomes friends with him and Yashiro. Kou possesses a brave, caring and direct personality, preferring to jump into things headfirst, and has the ability to see supernaturals naturally. He tends to get into some trouble due to being rather gullible and inexperienced, but he makes up for it in effort and determination. A running gag in the series is how he wears a good luck charm as an earring on his right ear, which (Sosuke Mitsuba) Mitsuba mocks as a \"lame traffic safety earring\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|S\u014dsuke Mitsuba|\u4e09\u8449 \u60e3\u52a9|Mitsuba S\u014dsuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|Daiki Kobayashi}} (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English) \n:Mitsuba was Kou's middle school classmate a few years ago who died soon after.  With a pretty face and a somewhat narcissistic attitude, Mitsuba has a love for photography, only taking photos of things he liked or things that were important to him. He is also seen having self-confidence issues that he covers up with a cocky bravado.  Before death he was a quiet kid attempting to be agreeable, only to realize in death that he made himself forgettable. After his death, he became a ghost haunting Kamome Academy's school lockers until Kou caught him in the act and decided to help him pass on. Mitsuba's regret was that he was not able to make good friends and stay with them forever, drawing out Tsukasa who broadcast an altered rumor of him, turning him into a monster due to his vague initial wish and forcing Kou to defeat him.\n:Later, Mitsuba is revived by Tsukasa after he preserves a part of his soul. The newly formed Mitsuba is persuaded to eat Mystery No. 3 in order to gain more power and he henceforth becomes the new Mystery and master of the Hell of Mirrors. Despite not being the original, Mitsuba still carries the same personality and dreams of the old one, with his new wish to transform from a ghost to a human to enjoy life with his friends. His wish is deemed impossible though, as there is no going back from being dead, as both Hanako and Teru Minamoto say.\n\n===Seven Mysteries===\nThe Seven Mysteries of Kamome Academy are the seven most famous supernatural rumours in the school, and also those that maintain the students' safety from murderous supernaturals. Leading them is Hanako, who is the Seventh and also most famous mystery. Each one of them has a \"boundary\" in a part of the school where their power is the strongest, and a ''\"Devine yorishiro\"'' that is typically an item embodying the source of their power. Such boundaries are often also gateways to the Far Shore where other apparitions reside. As when a school mystery's ''yorishiro'' is destroyed a mystery's seat and power is also removed, it is mostly kept in the deepest region of the boundary or safeguarded by the mystery.\n\n;{{Nihongo|The Three Clock Keepers|\u4e09\u4eba\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u5b88|Sannin no Tokeimori}}\n:{{Voiced by|Shunichi Toki|Alex Mai}}\n:Known as Mystery No.1, the Three Clock Keepers are a series of clock keepers guarding the clock tower of Kamome Academy, each with the powers to rewind time, stop time or hasten time. One of Yashiro's classmates, {{Nihongo|Akane Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95 \u831c|Aoi Akane}}, is a Clock Keeper by contract who can stop time for five minutes at a time, as well as the student council vice-president. He harbors a one-sided crush on Aoi. \n\n;{{Nihongo|The Misaki Stairs|\u30df\u30b5\u30ad\u968e\u6bb5|Misaki Kaidan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yukana]]|[[Alexis Tipton]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Known as Mystery No. 2, The Misaki Stairs is a staircase in the corner of the school building infront of the artroom with the fourth step rumored to being a gateway to the spirit world. Those that then enter the spirit world are shredded to death by \"Misaki\" and have their blood splattered on the staircase the following day. The portion of the spirit world the Misaki Stairs are a door to is guarded by {{Nihongo|Yako|\u30e4\u30b3}}, a fox spirit that can manifest as a beautiful woman. She once met a schoolteacher named Misaki in Kamome Academy and subsequently fell in love with his kindness, deciding to remember him even after his death. However, as rumors of her staircase changed, she was forced to shred those who entered her boundary in the desire to rebuild Misaki. Yashiro and Hanako managed to revert her back to normal after relinquishing her control over the Misaki Stairs.\n\n;{{Nihongo|The Hell of Mirrors|\u30ab\u30ac\u30df\u30b8\u30b4\u30af|Kagami Jigoku}}\n:Known as Mystery No. 3, the Hell of Mirrors is a boundary controlled by a bird-like supernatural that reveals a person's inner fears and insecurities. He is subsequently killed by Tsukasa and ingested by Mitsuba, who then becomes the next owner of the Hell of Mirrors.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shijima Mei|\u30b7\u30b8\u30de\u30e1\u30a4}}\n:Known as Mystery No. 4 \"Shijima-san of the Art Room\", she used to be an arts student at Kamome Academy rumored to have committed suicide when her parents didn't approve of her career choice. Shijima can create fictional dimensions separated from reality through her art, which Hanako decides to use to allow Yashiro to continue living past her lifespan. In actuality, Shijima's rumors about her life were incorrect, as she had died from illness instead of committing suicide. During her stay in the hospital, the cheerful and optimistic Shijima decided to draw a picture in line with an arts' showcase theme \"Tower\", imagining a fictional world inside her sketchbook where another, alternate her lived healthily, creating the present Shijima who is a pure supernatural who vowed to protect her. When she eventually died and her drawing was showcased, this spawned the present-day rumors and made the supernatural Shijima a school mystery. \n\n;{{Nihongo|The 4pm Bookstacks|\u5341\u516d\u6642\u306e\u66f8\u5eab|J\u016broku-ji no Shoko}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenjiro Tsuda]]|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Known as Mystery No. 5, the 4pm Bookstacks is a mysterious room filled with books about every student's past, present and future, whose door is only accessible at 4pm. The books can come in white, black and red colors, where white record about the living, black record the death, and red refers to forbidden books or chapters, typically about the future. The curator and creator of the Bookstacks is actually {{Nihongo|Mr Tsuchigomori|\u571f\u7c60}}, a spider-like supernatural who also has a double personality as a homeroom teacher in Kamome Academy. He was also Hanako's homeroom teacher when the former was a little boy and knows a lot about him.\n\n===Kamome Academy Supernaturals===\nApart from the Seven Mysteries, there are other, less powerful supernaturals that roam the school. They rely on student rumors to gain power, unlike the Mysteries which already have theirs so popular and widespread among the student body. \n;{{Nihongo|Mokke|\u3082\u3063\u3051}}\n:{{Voiced by|Yuri Yoshida}}\n:Known as \"Yosei-San\", the Mokke are in actual fact, sweets-loving rabbit-like supernaturals and a monster with a slight case of [[kleptomania]], enjoying committing small, random acts of theft. Due to their timidness and weak appearance, the Mokke tend to merge together to create horrifying creatures to fight off enemies, which scares the student population.\n\n;Kodama \n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu]] (Japanese); [[Larry Brantley]] (English)}}<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>\n:Known as \"The Confession Tree\". It was known to be planted by 'The God of Love'. Kodama is actually a spirit in the form of a tree determined to spread love among the students, but can be too meddlesome and forceful with its methods. After it is defeated by Hanako, it turns to the size of a broccoli, having been weakened greatly.\n\n===Antagonists===\n;{{Nihongo|Tsukasa Yugi|\u67da\u6728 \u3064\u304b\u3055|Yugi Tsukasa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Austin Tindle]]}}\n:Hanako's younger identical twin brother. When they were still alive, the twins were supposedly very close until he was killed by Hanako. Like his brother, he possesses a cheerful and mischievous personality, but at the same time a disturbingly brutal side. His childish nature only makes his violent actions even more disturbing. The two of them have opposing beliefs in that while Hanako stresses the importance of maintaining proper relationships between the humans and supernaturals, Tsukasa believes that the two entities should just behave how they want, even if it means wrecking tremendous havoc. He has also chosen to grant the wishes of supernaturals, just like how his brother grants the wishes of humans who summon him. He wears a black short-sleeved kimono with a grey hakama and a white button up underneath. He has his black seal on his right cheek and a two black Hakujodais called Kokujoudais, opposite to Hanako.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sakura Nanamine|\u4e03\u5cf0 \u685c|Nanamine Sakura}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Chika Anzai]]<ref name=\"cast3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-01-01/toilet-bound-hanako-kun-anime-adds-chika-anzai-takahiro-mizushima-to-cast/.154974|title=Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun Anime Adds Chika Anzai, Takahiro Mizushima to Cast|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 1, 2020|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref>|[[Kara Edwards]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:A beautiful 3rd year student at Kamome Academy and forced to be Tsukasa's assistant. Acting as the president of the school's broadcasting club, she helps him broadcast the altered rumors of supernaturals to bend them to his will. She became Tsukasa's helper through asking for her wish to be granted, similar to Nene with Hanako. She decided to start treating the younger Yugi brother as though he were a cat rather than human, making his actions more palatable.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Natsuhiko Hy\u016bga|\u65e5\u5411 \u590f\u5f66|Hy\u016bga Natsuhiko}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takahiro Mizushima]]<ref name=\"cast3\"/>|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}} \n:A 2nd year student at Kamome Academy and a member of the broadcasting club. He is often seen trying to win Sakura's affection and helps in Tsukasa's schemes.

Like Kou, he is an exorcist, but since young he has been hailed as a genius. Despite his handsome, calm and gentle appearance, he is frighteningly perceptive and ruthless, and harbors a sadistic streak, frequently terrorizing the Mokke to work as his servants. He dotes on his younger siblings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aoi Akane|\u8d64\u6839 \u8475|Akane Aoi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Minako Sato<ref name=\"cast2\"/>|[[Emily Neves]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Aoi is Yashiro's classmate and best friend, and the school's prettiest and most popular girl. She enjoys listening to rumors about the Seven Mysteries and recounting their stories to Yashiro. Yashiro notes that for some reason, all the stories Aoi has ever told her seem to come true. This is hinted to be related to her origins as someone who possesses the blood of [[miko|Kannagi]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lemon Yamabuki|\u5c71\u5439 \u6ab8\u6aac|Yamabuki Remon}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Genki

It has been serialized in [[Square Enix]]'s [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Monthly G Fantasy]]'' since 2014. It has been collected in twelve ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The manga is licensed in North America by [[Yen Press]]. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Lerche (studio)|Lerche]] premiered on January 9, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nKamome Academy is known for its famous Seven Mysteries and supernatural occurrences, popularized by student rumors. Nene Yashiro, a first-year occult-loving student who yearns for a boyfriend, decides to summon the seventh mystery [[Hanako-san|\"Hanako-san of the Toilet\"]], a girl who died in the bathroom a long time ago and can grant wishes for the right price. However, upon summoning the ghost, Hanako-san is revealed to be a boy. With a turn of events, Nene becomes his assistant and the story follows their adventures in maintaining the balance between the spirit world and the human world, as well as her discovery of the many secrets revolving around a loser.\n\n==Characters==\n===Protagonists===\n;{{Nihongo|Nene Yashiro|\u516b\u5c0b \u5be7\u3005|Yashiro Nene}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akari Kit\u014d]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-11-08/toilet-bound-hanako-kun-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-january-9-premiere/.153101|title=Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, January 9 Premiere|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 8, 2019|accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref>|[[Tia Ballard]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Nene is a 15-year-old high school student at Kamome Academy known for being a hopeless romantic, which resulted in her summoning Hanako from the school's seventh mystery in the level 3 female toilet in order to get a crush to like her back. A desperate measure on her part led her to become bound to Hanako as his assistant, inflicted with a mermaid's curse causing her to develop scales and at worst turn into a fish upon contact with water. Along with her romantic tendencies, Yashiro possesses a kind and trusting personality. Her best friend is Aoi Akane and a running gag in the series are how her ankles are much larger than a normal person's, getting called radishes/daikons and swollen.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hanako-kun|\u82b1\u5b50\u304f\u3093}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|[[Justin Briner]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\">{{cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/forum/topic/19359/master-thread-toilet-bound-hanako-kun-dubbed|title=[Master Thread] Toilet-bound Hanako-kun (Dubbed)|website=Funimation|accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref>}}\n:Known as the seventh mystery of Kamome Academy, tasked with the duty of maintaining the balance between the spirit and human world. His rumor \"Hanako-san of the Toilet\" states that he grants wishes to those who summon him provided they pay a suitable price, prompting Yashiro to approach him. As the leader of the Seven Mysteries, he possesses incredible power and fights with a knife. When Yashiro inflicted the curse of the mermaid on herself that caused her to turn into a fish, he ingested the other half of the curse in the form of a scale to help lessen its effects and allow her to only transform upon contact with water, in return for her being his assistant. He is often seen as cheerful, childish, and extremely mischievous, but these frequently serve to mask his emotions. He cares deeply about Yashiro.  \n:Not much has been revealed about his past. Hanako was once a student at Kamome Academy under the name {{Nihongo|Amane Yugi|\u67da\u6728 \u666e|Yugi Amane}} who was bullied badly during his childhood. As a student, he harbored a love for astronomy and was destined to become an astronomy teacher, until he killed his younger twin brother Tsukasa Yugi.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kou Minamoto|\u6e90 \u5149|Minamoto K\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sh\u014dya Chiba]]<ref name=\"cast\"/>|Tyson Rinehart<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Kou is part of the middle school division at Kamome Academy and the second son of a family of exorcists. He initially came to this school to exorcise Hanako, but soon becomes friends with him and Yashiro. Kou possesses a brave, caring and direct personality, preferring to jump into things headfirst, and has the ability to see supernaturals naturally. He tends to get into some trouble due to being rather gullible and inexperienced, but he makes up for it in effort and determination. A running gag in the series is how he wears a good luck charm as an earring on his right ear, which (Sosuke Mitsuba) Mitsuba mocks as a \"lame traffic safety earring\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|S\u014dsuke Mitsuba|\u4e09\u8449 \u60e3\u52a9|Mitsuba S\u014dsuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|Daiki Kobayashi}} (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English) \n:Mitsuba was Kou's middle school classmate a few years ago who died soon after.  With a pretty face and a somewhat narcissistic attitude, Mitsuba has a love for photography, only taking photos of things he liked or things that were important to him. He is also seen having self-confidence issues that he covers up with a cocky bravado.  Before death he was a quiet kid attempting to be agreeable, only to realize in death that he made himself forgettable. After his death, he became a ghost haunting Kamome Academy's school lockers until Kou caught him in the act and decided to help him pass on. Mitsuba's regret was that he was not able to make good friends and stay with them forever, drawing out Tsukasa who broadcast an altered rumor of him, turning him into a monster due to his vague initial wish and forcing Kou to defeat him.\n:Later, Mitsuba is revived by Tsukasa after he preserves a part of his soul. The newly formed Mitsuba is persuaded to eat Mystery No. 3 in order to gain more power and he henceforth becomes the new Mystery and master of the Hell of Mirrors. Despite not being the original, Mitsuba still carries the same personality and dreams of the old one, with his new wish to transform from a ghost to a human to enjoy life with his friends. His wish is deemed impossible though, as there is no going back from being dead, as both Hanako and Teru Minamoto say.\n\n===Seven Mysteries===\nThe Seven Mysteries of Kamome Academy are the seven most famous supernatural rumours in the school, and also those that maintain the students' safety from murderous supernaturals. Leading them is Hanako, who is the Seventh and also most famous mystery. Each one of them has a \"boundary\" in a part of the school where their power is the strongest, and a ''\"Devine yorishiro\"'' that is typically an item embodying the source of their power. Such boundaries are often also gateways to the Far Shore where other apparitions reside. As when a school mystery's ''yorishiro'' is destroyed a mystery's seat and power is also removed, it is mostly kept in the deepest region of the boundary or safeguarded by the mystery.\n\n;{{Nihongo|The Three Clock Keepers|\u4e09\u4eba\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u5b88|Sannin no Tokeimori}}\n:{{Voiced by|Shunichi Toki|Alex Mai}}\n:Known as Mystery No.1, the Three Clock Keepers are a series of clock keepers guarding the clock tower of Kamome Academy, each with the powers to rewind time, stop time or hasten time. One of Yashiro's classmates, {{Nihongo|Akane Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95 \u831c|Aoi Akane}}, is a Clock Keeper by contract who can stop time for five minutes at a time, as well as the student council vice-president. He harbors a one-sided crush on Aoi. \n\n;{{Nihongo|The Misaki Stairs|\u30df\u30b5\u30ad\u968e\u6bb5|Misaki Kaidan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yukana]]|[[Alexis Tipton]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Known as Mystery No. 2, The Misaki Stairs is a staircase in the corner of the school building infront of the artroom with the fourth step rumored to being a gateway to the spirit world. Those that then enter the spirit world are shredded to death by \"Misaki\" and have their blood splattered on the staircase the following day. The portion of the spirit world the Misaki Stairs are a door to is guarded by {{Nihongo|Yako|\u30e4\u30b3}}, a fox spirit that can manifest as a beautiful woman. She once met a schoolteacher named Misaki in Kamome Academy and subsequently fell in love with his kindness, deciding to remember him even after his death. However, as rumors of her staircase changed, she was forced to shred those who entered her boundary in the desire to rebuild Misaki. Yashiro and Hanako managed to revert her back to normal after relinquishing her control over the Misaki Stairs.\n\n;{{Nihongo|The Hell of Mirrors|\u30ab\u30ac\u30df\u30b8\u30b4\u30af|Kagami Jigoku}}\n:Known as Mystery No. 3, the Hell of Mirrors is a boundary controlled by a bird-like supernatural that reveals a person's inner fears and insecurities. He is subsequently killed by Tsukasa and ingested by Mitsuba, who then becomes the next owner of the Hell of Mirrors.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shijima Mei|\u30b7\u30b8\u30de\u30e1\u30a4}}\n:Known as Mystery No. 4 \"Shijima-san of the Art Room\", she used to be an arts student at Kamome Academy rumored to have committed suicide when her parents didn't approve of her career choice. Shijima can create fictional dimensions separated from reality through her art, which Hanako decides to use to allow Yashiro to continue living past her lifespan. In actuality, Shijima's rumors about her life were incorrect, as she had died from illness instead of committing suicide. During her stay in the hospital, the cheerful and optimistic Shijima decided to draw a picture in line with an arts' showcase theme \"Tower\", imagining a fictional world inside her sketchbook where another, alternate her lived healthily, creating the present Shijima who is a pure supernatural who vowed to protect her. When she eventually died and her drawing was showcased, this spawned the present-day rumors and made the supernatural Shijima a school mystery. \n\n;{{Nihongo|The 4pm Bookstacks|\u5341\u516d\u6642\u306e\u66f8\u5eab|J\u016broku-ji no Shoko}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenjiro Tsuda]]|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Known as Mystery No. 5, the 4pm Bookstacks is a mysterious room filled with books about every student's past, present and future, whose door is only accessible at 4pm. The books can come in white, black and red colors, where white record about the living, black record the death, and red refers to forbidden books or chapters, typically about the future. The curator and creator of the Bookstacks is actually {{Nihongo|Mr Tsuchigomori|\u571f\u7c60}}, a spider-like supernatural who also has a double personality as a homeroom teacher in Kamome Academy. He was also Hanako's homeroom teacher when the former was a little boy and knows a lot about him.\n\n===Kamome Academy Supernaturals===\nApart from the Seven Mysteries, there are other, less powerful supernaturals that roam the school. They rely on student rumors to gain power, unlike the Mysteries which already have theirs so popular and widespread among the student body. \n;{{Nihongo|Mokke|\u3082\u3063\u3051}}\n:{{Voiced by|Yuri Yoshida}}\n:Known as \"Yosei-San\", the Mokke are in actual fact, sweets-loving rabbit-like supernaturals and a monster with a slight case of [[kleptomania]], enjoying committing small, random acts of theft. Due to their timidness and weak appearance, the Mokke tend to merge together to create horrifying creatures to fight off enemies, which scares the student population.\n\n;Kodama \n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu]] (Japanese); [[Larry Brantley]] (English)}}<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>\n:Known as \"The Confession Tree\". It was known to be planted by 'The God of Love'. Kodama is actually a spirit in the form of a tree determined to spread love among the students, but can be too meddlesome and forceful with its methods. After it is defeated by Hanako, it turns to the size of a broccoli, having been weakened greatly.\n\n===Antagonists===\n;{{Nihongo|Tsukasa Yugi|\u67da\u6728 \u3064\u304b\u3055|Yugi Tsukasa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Austin Tindle]]}}\n:Hanako's younger identical twin brother. When they were still alive, the twins were supposedly very close until he was killed by Hanako. Like his brother, he possesses a cheerful and mischievous personality, but at the same time a disturbingly brutal side. His childish nature only makes his violent actions even more disturbing. The two of them have opposing beliefs in that while Hanako stresses the importance of maintaining proper relationships between the humans and supernaturals, Tsukasa believes that the two entities should just behave how they want, even if it means wrecking tremendous havoc. He has also chosen to grant the wishes of supernaturals, just like how his brother grants the wishes of humans who summon him. He wears a black short-sleeved kimono with a grey hakama and a white button up underneath. He has his black seal on his right cheek and a two black Hakujodais called Kokujoudais, opposite to Hanako.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sakura Nanamine|\u4e03\u5cf0 \u685c|Nanamine Sakura}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Chika Anzai]]<ref name=\"cast3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-01-01/toilet-bound-hanako-kun-anime-adds-chika-anzai-takahiro-mizushima-to-cast/.154974|title=Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun Anime Adds Chika Anzai, Takahiro Mizushima to Cast|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 1, 2020|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref>|[[Kara Edwards]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:A beautiful 3rd year student at Kamome Academy and forced to be Tsukasa's assistant. Acting as the president of the school's broadcasting club, she helps him broadcast the altered rumors of supernaturals to bend them to his will. She became Tsukasa's helper through asking for her wish to be granted, similar to Nene with Hanako. She decided to start treating the younger Yugi brother as though he were a cat rather than human, making his actions more palatable.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Natsuhiko Hy\u016bga|\u65e5\u5411 \u590f\u5f66|Hy\u016bga Natsuhiko}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takahiro Mizushima]]<ref name=\"cast3\"/>|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}} \n:A 2nd year student at Kamome Academy and a member of the broadcasting club. He is often seen trying to win Sakura's affection and helps in Tsukasa's schemes. His flippant personality tends to lead him into trouble all on its own.\n\n===Others===\n;{{Nihongo|Teru Minamoto|\u6e90 \u8f1d|Minamoto Teru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuma Uchida]]<ref name=\"cast2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-12-09/toilet-bound-hanako-kun-anime-reveals-2nd-promo-video-more-cast-theme-song-artists/.154144|title=Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun Anime Reveals 2nd Promo Video, More Cast, Theme Song Artists|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 9, 2019|accessdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>|[[David Matranga]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:The most popular male student in school, Kou's older brother and also the student council president. Like Kou, he is an exorcist, but since young he has been hailed as a genius. Despite his handsome, calm and gentle appearance, he is frighteningly perceptive and ruthless, and harbors a sadistic streak, frequently terrorizing the Mokke to work as his servants. He dotes on his younger siblings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aoi Akane|\u8d64\u6839 \u8475|Akane Aoi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Minako Sato<ref name=\"cast2\"/>|[[Emily Neves]]<ref name=\"Hanako dub\"/>}}\n:Aoi is Yashiro's classmate and best friend, and the school's prettiest and most popular girl. She enjoys listening to rumors about the Seven Mysteries and recounting their stories to Yashiro. Yashiro notes that for some reason, all the stories Aoi has ever told her seem to come true. This is hinted to be related to her origins as someone who possesses the blood of [[miko|Kannagi]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lemon Yamabuki|\u5c71\u5439 \u6ab8\u6aac|Yamabuki Remon}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Genki
