The exhibit also has new 24-hour closed circuit television to observe the pandas and how they interact with one another as well as other species in the exhibit.

The exhibit itself includes a room with a waterfall and rocky outcrop, a den, and several sustainable design features.

The giant panda exhibit is over 3,000 square meters and gives the pandas the options such as moving outside to lay on cool rocks or to bath in waterfalls. The two pandas that the Adelaide Zoo in Australia holds also have the option of staying inside in either air-conditioned rooms or in more natural caves to provide comfort for the pandas. The exhibit also has new 24-hour closed circuit television to observe the pandas and how they interact with one another as well as other species in the exhibit. There is also a public viewing terrace under a bamboo canopy to accommodate the crowds but also to manage the privacy of the pandas.

The buildings, plant life and even the sounds of China are represented in this $16 million exhibit.\n\nAt the [[Smithsonian National Zoological Park]], zoo keepers play with giant pandas and switch up their routine. They provide honey, apples, and leaf-eater biscuits inside the panda toys. The toys are usually made of plastic, rubber, and bamboo to ensure that the pandas don\u2019t break the toys too easily. Giant Pandas are allowed to play with water bottles, burlap bags, blankets, boxes, and [[fruitsicles]]- frozen fruit juice and water with cut up fruit inside. The exhibit itself includes a room with a waterfall and rocky outcrop, a den, and several sustainable design features. There are green roofs, a solar hot water system, and natural material for the visitor paths. Not only is the exhibit sustainable, but it also creates an environment that allows for the pandas to stay at a cool temperature when it is hot outside while providing areas for privacy. Short trees, shrubs, pools, and streams, allow them to stay comfortable at all times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enrichment For Giant Pandas|website=Smithsonian National Zoological Park}}</ref> The National Zoo will return one of the pandas, a four year-old giant panda named \"Bei Bei,\" to China on November 19, 2019.<ref>[https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/17/us/bei-bei-giant-panda-national-zoo-trnd/index.html Bye bye, Bei Bei: Beloved giant panda is leaving DC for China in a private jet] Theresa Waldrop, CNN Travel, November 18, 2019</ref>\n\nThe [[San Diego Zoo]] had Giant Pandas on-loan from China from 2006-2019 as part of the breeding program that successfully boosted the Giant Panda from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-diego-zoo-pandas-last-look-before-they-head-back-to-china/|title=San Diego Zoo prepares to say farewell to giant pandas|last=April 15|first=CBS News|last2=2019|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-17|last3=Pm|first3=12:31}}</ref> The agreement for the San Diego Zoo to house the breeding pair of Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu ended in 2019, and the pandas have been set to be returned on April 27th.
