The Title Track music of this film  is also taken from ''Bommarillu''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a baby taking his initial steps on a beach while the father is supporting him. The narrator in the background ([[Prosenjit Chatterjee|Prasenjit]]) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Sidhu ([[Hiran Chatterjee|Hiran]]) begins uttering abuses at all the fathers in the world. When inquired about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind ([[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]]), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairdo and many others are stashed away by his father's. However, he vows that the two things that will be of his choice would be, his career and the woman he would marry.\n\nPost-[[Motion picture credits|credits]], Satya ([[Subhasis Mukherjee]]), the Arvind dutiful household's servant wakes up Sidhu in the morning. In the background, we see Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi ([[Laboni Sarkar]]) singing a [[devotional song]] while cooking. At the dining table, Arvind, [[Managing Director]] of their construction company, inquires if Siddhu will join their office for managing their business. When Sidhu deliberates, his father doesn't stand any longer and instead plans for his [[marriage]] despite Sidhu's silent protest. The next week, he returns home to realize that he is going to get [[engagement|engaged]] to Manasi against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a \"daddy's girl\" and she not being to his liking. However, with Arvind's final say, they eventually get engaged.\n\nWhile contemplating on his options in a temple, Sidhu accidentally meets Priya ([[Srabanti Malakar]]), an [[engineering]] student. Seeing her chirpy nature and vibrance, Sidhu begins to like her. He makes attempts to know her by meeting her on a regular basis. In the process, he starts liking her cherubic and ever-friendly nature and as someone who does what she loves. As days go by, he realizes about so many small things in her company that gave him happiness. He realizes that he has fallen in love with her.\n\nAlongside this, Sidhu applies for a bank loan to start out on his dream of building his career. When his love for Priya deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses to her that he is engaged to marry Manasi against his wishes, but what he really wants is her. On knowing of him being engaged, Priya gets dejected, but comes back a day later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Sidhu is seen by a furious Arvind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marriage with Manasi. When asked for his reason to like Priya, Sidhu replies saying that if Priya can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Priya to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao ([[Sushanta Dutta]]) that she is going on a college tour.\n\nWhen Priya is introduced to Sidhu's family, she gets a lukewarm welcome. As she settles down in the house, one after the other begins to like her. Even though getting used to the living habits of the authoritarian Arvind's household was difficult, Priya stayed put for Sidhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Arvind reprimands Sidhu when he knows of his bank loan and his plans, only to further enrage Sidhu. One day the entire family along with Priya attends a marriage ceremony. A cheerful Priya cheers up the ceremony with her playful nature. Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao who happens to be around, recognizes Sidhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Priya realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their grace, Sidhu admonishes Priya for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Priya moves out of the house saying that she does not find Sidhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Sidhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Arvind on Sidhu's choices and wants. In the process, Sidhu opens up his heart and leaving Arvind to repent on his foolishness. Sidhu requests Manasi and her parents to call off the impending marriage. While they relent, Arvind manages to convince Kanaka babu about Sidhu and Priya's marriage. In return, Kanaka  wants to know more about Sidhu by having him live in house for a week. Arvind agrees with this and as the story returns to the pre-credits scene, the viewers are left to assume about the happy marriage of the protagonists.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hiran Chatterjee|Hiran]] - Sidhu\n* [[Srabanti Malakar]] - Priya\n* [[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]] - Aravind (Sidhu's father)\n* Sushanta Dutta&nbsp;\u2014 Kanaka Rao (Priya's father)\n* [[Laboni Sarkar]]&nbsp;\u2014 Lakshmi (Sidhu's mother)\n* [[Locket Chatterjee]]&nbsp;\u2014 Sidhu's sister-in-law\n* [[Subhasish Mukherjee]]&nbsp;\u2014 Satya (servant)\n* [[Kamalika Banerjee]]\n* [[Pritam Saha]] - Monti (Sidhu's nephew)\n\n==Crew==\n* Producer:Ashoke Kumar Dhanuka\n* Director:Rabi Kinagi\n* Story: Bhaskar\n* Production Design:\n* Dialogue:\n* 'Lyrics:  [[Goutam Susmit]]\n* Editing:\n* Cinematography:\n* '''Music Director''': [[S.

The song went to number one on both the Flanders and Wallonia Ultratop charts. Performing in the first semi final of the competition, Nottet was successful in progressing to the final, coming second in his semi final with 149 points. During the Jury Final (following Australia), he could be barely seen on stage due to heavy use of smoke machines and pyrotechnics from the Australian Act. His delegation was rumoured to have lodged a complaint about this, saying that it would affect part of their final score. While they requested to perform again, this was apparently denied, instead telling juries to disregard the smoke. In the Grand Final, the Belgian entry scored a total of 217 points leaving \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" in fourth position overall, giving Belgium its first top five placement since 2003. It received the maximum 12 points from three countries; Netherlands, France and Hungary. The song was certified Platinum for selling 30,000 copies in Belgium. Nottet has released three different music videos for Rhythm Inside (including one called the \"Alice in Nightmareland\" version). After the contest, \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" reached the top ten in the Austrian, Lithuanian and Russian Music Charts, achieving top 20 in Finland, Iceland and Sweden and also charting in Australia, UK, France, Switzerland and many more European countries.\n\nLoic has sung at NJR park Uitmarkt Symphonica.

The song went to number one on both the Flanders and Wallonia Ultratop charts. Performing in the first semi final of the competition, Nottet was successful in progressing to the final, coming second in his semi final with 149 points. During the Jury Final (following Australia), he could be barely seen on stage due to heavy use of smoke machines and pyrotechnics from the Australian Act.

While the bridge is of aesthetic and social significance, its high level of heritage significance stems chiefly from it being of great historical and technical significance. The Bridge is the second oldest surviving timber truss bridge in the NSW road network, and is an exceptionally rare example of an Old PWD truss bridge. Old PWD truss bridges were the first in the five-stage development of timber truss bridges in NSW, and represent the genesis of this form of bridge construction. While the bridge as a whole has been assessed as fulfilling the criteria for listing on the SHR, the various elements that comprise the Bridge are of varying levels of significance: abutments, piers, decking and hand railing are of moderate significance, of works the cross girders are of considerable significance and the truss spans are of exceptional significance.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Everett, Claire |author2=Taylor, Raymond |date=2003|title=Monkerai Bridge. Conservation Management Plan (Draft)}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\nMonkerai Bridge over Karuah River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is the second-oldest surviving timber truss road bridge in New South Wales, and is one of only two surviving Old PWD truss bridges in existence. The design of the Bridge is historically significant through its links to earlier European timber truss bridges, the designs of which can be traced back to the influence of the 16th Century Italian architect, [[Andrea Palladio]]. The Bridge is historically significant through its association with the expansion of the NSW road network, and the contribution of that road system to the settlement and development of NSW. The form and fabric of the Bridge are significant in reflecting the requirement of an 1861 parliamentary decree that local materials be used in the construction of public works, to reduce the costs associated with the importation of iron, which was not produced locally at that time.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe bridge is significant through its association with William Bennett, the Commissioner for Public Works, designer of the Old PWD truss, and \"father\" of timber truss bridges in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe form of the bridge is aesthetically pleasing. The structural detail of the bridge is clearly visible, and the form of the truss has an angularity and repetition of form that is pleasing to the eye. The bridge is located in a visually attractive landscape of gently rolling hills and valleys, and the Bridge itself forms an attractive addition to the built component of that landscape. The appearance of the bridge when viewed from up or downstream is quite striking.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe bridge is of significance to the people of the Monkerai area, both as a transport link, and as a local heritage item although there does not appear to be a high level of community awareness of its heritage significance. The bridge is of significance to the region for its place in the road network of the [[Hunter Region]], and through its historical contribution to the settlement and development of the [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]] region. Timber truss bridges are significant to the social identity of NSW as the \"timber truss bridge state\", being the only Australian state to widely use timber truss bridges as an integral part of its late 19th and early 20th Century road network.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is of high technical significance as a rare remaining example of an Old PWD truss bridge, the first truss type designed and used for timber road bridges in NSW. Through study of the Old PWD and later truss types, it is possible to track the design changes made to the various truss types as designs were refined for better durability and ease of maintenance.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is an exceptionally rare example of a once prolific form of bridge construction. Only two Old PWD truss bridges survive, out of a total of 147 constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is highly representative of an Old PWD truss, and demonstrates the construction and design techniques used in the earliest form of timber truss bridge design in NSW. The bridge is intact and still functioning in its original role as a road bridge. Whilst elements of the Bridge have been altered to meet current traffic requirements, safety specifications or to make the structure less difficult to maintain, the most significant elements of the bridge, the truss spans, still retain the characteristics of the original design.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n*[[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Berger|first=Ian|date=2004|title=Statement of Heritage Impact.

Conservation Management Plan (Draft)}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\nMonkerai Bridge over Karuah River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is the second-oldest surviving timber truss road bridge in New South Wales, and is one of only two surviving Old PWD truss bridges in existence. The design of the Bridge is historically significant through its links to earlier European timber truss bridges, the designs of which can be traced back to the influence of the 16th Century Italian architect, [[Andrea Palladio]]. The Bridge is historically significant through its association with the expansion of the NSW road network, and the contribution of that road system to the settlement and development of NSW. The form and fabric of the Bridge are significant in reflecting the requirement of an 1861 parliamentary decree that local materials be used in the construction of public works, to reduce the costs associated with the importation of iron, which was not produced locally at that time.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe bridge is significant through its association with William Bennett, the Commissioner for Public Works, designer of the Old PWD truss, and \"father\" of timber truss bridges in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe form of the bridge is aesthetically pleasing. The structural detail of the bridge is clearly visible, and the form of the truss has an angularity and repetition of form that is pleasing to the eye. The bridge is located in a visually attractive landscape of gently rolling hills and valleys, and the Bridge itself forms an attractive addition to the built component of that landscape. The appearance of the bridge when viewed from up or downstream is quite striking.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe bridge is of significance to the people of the Monkerai area, both as a transport link, and as a local heritage item although there does not appear to be a high level of community awareness of its heritage significance. The bridge is of significance to the region for its place in the road network of the [[Hunter Region]], and through its historical contribution to the settlement and development of the [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]] region. Timber truss bridges are significant to the social identity of NSW as the \"timber truss bridge state\", being the only Australian state to widely use timber truss bridges as an integral part of its late 19th and early 20th Century road network.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is of high technical significance as a rare remaining example of an Old PWD truss bridge, the first truss type designed and used for timber road bridges in NSW. Through study of the Old PWD and later truss types, it is possible to track the design changes made to the various truss types as designs were refined for better durability and ease of maintenance.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is an exceptionally rare example of a once prolific form of bridge construction. Only two Old PWD truss bridges survive, out of a total of 147 constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is highly representative of an Old PWD truss, and demonstrates the construction and design techniques used in the earliest form of timber truss bridge design in NSW. The bridge is intact and still functioning in its original role as a road bridge. Whilst elements of the Bridge have been altered to meet current traffic requirements, safety specifications or to make the structure less difficult to maintain, the most significant elements of the bridge, the truss spans, still retain the characteristics of the original design.<ref name=nswshr-1475/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n*[[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Berger|first=Ian|date=2004|title=Statement of Heritage Impact.
