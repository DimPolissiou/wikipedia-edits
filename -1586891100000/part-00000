He was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry in 1977 for ''[[Divine Comedies]].'' His poetry falls into two distinct bodies of work: the polished and formalist lyric poetry of his early career, and the epic narrative of occult communication with spirits and angels, titled ''[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]'' (published in three volumes from 1976 to 1980), which dominated his later career. Although most of his published work was poetry, he also wrote essays, fiction, and plays.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Ingram Merrill was born in [[New York City]], to [[Charles E. Merrill]] (1885&ndash;1956), the founding partner of the [[Merrill Lynch]] investment firm, and Hellen Ingram Merrill (1898&ndash;2000), a society reporter and publisher from [[Jacksonville, Florida]].<ref name=\"Chron\">{{cite book|title=James Merrill: Selected Poems|editors= [[J.

He was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry in 1977 for ''[[Divine Comedies]].'' His poetry falls into two distinct bodies of work: the polished and formalist lyric poetry of his early career, and the epic narrative of occult communication with spirits and angels, titled ''[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]'' (published in three volumes from 1976 to 1980), which dominated his later career. Although most of his published work was poetry, he also wrote essays, fiction, and plays.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Ingram Merrill was born in [[New York City]], to [[Charles E.

The divorce of Merrill's parents &mdash; the sense of disruption, followed by a sense of seeing the world \"doubled\" or in two ways at once &mdash; figures prominently in the poet's verse. Merrill did not hesitate to alter small autobiographical details to improve a poem's logic, or to serve an environmental, aesthetic, or spiritual theme.\n\nAs Merrill matured, the polished and taut brilliance of his early work yielded to a more informal, relaxed, and conversational tone.<ref>Merrill's 1993 memoir ''A Different Person'' charts this long evolution: \"[T]he mere act of reading [my poems] aloud&mdash;something I was doing for virtually the first time [in March 1950]&mdash;quickly disabused me ...

It describes their Ouija board experience as a game that got badly out of control, until they couldn't tell what was real and what was not. According to her, the board became a form of self-induced demonic possession, to which Merrill, driven by his ambition to make poetry out of spirit messages, was especially susceptible, and in which Jackson was enlisted against his will. For evidence, she quotes passages from ''The Changing Light at Sandover'', as if the trilogy were a factual record of their seances rather than a poetic fiction based on them. \"As I read through the last two-thirds of the book,\" she writes, \"I sometimes had the feeling that my friend's mind\" -Merrill's mind- \"was intermittently being taken over by a stupid and possibly even evil intelligence.\"}}</ref> According to Stoker Hunt, author of ''Ouija: The Most Dangerous Game'', before his death Merrill warned against the use of the Ouija board.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Stoker |date=1992 |title=Ouija: The Most Dangerous Game |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zYbyQcXnKvcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Ouija:+The+Most+Dangerous+Game.#v=onepage |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Library |page=47 |isbn=0060923504 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the publication of ''The Changing Light at Sandover'', Merrill returned to writing shorter poetry which could be both whimsical and nostalgic: \"Self-Portrait in TYVEK Windbreaker\" (for example) is a [[conceit]] inspired by a [[windbreaker|windbreaker jacket]] Merrill purchased from \"one of those vaguely imbecile / Emporia catering to the collective unconscious / Of our time and place.\" The [[Tyvek]] windbreaker &mdash; \"DuPont contributed the seeming-frail, / Unrippable stuff first used for Priority Mail\" &mdash; is \"white with a world map.\" \"A zipper's hiss, and the Atlantic Ocean closes / Over my blood-red T-shirt from the Gap.\"<ref name=\"Iowa\">Marshall, Kathe Bonann.

It was released in theaters on March 9, 2012, four years after it was filmed in August 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nJack McCall is a [[literary agent]] who uses his \"gift of gabbing\" to get various book deals, and he is not afraid to stretch the truth to get them. While he is trying to get a book deal from a New Age self-help guru named Dr. Sinja, the guru sees through his deceit and agrees to the deal, only to later deliver a five-page book. That night, a [[Bodhi Tree]] magically appears in his backyard. Dr. Sinja goes to Jack's house and they both discover that for every word that Jack speaks, a leaf will fall off of the tree. When the tree runs out of leaves, the tree will perish, as will Jack. In time, he finds that even written words and gestures towards words count towards his limit; plus anything that happens to the tree will also affect Jack. When Jack tries to cut it down with an axe, an axe wound appears on him. When squirrels climb the tree, it tickles him. When a gardener tries to poison it with [[DDT]], Jack gets high on the fumes and when the gardener tries to water the tree, Jack starts to sweat/perspire profusely.\n\nWith Jack forced to pick and choose his words, communicating with others becomes difficult and full of misunderstandings. These misunderstandings cost him two book deals, his job, and his wife Caroline. She walks out on him when she thinks his sudden silence is due to his not loving her anymore. When he tries to explain the tree to her, she doesn't believe him. Only Jack's assistant Aaron Weisberger realizes he is telling the truth, and goes to Jack's house to keep track of how many leaves remain. Jack tries to break the curse by being a better person by giving food to the homeless, and donating some of his money to charity, but that plan fails. Jack drinks a lot of alcohol in the night, causing him to sing a lot, thus making the tree lose lots of leaves. Only when Aaron confronts him and tackles him to the ground does Jack stop speaking.\n\nWith his life falling apart and the tree running out of leaves, Jack confronts Dr. Sinja and asks how to end the curse. The guru tells him to make peace in all of his relationships. With just one branch of leaves left, Jack tries to reconcile with his wife, but she remains hesitant. He visits his mother Annie, who lives in an assisted-living center and has dementia. Annie tells Jack, who she thinks is Jack's late father Raymond, that she wishes Jack would stop being angry at his father for walking out on them when he was a kid. Jack, realizing that this is the relationship that needs the most mending, goes to visit his father's grave. Jack expends the last three leaves of the tree with the words \"I forgive you\". With no leaves remaining, Jack suffers a heart attack in a storm and appears to die.  Aaron then calls Jack on his cell phone.  Jack, who is still alive, answers his phone. Aaron tells him that the tree's leaves have magically reappeared and Jack can now talk freely again.\n\nJack and Caroline get back together, with Jack buying the family-friendly house Caroline asked for earlier, and the tree is in their front yard. He does not get his job back (Aaron was promoted to Jack's old position), but he writes a book about his experience, called ''A Thousand Words'', and gets Aaron to make the deal. Unfortunately for Aaron, his promotion causes him to be like Jack was, thus he gets his own smaller office Bodhi tree.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as  Jack McCall\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Caroline McCall\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Aaron Wiseberger\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Dr. Sinja\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Samantha Davis\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Annie McCall (Jack's Mother)\n* [[Jack McBrayer]] as [[Starbucks]] Coffee Employee\n* [[Steve Little (actor)|Steve Little]] as Co-Worker\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Blind Old Man\n* [[Kayla Blake]] as Emily\n* Lennie Loftin as Robert Gilmore\n* [[Alain Chabat]] as Christian L\u00e9ger de la Touffe\n* Ted Kennedy as Homeless Man\n* Emanuel Ragsdale as Tyler McCall\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''A Thousand Words'' was filmed in August 2008 in [[Los Angeles, California]] and was supposed to be released in 2009,  but was repeatedly delayed after being caught up in the separation of [[DreamWorks Pictures]] from [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]].<ref name=\"Slashfilm\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/shelved-eddie-murphy-film-a-thousand-words-january-2012-release-date |title=Shelved Eddie Murphy Film \u2018A Thousand Words\u2019 Gets January 2012 Release Date |work=[[/Film]] |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref> During an interview for ''[[Fred: The Movie]]'', director [[Brian Robbins]] stated that the film would be released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://collider.com/brian-robbins-interview-fred-the-movie-lucas-cruikshank/48767 |title=Director Brian Robbins Exclusive Interview FRED: THE MOVIE; Plus an Update on A THOUSAND WORDS Starring Eddie Murphy |work=Collider.com |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> Reshoots were done on the film early in 2011.<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n\nThe film was then scheduled for a January 2012 release, but after Murphy was announced as the host of the 2012 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] ceremony (he later stepped down),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/09/eddie-murphy-quits-oscars-homophobia-row |title=Eddie Murphy quits Oscars after homophobia row |accessdate=November 20, 2011 | location=London |work=The Guardian |first=David |last=Batty |date=November 9, 2011}}</ref> the film was given a date of March 23, 2012;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/paramount-realizes-oscar-hosting-gig-huge-commercial-eddie-murphy-movies-moves-a-thousand-words-march-2012 |title=Paramount Realizes Oscars Are Huge Commercial For Eddie Murphy, Moves \u2018A Thousand Words\u2019 to March 2012 |work=[[/Film]] |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> this was later pushed to April 20, 2012,<ref>[http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/paramount-shifts-release-dates-for-hansel-and-gretel-two-other-pics \"'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' Delays To 2013 So Jeremy Renner More Of Global Draw\"].

It was released in theaters on March 9, 2012, four years after it was filmed in August 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nJack McCall is a [[literary agent]] who uses his \"gift of gabbing\" to get various book deals, and he is not afraid to stretch the truth to get them. While he is trying to get a book deal from a New Age self-help guru named Dr. Sinja, the guru sees through his deceit and agrees to the deal, only to later deliver a five-page book. That night, a [[Bodhi Tree]] magically appears in his backyard. Dr. Sinja goes to Jack's house and they both discover that for every word that Jack speaks, a leaf will fall off of the tree. When the tree runs out of leaves, the tree will perish, as will Jack. In time, he finds that even written words and gestures towards words count towards his limit; plus anything that happens to the tree will also affect Jack. When Jack tries to cut it down with an axe, an axe wound appears on him. When squirrels climb the tree, it tickles him. When a gardener tries to poison it with [[DDT]], Jack gets high on the fumes and when the gardener tries to water the tree, Jack starts to sweat/perspire profusely.\n\nWith Jack forced to pick and choose his words, communicating with others becomes difficult and full of misunderstandings. These misunderstandings cost him two book deals, his job, and his wife Caroline. She walks out on him when she thinks his sudden silence is due to his not loving her anymore. When he tries to explain the tree to her, she doesn't believe him. Only Jack's assistant Aaron Weisberger realizes he is telling the truth, and goes to Jack's house to keep track of how many leaves remain. Jack tries to break the curse by being a better person by giving food to the homeless, and donating some of his money to charity, but that plan fails. Jack drinks a lot of alcohol in the night, causing him to sing a lot, thus making the tree lose lots of leaves. Only when Aaron confronts him and tackles him to the ground does Jack stop speaking.\n\nWith his life falling apart and the tree running out of leaves, Jack confronts Dr. Sinja and asks how to end the curse. The guru tells him to make peace in all of his relationships. With just one branch of leaves left, Jack tries to reconcile with his wife, but she remains hesitant. He visits his mother Annie, who lives in an assisted-living center and has dementia. Annie tells Jack, who she thinks is Jack's late father Raymond, that she wishes Jack would stop being angry at his father for walking out on them when he was a kid. Jack, realizing that this is the relationship that needs the most mending, goes to visit his father's grave. Jack expends the last three leaves of the tree with the words \"I forgive you\". With no leaves remaining, Jack suffers a heart attack in a storm and appears to die.  Aaron then calls Jack on his cell phone.  Jack, who is still alive, answers his phone. Aaron tells him that the tree's leaves have magically reappeared and Jack can now talk freely again.\n\nJack and Caroline get back together, with Jack buying the family-friendly house Caroline asked for earlier, and the tree is in their front yard. He does not get his job back (Aaron was promoted to Jack's old position), but he writes a book about his experience, called ''A Thousand Words'', and gets Aaron to make the deal. Unfortunately for Aaron, his promotion causes him to be like Jack was, thus he gets his own smaller office Bodhi tree.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as  Jack McCall\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Caroline McCall\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Aaron Wiseberger\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Dr. Sinja\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Samantha Davis\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Annie McCall (Jack's Mother)\n* [[Jack McBrayer]] as [[Starbucks]] Coffee Employee\n* [[Steve Little (actor)|Steve Little]] as Co-Worker\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Blind Old Man\n* [[Kayla Blake]] as Emily\n* Lennie Loftin as Robert Gilmore\n* [[Alain Chabat]] as Christian L\u00e9ger de la Touffe\n* Ted Kennedy as Homeless Man\n* Emanuel Ragsdale as Tyler McCall\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''A Thousand Words'' was filmed in August 2008 in [[Los Angeles, California]] and was supposed to be released in 2009,  but was repeatedly delayed after being caught up in the separation of [[DreamWorks Pictures]] from [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]].<ref name=\"Slashfilm\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/shelved-eddie-murphy-film-a-thousand-words-january-2012-release-date |title=Shelved Eddie Murphy Film \u2018A Thousand Words\u2019 Gets January 2012 Release Date |work=[[/Film]] |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref> During an interview for ''[[Fred: The Movie]]'', director [[Brian Robbins]] stated that the film would be released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://collider.com/brian-robbins-interview-fred-the-movie-lucas-cruikshank/48767 |title=Director Brian Robbins Exclusive Interview FRED: THE MOVIE; Plus an Update on A THOUSAND WORDS Starring Eddie Murphy |work=Collider.com |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> Reshoots were done on the film early in 2011.<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n\nThe film was then scheduled for a January 2012 release, but after Murphy was announced as the host of the 2012 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] ceremony (he later stepped down),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/09/eddie-murphy-quits-oscars-homophobia-row |title=Eddie Murphy quits Oscars after homophobia row |accessdate=November 20, 2011 | location=London |work=The Guardian |first=David |last=Batty |date=November 9, 2011}}</ref> the film was given a date of March 23, 2012;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/paramount-realizes-oscar-hosting-gig-huge-commercial-eddie-murphy-movies-moves-a-thousand-words-march-2012 |title=Paramount Realizes Oscars Are Huge Commercial For Eddie Murphy, Moves \u2018A Thousand Words\u2019 to March 2012 |work=[[/Film]] |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> this was later pushed to April 20, 2012,<ref>[http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/paramount-shifts-release-dates-for-hansel-and-gretel-two-other-pics \"'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' Delays To 2013 So Jeremy Renner More Of Global Draw\"].

It was the oldest and most important of the five Greek cities in the region. It gave eastern Libya the classical name ''[[Cyrenaica]]'' that it has retained to modern times. Located nearby is the ancient [[Necropolis of Cyrene]].\n\nCyrene lies in a lush [[valley]] in the [[Jebel Akhdar (Libya)|Jebel Akhdar]] uplands. The city was named after a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]], Kyre, which the Greeks consecrated to [[Apollo]]. It was also the seat of the [[Cyrenaics]], a famous [[Greek philosophy|school of philosophy]] in the fourth century BC, founded by [[Aristippus]], a disciple of [[Socrates]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Summary of the founding of Cyrene, as told by Herodotus ===\nGrinus, son of Aesanius a descendant of Theras, and king of the island of Thera, had visited the [[Pythia]], the [[oracle]] of [[Delphi]], and offered a [[hecatomb]] to the Pythia on sundry matters. The Pythia had offered the advice to found a new city in [[ancient Libya|Libya]].\n\nMany years passed and the advice was not taken, and Thera had succumbed to a horrific [[drought]] and all of the crops and trees had perished. They again sent to Delphi and were reminded that the Pythia had said several years before to settle in the country of Libya, but this time she specifically said to found a settlement in the land of [[Cyrenaica|Cyrene]].\n\nNot knowing how to get to Libya, they sent a messenger to [[Crete]] to find someone to lead them on their journey. They found a dealer in purple [[dye]]s named Corobius. He had once traveled to an island across from Libya called Platea [or Plataea, modern Jazirat Barda`ah].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getamap.net/maps/libya/darnah/_plataea/ |title=Plat\u00e6a |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Get A Map |access-date=23 Nov 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031714/http://www.getamap.net/maps/libya/darnah/_plataea/ |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Grinus and Corobius sailed to Platea, when they reached their destination they left Corobius with months of supplies and Grinus went back to Thera to collect men to settle the newly made colony. After two years of settling the [[colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|colony]], they had little success and went back to the Pythia to get advice. The Pythia had repeated her advice to move directly to the country of Libya instead of across from Libya. So they moved to a place called Aziris. They settled there for six years, and were very successful until the Libyans visited the settlement of Aziris to convince the people to move further inland. They were swayed by the Libyans to move and settled into what is now Cyrene. The current king of that time Battus reigned for 40 years, until he passed on and his son, Arcesilaus, took over and reigned for 16 years, with no more or less population change until the Oracle had told the third king, another Battus, to bring [[Greeks|Greek]] citizens to the settlement and with that expansion the Libyans had lost a lot of land surrounding Cyrene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/630cyrene.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=2016-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203130152/http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/630cyrene.asp|archive-date=2016-12-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek period===\n[[File:Temple of Zeus - Cyrene.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Zeus, Cyrene]]\nAccording to Greek tradition, Cyrene was founded in 631 BC as a settlement of Greeks from the island of [[Santorini|Thera]], traditionally led by [[Battus I of Cyrene|Battus I]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Osborne|first=Robin|year=2009|title=Greece in the Making: 1200\u2013479 BC|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=8}}</ref> at a site {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} from its associated port, [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia (Marsa Sousa)]]. Traditional details concerning the founding of the city are contained in [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' IV. Cyrene promptly became the chief town of Libya and established commercial relations with all the Greek cities, reaching the height of its prosperity under its own kings in the 5th century BC. Soon after 460 BC it became a [[republic]].  In 413 BC, during the [[Peloponnesian War]], Cyrene supplied [[Spartan army|Spartan forces]] with two [[trireme]]s and [[maritime pilot|pilots]].<ref>Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War (The Landmark Thucydides edition, Robt.

In 276 BC Magas crowned himself king and declared ''de facto'' independence, marrying the daughter of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid emperor]] and forming with him an alliance in order to invade the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].\n\nThe invasion was unsuccessful and in 250 BC, after Magas' death, the city was reabsorbed into Ptolemaic Egypt. [[Cyrenaica]] became part of the Ptolemaic empire controlled from Alexandria, and became Roman territory in 96 BC when [[Ptolemy Apion]] bequeathed Cyrenaica to [[Rome]]. In 74 BC the territory was formally transformed into a [[Roman province]].\n\n[[File:Apollo Kitharoidos BM 1380.jpg|right|thumb|[[Apollo of Cyrene|Apollo Kitharoidos]] from Cyrene.

Tensions came to a head in the insurrection of the Jews of Cyrene under [[Vespasian]] (73 AD, the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]) and especially [[Trajan]] (117 AD, the [[Kitos War]]). This revolt was quelled by [[Marcius Turbo]], but not before huge numbers of civilians had been brutally massacred by the Jewish rebels.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]], lxviii. 32</ref> According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|of Caesarea]], the Jewish rebellion left Libya so depopulated to such an extent that a few years later new colonies had to be established there by the emperor [[Hadrian]] just to maintain the viability of continued settlement.\n\n[[Plutarch]] in his work ''De mulierum virtutibus'' (\"On the Virtues of Women\") describes how the tyrant of Cyrene, [[Nicocrates]], was deposed by his wife [[Aretaphila of Cyrene]] around the year 50 BC<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Bravery_of_Women*/B.html Plutarch.

In the [[Acts of the Apostles]] there is mention of people from Cyrene being in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|2:10|ESV}}</ref> According to the tradition of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], its founder, [[Saint Mark]] was a native of Cyrene and ordained the first bishop of Cyrene. The [[Roman Martyrology]]<ref>''Martyrologium Romanum (Typographia Vaticana 2001 {{ISBN|978-88-209-7210-3}})</ref> mentions under 4 July a tradition that in the persecution of [[Diocletian]] a bishop Theodorus of Cyrene was scourged and had his tongue cut out. Earlier editions of the Martyrology mentioned what may be the same person also under 26 March. Letter 67 of [[Synesius]] tells of an irregular episcopal ordination carried out by a bishop Philo of Cyrene, which was condoned by [[Athanasius]]. The same letter mentions that a nephew of this Philo, who bore the same name, also became bishop of Cyrene. Although Cyrene was by then ruined, a bishop of Cyrene name Rufus was at the [[Robber Council of Ephesus]] in 449.

Cyrene, with its port of Apollonia (Marsa Susa), remained an important urban center until the [[earthquake]] of 262, which damaged the [[Extramural Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone at Cyrene, Libya|Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephon]] in Cyrene. After the disaster, the emperor [[Claudius II|Claudius Gothicus]] restored Cyrene, naming it ''Claudiopolis'', but the restorations were poor and precarious. Natural catastrophes and a profound economic decline dictated its death, and in 365 another particularly devastating earthquake destroyed its already meager hopes of recovery. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] described it in the 4th century as a deserted city, and [[Synesius]], a native of Cyrene, described it in the following century as a vast ruin at the mercy of the nomads. Ultimately, the city fell under [[Arab conquest]] in 643, by which time little was left of the opulent Roman cities of Northern Africa; the ruins of Cyrene are located near the modern village of [[Shahhat]].\n\n==Philosophy==\nCyrene contributed to the intellectual life of the Greeks, through renowned philosophers and mathematicians. Philosophy flourished at the Cyrenaican plateau, the School of Cyrene, known as [[Cyrenaics]] developed here, a minor [[Socratic method|Socratic]] school founded by [[Aristippus]] (perhaps the friend of [[Socrates]], though according to some accounts a grandson of Aristippus with the same name). French Neo-Epicurean philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] has called Cyrene \u201ca philosophical Atlantis\u201d thanks to its huge importance in the birth and initial development of pleasure ethics. \n\nCyrene was the birthplace of [[Eratosthenes]], who later went to [[Alexandria]].

The city was named after a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]], Kyre, which the Greeks consecrated to [[Apollo]].

The Pythia had offered the advice to found a new city in [[ancient Libya|Libya]].\n\nMany years passed and the advice was not taken, and Thera had succumbed to a horrific [[drought]] and all of the crops and trees had perished. They again sent to Delphi and were reminded that the Pythia had said several years before to settle in the country of Libya, but this time she specifically said to found a settlement in the land of [[Cyrenaica|Cyrene]].\n\nNot knowing how to get to Libya, they sent a messenger to [[Crete]] to find someone to lead them on their journey. They found a dealer in purple [[dye]]s named Corobius. He had once traveled to an island across from Libya called Platea [or Plataea, modern Jazirat Barda`ah].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getamap.net/maps/libya/darnah/_plataea/ |title=Plat\u00e6a |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Get A Map |access-date=23 Nov 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031714/http://www.getamap.net/maps/libya/darnah/_plataea/ |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Grinus and Corobius sailed to Platea, when they reached their destination they left Corobius with months of supplies and Grinus went back to Thera to collect men to settle the newly made colony. After two years of settling the [[colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|colony]], they had little success and went back to the Pythia to get advice. The Pythia had repeated her advice to move directly to the country of Libya instead of across from Libya. So they moved to a place called Aziris. They settled there for six years, and were very successful until the Libyans visited the settlement of Aziris to convince the people to move further inland. They were swayed by the Libyans to move and settled into what is now Cyrene. The current king of that time Battus reigned for 40 years, until he passed on and his son, Arcesilaus, took over and reigned for 16 years, with no more or less population change until the Oracle had told the third king, another Battus, to bring [[Greeks|Greek]] citizens to the settlement and with that expansion the Libyans had lost a lot of land surrounding Cyrene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/630cyrene.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=2016-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203130152/http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/630cyrene.asp|archive-date=2016-12-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek period===\n[[File:Temple of Zeus - Cyrene.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Zeus, Cyrene]]\nAccording to Greek tradition, Cyrene was founded in 631 BC as a settlement of Greeks from the island of [[Santorini|Thera]], traditionally led by [[Battus I of Cyrene|Battus I]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Osborne|first=Robin|year=2009|title=Greece in the Making: 1200\u2013479 BC|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=8}}</ref> at a site {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} from its associated port, [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia (Marsa Sousa)]].

In the [[Acts of the Apostles]] there is mention of people from Cyrene being in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|2:10|ESV}}</ref> According to the tradition of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], its founder, [[Saint Mark]] was a native of Cyrene and ordained the first bishop of Cyrene. The [[Roman Martyrology]]<ref>''Martyrologium Romanum (Typographia Vaticana 2001 {{ISBN|978-88-209-7210-3}})</ref> mentions under 4 July a tradition that in the persecution of [[Diocletian]] a bishop Theodorus of Cyrene was scourged and had his tongue cut out. Earlier editions of the Martyrology mentioned what may be the same person also under 26 March. Letter 67 of [[Synesius]] tells of an irregular episcopal ordination carried out by a bishop Philo of Cyrene, which was condoned by [[Athanasius]]. The same letter mentions that a nephew of this Philo, who bore the same name, also became bishop of Cyrene. Although Cyrene was by then ruined, a bishop of Cyrene name Rufus was at the [[Robber Council of Ephesus]] in 449.

Cyrene, with its port of Apollonia (Marsa Susa), remained an important urban center until the [[earthquake]] of 262, which damaged the [[Extramural Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone at Cyrene, Libya|Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephon]] in Cyrene. After the disaster, the emperor [[Claudius II|Claudius Gothicus]] restored Cyrene, naming it ''Claudiopolis'', but the restorations were poor and precarious. Natural catastrophes and a profound economic decline dictated its death, and in 365 another particularly devastating earthquake destroyed its already meager hopes of recovery. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] described it in the 4th century as a deserted city, and [[Synesius]], a native of Cyrene, described it in the following century as a vast ruin at the mercy of the nomads. Ultimately, the city fell under [[Arab conquest]] in 643, by which time little was left of the opulent Roman cities of Northern Africa; the ruins of Cyrene are located near the modern village of [[Shahhat]].\n\n==Philosophy==\nCyrene contributed to the intellectual life of the Greeks, through renowned philosophers and mathematicians. Philosophy flourished at the Cyrenaican plateau, the School of Cyrene, known as [[Cyrenaics]] developed here, a minor [[Socratic method|Socratic]] school founded by [[Aristippus]] (perhaps the friend of [[Socrates]], though according to some accounts a grandson of Aristippus with the same name). French Neo-Epicurean philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] has called Cyrene \u201ca philosophical Atlantis\u201d thanks to its huge importance in the birth and initial development of pleasure ethics. \n\nCyrene was the birthplace of [[Eratosthenes]], who later went to [[Alexandria]]. Statues of philosophers, poets, and [[The Nine Muses]], and a bust of [[Demosthenes]] were found in Cyrene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6DcMU94GUC&lpg=PA202&ots=V0GUyMv5Zr&dq=Cyrene%20Athens%20of%20Africa&pg=PA202#v=onepage&q=Cyrene%20Athens%20of%20Africa&f=false|title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa|year=1981|author=G.

The book of 2 Maccabees itself is said by its author to be an abridgment of a five-volume work by a Hellenized Jew by the name of [[Jason of Cyrene]] who lived around 100 BC.\n\nCyrene is also mentioned in the [[New Testament]]. A Cyrenian named [[Simon of Cyrene|Simon]] carried the cross of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 15:21 and parallels).

Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices.

Clemson]], in exchange for room, board and tuition.{{sfn|Brothers}} His completed plaster models were sent to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA) by the [[Director of the United States Mint]], [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], on May 25, 1936.{{sfn|Taxay|p=179}} The CFA was by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] charged with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion, though she recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} The CFA chair, [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts|Charles Moore]] agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced medallist.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for ''[[The Numismatist]]'': \"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia\u2019s and Clemson\u2019s talented, adopted son.\"{{sfn|Brothers}}\n\nOn June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui-Centennial Commission, stating she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of  [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, wrote, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, lists the set for between $540 and $900, depending on condition, with individual pieces valued at a third of that.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1089}} An exceptional specimen from the Denver Mint (1936\u2013D) sold for $15,863 in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=CoinWeek|last=Ferguson|first=Mark|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 29, 2020|url=https://coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/price-records-emerge-for-finest-cac-commemorative-half-dollars/|title=Price records emerge for finest CAC commemorative half dollars}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n==Sources==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D.

The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G. Clemson]], in exchange for room, board and tuition.{{sfn|Brothers}} His completed plaster models were sent to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA) by the [[Director of the United States Mint]], [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], on May 25, 1936.{{sfn|Taxay|p=179}} The CFA was by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] charged with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion, though she recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} The CFA chair, [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts|Charles Moore]] agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced medallist.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for ''[[The Numismatist]]'': \"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia\u2019s and Clemson\u2019s talented, adopted son.\"{{sfn|Brothers}}\n\nOn June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui-Centennial Commission, stating she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of  [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, wrote, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, lists the set for between $540 and $900, depending on condition, with individual pieces valued at a third of that.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1089}} An exceptional specimen from the Denver Mint (1936\u2013D) sold for $15,863 in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=CoinWeek|last=Ferguson|first=Mark|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 29, 2020|url=https://coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/price-records-emerge-for-finest-cac-commemorative-half-dollars/|title=Price records emerge for finest CAC commemorative half dollars}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n==Sources==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.
