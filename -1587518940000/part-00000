They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nUntil the early 1980s, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s stance, reflected by the name \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\", was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors. Researchers outside China argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|title=China: A Century of Revolution|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment|date=1997}}</ref><ref>{{citation|contribution=Famine in China|year=2003|title=Encyclopedia of Population|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Leap Forward, farming was organized into [[People's commune|communes]] and the cultivation of privately owned plots forbidden. Iron and steel production was identified as a key requirement for economic advancement. Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\n[[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets in 2008:\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died. As people were dying in large numbers around them, officials did not think to save them. Their only concern was how to fulfill the delivery of grain.<ref name=trans>Translation from [http://en.chinaelections.org/newsinfo.asp?newsid=18328 \"A hunger for the truth: A new book, banned on the mainland, is becoming the definitive account of the Great Famine.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210190821/http://en.chinaelections.org/newsinfo.asp?newsid=18328 |date=10 February 2012 }}, chinaelections.org, 7 July 2008 of content from [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], ''\u5893\u7891 \uff0d\uff0d\u4e2d\u570b\u516d\u5341\u5e74\u4ee3\u5927\u9951\u8352\u7d00\u5be6 (Mu Bei \u2013 Zhong Guo Liu Shi Nian Dai Da Ji Huang Ji Shi)'', Hong Kong: Cosmos Books (Tian Di Tu Shu), 2008, {{ISBN|9789882119093}} {{in lang|zh}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlong with [[collectivization]], the central government decreed several changes in agricultural techniques that would be based on the [[Lysenkoism|ideas]] of later-discredited Russian agronomist [[Trofim Lysenko]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The People's Republic of China, 1949\u201376|edition=second|first=Michael|last=Lynch|location=London|publisher=Hodder Education|year=2008|page=57}}</ref> One of these ideas was close planting, whereby the density of seedlings was at first tripled and then doubled again. The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\nThese radically harmful changes in farming organization coincided with adverse weather patterns, including droughts and floods. As a result, year over year grain production dropped in China. The harvest was down by 15% in 1959. By 1960, it was at 70% of its 1958 level. There was no recovery until 1962, after the Great Leap Forward was declared over by the Central government.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Justin Yifu|last2=Yang|first2=Dennis Tao|year=2000|title=Food Availability, Entitlements and the Chinese Famine of 1959\u201361|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]|volume=110|issue=460|page=143|publisher=[[Royal Economic Society]]|doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00494}}<!--|accessdate=14 November 2012--></ref> According to the China Statistical Yearbook (1984), crop production decreased from 200 million tons in 1958 to 143.5 million tons in 1960.\n\n<br />\n\n{{Confusing|section|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Illusion of superabundance ===\nThe Party began to export excessive amounts of grain from regions in 1957 under the Great Leap Forward.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== Government distribution and policies ===\nThe topic of the People's commune and the degree in which it influenced the famine holds contention in regards to its overall influence. Each region dealt with the famine differently and timelines of the famine are not uniform across China. The overarching argument is that excessive eating that took place in the mess halls directly led to a worsening of the famine and that if excessive eating did not take place then, \"the worst of the Great Leap Famine could still have been avoided in mid-1959.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the General Line, one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in many ways, including the illusion of superabundance.

By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n==Extent==\n[[File:Birth rate in China.svg|thumb|upright=2|{{center|Birth and death rate in China}}]]\n[[File:China-pyramid-1982.svg|thumb|Chinese [[population pyramid]] from 1982, displaying a huge shortage of people born in 1959\u201361, reflecting the high [[infant mortality]] and low birth rate during the period]]\n\nDue to lack of food and incentive to marry at that time, the population was about 658,590,000 in 1961, about 13,480,000 less than the population of 1959.

But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n[[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

Failure to abide by the policies led to punishment. The social pressure imposed on the citizens in terms of farming and business, which the government controlled, led to state instability.

Researchers outside China argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|title=China: A Century of Revolution|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment|date=1997}}</ref><ref>{{citation|contribution=Famine in China|year=2003|title=Encyclopedia of Population|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Leap Forward, farming was organized into [[People's commune|communes]] and the cultivation of privately owned plots forbidden. Iron and steel production was identified as a key requirement for economic advancement. Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\n[[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets in 2008:\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died. As people were dying in large numbers around them, officials did not think to save them. Their only concern was how to fulfill the delivery of grain.<ref name=trans>Translation from [http://en.chinaelections.org/newsinfo.asp?newsid=18328 \"A hunger for the truth: A new book, banned on the mainland, is becoming the definitive account of the Great Famine.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210190821/http://en.chinaelections.org/newsinfo.asp?newsid=18328 |date=10 February 2012 }}, chinaelections.org, 7 July 2008 of content from [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], ''\u5893\u7891 \uff0d\uff0d\u4e2d\u570b\u516d\u5341\u5e74\u4ee3\u5927\u9951\u8352\u7d00\u5be6 (Mu Bei \u2013 Zhong Guo Liu Shi Nian Dai Da Ji Huang Ji Shi)'', Hong Kong: Cosmos Books (Tian Di Tu Shu), 2008, {{ISBN|9789882119093}} {{in lang|zh}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlong with [[collectivization]], the central government decreed several changes in agricultural techniques that would be based on the [[Lysenkoism|ideas]] of later-discredited Russian agronomist [[Trofim Lysenko]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The People's Republic of China, 1949\u201376|edition=second|first=Michael|last=Lynch|location=London|publisher=Hodder Education|year=2008|page=57}}</ref> One of these ideas was close planting, whereby the density of seedlings was at first tripled and then doubled again. The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\nThese radically harmful changes in farming organization coincided with adverse weather patterns, including droughts and floods. As a result, year over year grain production dropped in China. The harvest was down by 15% in 1959. By 1960, it was at 70% of its 1958 level. There was no recovery until 1962, after the Great Leap Forward was declared over by the Central government.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Justin Yifu|last2=Yang|first2=Dennis Tao|year=2000|title=Food Availability, Entitlements and the Chinese Famine of 1959\u201361|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]|volume=110|issue=460|page=143|publisher=[[Royal Economic Society]]|doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00494}}<!--|accessdate=14 November 2012--></ref> According to the China Statistical Yearbook (1984), crop production decreased from 200 million tons in 1958 to 143.5 million tons in 1960.\n\n<br />\n\n{{Confusing|section|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Illusion of superabundance ===\nThe Party began to export excessive amounts of grain from regions in 1957 under the Great Leap Forward.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== Government distribution and policies ===\nThe topic of the People's commune and the degree in which it influenced the famine holds contention in regards to its overall influence. Each region dealt with the famine differently and timelines of the famine are not uniform across China. The overarching argument is that excessive eating that took place in the mess halls directly led to a worsening of the famine and that if excessive eating did not take place then, \"the worst of the Great Leap Famine could still have been avoided in mid-1959.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n==Extent==\n[[File:Birth rate in China.svg|thumb|upright=2|{{center|Birth and death rate in China}}]]\n[[File:China-pyramid-1982.svg|thumb|Chinese [[population pyramid]] from 1982, displaying a huge shortage of people born in 1959\u201361, reflecting the high [[infant mortality]] and low birth rate during the period]]\n\nDue to lack of food and incentive to marry at that time, the population was about 658,590,000 in 1961, about 13,480,000 less than the population of 1959.

This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields.

In 1992, Inslee was elected to represent {{ushr|WA|4}}, based around [[Central Washington]], in the U.S. House of Representatives. Defeated for reelection in [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]], Inslee briefly returned to private legal practice. He made his first run for governor of Washington in [[1996 Washington gubernatorial election|1996]], coming in fifth in the [[blanket primary]] ahead of the general election, which was won by Democrat [[Gary Locke]]. Inslee then served as regional director for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] under President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nInslee returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999, this time for {{ushr|WA|1|}}. The new district included Seattle's northern suburbs in [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]], and [[Kitsap County, Washington|Kitsap County]].

Inslee, State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]] and State Solicitor General [[Noah Purcell]] sued the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] over [[Executive Order 13769]], which halted travel for 90 days from seven Muslim-majority countries and imposed a total ban on Syrian refugees entering the United States.

It is used by the [[Staten Island Ferry]], which connects the island [[Boroughs of New York City|boroughs]] of [[Manhattan]] and [[Staten Island]]. The Whitehall Terminal is one of the ferry's terminals, the other being [[St. George Terminal]] on Staten Island.\n\nThe Whitehall Terminal originally opened in 1903 as a new transportation hub for the Staten Island Ferry, which was in the process of being acquired by the city government. It was renovated from 1953 to 1956 at the cost of $3 million, but by the 1980s, was in a state of deterioration. The Whitehall Terminal burned down in a fire in 1991, and was completely rebuilt and rededicated in February 2005 as a major integrated [[transportation hub]].\n\n==History==\n=== Original terminal ===\nOriginally, before the terminal was first built, ferry service was provided as early as the 1700s by individuals (and later private companies) with their own boats.

It is used by the [[Staten Island Ferry]], which connects the island [[Boroughs of New York City|boroughs]] of [[Manhattan]] and [[Staten Island]]. The Whitehall Terminal is one of the ferry's terminals, the other being [[St. George Terminal]] on Staten Island.\n\nThe Whitehall Terminal originally opened in 1903 as a new transportation hub for the Staten Island Ferry, which was in the process of being acquired by the city government. It was renovated from 1953 to 1956 at the cost of $3 million, but by the 1980s, was in a state of deterioration. The Whitehall Terminal burned down in a fire in 1991, and was completely rebuilt and rededicated in February 2005 as a major integrated [[transportation hub]].\n\n==History==\n=== Original terminal ===\nOriginally, before the terminal was first built, ferry service was provided as early as the 1700s by individuals (and later private companies) with their own boats.

It is a part of the [[O.F.I. (sports club)|OFI]] [[sports club|multi sports club]]. Outside Greece, the club is generally known as '''OFI Crete''', however, the name ''Crete'' is not actually part of the club's official title. The team competes in the [[Superleague Greece|Super League]], the top division of the [[Greek football league system]], and hosts home games at the [[Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium]].\n\nOFI is the Cretan club with the most continuous appearances in the [[Superleague Greece|Greek first division]]. It has won one [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] ([[1986\u201387 Greek Cup|1986\u201387]]) and one [[Balkans Cup]], while they have competed seven times in [[UEFA]] competitions.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nThe club was founded in the autumn of 1925<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/omilistoria/pote-idrythike-o-ofi|title=When was OFI founded|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> by a group of Cretan athletes exercising at the same gym in Heraklion.

During the first OFI's years, the club's founders made up the majority of the members.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ofi-1938.jpg|thumb|OFI's squad in 1938]] -->\n\n===The years before World War II (1925\u20131940)===\nThe years preceding World War II were a very difficult period not only for Crete, but for Greece in general. Thus, it was extremely difficult for OFI to travel and participate in national football tournaments. As a result, OFI was limited to matches around the island of Crete and particularly with other football clubs based in Heraklion. Strangely enough, these local matches were more frequent in comparison to the official ones of former periods. Even though official documentation does not exist, elderly fans of OFI believe that the team played around 400 matches before the Germans finally occupied Crete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/omilistoria/otan-oi-nazi-vomvardizan-tin-kriti|title=When the Nazis bombed Crete|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===First participation in the National League (1945\u20131962)===\nDuring occupation of Crete in World War II competitions were suspended and players signed up to fight, resulting in the deaths of many players. In the first period after WW2 the football tournament restarted in Greece with a single Championship, the \"First Division\", in which only major football clubs from [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]] participated, including a few teams which qualified through preliminary rounds. However, it was almost impossible for a team coming from the province to take part in it.\n\n[[File:Ofi-1954.jpg|thumb|OFI's squad in 1954]]\n\nThis situation arose because the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] structured a system in which football teams from around the country had to play many preliminary rounds before proceeding to the national championship. As a result, even though OFI was the top football team in Crete, they could not qualify to the national tournament.\n\nAfter 1956, the system in Greece changed slightly. Advantages were that in some seasons the preliminary rounds were organized in groups of a few teams, where the champions of each group were promoted directly to the championship of the same season's First Division. One of those seasons was in 1957\u201358. OFI played preliminary games in a group of 4 teams, where they finished in first place. Thus, OFI, for the first time in its history, participated in the Greek National Championship. However, the team could not stand the frequent trips around Greece and finished in last position. Up to 1962, when the official 2nd Division Championship was organized, OFI tried again many times, but unsuccessfully, to take part in the competition of the 1st Division again.\n\n===Attempts in the 2nd League (1962\u20131968)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ofi-1968.jpg|thumb|Celebrations in [[Chania]] after the promotion of OFI to the first division]] -->\n\nIn 1962\u201363 the official Greek 2nd division league was set up for first time. OFI was one of the teams that participated in the league and completed the season in 9th position. In 1963\u201364 and 1964\u201365, OFI finished in 3rd and 5th position respectively.\n\nIn 1965\u201366, OFI were the champions of the 2nd Division of Greek football and only one step away from promotion to the official 1st National Division of Greek football.\nYet, the Hellenic Football Federation decided that even the champions of the 2nd Division had to play preliminary games in order to be promoted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ritorno2015.com/2015/05/03/t%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B5-%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%84%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7-%CE%BF-%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%B7-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-1966/|title=Mitsotakis gets crazy by OFI of 1966|publisher=ritorno2015.com|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nOFI lost in the play-off matches and remained in the 2nd Division. In 1966\u201367 the disappointment was huge, even though OFI ended in 3rd position. Everyone on the island of Crete was feeling that the moment where they could see the pride of their island in the top league was very close.\nIn 1967\u201368, OFI finished in 2nd position and went into play-off games with the bottom team of the 1st division. The final match of the play-offs was to take place in the city of [[Chania]], on 26 June 1968. OFI, with the help of 10,000 Cretans thrashed the team from the 1st division with a 3\u20130 win and made the dreams of thousands of supporters come true.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footballleaguenews.gr/k2-categories/item/8346-%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%B6-%CE%B2-%CE%B5%CE%B8%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%CF%82-1968.html|title=Barrage Beta Ethniki 1968|publisher=footballleaguenews.info|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> OFI was an official member of the 1st National Division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soccerbase.info/1968-o-ofi-stin-a-ethniki/|title=First time in Alpha Ethniki|publisher=soccerbase.info|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Debut in the 1st League (1968\u20131971)===\nOFI's debut in the national 1st division was very difficult. \"Omilos\" ended the first round in 15th position. It was a very difficult task to remain in the league. However, in the 2nd round the Cretans played magnificently and finally finished in 12th place. In the next season OFI had already gained the experience of playing in the top league of Greek football. The \"Snakes\" finished in 13th place, but the strange thing was that OFI remained unbeaten in almost all of their home games in Heraklion. Only two teams managed to survive and leave Crete with an away win. Thus, even if OFI was not a feared opponent, all the other teams were anxious when taking the trip to the island of Crete.\n\n1970\u201371 was the worse season the team from Heraklion ever had in the 1st Division. OFI ended in 17th position and was relegated for the last time in their history to the 2nd division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91%CE%84_%CE%95%CE%B8%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE_%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%AF%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CF%8E%CE%BD_1970-1971|title=Greek Championship of 1970\u201371 season|publisher=el.wikipedia.org|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} The whole season was a tragedy for the Cretans. OFI had to meet \"old friends\" from the 2nd division again and start battling again in order to be promoted for a second time.\n\n===Back to the 2nd League (1971\u20131976)===\nOFI had been relegated again, but this time the 2nd division had changed entirely. After all, the championship had been more officially organized and opponents were tougher than before.\n\nOFI spent another 5 seasons in the 2nd division, from 1971\u201372 to 1975\u201376. During the first season, the team was continually in 1st place.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ofi-1976.jpg|thumb|Thousands of Cretans celebrating OFI's promotion to the first division (1976)]] -->\nHowever, at the end of the season, OFI's good performances deteriorated and they finally finished 4th. In 1972\u201373 the management decided on a complete overhaul of the squad. In these circumstances, the 13th position OFI achieved was predictable, yet a new era of the stars of OFI had just begun. In the next season OFI finished 6th and in 1974\u201375 they finished 5th. In the next season the league was divided again into two groups, each of 20 teams. The champions of each group would be promoted directly to the First National Division. OFI couldn't afford to miss this chance.\nEverything started perfectly for \"Omilos\" in 1975\u201376. They finished 1st at the end of the first round with a huge lead over the runners-up and then finished the season as champions. The whole island of Crete was celebrating the promotion of OFI to the 1st division. Up to the present, (2007), OFI have never been relegated again.\n\n===Theodoros Vardinogiannis era===\nDuring the first 3 seasons of OFI's presence in the 1st Division, the Greek championship still had an amateur status. In 1976\u201377, even though OFI were rookies, they finished in 6th place and gained the admiration of the whole country. In addition Dimitris Papadopoulos finished the top goal scorer of the League season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentikoule.gr/podosfairo/16541-o-ofh-timaei-ton-megalo-dimitri-papadopoulo|title=Dimitris Papadopoulos, the top goal scorer of OFI in 1977|publisher=gentikoule.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> The following two seasons OFI finished 8th and 7th respectively, a period in which OFI was never once defeated in Crete. Even the \"heavyweights\" of the league (Panathinaikos, Olympiacos, AEK & PAOK) struggled to win any points when making the trip to the Genti Koule on island of Crete.\n\nThe championship in Greece was professionalized in the 1979\u201380 season and in the middle of that term the [[Vardinogiannis]] group bought the football club of OFI with Theodoros Vardinogiannis being the major shareholder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.onsports.gr/afieromata/story/116621/otan-esvise-o-igetis-toy-ofh|title=Vardinogiannis and OFI|publisher=onsports.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport-retro.gr/thodoros-vardinogiannis-giorgos-kortsidakis-ofi-crete-kriti/|title=\"The first one envisioned a big OFI\"|publisher=sport-retro.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsit.gr/athlitika/ofi-protomi-kai-ekklisaki-sti-mnimi-toy-thodoroy-vardinogianni-pics/2155377/|title=The price to Vardinogiannis from OFI, with a bust and a chapel|publisher=newsit.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> During that season the only team that beat OFI at home in Crete was Panathinaikos. The Athenian team took the victory in Heraklion extremely easily with a score line of 0\u20133. It was the only loss endured by Cretans on the island that year, after all games had been completed OFI finished in 11th position. The next season Panathinaikos embarked on their first set of experiments on OFI{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Young players came from all over the country in order to play for \"Omilos\". Partly because of this experimentation by their new owners OFI only managed 13th position in the League. The 1981\u201382 campaign saw OFI finish in 9th place and the following 1982\u201383 season in 7th. It seemed clear that Theodoros Vardinogiannis wanted OFI to be a stronger team in the championship. He tried to achieve that, not by spending money for good players, but by sending 2nd hand players from his other team Panathinaikos or young players that could possibly be useful to OFI, but primarily, for Panathinaikos in the future when the time was right. Thus, in 1983\u201384, three goalkeepers, one midfielder and one defender came from the Athenian team to Crete. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe continuing experimentation caused OFI to be disappointed yet again. OFI finished in 8th place, exactly the same position they finished next season too. Although OFI's results were not wonderful, this group of fresh players had gained experience and started to play like a team. The one thing that was missing was a good coach, who could get the best out of each player.

Gerards continued his revolution with a 3rd-place finish in 1986\u201387 and 4th place in 1987\u201388. As Gerards' OFI continued to achieve high finishes in the Greek Championship the team from Crete did something wonderful 21 June 1987.

OFI finished 6th, 7th and 6th respectively, missing UEFA Cup participation by a few points. On 27 May 1990, OFI made the biggest overthrow in Greek football, as the club losing to 50' with 4\u20130 from [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in [[Karaiskakis Stadium]], ending with 4\u20135.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/Files/h-megaluterh-anatroph-sto-ellhniko-podosfairo-osfp-ofh-apo-4-0-4-5.4083457.html|title=OFI made the biggest overthrow in Greek football against Olympiacos|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> In June 1990, OFI played once again in the final of the Greek Cup, this time against Olympiacos.

OFI finished 4th in the Championship and qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup tournament. The season's great star for OFI was Nikos Nioplias. At the end of the previous season the Vardinogiannis family decided that he might become useful to Panathinaikos, so he became the 3rd player to move to Athens from OFI. Without the team's great star, OFI only managed a 7th-place finish in the 1993\u201394 Championship. But despite those facts the name of OFI was heard loud and clear all around Europe. That season OFI achieved the unthinkable&nbsp;\u2013 they eliminated [[Slavia Prague]] in the 1st round of the [[UEFA Cup]] and [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] in the 2nd round (both 2\u20131 on aggregate). Nobody in Europe could believe that an unknown quantity like OFI could ever knock out of Europe such illustrious opposition. The famous cup run came to an end when OFI was eliminated in the 3rd round by Portuguese club [[Boavista FC|Boavista]] (Round of 16). Despite the disappointment there was pride for Cretans to be taken in that their team was the most successful Greek team in European competition that season. <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Ofi-atletico.jpg|thumb|OFI vs Atletico Madrid]] -->\nIn 1994\u201395, Panathinaikos were in dire need of a striker, and OFI had 2 top rated strikers from the previous season, Nikos Machlas and Alexis Alexoudis. Even though Panathinaikos wanted Machlas, he himself refused to go to Athens, and as a result, Panathinaikos grabbed Alexoudis. OFI ended in the 9th position this year. In the next season, Eug\u00e8ne Gerards tried to build a new team with young players. Yet the Dutchman had lost 2 great players to Panathinaikos and Nikos Machlas was transferred to Vitesse Arnhem.

Finally OFI finished 3rd in the championship by humiliating Panathinaikos one week before the end and leaving the team from Athens in 5th place, outside the positions leading to UEFA competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/omilistoria/18-maiou-1997-i-mera-pou-kaike-to-irakleio|title=May 18, 1997: \"OFI - Europe - Koutsoupias\"|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> The whole island of Crete was again celebrating the great performance of OFI.\n\nIn the next two seasons, OFI finished in 7th and 8th position respectively, suffering constant humiliations by Panathinaikos in matches between the two, as revenge for what happened in May 1997. In addition to that, [[Kostas Kiassos]], a great OFI midfielder, was the next 'victim' and was transferred to Panathinaikos. Nevertheless, OFI resumed their successful UEFA Cup campaigns. The pride of Crete eliminated Icelandic team [[Knattspyrnuf\u00e9lag Reykjav\u00edkur|KR Reykjavik]] in the second qualifying round (3\u20131 on aggregate) and Hungarian team [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] in the 1st round proper (4\u20132 on aggregate, with an unforgettable 3\u20130 victory in Crete).

While Nioplias and Machlas retired, the team partly suffered from a series of bad rosters and managers. In 2001, OFI really struggled to remain to the 1st League. The next two years, OFI managed to play a little better, thus avoiding low positions easier. But then the dark years came: OFI avoided relegation every year, for one or two points difference.\n\nPresident Fanouris Vatsinas appointed German [[Reiner Maurer]] as a coach in the summer of 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/AEth/article1140609.ece|title=OFI announced Maurer|publisher=contra.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=2 July 2006}}</ref> Maurer had the team playing greater football, even competing for a European place since the Gerards era. In the 2007 summer, OFI played in the Intertoto cup, but under-performed. The 2007\u201308 season found the club fighting to avoid relegation once again, and Maurer was sacked. [[Giorgos Paraschos]] was brought as a temporary manager, and he was eventually replaced by Czech, [[Franti\u0161ek Straka]] before the start of the new season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Ofi/article314076.ece|title=Agreement with Franti\u0161ek Straka|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, OFI suffered from the bad presidency of Fanouris Vatsinas, who was asked by the fans to leave the club.

The first ever game between Ergotelis and OFI, a friendly match in 1929, ended after 35 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/omilistoria/o-aygoustos-tou-1929-gia-ton-ofi|title=August of 1929 for OFI|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> Ergotelis were ahead by one goal, when the game had to be abandoned after violence between the players broke out. Under the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]], a legislation determined that every regional Greek city should be represented by one football team. At that time, both OFI and Ergotelis used to play in the Second National division (Football League). \u0391t the end of the 1966\u201367 season, Ergotelis finished 8th, while OFI finished in a higher position, leading to Ergotelis' relegation. The legislation also allowed the remaining teams in the second division to sign players of the relegated ones, and thus five Ergotelis players were transferred to OFI. In the years to come Ergotelis languished in the lower leagues. This led to various controversies, especially since Ergotelis' come back, at the early 2000s. This rivalry has shown signs of diminishing over the years, with OFI fans attending newly promoted Ergotelis' games in the Super League during the club's first season in the competition, and Ergotelis loaning their longtime scoring legend [[Patrick Ogunsoto]] to a financially weakened Beta Ethniki side OFI for no fee, as an attempt to assist the latter in their struggle to return to the Super League.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/BEth/article1054187.ece|title=Ogunsoto moves to OFI|publisher=contra.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=4 January

It is a part of the [[O.F.I. (sports club)|OFI]] [[sports club|multi sports club]]. Outside Greece, the club is generally known as '''OFI Crete''', however, the name ''Crete'' is not actually part of the club's official title. The team competes in the [[Superleague Greece|Super League]], the top division of the [[Greek football league system]], and hosts home games at the [[Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium]].\n\nOFI is the Cretan club with the most continuous appearances in the [[Superleague Greece|Greek first division]]. It has won one [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] ([[1986\u201387 Greek Cup|1986\u201387]]) and one [[Balkans Cup]], while they have competed seven times in [[UEFA]] competitions.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nThe club was founded in the autumn of 1925<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/omilistoria/pote-idrythike-o-ofi|title=When was OFI founded|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> by a group of Cretan athletes exercising at the same gym in Heraklion. They registered a new sports club under the name '''Omilos Filathlon Irakleiou''' (acronym  '''OFI''') which means \"Heraklion Sports Club\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofi1925.gr/el/%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%B7-12/%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B1-14|title=OFI's History|publisher=ofi1925.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}} </ref> The club's official scope was to participate at all kinds of athletic events and exhibitions. During the first OFI's years, the club's founders made up the majority of the members.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ofi-1938.jpg|thumb|OFI's squad in 1938]] -->\n\n===The years before World War II (1925\u20131940)===\nThe years preceding World War II were a very difficult period not only for Crete, but for Greece in general. Thus, it was extremely difficult for OFI to travel and participate in national football tournaments. As a result, OFI was limited to matches around the island of Crete and particularly with other football clubs based in Heraklion. Strangely enough, these local matches were more frequent in comparison to the official ones of former periods. Even though official documentation does not exist, elderly fans of OFI believe that the team played around 400 matches before the Germans finally occupied Crete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/omilistoria/otan-oi-nazi-vomvardizan-tin-kriti|title=When the Nazis bombed Crete|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===First participation in the National League (1945\u20131962)===\nDuring occupation of Crete in World War II competitions were suspended and players signed up to fight, resulting in the deaths of many players. In the first period after WW2 the football tournament restarted in Greece with a single Championship, the \"First Division\", in which only major football clubs from [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]] participated, including a few teams which qualified through preliminary rounds. However, it was almost impossible for a team coming from the province to take part in it.\n\n[[File:Ofi-1954.jpg|thumb|OFI's squad in 1954]]\n\nThis situation arose because the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] structured a system in which football teams from around the country had to play many preliminary rounds before proceeding to the national championship. As a result, even though OFI was the top football team in Crete, they could not qualify to the national tournament.\n\nAfter 1956, the system in Greece changed slightly. Advantages were that in some seasons the preliminary rounds were organized in groups of a few teams, where the champions of each group were promoted directly to the championship of the same season's First Division. One of those seasons was in 1957\u201358. OFI played preliminary games in a group of 4 teams, where they finished in first place. Thus, OFI, for the first time in its history, participated in the Greek National Championship. However, the team could not stand the frequent trips around Greece and finished in last position. Up to 1962, when the official 2nd Division Championship was organized, OFI tried again many times, but unsuccessfully, to take part in the competition of the 1st Division again.\n\n===Attempts in the 2nd League (1962\u20131968)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ofi-1968.jpg|thumb|Celebrations in [[Chania]] after the promotion of OFI to the first division]] -->\n\nIn 1962\u201363 the official Greek 2nd division league was set up for first time. OFI was one of the teams that participated in the league and completed the season in 9th position. In 1963\u201364 and 1964\u201365, OFI finished in 3rd and 5th position respectively.\n\nIn 1965\u201366, OFI were the champions of the 2nd Division of Greek football and only one step away from promotion to the official 1st National Division of Greek football.\nYet, the Hellenic Football Federation decided that even the champions of the 2nd Division had to play preliminary games in order to be promoted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ritorno2015.com/2015/05/03/t%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B5-%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%84%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7-%CE%BF-%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%B7-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-1966/|title=Mitsotakis gets crazy by OFI of 1966|publisher=ritorno2015.com|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nOFI lost in the play-off matches and remained in the 2nd Division. In 1966\u201367 the disappointment was huge, even though OFI ended in 3rd position. Everyone on the island of Crete was feeling that the moment where they could see the pride of their island in the top league was very close.\nIn 1967\u201368, OFI finished in 2nd position and went into play-off games with the bottom team of the 1st division. The final match of the play-offs was to take place in the city of [[Chania]], on 26 June 1968. OFI, with the help of 10,000 Cretans thrashed the team from the 1st division with a 3\u20130 win and made the dreams of thousands of supporters come true.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footballleaguenews.gr/k2-categories/item/8346-%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%B6-%CE%B2-%CE%B5%CE%B8%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%CF%82-1968.html|title=Barrage Beta Ethniki 1968|publisher=footballleaguenews.info|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> OFI was an official member of the 1st National Division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soccerbase.info/1968-o-ofi-stin-a-ethniki/|title=First time in Alpha Ethniki|publisher=soccerbase.info|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Debut in the 1st League (1968\u20131971)===\nOFI's debut in the national 1st division was very difficult. \"Omilos\" ended the first round in 15th position. It was a very difficult task to remain in the league. However, in the 2nd round the Cretans played magnificently and finally finished in 12th place. In the next season OFI had already gained the experience of playing in the top league of Greek football. The \"Snakes\" finished in 13th place, but the strange thing was that OFI remained unbeaten in almost all of their home games in Heraklion. Only two teams managed to survive and leave Crete with an away win. Thus, even if OFI was not a feared opponent, all the other teams were anxious when taking the trip to the island of Crete.\n\n1970\u201371 was the worse season the team from Heraklion ever had in the 1st Division. OFI ended in 17th position and was relegated for the last time in their history to the 2nd division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91%CE%84_%CE%95%CE%B8%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE_%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%AF%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CF%8E%CE%BD_1970-1971|title=Greek Championship of 1970\u201371 season|publisher=el.wikipedia.org|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} The whole season was a tragedy for the Cretans. OFI had to meet \"old friends\" from the 2nd division again and start battling again in order to be promoted for a second time.\n\n===Back to the 2nd League (1971\u20131976)===\nOFI had been relegated again, but this time the 2nd division had changed entirely. After all, the championship had been more officially organized and opponents were tougher than before.\n\nOFI spent another 5 seasons in the 2nd division, from 1971\u201372 to 1975\u201376. During the first season, the team was continually in 1st place.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ofi-1976.jpg|thumb|Thousands of Cretans celebrating OFI's promotion to the first division (1976)]] -->\nHowever, at the end of the season, OFI's good performances deteriorated and they finally finished 4th. In 1972\u201373 the management decided on a complete overhaul of the squad. In these circumstances, the 13th position OFI achieved was predictable, yet a new era of the stars of OFI had just begun. In the next season OFI finished 6th and in 1974\u201375 they finished 5th. In the next season the league was divided again into two groups, each of 20 teams. The champions of each group would be promoted directly to the First National Division. OFI couldn't afford to miss this chance.\nEverything started perfectly for \"Omilos\" in 1975\u201376. They finished 1st at the end of the first round with a huge lead over the runners-up and then finished the season as champions. The whole island of Crete was celebrating the promotion of OFI to the 1st division. Up to the present, (2007), OFI have never been relegated again.\n\n===Theodoros Vardinogiannis era===\nDuring the first 3 seasons of OFI's presence in the 1st Division, the Greek championship still had an amateur status. In 1976\u201377, even though OFI were rookies, they finished in 6th place and gained the admiration of the whole country. In addition Dimitris Papadopoulos finished the top goal scorer of the League season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentikoule.gr/podosfairo/16541-o-ofh-timaei-ton-megalo-dimitri-papadopoulo|title=Dimitris Papadopoulos, the top goal scorer of OFI in 1977|publisher=gentikoule.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> The following two seasons OFI finished 8th and 7th respectively, a period in which OFI was never once defeated in Crete. Even the \"heavyweights\" of the league (Panathinaikos, Olympiacos, AEK & PAOK) struggled to win any points when making the trip to the Genti Koule on island of Crete.\n\nThe championship in Greece was professionalized in the 1979\u201380 season and in the middle of that term the [[Vardinogiannis]] group bought the football club of OFI with Theodoros Vardinogiannis being the major shareholder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.onsports.gr/afieromata/story/116621/otan-esvise-o-igetis-toy-ofh|title=Vardinogiannis and OFI|publisher=onsports.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport-retro.gr/thodoros-vardinogiannis-giorgos-kortsidakis-ofi-crete-kriti/|title=\"The first one envisioned a big OFI\"|publisher=sport-retro.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsit.gr/athlitika/ofi-protomi-kai-ekklisaki-sti-mnimi-toy-thodoroy-vardinogianni-pics/2155377/|title=The price to Vardinogiannis from OFI, with a bust and a chapel|publisher=newsit.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> During that season the only team that beat OFI at home in Crete was Panathinaikos. The Athenian team took the victory in Heraklion extremely easily with a score line of 0\u20133. It was the only loss endured by Cretans on the island that year, after all games had been completed OFI finished in 11th position. The next season Panathinaikos embarked on their first set of experiments on OFI{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Young players came from all over the country in order to play for \"Omilos\". Partly because of this experimentation by their new owners OFI only managed 13th position in the League. The 1981\u201382 campaign saw OFI finish in 9th place and the following 1982\u201383 season in 7th. It seemed clear that Theodoros Vardinogiannis wanted OFI to be a stronger team in the championship. He tried to achieve that, not by spending money for good players, but by sending 2nd hand players from his other team Panathinaikos or young players that could possibly be useful to OFI, but primarily, for Panathinaikos in the future when the time was right. Thus, in 1983\u201384, three goalkeepers, one midfielder and one defender came from the Athenian team to Crete. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe continuing experimentation caused OFI to be disappointed yet again. OFI finished in 8th place, exactly the same position they finished next season too. Although OFI's results were not wonderful, this group of fresh players had gained experience and started to play like a team. The one thing that was missing was a good coach, who could get the best out of each player. This man arrived the following season.\n\n====Gerards' years (1985\u20132000)====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eigen Gerard.jpg|thumb|[[Eug\u00e8ne Gerards]]]] -->\n\nIn 1985, OFI appointed Dutch [[Eug\u00e8ne Gerards]] as the head coach, who remained for a legendary 15 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.onsports.gr/afieromata/story/585644/aytos-itan-o-eygenios-gkerarnt-photos-videos|title=Eug\u00e8ne Gerards, who was|publisher=onsports.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> This is still the record tenure for a coach in the Greek League, and will be a feat that lives long in the memory of Cretans. Gerards' first 3 years at the helm in Crete were nothing short of amazing. In 1985\u201386, OFI finished 2nd in the league and only missed out on becoming champions by 5 points. Gerards continued his revolution with a 3rd-place finish in 1986\u201387 and 4th place in 1987\u201388. As Gerards' OFI continued to achieve high finishes in the Greek Championship the team from Crete did something wonderful 21 June 1987. In the Olympic Stadium in Athens they defeated [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]] 3\u20131 on penalties winning the Greek Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creteplus.gr/news/2161987-otan-o-ofi-kataktouse-tin-ellada-sto-oaka--51339.html|title=OFI wins the Greek Cup at Athens Olympic Stadium|publisher=creteplus.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> The game had finished 1\u20131 after regular and extra time.

OFI finished 6th, 7th and 6th respectively, missing UEFA Cup participation by a few points. On 27 May 1990, OFI made the biggest overthrow in Greek football, as the club losing to 50' with 4\u20130 from [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in [[Karaiskakis Stadium]], ending with 4\u20135.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/Files/h-megaluterh-anatroph-sto-ellhniko-podosfairo-osfp-ofh-apo-4-0-4-5.4083457.html|title=OFI made the biggest overthrow in Greek football against Olympiacos|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> In June 1990, OFI played once again in the final of the Greek Cup, this time against Olympiacos.

The game took place in [[Georgios Kamaras Stadium]] and OFI lost 1\u20130.\n\nDuring the last of those three seasons, OFI brought a young Argentinian star to Crete&nbsp;\u2013 Victor Hugo Delgado.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/ofi-tube/o-magos-tou-ofi-viktor-oygko-delgkado|title=Argentinian rising star Victor Hugo Delgado|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> However, there was little time for Cretans to enjoy the benefits of his talent as he was soon transferred to [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]].\n\nIn season 1992\u201393, OFI was in great form once again. OFI finished 4th in the Championship and qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup tournament. The season's great star for OFI was Nikos Nioplias. At the end of the previous season the Vardinogiannis family decided that he might become useful to Panathinaikos, so he became the 3rd player to move to Athens from OFI. Without the team's great star, OFI only managed a 7th-place finish in the 1993\u201394 Championship. But despite those facts the name of OFI was heard loud and clear all around Europe. That season OFI achieved the unthinkable&nbsp;\u2013 they eliminated [[Slavia Prague]] in the 1st round of the [[UEFA Cup]] and [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] in the 2nd round (both 2\u20131 on aggregate). Nobody in Europe could believe that an unknown quantity like OFI could ever knock out of Europe such illustrious opposition. The famous cup run came to an end when OFI was eliminated in the 3rd round by Portuguese club [[Boavista FC|Boavista]] (Round of 16). Despite the disappointment there was pride for Cretans to be taken in that their team was the most successful Greek team in European competition that season. <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Ofi-atletico.jpg|thumb|OFI vs Atletico Madrid]] -->\nIn 1994\u201395, Panathinaikos were in dire need of a striker, and OFI had 2 top rated strikers from the previous season, Nikos Machlas and Alexis Alexoudis. Even though Panathinaikos wanted Machlas, he himself refused to go to Athens, and as a result, Panathinaikos grabbed Alexoudis. OFI ended in the 9th position this year. In the next season, Eug\u00e8ne Gerards tried to build a new team with young players. Yet the Dutchman had lost 2 great players to Panathinaikos and Nikos Machlas was transferred to Vitesse Arnhem.

Finally OFI finished 3rd in the championship by humiliating Panathinaikos one week before the end and leaving the team from Athens in 5th place, outside the positions leading to UEFA competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/omilistoria/18-maiou-1997-i-mera-pou-kaike-to-irakleio|title=May 18, 1997: \"OFI - Europe - Koutsoupias\"|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> The whole island of Crete was again celebrating the great performance of OFI.\n\nIn the next two seasons, OFI finished in 7th and 8th position respectively, suffering constant humiliations by Panathinaikos in matches between the two, as revenge for what happened in May 1997. In addition to that, [[Kostas Kiassos]], a great OFI midfielder, was the next 'victim' and was transferred to Panathinaikos. Nevertheless, OFI resumed their successful UEFA Cup campaigns. The pride of Crete eliminated Icelandic team [[Knattspyrnuf\u00e9lag Reykjav\u00edkur|KR Reykjavik]] in the second qualifying round (3\u20131 on aggregate) and Hungarian team [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] in the 1st round proper (4\u20132 on aggregate, with an unforgettable 3\u20130 victory in Crete).

While Nioplias and Machlas retired, the team partly suffered from a series of bad rosters and managers. In 2001, OFI really struggled to remain to the 1st League. The next two years, OFI managed to play a little better, thus avoiding low positions easier. But then the dark years came: OFI avoided relegation every year, for one or two points difference.\n\nPresident Fanouris Vatsinas appointed German [[Reiner Maurer]] as a coach in the summer of 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/AEth/article1140609.ece|title=OFI announced Maurer|publisher=contra.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=2 July 2006}}</ref> Maurer had the team playing greater football, even competing for a European place since the Gerards era. In the 2007 summer, OFI played in the Intertoto cup, but under-performed. The 2007\u201308 season found the club fighting to avoid relegation once again, and Maurer was sacked. [[Giorgos Paraschos]] was brought as a temporary manager, and he was eventually replaced by Czech, [[Franti\u0161ek Straka]] before the start of the new season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Ofi/article314076.ece|title=Agreement with Franti\u0161ek Straka|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, OFI suffered from the bad presidency of Fanouris Vatsinas, who was asked by the fans to leave the club.

The first ever game between Ergotelis and OFI, a friendly match in 1929, ended after 35 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oficrete.gr/omilistoria/o-aygoustos-tou-1929-gia-ton-ofi|title=August of 1929 for OFI|publisher=oficrete.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> Ergotelis were ahead by one goal, when the game had to be abandoned after violence between the players broke out. Under the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]], a legislation determined that every regional Greek city should be represented by one football team. At that time, both OFI and Ergotelis used to play in the Second National division (Football League). \u0391t the end of the 1966\u201367 season, Ergotelis finished 8th, while OFI finished in a higher position, leading to Ergotelis' relegation. The legislation also allowed the remaining teams in the second division to sign players of the relegated ones, and thus five Ergotelis players were transferred to OFI. In the years to come Ergotelis languished in the lower leagues. This led to various controversies, especially since Ergotelis' come back, at the early 2000s. This rivalry has shown signs of diminishing over the years, with OFI fans attending newly promoted Ergotelis' games in the Super League during the club's first season in the competition, and Ergotelis loaning their longtime scoring legend [[Patrick Ogunsoto]] to a financially weakened Beta Ethniki side OFI for no fee, as an attempt to assist the latter in their struggle to return to the Super League.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/BEth/article1054187.ece|title=Ogunsoto moves to OFI|publisher=contra.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=4 January
