It is a popular tourist area in eastern Mexico. Playa del Carmen features a wide array of tourist activities due to its geographical location in the [[Riviera Maya]]. It has also been the destination of PGA Tour golf tournaments and the set location for various television shows. The town has become one of the fastest to grow in population size in Mexico.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Solidaridad.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Municipal Seat of Solidaridad, Playa del Carmen]]\n[[File:Kerkplayadelcarmen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Church in Playa del Carmen]]\n\nPlaya del Carmen is located within the [[Riviera Maya]], which runs from south of [[Canc\u00fan]] to [[Tulum]] and the [[Sian Ka'an]] biosphere reserve. Playa is a stop for several cruise ships which dock at the nearby [[Calica]] quarry docks, about six miles (10&nbsp;km) south of the city. The [[Xcaret Eco Park]], a Mexican-themed \"eco-archaeological park\", is a popular tourist destination located just south of the town in [[Xcaret]] (pronounced \"ish-kar-et\").\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Quinta Avenida in Playa del Carmen.JPG|thumb|250px|Paseo del Carmen, shopping center located south of Fifth Avenue]]\n\nIn October 2005, [[Hurricane Wilma]] passed directly over Playa del Carmen, remaining in the vicinity for two days and causing significant damage and a temporary drop in tourist arrivals.

It is a popular tourist area in eastern Mexico. Playa del Carmen features a wide array of tourist activities due to its geographical location in the [[Riviera Maya]]. It has also been the destination of PGA Tour golf tournaments and the set location for various television shows. The town has become one of the fastest to grow in population size in Mexico.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Solidaridad.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Municipal Seat of Solidaridad, Playa del Carmen]]\n[[File:Kerkplayadelcarmen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Church in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico]]\n\nPlaya del Carmen is located within the [[Riviera Maya]], which runs from south of [[Canc\u00fan]] to [[Tulum]] and the [[Sian Ka'an]] biosphere reserve. Playa is a stop for several cruise ships which dock at the nearby [[Calica]] quarry docks, about six miles (10&nbsp;km) south of the city. The [[Xcaret Eco Park]], a Mexican-themed \"eco-archaeological park\", is a popular tourist destination located just south of the town in [[Xcaret]] (pronounced \"ish-kar-et\").\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Quinta Avenida in Playa del Carmen.JPG|thumb|250px|Paseo del Carmen, shopping center located south of Fifth Avenue]]\n\nIn October 2005, [[Hurricane Wilma]] passed directly over Playa del Carmen, remaining in the vicinity for two days and causing significant damage and a temporary drop in tourist arrivals.

He studied in [[Saint Petersburg]]. In 1913 he was a chief editor of the ''Ukrainian student'' chronicles in Saint Petersburg. Neronovych at first was a member of the [[Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (USDRP), later heading the left faction of the party which program was the creation of the independent Soviet Ukraine. In 1917-1918 he was member of the [[Central Rada]] and Mala Rada. On November 2, 1917 he was a speaker at the All-Ukrainian Military Congress that took place in [[Kiev]] from November 2 through November 8, 1917.<ref>[http://www.day.kiev.ua/66783/ Road to the Civil War by Serhiy Makhun] {{in lang|uk}}</ref> The members of the congress were taken by a complete surprise when they found out about the [[October Revolution]].

The distinct conceptual difference between the two is the granting of rights to modify and re-use a [[software product]] obtained by a customer: FOSS software licenses both rights to the customer and therefore [[Product bundling|bundles]] the modifiable [[source code]] with the software (\"[[open-source software|open-source]]\"), while proprietary software typically does not license these rights and therefore keeps the source code hidden (\"[[closed source]]\").\n\nIn addition to granting rights and imposing restrictions on the use of copyrighted software, software licenses typically contain provisions which allocate liability and responsibility between the parties entering into the license agreement. In enterprise and commercial software transactions, these terms often include limitations of liability, warranties and warranty disclaimers, and indemnity if the software infringes intellectual property rights of anyone.\n\nUnlicensed software outside the scope of copyright protection is either [[public domain software]] (PD) or software which is non-distributed, non-licensed and handled as internal business [[trade secret]].<ref name=\"redhat2005\"/> Contrary to popular belief, distributed unlicensed software (not in the public domain) is fully copyright protected, and therefore legally unusable (as no usage rights at all are granted by a license) until it passes into public domain after the [[copyright term]] has expired.<ref>[http://blog.codinghorror.com/pick-a-license-any-license/ Pick a License, Any License] on codinghorror by [[Jeff Atwood]]</ref> Examples of this are unauthorized [[software leak]]s or software projects which are placed on public software repositories like [[GitHub]] without a specified license.<ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/2611422/open-source-software/github-finally-takes-open-source-licenses-seriously.html github-finally-takes-open-source-licenses-seriously] on [[InfoWorld|infoworld]].com by Simon Phipps (July 13, 2013)</ref><ref>[https://opensource.com/law/13/8/github-poss-licensing Post open source software, licensing and GitHub] on opensource.com by Richard Fontana (13 Aug 2013)</ref> As voluntarily handing software into the public domain (before reaching the copyright term) is problematic in some jurisdictions (for instance the [[Law of Germany]]), there are also licenses granting PD-like rights, for instance the [[CC0]] or [[WTFPL]].<ref>[https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law] by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in [[Berlin, Germany]]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 100%\"\n|+ Software licenses and rights granted in context of the copyright according to [[Mark Webbink]].<ref name=\"redhat2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redhat.com/f/summitfiles/presentation/May31/Open%20Source%20Dynamics/Troan_OpenSourceProprietyPersp.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122163130/http://www.redhat.com/f/summitfiles/presentation/May31/Open%20Source%20Dynamics/Troan_OpenSourceProprietyPersp.pdf|archivedate=2014-01-22 |year=2005 |accessdate=2015-12-29 |title=Open Source from a Proprietary Perspective |author=Larry Troan |work=[[RedHat]] Summit 2006 [[Nashville]] |pages=10 |format=pdf |publisher=redhat.com}}</ref> Expanded by freeware and sublicensing.\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[License|Rights granted]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Public domain software|Public domain]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Permissive license|Permissive]] [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]]<br>license (e.g. [[BSD license]])\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Copyleft license|Copyleft]] FOSS<br>license (e.g. [[GPL]])\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Freeware]]/[[Shareware]]/<br>[[Freemium]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Proprietary software|Proprietary license]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Trade secret]]\n|-\n| [[Copyright]] retained || {{no}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes|Very strict}}\n|-\n| [[Performing rights|Right to perform]] || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Right to display || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Right to copy || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{maybe|Often}} || {{no}} || {{no|Lawsuits are filed by the owner against copyright infringement the most}}\n|-\n| [[Derivative works|Right to modify]] || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{no}} || {{no}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Right to distribute || {{yes}} || {{maybe|Yes, under same license}} || {{maybe|Yes, under same license}} || {{maybe|Often}}|| {{no}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Right to sublicense || {{yes}} || {{yes}} ||  {{no}} || {{no}} ||  {{no}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Example software || [[SQLite]], [[ImageJ]] || [[Apache web server]], [[ToyBox]] || [[Linux kernel]], [[GIMP]], [[Open Broadcaster Software|OBS]]  || [[Irfanview]], [[Winamp]], ''[[League of Legends]]'' || [[Windows]], the majority of commercial video games and their [[Digital rights management|DRMs]], [[Spotify]], [[xSplit]], [[Tidal (service)|TIDAL]]|| Server-side<br>[[Cloud computing]] programs and services,<br> forensic applications, and other line-of-business work.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Ownership vs. licensing ===\nMany [[proprietary software|proprietary]] or open source software houses sell the SW copy with a license to use it.

Therefore, the owner of a copy of computer software is legally entitled to use that copy of software. Hence, if the end-user of software is the owner of the respective copy, then the end-user may legally use the software without a license from the software publisher.\n\nAs many proprietary \"licenses\" only enumerate the rights that the user already has under {{UnitedStatesCode|17|117}},{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and yet proclaim to take rights away from the user, these contracts may lack [[consideration]]. Proprietary software licenses often proclaim to give software publishers more control over the way their software is used by keeping ownership of each copy of software with the software publisher. By doing so, Section 117 does not apply to the end-user and the software publisher may then compel the end-user to accept all of the terms of the license agreement, many of which may be more restrictive than copyright law alone. The form of the relationship determines if it is a lease or a purchase, for example ''[[UMG v. Augusto]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/umg-v-augusto|title=UMG v.

This feature of proprietary software licenses means that certain rights regarding the software are reserved by the software publisher. Therefore, it is typical of EULAs to include terms which define the uses of the software, such as the number of installations allowed or the terms of distribution.\n\nThe most significant effect of this form of licensing is that, if ownership of the software remains with the software publisher, then the end-user ''must'' accept the software license. In other words, without acceptance of the license, the end-user may not use the software at all. One example of such a proprietary software license is the license for [[Microsoft Windows]]. As is usually the case with proprietary software licenses, this license contains an extensive list of activities which are restricted, such as: [[reverse engineering]], simultaneous use of the software by multiple users, and publication of benchmarks or performance tests.\n\nThere are numerous types of licensing models, varying from simple perpetual licenses and floating licenses to more advanced models such as the metered license. <ref>[https://www.10duke.com/software-licensing-models/ Software Licensing Models - Ultimate Guide (2020)], ''10duke.com''.</ref> The most common licensing models are per single user (named user, client, node) or per user in the appropriate volume discount level, while some manufacturers accumulate existing licenses. These open volume license programs are typically called open license program (OLP), transactional license program (TLP), [[Volume License|volume license]] program (VLP) etc. and are contrary to the contractual license program (CLP), where the customer commits to purchase a certain number of licenses over a fixed period (mostly two years). Licensing per concurrent/floating user also occurs, where all users in a network have access to the program, but only a specific number at the same time. Another license model is licensing per dongle, which allows the owner of the dongle to use the program on any computer. Licensing per server, CPU or points, regardless the number of users, is common practice, as well as site or company licenses. Sometimes one can choose between perpetual (permanent) and annual license. For perpetual licenses, one year of maintenance is often required, but maintenance (subscription) renewals are discounted. For annual licenses, there is no renewal; a new license must be purchased after expiration. Licensing can be host/client (or guest), mailbox, IP address, domain etc., depending on how the program is used. Additional users are ''inter alia'' licensed per extension pack (e.g. up to 99 users), which includes the base pack (e.g. 5 users). Some programs are modular, so one will have to buy a base product before they can use other modules.<ref name=Scholten>{{cite web|last=Scholten |first=Thomas |title=Software Licensing |url=http://www.softwareresearches.net/|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nSoftware licensing often also includes maintenance. This, usually with a term of one year, is either included or optional, but must often be bought with the software. The maintenance agreement (contract) typically contains a clause that allows the licensee to receive minor updates (V.1.1 => 1.2), and sometimes major updates (V.1.2 => 2.0). This option is usually called update insurance or  upgrade assurance. For a major update, the customer has to buy an upgrade, if it is not included in the maintenance agreement. For a maintenance renewal, some manufacturers charge a reinstatement (reinstallment) fee retroactively per month, in the event that the current maintenance has expired. \n\nMaintenance sometimes includes [[Technical support|technical support]]. When it does, the level of technical support, which are commonly named gold, silver and bronze, can vary depending on the communication method (i.e. e-mail versus telephone support), availability (e.g. 5x8, 5 days a week, 8 hours a day) and reaction time (e.g. three hours). Support is also licensed per incident as an incident pack (e.g. five support incidents per year).<ref name=Scholten/>\n\nMany manufacturers offer special conditions for schools and government agencies (EDU/GOV license).

On both sides, and therefore mostly [[orthogonal]], \"free download\" ([[Freeware]]).]]\n{{Main|Free software license|Open source software license}}\nThere are several organizations in the FOSS domain who give out guidelines and definitions regarding software licenses. [[Free Software Foundation]] maintains non-exhaustive lists of software licenses following their [[The Free Software Definition]] and licenses which the FSF considers non-free for various reasons.<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ License list] \u2013 [[Free Software Foundation]]</ref> The FSF distinguishes additionally between free software licenses that are [[License compatibility|compatible]] or incompatible with the FSF license of choice, the [[copyleft]] [[GNU General Public License]]. The [[Open Source Initiative]] defines a list of certified open-source licenses following their [[The Open Source Definition]].<ref>[https://opensource.org/licenses/category Open Source Licenses by Category] on opensource.org</ref> Also the [[Debian]] project has a list of licenses which follow their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].<ref>[https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses DFSGLicenses] on debian.org</ref>\n\nFree and open-source licenses are commonly classified into two categories: Those with the aim to have minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed ([[permissive licenses]]), and the protective [[share-alike]] ([[copyleft|copyleft Licenses]]).\n\nAn example of a copyleft free software license is the often used [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), also the first copyleft license. This license is aimed at giving and protecting all users unlimited freedom to use, study, and privately modify the software, and if the user adheres to the terms and conditions of the GPL, freedom to redistribute the software or any modifications to it. For instance, any modifications made and redistributed by the end-user must include the source code for these, and the license of any derivative work must not put any additional restrictions beyond what the GPL allows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html |title=The GNU General Public License v3.0 \u2013 GNU Project \u2013 Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=fsf.org |accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nExamples of [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software licenses]] are the [[BSD license]] and the [[MIT license]], which give unlimited permission to use, study, and privately modify the software, and includes only minimal requirements on redistribution. This gives a user the permission to take the code and use it as part of closed-source software or software released under a [[proprietary software]] license.\n\nIt was under debate some time if [[public domain software]] and public domain-like licenses can be considered as a kind of FOSS license. Around 2004 lawyer [[Lawrence Rosen (attorney)|Lawrence Rosen]] argued in the essay ''\"Why the public domain isn't a license\"'' software could not truly be [[Waiver|waived]] into public domain and can't therefore be interpreted as very permissive FOSS license,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosenlaw.com/lj16.htm |title=Why the public domain isn't a license |author=[[Lawrence Rosen (attorney)|Lawrence Rosen]] |date=2004-05-25 |accessdate=2016-02-22 |publisher=rosenlaw.com}}</ref> a position which faced opposition by [[Daniel J.

Under United States copyright law, all [[software]] is [[copyright]] protected, in both [[source code]] and [[object code]] forms, unless that software was developed by the United States Government, in which case it cannot be copyrighted.<ref name=\"fsm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/what_if_copyright_didnt_apply_binary_executables |title=What if copyright didn't apply to binary executables? |date=2008-08-29| first=Terry |last=Hancock |publisher=[[Free Software Magazine]] |accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref> Authors of copyrighted software can donate their software to the [[public domain software|public domain]], in which case it is also not covered by copyright and, as a result, cannot be licensed. \n\nA typical software license grants the [[licensee]], typically an [[end-user]], permission to use one or more copies of software in ways where such a use would otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement of the software owner's [[exclusive rights]] under copyright.\n\n== Software licenses and copyright law ==\nMost distributed software can be categorized according to its license type (see table).\n\nTwo common categories for software under copyright law, and therefore with licenses which grant the [[licensee]] specific rights, are [[proprietary software]] and [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS). The distinct conceptual difference between the two is the granting of rights to modify and re-use a [[software product]] obtained by a customer: FOSS software licenses both rights to the customer and therefore [[Product bundling|bundles]] the modifiable [[source code]] with the software (\"[[open-source software|open-source]]\"), while proprietary software typically does not license these rights and therefore keeps the source code hidden (\"[[closed source]]\").\n\nIn addition to granting rights and imposing restrictions on the use of copyrighted software, software licenses typically contain provisions which allocate liability and responsibility between the parties entering into the license agreement. In enterprise and commercial software transactions, these terms often include limitations of liability, warranties and warranty disclaimers, and indemnity if the software infringes intellectual property rights of anyone.\n\nUnlicensed software outside the scope of copyright protection is either [[public domain software]] (PD) or software which is non-distributed, non-licensed and handled as internal business [[trade secret]].<ref name=\"redhat2005\"/> Contrary to popular belief, distributed unlicensed software (not in the public domain) is fully copyright protected, and therefore legally unusable (as no usage rights at all are granted by a license) until it passes into public domain after the [[copyright term]] has expired.<ref>[http://blog.codinghorror.com/pick-a-license-any-license/ Pick a License, Any License] on codinghorror by [[Jeff Atwood]]</ref> Examples of this are unauthorized [[software leak]]s or software projects which are placed on public software repositories like [[GitHub]] without a specified license.<ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/2611422/open-source-software/github-finally-takes-open-source-licenses-seriously.html github-finally-takes-open-source-licenses-seriously] on [[InfoWorld|infoworld]].com by Simon Phipps (July 13, 2013)</ref><ref>[https://opensource.com/law/13/8/github-poss-licensing Post open source software, licensing and GitHub] on opensource.com by Richard Fontana (13 Aug 2013)</ref> As voluntarily handing software into the public domain (before reaching the copyright term) is problematic in some jurisdictions (for instance the [[Law of Germany]]), there are also licenses granting PD-like rights, for instance the [[CC0]] or [[WTFPL]].<ref>[https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law] by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in [[Berlin, Germany]]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 100%\"\n|+ Software licenses and rights granted in context of the copyright according to [[Mark Webbink]].<ref name=\"redhat2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redhat.com/f/summitfiles/presentation/May31/Open%20Source%20Dynamics/Troan_OpenSourceProprietyPersp.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122163130/http://www.redhat.com/f/summitfiles/presentation/May31/Open%20Source%20Dynamics/Troan_OpenSourceProprietyPersp.pdf|archivedate=2014-01-22 |year=2005 |accessdate=2015-12-29 |title=Open Source from a Proprietary Perspective |author=Larry Troan |work=[[RedHat]] Summit 2006 [[Nashville]] |pages=10 |format=pdf |publisher=redhat.com}}</ref> Expanded by freeware and sublicensing.\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[License|Rights granted]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Public domain software|Public domain]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Permissive license|Permissive]] [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]]<br>license (e.g. [[BSD license]])\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Copyleft license|Copyleft]] FOSS<br>license (e.g. [[GPL]])\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Freeware]]/[[Shareware]]/<br>[[Freemium]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Proprietary software|Proprietary license]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Trade secret]]\n|-\n| [[Copyright]] retained || {{no}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes|Very strict}}\n|-\n| [[Performing rights|Right to perform]] || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Right to display || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Right to copy || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{maybe|Often}} || {{no}} || {{no|Lawsuits are filed by the owner against copyright infringement the most}}\n|-\n| [[Derivative works|Right to modify]] || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{yes}} || {{no}} || {{no}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Right to distribute || {{yes}} || {{maybe|Yes, under same license}} || {{maybe|Yes, under same license}} || {{maybe|Often}}|| {{no}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Right to sublicense || {{yes}} || {{yes}} ||  {{no}} || {{no}} ||  {{no}} || {{no}}\n|-\n| Example software || [[SQLite]], [[ImageJ]] || [[Apache web server]], [[ToyBox]] || [[Linux kernel]], [[GIMP]], [[Open Broadcaster Software|OBS]]  || [[Irfanview]], [[Winamp]], ''[[League of Legends]]'' || [[Windows]], the majority of commercial video games and their [[Digital rights management|DRMs]], [[Spotify]], [[xSplit]], [[Tidal (service)|TIDAL]]|| Server-side<br>[[Cloud computing]] programs and services,<br> forensic applications, and other line-of-business work.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Ownership vs. licensing ===\nMany [[proprietary software|proprietary]] or open source software houses sell the SW copy with a license to use it. There isn't any transferring of [[Ownership right|ownership]] of the good to the user, which hasn't the warranty of a for life availability of the software, nor isn't entitled to sell, rent, give it to someone, copy or redistribute it on the Web. License [[Contractual term|terms]] and [[Covenant (law)|conditions]] may specify further [[Provision (contracting)|legal clauses]] that users can't negotiate individually or by way of a [[consumer organization]], and can uniquely accept or refuse, returning the product back to the vendor.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allbusiness.com/the-difference-between-buying-and-licensing-software-928-1.html | title = The difference between ownership transfer (purchased) and licensing software | website = [[Allbusiness.com]] | archive-url = http://archive.is/1IvF2/ | archive-date = 12 June 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> This right can be effectively applied where the jurisdiction provides a mandatory time for the good decline right after the purchase (as in the [[European Union law]]), or a mandatory public advertisement of the license terms, so as to be made readable by users before their purchasing.\n\nIn the United States, Section 117 of the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]] gives the owner of a particular copy of software the explicit right to use the software with a computer, even if use of the software with a computer requires the making of incidental copies or adaptations (acts which could otherwise potentially constitute [[copyright infringement]]). Therefore, the owner of a copy of computer software is legally entitled to use that copy of software. Hence, if the end-user of software is the owner of the respective copy, then the end-user may legally use the software without a license from the software publisher.\n\nAs many proprietary \"licenses\" only enumerate the rights that the user already has under {{UnitedStatesCode|17|117}},{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and yet proclaim to take rights away from the user, these contracts may lack [[consideration]]. Proprietary software licenses often proclaim to give software publishers more control over the way their software is used by keeping ownership of each copy of software with the software publisher. By doing so, Section 117 does not apply to the end-user and the software publisher may then compel the end-user to accept all of the terms of the license agreement, many of which may be more restrictive than copyright law alone. The form of the relationship determines if it is a lease or a purchase, for example ''[[UMG v. Augusto]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/umg-v-augusto|title=UMG v.

This feature of proprietary software licenses means that certain rights regarding the software are reserved by the software publisher. Therefore, it is typical of EULAs to include terms which define the uses of the software, such as the number of installations allowed or the terms of distribution.\n\nThe most significant effect of this form of licensing is that, if ownership of the software remains with the software publisher, then the end-user ''must'' accept the software license. In other words, without acceptance of the license, the end-user may not use the software at all. One example of such a proprietary software license is the license for [[Microsoft Windows]]. As is usually the case with proprietary software licenses, this license contains an extensive list of activities which are restricted, such as: [[reverse engineering]], simultaneous use of the software by multiple users, and publication of benchmarks or performance tests.\n\nThere are numerous types of licensing models, varying from simple perpetual licenses and floating licenses to more advanced models such as the metered license. <ref>[https://www.10duke.com/software-licensing-models/ Software Licensing Models - Ultimate Guide (2020)], ''10duke.com''.</ref> The most common licensing models are per single user (named user, client, node) or per user in the appropriate volume discount level, while some manufacturers accumulate existing licenses. These open volume license programs are typically called open license program (OLP), transactional license program (TLP), [[Volume License|volume license]] program (VLP) etc. and are contrary to the contractual license program (CLP), where the customer commits to purchase a certain number of licenses over a fixed period (mostly two years). Licensing per concurrent/floating user also occurs, where all users in a network have access to the program, but only a specific number at the same time. Another license model is licensing per dongle, which allows the owner of the dongle to use the program on any computer. Licensing per server, CPU or points, regardless the number of users, is common practice, as well as site or company licenses. Sometimes one can choose between perpetual (permanent) and annual license. For perpetual licenses, one year of maintenance is often required, but maintenance (subscription) renewals are discounted. For annual licenses, there is no renewal; a new license must be purchased after expiration. Licensing can be host/client (or guest), mailbox, IP address, domain etc., depending on how the program is used. Additional users are ''inter alia'' licensed per extension pack (e.g. up to 99 users), which includes the base pack (e.g. 5 users). Some programs are modular, so one will have to buy a base product before they can use other modules.<ref name=Scholten>{{cite web|last=Scholten |first=Thomas |title=Software Licensing |url=http://www.softwareresearches.net/|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nSoftware licensing often also includes maintenance. This, usually with a term of one year, is either included or optional, but must often be bought with the software. The maintenance agreement (contract) typically contains a clause that allows the licensee to receive minor updates (V.1.1 => 1.2), and sometimes major updates (V.1.2 => 2.0). This option is usually called update insurance or  upgrade assurance. For a major update, the customer has to buy an upgrade, if it is not included in the maintenance agreement. For a maintenance renewal, some manufacturers charge a reinstatement (reinstallment) fee retroactively per month, in the event that the current maintenance has expired. \n\nMaintenance sometimes includes [[Technical support|technical support]]. When it does, the level of technical support, which are commonly named gold, silver and bronze, can vary depending on the communication method (i.e. e-mail versus telephone support), availability (e.g. 5x8, 5 days a week, 8 hours a day) and reaction time (e.g. three hours). Support is also licensed per incident as an incident pack (e.g. five support incidents per year).<ref name=Scholten/>\n\nMany manufacturers offer special conditions for schools and government agencies (EDU/GOV license).

[[Free Software Foundation]] maintains non-exhaustive lists of software licenses following their [[The Free Software Definition]] and licenses which the FSF considers non-free for various reasons.<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ License list] \u2013 [[Free Software Foundation]]</ref> The FSF distinguishes additionally between free software licenses that are [[License compatibility|compatible]] or incompatible with the FSF license of choice, the [[copyleft]] [[GNU General Public License]]. The [[Open Source Initiative]] defines a list of certified open-source licenses following their [[The Open Source Definition]].<ref>[https://opensource.org/licenses/category Open Source Licenses by Category] on opensource.org</ref> Also the [[Debian]] project has a list of licenses which follow their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].<ref>[https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses DFSGLicenses] on debian.org</ref>\n\nFree and open-source licenses are commonly classified into two categories: Those with the aim to have minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed ([[permissive licenses]]), and the protective [[share-alike]] ([[copyleft|copyleft Licenses]]).\n\nAn example of a copyleft free software license is the often used [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), also the first copyleft license. This license is aimed at giving and protecting all users unlimited freedom to use, study, and privately modify the software, and if the user adheres to the terms and conditions of the GPL, freedom to redistribute the software or any modifications to it. For instance, any modifications made and redistributed by the end-user must include the source code for these, and the license of any derivative work must not put any additional restrictions beyond what the GPL allows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html |title=The GNU General Public License v3.0 \u2013 GNU Project \u2013 Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=fsf.org |accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nExamples of [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software licenses]] are the [[BSD license]] and the [[MIT license]], which give unlimited permission to use, study, and privately modify the software, and includes only minimal requirements on redistribution. This gives a user the permission to take the code and use it as part of closed-source software or software released under a [[proprietary software]] license.\n\nIt was under debate some time if [[public domain software]] and public domain-like licenses can be considered as a kind of FOSS license. Around 2004 lawyer [[Lawrence Rosen (attorney)|Lawrence Rosen]] argued in the essay ''\"Why the public domain isn't a license\"'' software could not truly be [[Waiver|waived]] into public domain and can't therefore be interpreted as very permissive FOSS license,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosenlaw.com/lj16.htm |title=Why the public domain isn't a license |author=[[Lawrence Rosen (attorney)|Lawrence Rosen]] |date=2004-05-25 |accessdate=2016-02-22 |publisher=rosenlaw.com}}</ref> a position which faced opposition by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] and others.<ref>[https://cr.yp.to/publicdomain.html Placing documents into the public domain] by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] on cr.yp.to ''\"Most rights can be voluntarily abandoned (\"waived\") by the owner of the rights. Legislators can go to extra effort to create rights that can't be abandoned, but usually they don't do this. In particular, you can voluntarily abandon your United States copyrights: \"It is well settled that rights gained under the Copyright Act may be abandoned. But abandonment of a right must be manifested by some overt act indicating an intention to abandon that right. See Hampton v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 279 F.2d 100, 104 (9th Cir. 1960).\"\"'' (2004)</ref> In 2012 the dispute was finally resolved when Rosen accepted the [[CC0]] as an [[open source license]], while admitting that contrary to his previous claims, copyright can be waived away, backed by [[Ninth circuit]] decisions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-March/001679.html |quote=''The case you referenced in your email, Hampton v. Paramount Pictures, 279 F.2d 100 (9th Cir. Cal. 1960), stands for the proposition that, at least in the Ninth Circuit, a person can indeed abandon his copyrights (counter to what I wrote in my article) -- but it takes the equivalent of a manifest license to do so. :-)[...] For the record, I have already voted +1 to approve the CC0 public domain dedication and fallback license as OSD compliant. I admit that I have argued for years against the \"public domain\" as an open source license, but in retrospect, considering the minimal risk to developers and users relying on such software and the evident popularity of that \"license\", I changed my mind. One can't stand in the way of a fire hose of free public domain software, even if it doesn't come with a better FOSS license that I trust more.'' |author=[[Lawrence Rosen (attorney)|Lawrence Rosen]] |date=2012-03-08 |publisher=opensource.org |title=(License-review) (License-discuss) CC0 incompliant with OSD on patents, (was: MXM compared to CC0) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312093735/https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-March/001679.html |archivedate=2016-03-12 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Comparison of free and open-source software licenses]]\n* [[Digital rights management]]\n* [[Copy protection]]\n* [[Dual-licensing]]\n* [[Index of Articles Relating to Terms of Service and Privacy Policies]]\n* [[License-free software]]\n* [[License manager]]\n* [[Product activation]]\n* [[Product key]]\n* [[Rights Expression Language]]\n* [[Software metering]]\n* [[Terms of service]]\n* [[Perpetual access]]\n* [[:Category:Copyright licenses|Copyright licenses (category)]]\n* [[:Category:Software by license|Software by license (category)]]\n\n== License management software ==\n* [https://www.10duke.com/products/entitlements-licensing/ 10Duke Entitlements]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikibooks|FOSS Licensing}}\n\n* [https://www.10duke.com/software-licensing-models/ Software Licensing Models - Ultimate Guide (2020)]\n* [http://www.bricklin.com/licensingthinking.htm Software licensing for a small ISV and the issue of open source] by [[Dan Bricklin]]\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721052929/http://knol.google.com/k/jon-gillespie-brown/what-is-software-licensing/3v64x901bjfe2/2# |date=July 21, 2011 |title=''Definition of software licensing'' }} by Jon Gillespie-Brown at knol.google.de\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721052936/http://knol.google.com/k/why-product-activation-for-software-is-becoming-widespread# |date=July 21, 2011 |title=''Why product activation for software is becoming widespread'' }} knol.google.com\n* [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses \"Relationships between different types of licenses Free and Non-Free\"].
