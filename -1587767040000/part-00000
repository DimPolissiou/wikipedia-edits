During the 1980s, local artist [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] helped put it at the forefront of Minneapolis music venues by using it as the location for many scenes in his movie ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'', while also recording the song \"[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]\" and other songs from the movie and ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' album live at the club in 1983. The club's appearance in the film brought it national recognition and the venue soon found itself a tourist attraction. As the decade progressed, the reliance on popular and progressive DJ dance nights continued, including weekly theme nights featuring breakdance culture (\"Break It Up\" and \"Electric Energy\"), the exploding funk and raps scenes (\"More Funk\" aka \"MF\") in the main room and House/rave music (\"House Nation Under A Groove\") in the Entry. Other theme nights were \"Sex-O-Rama,\" \"Club Degenerate,\" \"Club 2-4-1\" \"Depth Probe,\" the all-ages \"Sunday Night Dance Party\" (SNDP), and the \"air guitar\" performance series, \"Great Pretenders\". Relatively more mainstream and mixed-genre dance nights held down Friday and Saturday nights (\"Danceteria,\" \"No Creeps\" and others).\n\nAfter the club's twentieth anniversary in 1990, national attention increased, with mentions in magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

The club's appearance in the film brought it national recognition and the venue soon found itself a tourist attraction. As the decade progressed, the reliance on popular and progressive DJ dance nights continued, including weekly theme nights featuring breakdance culture (\"Break It Up\" and \"Electric Energy\"), the exploding funk and raps scenes (\"More Funk\" aka \"MF\") in the main room and House/rave music (\"House Nation Under A Groove\") in the Entry. Other theme nights were \"Sex-O-Rama,\" \"Club Degenerate,\" \"Club 2-4-1\" \"Depth Probe,\" the all-ages \"Sunday Night Dance Party\" (SNDP), and the \"air guitar\" performance series, \"Great Pretenders\". Relatively more mainstream and mixed-genre dance nights held down Friday and Saturday nights (\"Danceteria,\" \"No Creeps\" and others).\n\nAfter the club's twentieth anniversary in 1990, national attention increased, with mentions in magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Around this time, there was an increased interest in DJs and [[electronic dance music]], and the VIP Lounge on the second level was unveiled, featuring DJs and personalities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe club was briefly closed by Fingerhut in late fall 2004 for financial reasons, causing a wave of protest from music fans. The issues were quickly resolved (the judge presiding in the bankruptcy case noted, \"I gather there is some urgency about this\"), and the club was reopened by new partners Meyers, McClellan, and Byron Frank (a longtime business manager), with shows resuming after one week's closure. Mayor [[R.T. Rybak]] of [[Minneapolis]] promised to do a stage dive at the first show after reopening, but ended up dropping the idea when he discovered that the show would feature the heavy metal band [[Gwar]]. Rybak had [[crowd surfing|crowd surfed]] at a \"Rock for Democracy\" event at the venue earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite web|author=David |url=http://howwastheshow.blogspot.com/2004/07/mayor-rt-rybak-stage-dives-and-crowd.html |title=Mayor RT Rybak Stage Dives and Crowd Surfs at First Avenue during Rock for Democracy |publisher=HowWasTheShow Blog |date=July 18, 2004 |accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMcClellan ended his 32-year stint at First Avenue in 2005,<ref>[https://archive.today/20110805181201/http://articles.citypages.com/2004-06-30/columns/the-first-avenue-massacre/full/ \"The First Avenue Massacre - What Steve McClellan's Pink Slip Said\"]; by Jim Walsh; [[City Pages]] article.</ref> and formed a non-profit company, the Diverse Emerging Music Organization (or DEMO).<ref>[http://www.demomn.org ''Diverse Emerging Music Organization'']; organizational website.</ref> After McClellan's departure as general manager, Jack Meyers was appointed to the position and continued until 2009, when Nathan Kranz took over.<ref>{{cite web| title=About Us: History: Current| url=http://www.first-avenue.com/history/today| publisher=First Avenue, 701 Ventures| accessdate=January 18, 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324160635/http://www.first-avenue.com/history/today| archivedate=March 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Notable events==\n[[Image:First Avenue Exterior - Stars 2.JPG|thumb]]\nThe [[nightclub]] has been the starting point for many bands that have come out of the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]], including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[The Revolution (band)|The Revolution]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Semisonic]], [[Atmosphere (hip hop group)|Atmosphere]], [[Brother Ali]], [[Dosh (musician)|Dosh]], [[The Jayhawks]], [[Mint Condition]] and [[Curtiss A]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nBands and artists have performed at the nightclub and influenced the Minneapolis music scene from 1970 onward, as exemplified by the silver stars that adorn the black building's exterior (every star has the name of an artist who has played at First Avenue or 7th St Entry).

Indiana borders [[Lake Michigan]] to the northwest, [[Michigan]] to the north, [[Ohio]] to the east, [[Kentucky]] to the south and southeast, and [[Illinois]] to the west.\n\nBefore becoming a territory, various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the [[Eastern United States]]; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], Central Indiana by migrants from the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states and from adjacent Ohio, and [[Southern Indiana]] by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and [[Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286017/Indiana/279873/Settlement-patterns-and-demographic-trends |title=Indiana \u2013 Settlement patterns and demographic trends |publisher=eb.com |author1=William Vincent D'Antonio |author2=Robert L.

On May 7, 1800, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation to divide the [[Northwest Territory]] into two areas and named the western section the [[Indiana Territory]]. In 1816, when Congress passed an Enabling Act to begin the process of establishing statehood for Indiana, a part of this territorial land became the geographic area for the new state.<ref>A portion of the Northwest Territory's eastern section became the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803. The [[Michigan Territory]] was established in 1805 from part of the Indiana Territory's northern lands and four years later, in 1809, the Illinois counties were separated from the Indiana Territory to create the [[Illinois Territory]].

The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Refugee tribes from eastern regions, including the Delaware who settled in the White and Whitewater River Valleys, later joined them.\n\n===European exploration and sovereignty===\n\n{{Main|New France|Canada (New France)|Louisiana (New France)|Illinois Country|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}\n[[File:Natives guiding french explorers through indiana.jpg|thumb|Native Americans guide French explorers through Indiana, as depicted by [[Maurice Thompson]] in ''Stories of Indiana'']]\n\nIn 1679, French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.\n\nBy 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nIn 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.\n\nThe Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].\n\nThe tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Native American use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called \"Indian Territory\".\n\nIn 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31\u201332.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name=\"NO\">{{cite web| title =Northwest Ordinance of 1787 | publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events| accessdate =July 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west. His success is often credited for changing the course of the American Revolutionary War.<ref>Brill, p. 33.</ref> At the end of the war, through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States, including Native American lands.\n\n===The frontier===\n\n{{Main|Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Indiana Territory}}\n{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 210\n|image1=Indiana Indian treaties.svg\n|alt1=A colorful map of Indiana with treaty names\n|image2=Indiana, 1817.jpg\n|alt2=A crude map of Indiana with only a handful of southern counties delineated\n|caption2=Above: a map showing extent of the treaty lands.

About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.\n\nA portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).\n\nIn 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811.

The remaining two counties, Dearborn and Ohio, are combined into one circuit. Many counties operate [[superior court]]s in addition to the circuit court. In densely populated counties where the caseload is traditionally greater, separate courts have been established to solely hear either juvenile, criminal, probate or small claims cases. The establishment, frequency and jurisdiction of these additional courts varies greatly from county to county.

County officials elected to four-year terms include an auditor, recorder, treasurer, sheriff, coroner and clerk of the circuit court.

Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises.

While Indiana has made commitments to increasing use of renewable resources such as wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or solar power, however, progress has been very slow, mainly because of the continued abundance of coal in Southern Indiana. Most of the new plants in the state have been [[coal gasification]] plants. Another source is hydroelectric power.\n\n[[Wind power in Indiana|Wind power]] is now being developed. New estimates in 2006 raised the wind capacity for Indiana from 30 MW at 50 m turbine height to 40,000 MW at 70 m, and to 130,000 MW at 100 m, in 2010, the height of newer turbines.<ref>[http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html Indiana's Renewable Energy Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209233955/http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html |date=February 9, 2014 }} Retrieved August 20, 2008</ref> As of the end of 2011, Indiana has installed 1,340 MW of wind turbines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_installed_capacity.asp |title=WINDExchange: U.S. Installed Wind Capacity |website=windpoweringamerica.gov |accessdate=February 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314233108/http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_installed_capacity.asp |archivedate=March 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\n====Airports====\n\n{{See also|List of airports in Indiana}}\n\n[[Indianapolis International Airport]] serves the greater Indianapolis area and has finished constructing a new passenger terminal.

However, the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) Proposal of 2005 stated the 181st would lose its fighter mission and [[F-16]] aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility as a general-aviation-only facility.\n\nThe southern part of the state is also served by the [[Louisville International Airport]] across the Ohio River in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Hebron, Kentucky]]. Most residents of [[Northwest Indiana]], which is primarily in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], use the two Chicago airports, [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport]].\n\n====Highways====\n\n[[File:I-69 Construction Indiana.jpg|thumb|The [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]] extension project in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe County]]]]\n\nThe major U.S. [[List of Interstate Highways in Indiana|Interstate highways in Indiana]] are [[Interstate 64 in Indiana|I-64]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|I-65]], [[Interstate 265 in Indiana|I-265]], [[Interstate 465|I-465]], [[Interstate 865|I-865]], [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]], [[Interstate 469|I-469]], [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]], [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|I-74]], [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]], [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]], [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|I-94]], and [[Interstate 275 (Ohio\u2013Indiana\u2013Kentucky)|I-275]]. The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.\n\nA $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]]) now complete. The sixth and final phase to Indianapolis is in planning. When complete, I-69 will traverse an additional {{convert|142|mi|km|}} through the state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lange|first=Kaitlin|title=I-69 completion date pushed back|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/13/-69-completion-date-pushed-back/97850844/|accessdate=September 3, 2017|work=The Indianapolis Star|date=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====County roads====\n\nMost Indiana counties use a grid-based system to identify county roads; this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) makes it much easier to identify the sources of calls placed to the [[9-1-1]] system. Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).\n\nThere are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.\n\nNotably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.\n\n====Rail====\n\n[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]\n\nIndiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Other [[Class I railroad]]s in Indiana include the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Soo Line Railroad]], a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] subsidiary, as well as [[Amtrak]]. The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads. The [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems, extending from Chicago to [[South Bend]]. Indiana is implementing an extensive rail plan prepared in 2002 by the [[Parsons Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Rail Plan | publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation | url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm}}</ref> Many recreational trails, such as the [[Monon Trail]] and [[Cardinal Greenway]], have been created from [[rails-to-trails|abandoned rails routes]].\n\n====Ports====\n\n[[File:Towboat Ben McCool upbound on Ohio River with two tank barges (1 of 6) 87j082.jpg|thumb|Barges are a common sight along the [[Ohio River]].

Evansville has been a [[United States Customs|U.S. Customs Port of Entry]] for more than 125 years. Because of this, it is possible to have international cargo shipped to Evansville in bond. The international cargo can then clear Customs in Evansville rather than a coastal port.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Education==\n\n{{See also|List of colleges and universities in Indiana}}\n\nIndiana's 1816 constitution was the first in the country to implement a state-funded [[public school (government funded)|public school]] system.

In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution. In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.\n\nAlthough the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.\n\nIndiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools. Mathematics, English/Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies are among the top, prioritized standards.

Indiana borders [[Lake Michigan]] to the northwest, [[Michigan]] to the north, [[Ohio]] to the east, [[Kentucky]] to the south and southeast, and [[Illinois]] to the west.\n\nBefore becoming a territory, various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the [[Eastern United States]]; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], Central Indiana by migrants from the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states and from adjacent Ohio, and [[Southern Indiana]] by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and [[Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286017/Indiana/279873/Settlement-patterns-and-demographic-trends |title=Indiana \u2013 Settlement patterns and demographic trends |publisher=eb.com |author1=William Vincent D'Antonio |author2=Robert L.

On May 7, 1800, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation to divide the [[Northwest Territory]] into two areas and named the western section the [[Indiana Territory]].

The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Refugee tribes from eastern regions, including the Delaware who settled in the White and Whitewater River Valleys, later joined them.\n\n===European exploration and sovereignty===\n\n{{Main|New France|Canada (New France)|Louisiana (New France)|Illinois Country|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}\n[[File:Natives guiding french explorers through indiana.jpg|thumb|Native Americans guide French explorers through Indiana, as depicted by [[Maurice Thompson]] in ''Stories of Indiana'']]\n\nIn 1679, French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.\n\nBy 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nIn 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.\n\nThe Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].\n\nThe tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Native American use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called \"Indian Territory\".\n\nIn 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31\u201332.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name=\"NO\">{{cite web| title =Northwest Ordinance of 1787 | publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events| accessdate =July 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west. His success is often credited for changing the course of the American Revolutionary War.<ref>Brill, p. 33.</ref> At the end of the war, through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States, including Native American lands.\n\n===The frontier===\n\n{{Main|Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Indiana Territory}}\n{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 210\n|image1=Indiana Indian treaties.svg\n|alt1=A colorful map of Indiana with treaty names\n|image2=Indiana, 1817.jpg\n|alt2=A crude map of Indiana with only a handful of southern counties delineated\n|caption2=Above: a map showing extent of the treaty lands.

About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.\n\nA portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).\n\nIn 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and the purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Statehood and settlement===\n\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey Lester Jones, Photographer May 24, 1940.

The remaining two counties, Dearborn and Ohio, are combined into one circuit. Many counties operate [[superior court]]s in addition to the circuit court. In densely populated counties where the caseload is traditionally greater, separate courts have been established to solely hear either juvenile, criminal, probate or small claims cases.

County officials elected to four-year terms include an auditor, recorder, treasurer, sheriff, coroner and clerk of the circuit court.

Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises.

While Indiana has made commitments to increasing use of renewable resources such as wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or solar power, however, progress has been very slow, mainly because of the continued abundance of coal in Southern Indiana. Most of the new plants in the state have been [[coal gasification]] plants. Another source is hydroelectric power.\n\n[[Wind power in Indiana|Wind power]] is now being developed. New estimates in 2006 raised the wind capacity for Indiana from 30 MW at 50 m turbine height to 40,000 MW at 70 m, and to 130,000 MW at 100 m, in 2010, the height of newer turbines.<ref>[http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html Indiana's Renewable Energy Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209233955/http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html |date=February 9, 2014 }} Retrieved August 20, 2008</ref> As of the end of 2011, Indiana has installed 1,340 MW of wind turbines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_installed_capacity.asp |title=WINDExchange: U.S. Installed Wind Capacity |website=windpoweringamerica.gov |accessdate=February 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314233108/http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_installed_capacity.asp |archivedate=March 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\n====Airports====\n\n{{See also|List of airports in Indiana}}\n\n[[Indianapolis International Airport]] serves the greater Indianapolis area and has finished constructing a new passenger terminal.

However, the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) Proposal of 2005 stated the 181st would lose its fighter mission and [[F-16]] aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility as a general-aviation-only facility.\n\nThe southern part of the state is also served by the [[Louisville International Airport]] across the Ohio River in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Hebron, Kentucky]]. Most residents of [[Northwest Indiana]], which is primarily in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], use the two Chicago airports, [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport]].\n\n====Highways====\n\n[[File:I-69 Construction Indiana.jpg|thumb|The [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]] extension project in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe County]]]]\n\nThe major U.S. [[List of Interstate Highways in Indiana|Interstate highways in Indiana]] are [[Interstate 64 in Indiana|I-64]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|I-65]], [[Interstate 265 in Indiana|I-265]], [[Interstate 465|I-465]], [[Interstate 865|I-865]], [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]], [[Interstate 469|I-469]], [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]], [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|I-74]], [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]], [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]], [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|I-94]], and [[Interstate 275 (Ohio\u2013Indiana\u2013Kentucky)|I-275]]. The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.\n\nA $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]]) now complete. The sixth and final phase to Indianapolis is in planning. When complete, I-69 will traverse an additional {{convert|142|mi|km|}} through the state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lange|first=Kaitlin|title=I-69 completion date pushed back|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/13/-69-completion-date-pushed-back/97850844/|accessdate=September 3, 2017|work=The Indianapolis Star|date=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====County roads====\n\nMost Indiana counties use a grid-based system to identify county roads; this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) makes it much easier to identify the sources of calls placed to the [[9-1-1]] system. Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).\n\nThere are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.\n\nNotably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.\n\n====Rail====\n\n[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]\n\nIndiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Other [[Class I railroad]]s in Indiana include the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Soo Line Railroad]], a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] subsidiary, as well as [[Amtrak]]. The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads. The [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems, extending from Chicago to [[South Bend]]. Indiana is implementing an extensive rail plan prepared in 2002 by the [[Parsons Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Rail Plan | publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation | url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm}}</ref> Many recreational trails, such as the [[Monon Trail]] and [[Cardinal Greenway]], have been created from [[rails-to-trails|abandoned rails routes]].\n\n====Ports====\n\n[[File:Towboat Ben McCool upbound on Ohio River with two tank barges (1 of 6) 87j082.jpg|thumb|Barges are a common sight along the [[Ohio River]].

Evansville has been a [[United States Customs|U.S. Customs Port of Entry]] for more than 125 years. Because of this, it is possible to have international cargo shipped to Evansville in bond. The international cargo can then clear Customs in Evansville rather than a coastal port.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Education==\n\n{{See also|List of colleges and universities in Indiana}}\n\nIndiana's 1816 constitution was the first in the country to implement a state-funded [[public school (government funded)|public school]] system.

In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution. In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.\n\nAlthough the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.\n\nIndiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools. Mathematics, English/Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies are among the top, prioritized standards.

Their irregular, repeating shapes are found in cloud formations and tree limbs, in stalks of broccoli and craggy mountain ranges, even in the rhythm of the human heart. In this film, NOVA takes viewers on a fascinating quest with a group of maverick mathematicians determined to decipher the rules that govern fractal geometry. For centuries, fractal-like irregular shapes were considered beyond the boundaries of mathematical understanding. Now, mathematicians have finally begun mapping this uncharted territory.

NOVA was on-site at the San Jos\u00e9 mine in Chile by early September. Conferred special access, NOVA's film crew interviewed engineers, NASA experts, medical personnel, and key figures from the companies that provided drills and crucial rescue equipment to give a more detailed scientific account of the unfolding events. The resulting film, using footage from the scene as well as advanced animation, showcases the extraordinary feats of engineering as well as the biological and geological factors inherent in the rescue. \"Emergency Mine Rescue\" also examines the psychological and physiological impact of this kind of prolonged ordeal on the miners and those involved in the rescue efforts.

Despite all their efforts, the performance of the plane was balanced on a knife-edge, demanding near-perfect weather conditions and hour after hour of vigilant, skillful piloting. The longest nonstop leg, from Japan to Hawaii, lasted five days and set a new world solo flight record.

The U.S. space program suffered a bitter setback when Apollo 1 ended in a deadly fire during a pre-launch run-through.

Their irregular, repeating shapes are found in cloud formations and tree limbs, in stalks of broccoli and craggy mountain ranges, even in the rhythm of the human heart. In this film, NOVA takes viewers on a fascinating quest with a group of maverick mathematicians determined to decipher the rules that govern fractal geometry. For centuries, fractal-like irregular shapes were considered beyond the boundaries of mathematical understanding. Now, mathematicians have finally begun mapping this uncharted territory.

NOVA was on-site at the San Jos\u00e9 mine in Chile by early September. Conferred special access, NOVA's film crew interviewed engineers, NASA experts, medical personnel, and key figures from the companies that provided drills and crucial rescue equipment to give a more detailed scientific account of the unfolding events. The resulting film, using footage from the scene as well as advanced animation, showcases the extraordinary feats of engineering as well as the biological and geological factors inherent in the rescue. \"Emergency Mine Rescue\" also examines the psychological and physiological impact of this kind of prolonged ordeal on the miners and those involved in the rescue efforts.

Despite all their efforts, the performance of the plane was balanced on a knife-edge, demanding near-perfect weather conditions and hour after hour of vigilant, skillful piloting. The longest nonstop leg, from Japan to Hawaii, lasted five days and set a new world solo flight record.

The U.S. space program suffered a bitter setback when Apollo 1 ended in a deadly fire during a pre-launch run-through.

Westview Press, Boulder, CO.</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\"<ref name=\"Dundon2009\" /> The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \n\n==Factors affecting sustainability==\n[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods have a low [[carbon footprint]].]]\n\nPractices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage|tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]]).\n\n[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]\n\nThe most important factors for a farming site are [[climate]], soil, [[nutrient]]s and [[water resources]]. Of the four, water and [[soil conservation]] are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from [[nutrient depletion]] and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] or mineral ores.\n\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of [[fertilizer]] or [[manure]], which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).\n\n===Nutrients===\n====Nitrates====\nPossible sources of [[nitrate]]s that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:\n\n#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure|human manure]]\n#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]<nowiki/>s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]\n#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using renewable electricity)\n#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.\n\nThe last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928\u20134932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]</ref> Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.\n\nOther options include [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.\n\nAccording to the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute, several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in \"normal\" years with average rainfall.

Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 1 farm used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide.<ref>Pretty. J. (November 23, 2018). Intensification for redesigned and sustainable agriculture systems; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/eaav0294/tab-pdf</ref> In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |display-authors=etal |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349}}</ref>\n\n[[Vertical farming]] is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.<ref name=Marks2014>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[Water efficiency]] can be improved by reducing the need for [[irrigation]] and using alternative methods.

Westview Press, Boulder, CO.</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\"<ref name=\"Dundon2009\" /> The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \n\n==Factors affecting sustainability==\n[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods have a low [[carbon footprint]].]]\n\nPractices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage|tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]]).\n\n[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]\n\nThe most important factors for a farming site are [[climate]], soil, [[nutrient]]s and [[water resources]]. Of the four, water and [[soil conservation]] are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from [[nutrient depletion]] and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] or mineral ores.\n\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of [[fertilizer]] or [[manure]], which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).\n\n===Nutrients===\n====Nitrates====\nPossible sources of [[nitrate]]s that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:\n\n#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure|human manure]]\n#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]<nowiki/>s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]\n#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using renewable electricity)\n#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.\n\nThe last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928\u20134932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]</ref> Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.\n\nOther options include [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid [[Soil salinity|salinization]]) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a [[non-renewable resource]]. Improvements in water [[well drilling]] technology and [[submersible pump]]s, combined with the development of [[drip irrigation]] and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.\n\nAccording to the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute, several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in \"normal\" years with average rainfall.

Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide.<ref>Pretty. J. (November 23, 2018). Intensification for redesigned and sustainable agriculture systems; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/eaav0294/tab-pdf</ref> In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |display-authors=etal |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349}}</ref>\n\n[[Vertical farming]] is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.<ref name=Marks2014>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[Water efficiency]] can be improved by reducing the need for [[irrigation]] and using alternative methods.

One of the targets is to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. By 2050 the restored land should sequestrate 20 billion tonnes of carbon annually.
