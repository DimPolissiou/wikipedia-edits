Many believed that the sexually explicit behavior encouraged by Charles II on the stage led to the demoralization of the English population outside the theater.  Many felt that restoration comedies, which started out ridiculing vice, appeared to support vice instead therefore becoming one of the leading causes of moral corruption. One of the leading environmental factors that made way for this new genre was [[Jeremy Collier]]\u2019s ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'', published in 1698. This essay signaled the public opposition to the supposed improprieties of plays staged during the previous three decades. Collier convincingly argued that the, \"business of plays is to recommend Vertue, and discountenance Vice\".<ref name=Collier>{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=Jeremy|title=A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage|date=1698|location=London}}</ref><ref name=Cox/> Other sentimentalists took on the responsibility to moralize the stage in hopes of repairing the perceived damage of restoration comedies. These playwrights and theoreticians used the theater to instruct rather than delight after puritan opposition to theater grew from 1660 to 1698.<ref name=Cox>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=James E.|last2=Litt|first2=D.|title=The Rise of Sentimental Comedy|date=1926|publisher=The Folcroft Press|location=Springfield, Mo}}</ref><ref name=Hare>{{cite book|last1=Hare|first1=Maurice Evan|title=Steele and the Sentimental Comedy|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924072597960|date=1909|publisher=Clarednon|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nAt the opening night of Cibber's ''[[Love's Last Shift]]'' at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Dury Lane Theater]] in January 1696 spectators experienced a new genre.<ref name=Bernbaum>{{cite book|last1=Bernbaum|first1=Ernest|title=The Drama of Sensibilty: A Sketch of the History of English Sentimental Comedy and Domestic Tragedy 1696-1780|date=1915|publisher=Ginn and Company|location=Gloucester, Mass.}}</ref><ref name=Hare/> They were genuinely surprised by the unexpected reconciliation and the joy of seeing this, \"spread such an uncommon rapture of pleasure in the audience that never were spectators more happy in easing their minds by uncommon and repeated plaudits and honest tears.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Thomas|title=Dramatic Miscellanies|url=https://archive.org/details/dramaticmiscell01davigoog|date=1784|pages=411\u2013412|edition=III}}</ref> This enthusiasm was aroused by the virtues of the characters, creating a sense of astonishment in the audience because they allowed them to feel admiration for people like themselves. This feeling became the hallmark of sentimentalism. Richard Steele stated that sentimental comedies, \"makes us approve ourselves more\" <ref>{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Richard|title=Epilogue to the Lying Lover|date=1703}}</ref> and [[Denis Diderot]] advocated that sentimentalism helps spectators remember that all nature is inherently good.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=De la Poesie dramatique|date=1875|publisher=Euvres|location=Assezat|page=312|edition=VII}}</ref> Sentimentalists met resistance with playwrights of true comedy, who also had a moral aim but strove to reach it by exhibiting characters from which the audience should take warning instead of emulate.<ref name=Bernbaum/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Vanbrugh|first1=John, Sir|title=A Short Vindication of the Relapse|date=1698|pages=65\u201371}}</ref>\n\nSentimental comedy influenced and became absorbed into a new genre called [[domestic tragedy]] beginning around the mid-18th century. These tragedies intended to use real-life situations, settings, and prose to move an audience and foreshadowed the realism to come in the 19th century.<ref name=Bernbaum/><ref name=\"Brockett\"/><ref name=Hare/>\n\n==Critical response==\n\n===Beaumarchais' ''An Essay on Serious Drama''===\n\n[[Pierre Beaumarchais]] was very much in support of sentimental comedy and describes his reasoning in his essay published in 1767. He explains first that the purpose of sentimental comedy is to offer a more immediate interest and more direct moral lesson than tragedy, and a deeper meaning than comedy. Since according to Beaumarchais noisy laughter is the enemy of thought, sentimental comedy gives its audience a chance to find silent sympathy and thought provoking isolation in tears. Being touched by the action on stage allows viewers to learn from the play and as good men are reminded of the rewards of virtues they are able to relate the play's events to real life. The form is praised for doing away with verse and rhyme as they can obscure the meaning \u2013 making the truth disappear. Beaumarchais is instead in favor of language found in nature, and used in sentimental comedy.<ref name=Campbell/><ref name=Beaumarchais/>\n\nTo combat the opposition, Beaumarchais lays out come criticism of laughing comedy. He argues that laughing at others distances the laughter from those being made fun of and that mockery is therefore not the best weapon to fight vice. A play that encourages this type of behavior also interests the audience more in the rascal than the honest man showing the viewers that morality is shallow, worthless, and inverted. Even Beaumarchais admits that some critics describe the genre as deadly dawdling prose with no comic relief, maxims, or characters with improbable plots that will inspire laziness in young writers who will not take the time to write verse.<ref name=Campbell/><ref name=Beaumarchais/>\n\n=== Goldsmith's ''An Essay on the Theatre''===\n\nIn this essay, alternately titled ''A Comparison between Laughing and Sentimental Comedy'' and published in 1773, [[Oliver Goldsmith]] invokes the classical definition of comedy through [[Aristotle]] and [[Terence]] and insists that comedy is meant to expose the vices rather than the distresses of man. He argues that theatre is meant to amuse its spectators and while sentimental comedy might amuse the public, laughing comedy would amuse them more. He goes further to say that the characters of sentimental comedy are difficult to relate to and that audience members will, therefore, remain indifferent to the characters' plight. Goldsmith advocates that since sentimental comedies show distresses that they should be labeled as tragedies, though a simple name change will not enhance their efficacy. The essay is ended with a sarcastic comment about the ease with which any writer could create a sentimental comedy with just some, \"insipid dialogue, without character or humour...make a pathetic scene or two, with a sprinkling of tender melancholy conversation...and there is no doubt that all the ladies will cry\".<ref name=Campbell/><ref name=Brockett/><ref name=Goldsmith>{{cite book|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Oliver|title=An Essay on the Theatre; Or, A Comparison between Laughing and Sentimental Comedy|date=1773|publisher=Westminster Magazine|location=London}}</ref>\n\nSentimental comedy had both supporters and naysayers, but by the 1770s the genre had all but died out, leaving in its place laughing comedies, such as [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', which were generally concerned the intrigues of those living in upper-class society.<ref name=Campbell/><ref name=Brockett/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Restoration Comedy|Restoration comedy]]\n* [[Domestic Tragedy|Domestic tragedy]]\n* [[Com\u00e9die larmoyante]]\n* [[History of theatre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{History of theatre}}\n\n[[Category:British drama]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Charlotte Goodall as Sir Harry Wildair.jpg|Charlotte Goodall as Sir Harry Wildair in ''The Constant Couple''|thumb]]'''Sentimental comedy''' is an 18th-century dramatic genre which sprang up as a reaction to the immoral tone of [[Restoration comedy|English Restoration plays]].

One of the leading environmental factors that made way for this new genre was [[Jeremy Collier]]\u2019s ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'', published in 1698. This essay signaled the public opposition to the supposed improprieties of plays staged during the previous three decades. Collier convincingly argued that the, \"business of plays is to recommend Vertue, and discountenance Vice\".<ref name=Collier>{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=Jeremy|title=A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage|date=1698|location=London}}</ref><ref name=Cox/> Other sentimentalists took on the responsibility to moralize the stage in hopes of repairing the perceived damage of restoration comedies. These playwrights and theoreticians used the theater to instruct rather than delight after puritan opposition to theater grew from 1660 to 1698.<ref name=Cox>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=James E.|last2=Litt|first2=D.|title=The Rise of Sentimental Comedy|date=1926|publisher=The Folcroft Press|location=Springfield, Mo}}</ref><ref name=Hare>{{cite book|last1=Hare|first1=Maurice Evan|title=Steele and the Sentimental Comedy|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924072597960|date=1909|publisher=Clarednon|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nAt the opening night of Cibber's ''[[Love's Last Shift]]'' at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Dury Lane Theater]] in January 1696 spectators experienced a new genre.<ref name=Bernbaum>{{cite book|last1=Bernbaum|first1=Ernest|title=The Drama of Sensibilty: A Sketch of the History of English Sentimental Comedy and Domestic Tragedy 1696-1780|date=1915|publisher=Ginn and Company|location=Gloucester, Mass.}}</ref><ref name=Hare/> They were genuinely surprised by the unexpected reconciliation and the joy of seeing this, \"spread such an uncommon rapture of pleasure in the audience that never were spectators more happy in easing their minds by uncommon and repeated plaudits and honest tears.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Thomas|title=Dramatic Miscellanies|url=https://archive.org/details/dramaticmiscell01davigoog|date=1784|pages=411\u2013412|edition=III}}</ref> This enthusiasm was aroused by the virtues of the characters, creating a sense of astonishment in the audience because they allowed them to feel admiration for people like themselves. This feeling became the hallmark of sentimentalism. Richard Steele stated that sentimental comedies, \"makes us approve ourselves more\" <ref>{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Richard|title=Epilogue to the Lying Lover|date=1703}}</ref> and [[Denis Diderot]] advocated that sentimentalism helps spectators remember that all nature is inherently good.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=De la Poesie dramatique|date=1875|publisher=Euvres|location=Assezat|page=312|edition=VII}}</ref> Sentimentalists met resistance with playwrights of true comedy, who also had a moral aim but strove to reach it by exhibiting characters from which the audience should take warning instead of emulate.<ref name=Bernbaum/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Vanbrugh|first1=John, Sir|title=A Short Vindication of the Relapse|date=1698|pages=65\u201371}}</ref>\n\nSentimental comedy influenced and became absorbed into a new genre called [[domestic tragedy]] beginning around the mid-18th century. These tragedies intended to use real-life situations, settings, and prose to move an audience and foreshadowed the realism to come in the 19th century.<ref name=Bernbaum/><ref name=\"Brockett\"/><ref name=Hare/>\n\n==Critical response==\n\n===Beaumarchais' ''An Essay on Serious Drama''===\n\n[[Pierre Beaumarchais]] was very much in support of sentimental comedy and describes his reasoning in his essay published in 1767. He explains first that the purpose of sentimental comedy is to offer a more immediate interest and more direct moral lesson than tragedy, and a deeper meaning than comedy. Since according to Beaumarchais noisy laughter is the enemy of thought, sentimental comedy gives its audience a chance to find silent sympathy and thought provoking isolation in tears. Being touched by the action on stage allows viewers to learn from the play and as good men are reminded of the rewards of virtues they are able to relate the play's events to real life. The form is praised for doing away with verse and rhyme as they can obscure the meaning making the truth disappear. Beaumarchais is instead in favor of language found in nature, and used in sentimental comedy.<ref name=Campbell/><ref name=Beaumarchais/>\n\nTo combat the opposition Beaumarchais lays out come criticism of laughing comedy. He argues that laughing at others distances the laugher from those being made fun of and that mockery is therefore not the best weapon to fight vice. A play that encourages this type of behavior also interests the audience more in the rascal than the honest man showing the viewers that morality is shallow, worthless, and inverted. Even Beaumarchais admits that some critics describe the genre as deadly dawdling prose with no comic relief, maxims, or characters with improbable plots that will inspire laziness in young writers who won't take the time to write verse.<ref name=Campbell/><ref name=Beaumarchais/>\n\n=== Goldsmith's ''An Essay on the Theatre''===\n\nIn this essay, alternately titled ''A Comparison between Laughing and Sentimental Comedy'' and published in 1773, [[Oliver Goldsmith]] invokes the classical definition of comedy through [[Aristotle]] and [[Terence]] and insists that comedy is meant to expose the vices rather than the distresses of man. He argues that theatre is meant to amuse its spectators and while sentimental comedy might amuse the public, laughing comedy would amuse them more. He goes further to say that the characters of sentimental comedy are difficult to relate to and that audience members will therefore remain indifferent to the characters' plight. Goldsmith advocates that since sentimental comedies show distresses that they should be labeled as tragedies, though a simple name change will not enhance their efficacy. The essay is ended with a sarcastic comment about the ease with which any writer could create a sentimental comedy with just some, \"insipid dialogue, without character or humour...make a pathetic scene or two, with a sprinkling of tender melancholy conversation...and there is no doubt that all the ladies will cry\".<ref name=Campbell/><ref name=Brockett/><ref name=Goldsmith>{{cite book|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Oliver|title=An Essay on the Theatre; Or, A Comparison between Laughing and Sentimental Comedy|date=1773|publisher=Westminster Magazine|location=London}}</ref>\n\nSentimental comedy had both supporters and naysayers, but by the 1770s the genre had all but died out, leaving in its place laughing comedies, such as [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', which were generally concerned the intrigues of those living in upper-class society.<ref name=Campbell/><ref name=Brockett/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Restoration Comedy|Restoration comedy]]\n* [[Domestic Tragedy|Domestic tragedy]]\n* [[Com\u00e9die larmoyante]]\n* [[History of theatre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{History of theatre}}\n\n[[Category:British drama]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "copy edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimental_comedy"}

Party flags are mentioned, but never described in the actual novel.]]\n\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is set in [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], one of three inter-continental [[superstates]] that divided the world after a global war.\n\nSmith's memories and his reading of the proscribed book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], reveal that after the [[Second World War]], the United Kingdom became involved in a war during the early 1950s in which [[nuclear weapon]]s destroyed hundreds of cities in Europe, western Russia and North America. [[Colchester]] was destroyed and London also suffered widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a [[London Underground]] station. Britain fell into civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as [[Ingsoc]], emerged victorious and formed a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in Britain. The [[British Commonwealth]] and Latin America were absorbed by the United States, resulting in the superstate of Oceania. Ingsoc became the sole government party in this new nation.\n\nSimultaneously, the [[Soviet Union]] conquered [[continental Europe]] and established the second superstate of [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]], under a Neo-[[Bolshevik]] regime. The third superstate of [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] emerged in the Far East after another decade of fighting, with a ruling ideology translated from Chinese as 'Death-Worship' or 'Obliteration of the Self'. The three superstates wage perpetual war for the remaining unconquered lands of the world in \"a rough quadrilateral with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and Hong Kong\" through constantly shifting alliances. Although each of the three states are said to have sufficient natural resources, the war continues to maintain ideological control over the people.\n\nWhile citizens in each state are trained to despise the ideologies of the other two as uncivilised and barbarous, Goldstein's book, ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', explains that in fact the superstates' ideologies are practically identical and that the public's ignorance of this fact is imperative so that they might continue believing otherwise. The only references to the exterior world for the Oceanian citizenry (the Outer Party and the Proles) are Ministry of Truth maps and propaganda to ensure their belief in \"the war\".\n\nHowever, due to the fact that Winston barely remembers these events and due to the Party's manipulation of historical records, the continuity and accuracy of these events are unknown. Winston himself notes that the Party has claimed credit for inventing helicopters, aeroplanes, and trains, while Julia theorises that the perpetual bombing of London is merely a [[false-flag operation]] designed to convince the populace that a war is occurring. If the official account was accurate, Smith's strengthening memories and the story of his family's dissolution suggest that the atomic bombings occurred first, followed by civil war featuring \"confused street fighting in London itself\" and the societal postwar reorganisation, which the Party retrospectively calls \"the Revolution\".\n\nMost of the plot takes place in London, the \"chief city of [[Airstrip One]]\", the Oceanic province that \"had once been called England or Britain\".<ref>Part I, Ch. 1.</ref><ref>Part I, Ch. 3.</ref> Posters of the Party leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], bearing the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\", dominate the city (Winston states it can be found on nearly every house), while telescreens ([[transceiver|transceiving]] television set) monitor the private and public lives of the party members. Military parades, propaganda films, and [[public executions]] are said to be commonplace.\n\nThe class hierarchy of Oceania has three levels:\n* (I) the upper-class [[Inner Party]], the elite ruling minority, who make up 2% of the population.\n* (II) the professional-managerial class [[Outer Party]], the middle class, who make up 13% of the population.\n* (III) the lower-class [[Proles (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Proletariat]], who make up 85% of the population and represent the working class.\nAs the government, the Party controls the population with four ministries, each named after the opposite of their true function:\n* the [[Ministry of Peace]] deals with war and defence.\n* the [[Ministry of Plenty]] deals with economic affairs (starvation and rationing).\n* the [[Ministry of Love]] deals with law and order (torture and brainwashing).\n* the [[Ministry of Truth]] deals with news, entertainment, education and art (propaganda).\n\nThe protagonist [[Winston Smith]], a member of the Outer Party, works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth as an editor, [[historical negationism|negating historical records]] to make the past conform to the ever-changing [[party line (politics)|party line]] and deleting references to ''[[unperson]]s'' (people who have not only killed by the state but denied existence even in history or memory).\n\nThe story of Winston Smith begins on 4 April 1984: \"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\" Yet he is uncertain of the true date, given the regime's continual rewriting and manipulation of history.<ref>\"striking thirteen\" (1:00&nbsp;pm). In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the [[24-hour clock]] is modern, the [[12-hour clock]] is old-fashioned, Part I, Ch. 8.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:1984 fictious world map 2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.6|alt=Color-coded world map|World map, based on the novel]]\nIn the year 1984, civilisation has been damaged by war, civil conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) is a province of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Oceania]], one of the three [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] super-states that rule the world. It is ruled by the \"Party\" under the ideology of \"[[Ingsoc]]\" (a shortening of \"English Socialism\") and the mysterious leader [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who has an intense [[cult of personality]]. The Party stamps out anyone who does not fully conform to their regime using the [[Thought Police]] and constant surveillance through devices such as [[Telescreen]]s (two-way televisions).\n\nWinston Smith is a member of the middle-class [[Outer Party]], working at the [[Ministry of Truth]], where he [[historical negationism|rewrites historical records]] to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become \"unpersons\", disappearing with all evidence of their existence removed. Winston revises past editions of ''[[The Times]]'', while the original documents are destroyed by fire in a \"[[memory hole]]\". He secretly opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion, despite knowing that he is already a \"[[Thoughtcrime|thoughtcriminal]]\" and likely to be caught one day.\n\nWhile in a proletariat neighbourhood, he meets Mr. Charrington, the owner of an antiques shop, and buys a diary. He uses an alcove to hide it from the Telescreen in his room, and writes thoughts criticising the Party and Big Brother, and also writes that \"if there is hope, it lies in the proles\". To his dismay, when he visits a section of town where the proles live he discovers they have no political consciousness. An old man he talks to there has no significant memory of life before the Revolution. As he works in the Ministry of Truth, he observes [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry, whom Winston suspects of being a spy against him, and develops an intense hatred of her. He vaguely suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], is a member of an enigmatic underground [[resistance movement]] known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]. Winston has a lunch conversation with a co-worker named Syme, who is writing a dictionary for a revised version of the English language called [[Newspeak]]. After Syme says freely that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston thinks to himself that Syme will disappear as he is \"too intelligent\" and therefore dangerous to the Party.\n\nOne day, Julia secretly hands Winston a note saying she loves him, and the two begin a torrid affair. This is an act of rebellion, as the Party insists that sex only be used for reproduction. Julia shares his loathing of the Party, but he later realizes that she is not interested in politics or in overthrowing the regime, thinking that it impossible. They at first rendezvous in the country, and later meet in a rented room above Mr. Charrington's shop. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and his terse relationship with his wife Katharine, from whom he is separated (divorce is not permitted by the Party). He also notices the disappearance of Syme during one of his working days. Weeks later, Winston is approached by O'Brien, who invites Winston over to his flat, which is noted as being of far higher quality than Winston's. O'Brien introduces himself as a member of the Brotherhood and sends Winston a copy of ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by Emmanuel Goldstein. Meanwhile, during the nation's Hate Week, Oceania's enemy suddenly changes from [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] to [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], with no-one seemingly noticing the shift. Winston and Julia read parts of the book, which explains more about how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its slogans and the concept of [[perpetual war]]. It argues that the Party can be overthrown if proles rise up against it. However, to Winston, it does not answer 'why' the Party maintains power.\n\nWinston and Julia are captured and imprisoned. Mr. Charrington is revealed to be an agent of the Thought Police. At the [[Ministry of Love]], Winston briefly interacts with colleagues who have been arrested for other offences. O'Brien arrives, revealing that he too is a Thought Police agent, part of a special [[sting operation]] to catch \"thoughtcriminals\". Over several months, Winston is starved and tortured and forced to \"cure\" himself of his \"insanity\" by changing his own perception to fit in line with the Party. O'Brien tells Winston that the Party \"is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power.\" When O'Brien taunts Winston by asking him if there is any humiliation which he has not yet been made to suffer, Winston points out that the Party has not managed to make him betray Julia. O'Brien admits that is true. He says that once Winston is fully loyal, he will be released back into society for an unspecified period of time, and then he will be executed.\n\nStill imprisoned but now better fed and no longer mistreated, Winston grows stronger. Intellectually he has accepted that the party is invincible and \u2018objective truth\u2019 has no meaning. He has fully absorbed ''crimestop'', the instinctive conformity to state doctrine that precludes any oppositional thought. Emotionally, however, he at times clings to his old self. He fantasizes that moments before his execution his heretic side will emerge, which, as long as he is killed while unrepentant, will be his great victory over the party.\n\nWinston\u2019s hopes implode when, in an unconscious reverie, he calls out Julia\u2019s name. O\u2019Brien confronts him and Winston admits he hates Big Brother. O'Brien takes Winston to [[Room 101]] for the final stage of re-education. The room contains each prisoner's worst fear. In Winston's case it is rats. The fact that the Party knows this indicates the level of surveillance on the population is far more thorough than Winston previously believed. As a wire cage holding frenzied rats is fitted onto his face, Winston betrays Julia, begging his torturers to do it to Julia instead of him. Some time after being released Winston meets Julia in a park. She says she was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. They part ways. Later, Winston sits alone in a caf\u00e9 as Oceania celebrates a supposed victory over Eurasian armies in Africa and realises that, now, \"he loved Big Brother\".\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n[[File:Constellation of characters.png|thumb|A constellation of characters Winston interacts with in the book ''1984''.]]\n* [[Winston Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 the protagonist who is a phlegmatic [[everyman]] and is curious of the past before the Revolution.\n*[[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]]&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's lover who is a covert \"[[Insurrectionist|rebel]] from the waist downwards\" who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League.\n* [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]]&nbsp;\u2013 a member of the Inner Party who poses as a member of The Brotherhood, the counter-revolutionary resistance, to deceive, trap, and capture Winston and Julia. O'Brien has a servant named Martin.\n\n===Secondary characters===\n* Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford&nbsp;\u2013 former members of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the original leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Caf\u00e9\u2014with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, in the course of his editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a [[memory hole]]. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.\n* Ampleforth&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's one-time Records Department colleague who was imprisoned for leaving the word \"God\" in a Kipling poem as he could not find another rhyme for \"rod\";{{refn|This may be a reference to \"[[McAndrew's Hymn]]\", which includes the lines \"From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God\u2014 / Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/george-orwell-weighs-scottish-independence/#! |title=George Orwell Weighs in on Scottish Independence |magazine=[[LA Review of Books]] |first=Nina |last=Martyris |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> }} Winston encounters him at the [[Ministry of Love|Miniluv]]. Ampleforth is a dreamer and intellectual who takes pleasure in his work, and respects poetry and language, traits which cause him disfavour with the Party.\n* Charrington&nbsp;\u2013 an officer of the [[Thought Police]] posing as a sympathetic antiques dealer amongst the Proles.\n* Katharine Smith&nbsp;\u2013 the emotionally indifferent wife whom Winston \"can't get rid of\". Despite disliking sexual intercourse, Katharine married Winston because it was their \"duty to the Party\". Although she was a \"goodthinkful\" ideologue, they separated because the couple could not conceive children. Divorce is not permitted, but couples who cannot have children may live separately. For much of the story Winston lives in vague hope that Katharine may die or could be \"got rid of\" so that he may marry Julia. He regrets not having killed her by pushing her over the edge of a quarry when he had the chance many years previously.\n* Tom Parsons&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's na\u00efve neighbour, and an ideal member of the Outer Party: an uneducated, suggestible man who is utterly loyal to the Party, and fully believes in its perfect image. He is socially active and participates in the Party activities for his social class. He is friendly towards Smith, and despite his political conformity punishes his bullying son for firing a [[slingshot|catapult]] at Winston. Later, as a prisoner, Winston sees Parsons is in the Ministry of Love, as his daughter had reported him to the Thought Police, saying she heard him speak against Big Brother in his sleep. Even this does not dampen his belief in the Party, and he states he could do \"good work\" in the hard labour camps.\n* Mrs. Parsons&nbsp;\u2013 Parsons's wife is a wan and hapless woman who is intimidated by her own children.\n** The Parsons children&nbsp;\u2013 members of the Party Youth League, representing the new generation of Oceanian citizens, without memory of life before Big Brother, and without family ties or emotional sentiment; the model society envisioned by the Inner Party.\n* Syme&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's colleague at the Ministry of Truth. He was a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] who helped develop the language and the dictionary of [[Newspeak]]. Although he is enthusiastic about his work and support for the Party, Winston notes that \"He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly.\" Winston predicts, correctly, that Syme will become an unperson.\n\n===Unseen characters===\nWhether these characters are real or fabrications of Party propaganda is something that neither Winston nor the reader is permitted to know:\n* [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]&nbsp;\u2013 the leader and figurehead of the Party that rules Oceania.\n* [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly a former leading figure in the Party who became the counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of The Book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''. Goldstein is the symbolic [[enemy of the state]]\u2014the national [[Archenemy|nemesis]] who ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during the [[Two Minutes Hate]] and other fearmongering.\n\n==World in novel==\n===Ingsoc===\n{{Main|Ingsoc}}\nIngsoc (English Socialism) is the predominant ideology and [[pseudophilosophy]] of Oceania, and [[Newspeak]] is the official language of official documents. Orwell depicts the Party's ideology as an [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] worldview that \"rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it does so in the name of Socialism.\"\n\n===Ministries of Oceania===\n{{Main|Ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\nIn London, the capital city of Airstrip One, Oceania's four government ministries are in pyramids (300 m high), the fa\u00e7ades of which display the Party's three slogans. As mentioned, the ministries' names are the opposite ([[doublethink]]) of their true functions: \"The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.\" (Part II, Chapter IX&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'')\n\n====Ministry of Peace====\nThe [[Ministry of Peace]] supports Oceania's perpetual war against either of the two other superstates:\n<blockquote>The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognised and not recognised by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.</blockquote>\n\n====Ministry of Plenty====\nThe [[Ministry of Plenty]] rations and controls food, goods, and domestic production; every fiscal quarter, it publishes false claims of having raised the standard of living, when it has, in fact, reduced rations, availability and production. The Ministry of Truth substantiates the Ministry of Plenty's claims by [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising]] historical records to report numbers supporting the current \"increased rations\".\n\n====Ministry of Truth====\nThe [[Ministry of Truth]] controls information: news, entertainment, education, and the arts. Winston Smith works in the Minitrue RecDep (Records Department), \"rectifying\" historical records to concord with Big Brother's current pronouncements so that everything the Party says is true.\n\n====Ministry of Love====\nThe [[Ministry of Love]] identifies, monitors, arrests and converts real and imagined dissidents. In Winston's experience, the dissident is beaten and tortured, and, when near-broken, he is sent to [[Room 101]] to face \"the worst thing in the world\"\u2014until love for Big Brother and the Party replaces dissension.\n\n===Doublethink===\n{{Main|Doublethink}}\n{{quotation|The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.|Part II, Chapter IX&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''|}}\n\n===Political geography===\n{{Main|Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n[[File:1984 fictitious world map v2 quad.svg|thumb|Fictitious map illustrating the political landscape of the novel]]\nThree perpetually warring [[totalitarian]] super-states control the world:<ref name=\"Part II, Ch. 9\">Part II, Ch. 9</ref>\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] (ideology: [[Ingsoc]], i.e. English Socialism), whose core territories are the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[British Isles]], [[Australasia]], [[Polynesia]] and Southern Africa\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eurasia|Eurasia]] (ideology: [[Neo-Bolshevism]]), whose core territories are [[Continental Europe]] and Russia, including [[Siberia]]\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eastasia|Eastasia]] (ideology: [[Obliteration of the Self]] or [[Death Worship]]), whose core territories are China, Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Indochina]]\n\nThe perpetual war is fought for control of the \"disputed area\" lying \"between the frontiers of the super-states\", which forms \"a rough [[quadrilateral]] with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and Hong Kong\",<ref name=\"Part II, Ch. 9\"/> and Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Indonesia are where the superstates capture and use slave labour. Fighting also takes place between Eurasia and Eastasia in [[Manchuria]], Mongolia and Central Asia, and all three powers battle one another over various Atlantic and Pacific islands.\n\n===The Revolution===\n{{Main|The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism}}\nWinston Smith's memory and Emmanuel Goldstein's book communicate some of the history that precipitated the Revolution. Eurasia was formed when the [[Soviet Union]] conquered Continental Europe, creating a single state stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] does not include the British Isles because the United States annexed them along with the rest of the British Empire and Latin America, thus establishing Oceania and gaining control over a quarter of the planet. [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], the last superstate established, emerged only after \"a decade of confused fighting\". It includes the Asian lands conquered by China and Japan. Although Eastasia is prevented from matching Eurasia's size, its larger populace compensates for that handicap.\n\nThe annexation of Britain occurred about the same time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of [[Colchester]] is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.\n\nWhile the precise chronology cannot be traced, most of the global societal reorganisation occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet in the ruins of a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack \"thirty years\" earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the atomic war that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the \"fourth quarter of 1983\" was \"also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan\", which implies that the first quarter of the first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.\n\n===The War===\n{{See also|Perpetual war}}\nIn 1984, there is a perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates that emerged from the global atomic war. ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the [[Malabar Coast]].\n\nThat alliance ends and Oceania, allied with Eurasia, fights Eastasia, a change occurring on Hate Week, dedicated to creating patriotic fervour for the Party's perpetual war. The public are blind to the change; in mid-sentence, an orator changes the name of the enemy from \"Eurasia\" to \"Eastasia\" without pause. When the public are enraged at noticing that the wrong flags and posters are displayed, they tear them down; the Party later claims to have captured the whole of Africa.\n\nGoldstein's book explains that the purpose of the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise what the government is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with [[V-weapons|rocket bombs]], helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).\n\n===Living standards===\nThe society of Airstrip One and, according to \"The Book\", almost the whole world, lives in poverty: hunger, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of the civil war, the atomic wars and the purportedly enemy (but possibly [[false flag]]) rockets. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministerial pyramids, little of London was rebuilt. Members of the Outer Party consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality \"luxuries\" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the \"Victory\" brand. (That is a parody of the low-quality Indian-made \"Victory\" cigarettes, widely smoked in Britain and by British soldiers during World War II. They were smoked because it was easier to import them from India than it was to import American cigarettes from across the Atlantic because of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].)\n\nWinston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include [[telescreens]] that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.\n\nIn contrast to their subordinates, the Inner Party upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarter of the city, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, coffee and sugar, all denied to the general populace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp|title=Barron's Booknotes-1984 by George Orwell|last=Reed|first=Kit|year=1985|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]]|accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Winston is astonished that the [[elevator|lifts]] in O'Brien's building work, the [[telescreens]] can be switched off and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All members of the Inner Party are attended to by slaves captured in the disputed zone, and \"The Book\" suggests that many have their own motorcars or even helicopters. Nonetheless, \"The Book\" makes clear that even the conditions enjoyed by the Inner Party are only \"relatively\" comfortable, and standards would be regarded as austere by those of the prerevolutionary \u00e9lite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/16.html|title=1984}}Part 2, Chapter 9</ref>\n\nThe proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with alcohol, pornography and a national lottery whose winnings are never actually paid out; that is obscured by propaganda and the lack of communication within Oceania. At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the middle-class Outer Party: they are subject to certain levels of monitoring but are not expected to be particularly patriotic. They lack telescreens in their own homes and often jeer at the telescreens that they see. \"The Book\" indicates that is because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions. The model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or \"reintegration\" by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they are deemed to lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that \"the future belonged to the proles\".<ref>Lines 29\u201335, p. 229, Chapter X, Part II of the Penguin paperback edition of 1984: \"The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill\".</ref>\n\nThe standard of living of the populace is low overall. Consumer goods are scarce, and all those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot. The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and \"The Book\" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war consumes surplus industrial production. Outer Party members and proles occasionally gain access to better items in the market, which deals in goods that were pilfered from the residences of the Inner Party.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay \"[[Notes on Nationalism]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html|title=George Orwell: \"Notes on Nationalism\"|date=May 1945|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces.

Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions from one power unit to another (for example, Communism, [[Pacifism]], Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say that they must be the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.\n\nO'Brien concludes: \"The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.\"\n\n===Futurology===\nIn the book, Inner Party member O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future: {{Quote|There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.

One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He proceeds to write an article about '''Comrade Ogilvy''', a made-up party member who displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.<ref>{{Cite book|title=1984|last=Orwell|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=part 1, chapter 4}}</ref>\n\n===Surveillance===\nThe inhabitants of [[Oceania (Ninteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], particularly the Outer Party members, have no real privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way [[telescreen]]s so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.\n\n==Newspeak appendix==\n{{Main|Newspeak|List of Newspeak words}}\n\"The Principles of Newspeak\" is an academic essay appended to the novel. It describes the development of Newspeak, the Party's minimalist artificial language meant to ideologically align thought and action with the principles of Ingsoc by making \"all other modes of thought\" (i.e. any thoughts, concepts, or sayings that go against Ingsoc) impossible. The idea that the structure of language can be used to influence thought is known as [[linguistic relativity]].\n\nWhether or not the Newspeak appendix implies a hopeful end to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' remains a critical debate, as it is in Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the [[past tense]]: \"Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised\" p.&nbsp;422).

Some time at an unspecified date after the first American publication of the book, producer [[Sidney Sheldon]] wrote to Orwell interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell sold the American stage rights to Sheldon, explaining that his basic goal with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:\n<blockquote>[''Nineteen Eighty-Four''] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Russian Foreign Office]].<ref>Sheldon, Sidney (2006) ''The Other Side of Me'', Grand Central Publishing, p. 213</ref></blockquote> According to Orwell biographer [[D. J. Taylor]], the author's ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'' (1935) has \"essentially the same plot of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' ... It's about somebody who is spied upon, and eavesdropped upon, and oppressed by vast exterior forces they can do nothing about. It makes an attempt at rebellion and then has to compromise\".<ref name=\"fivebookstaylor\">{{Cite interview |last=Taylor |first=D.

A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete\"; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-Aggression]]. Thereafter, and continuing until the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped\u2014including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line. Orwell had criticised the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] for supporting the Treaty in his essays for ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' (1941). \"The Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 reversed the Soviet Union's stated foreign policy. It was too much for many of the [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveller]]s like [[Victor Gollancz|Gollancz]] [Orwell's sometime publisher] who had put their faith in a strategy of construction [[Popular Front]] governments and the peace bloc between Russia, Britain and France.\"<ref>Perry, Matt.

Given the middle class's grasping this, they too would abide socialist revolution and that only reactionary Britons would oppose it, thus limiting the force revolutionaries would need to take power. An English Socialism would come about which \"will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State.

Many terms used in the novel have entered common usage, including [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], [[doublethink]], [[thoughtcrime]], [[Newspeak]], [[Room 101]], [[telescreen]], [[2 + 2 = 5]], [[Proles (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|prole]], and [[memory hole]]. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' also popularised the adjective \"[[Orwellian]]\", connoting things such as official deception, secret surveillance, brazenly misleading terminology, and manipulation of recorded history by a totalitarian or authoritarian state.

Party flags are mentioned, but never described in the actual novel.]]\n\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is set in [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], one of three inter-continental [[superstates]] that divided the world after a global war.\n\nSmith's memories and his reading of the proscribed book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], reveal that after the [[Second World War]], the United Kingdom became involved in a war during the early 1950s in which [[nuclear weapon]]s destroyed hundreds of cities in Europe, western Russia and North America. [[Colchester]] was destroyed and London also suffered widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a [[London Underground]] station. Britain fell into civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as [[Ingsoc]], emerged victorious and formed a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in Britain. The [[British Commonwealth]] and Latin America were absorbed by the United States, resulting in the superstate of Oceania. Ingsoc became the sole government party in this new nation.\n\nSimultaneously, the [[Soviet Union]] conquered [[continental Europe]] and established the second superstate of [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]], under a Neo-[[Bolshevik]] regime. The third superstate of [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] emerged in the Far East after another decade of fighting, with a ruling ideology translated from Chinese as 'Death-Worship' or 'Obliteration of the Self'. The three superstates wage perpetual war for the remaining unconquered lands of the world in \"a rough quadrilateral with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and Hong Kong\" through constantly shifting alliances. Although each of the three states are said to have sufficient natural resources, the war continues to maintain ideological control over the people.\n\nWhile citizens in each state are trained to despise the ideologies of the other two as uncivilised and barbarous, Goldstein's book, ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', explains that in fact the superstates' ideologies are practically identical and that the public's ignorance of this fact is imperative so that they might continue believing otherwise. The only references to the exterior world for the Oceanian citizenry (the Outer Party and the Proles) are Ministry of Truth maps and propaganda to ensure their belief in \"the war\".\n\nHowever, due to the fact that Winston barely remembers these events and due to the Party's manipulation of historical records, the continuity and accuracy of these events are unknown. Winston himself notes that the Party has claimed credit for inventing helicopters, aeroplanes, and trains, while Julia theorises that the perpetual bombing of London is merely a [[false-flag operation]] designed to convince the populace that a war is occurring. If the official account was accurate, Smith's strengthening memories and the story of his family's dissolution suggest that the atomic bombings occurred first, followed by civil war featuring \"confused street fighting in London itself\" and the societal postwar reorganisation, which the Party retrospectively calls \"the Revolution\".\n\nMost of the plot takes place in London, the \"chief city of [[Airstrip One]]\", the Oceanic province that \"had once been called England or Britain\".<ref>Part I, Ch. 1.</ref><ref>Part I, Ch. 3.</ref> Posters of the Party leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], bearing the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\", dominate the city (Winston states it can be found on nearly every house), while telescreens ([[transceiver|transceiving]] television set) monitor the private and public lives of the party members. Military parades, propaganda films, and [[public executions]] are said to be commonplace.\n\nThe class hierarchy of Oceania has three levels:\n* (I) the upper-class [[Inner Party]], the elite ruling minority, who make up 2% of the population.\n* (II) the professional-managerial class [[Outer Party]], the middle class, who make up 13% of the population.\n* (III) the lower-class [[Proles (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Proletariat]], who make up 85% of the population and represent the working class.\nAs the government, the Party controls the population with four ministries, each named after the opposite of their true function:\n* the [[Ministry of Peace]] deals with war and defence.\n* the [[Ministry of Plenty]] deals with economic affairs (starvation and rationing).\n* the [[Ministry of Love]] deals with law and order (torture and brainwashing).\n* the [[Ministry of Truth]] deals with news, entertainment, education and art (propaganda).\n\nThe protagonist [[Winston Smith]], a member of the Outer Party, works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth as an editor, [[historical negationism|negating historical records]] to make the past conform to the ever-changing [[party line (politics)|party line]] and deleting references to ''[[unperson]]s'' (people who have not only killed by the state but denied existence even in history or memory).\n\nThe story of Winston Smith begins on 4 April 1984: \"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\" Yet he is uncertain of the true date, given the regime's continual rewriting and manipulation of history.<ref>\"striking thirteen\" (1:00&nbsp;pm). In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the [[24-hour clock]] is modern, the [[12-hour clock]] is old-fashioned, Part I, Ch. 8.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:1984 fictious world map 2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.6|alt=Color-coded world map|World map, based on the novel]]\nIn the year 1984, civilisation has been damaged by war, civil conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) is a province of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Oceania]], one of the three [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] super-states that rule the world. It is ruled by the \"Party\" under the ideology of \"[[Ingsoc]]\" (a shortening of \"English Socialism\") and the mysterious leader [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who has an intense [[cult of personality]]. The Party stamps out anyone who does not fully conform to their regime using the [[Thought Police]] and constant surveillance through devices such as [[Telescreen]]s (two-way televisions).\n\nWinston Smith is a member of the middle-class [[Outer Party]], working at the [[Ministry of Truth]], where he [[historical negationism|rewrites historical records]] to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become \"unpersons\", disappearing with all evidence of their existence removed. Winston revises past editions of ''[[The Times]]'', while the original documents are destroyed by fire in a \"[[memory hole]]\". He secretly opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion, despite knowing that he is already a \"[[Thoughtcrime|thoughtcriminal]]\" and likely to be caught one day.\n\nWhile in a proletariat neighbourhood, he meets Mr. Charrington, the owner of an antiques shop, and buys a diary. He uses an alcove to hide it from the Telescreen in his room, and writes thoughts criticising the Party and Big Brother, and also writes that \"if there is hope, it lies in the proles\". To his dismay, when he visits a section of town where the proles live he discovers they have no political consciousness. An old man he talks to there has no significant memory of life before the Revolution. As he works in the Ministry of Truth, he observes [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry, whom Winston suspects of being a spy against him, and develops an intense hatred of her. He vaguely suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], is a member of an enigmatic underground [[resistance movement]] known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]. Winston has a lunch conversation with a co-worker named Syme, who is writing a dictionary for a revised version of the English language called [[Newspeak]]. After Syme says freely that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston thinks to himself that Syme will disappear as he is \"too intelligent\" and therefore dangerous to the Party.\n\nOne day, Julia secretly hands Winston a note saying she loves him, and the two begin a torrid affair. This is an act of rebellion, as the Party insists that sex only be used for reproduction. Julia shares his loathing of the Party, but he later realizes that she is not interested in politics or in overthrowing the regime, thinking that it impossible. They at first rendezvous in the country, and later meet in a rented room above Mr. Charrington's shop. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and his terse relationship with his wife Katharine, from whom he is separated (divorce is not permitted by the Party). He also notices the disappearance of Syme during one of his working days. Weeks later, Winston is approached by O'Brien, who invites Winston over to his flat, which is noted as being of far higher quality than Winston's. O'Brien introduces himself as a member of the Brotherhood and sends Winston a copy of ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by Emmanuel Goldstein. Meanwhile, during the nation's Hate Week, Oceania's enemy suddenly changes from [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] to [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], with no-one seemingly noticing the shift. Winston and Julia read parts of the book, which explains more about how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its slogans and the concept of [[perpetual war]]. It argues that the Party can be overthrown if proles rise up against it. However, to Winston, it does not answer 'why' the Party maintains power.\n\nWinston and Julia are captured and imprisoned. Mr. Charrington is revealed to be an agent of the Thought Police. At the [[Ministry of Love]], Winston briefly interacts with colleagues who have been arrested for other offences. O'Brien arrives, revealing that he too is a Thought Police agent, part of a special [[sting operation]] to catch \"thoughtcriminals\". Over several months, Winston is starved and tortured and forced to \"cure\" himself of his \"insanity\" by changing his own perception to fit in line with the Party. O'Brien tells Winston that the Party \"is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power.\" When O'Brien taunts Winston by asking him if there is any humiliation which he has not yet been made to suffer, Winston points out that the Party has not managed to make him betray Julia. O'Brien admits that is true. He says that once Winston is fully loyal, he will be released back into society for an unspecified period of time, and then he will be executed.\n\nStill imprisoned but now better fed and no longer mistreated, Winston grows stronger. Intellectually he has accepted that the party is invincible and \u2018objective truth\u2019 has no meaning. He has fully absorbed ''crimestop'', the instinctive conformity to state doctrine that precludes any oppositional thought. Emotionally, however, he at times clings to his old self. He fantasizes that moments before his execution his heretic side will emerge, which, as long as he is killed while unrepentant, will be his great victory over the party.\n\nWinston\u2019s hopes implode when, in an unconscious reverie, he calls out Julia\u2019s name. O\u2019Brien confronts him and Winston admits he hates Big Brother. O'Brien takes Winston to [[Room 101]] for the final stage of re-education. The room contains each prisoner's worst fear. In Winston's case it is rats. The fact that the Party knows this indicates the level of surveillance on the population is far more thorough than Winston previously believed. As a wire cage holding frenzied rats is fitted onto his face, Winston betrays Julia, begging his torturers to do it to Julia instead of him. Some time after being released Winston meets Julia in a park. She says she was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. They part ways. Later, Winston sits alone in a caf\u00e9 as Oceania celebrates a supposed victory over Eurasian armies in Africa and realises that, now, \"he loved Big Brother\".\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n[[File:Constellation of characters.png|thumb|A constellation of characters Winston interacts with in the book ''1984''.]]\n* [[Winston Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 the protagonist who is a phlegmatic [[everyman]] and is curious of the past before the Revolution.\n*[[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]]&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's lover who is a covert \"[[Insurrectionist|rebel]] from the waist downwards\" who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League.\n* [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]]&nbsp;\u2013 a member of the Inner Party who poses as a member of The Brotherhood, the counter-revolutionary resistance, to deceive, trap, and capture Winston and Julia. O'Brien has a servant named Martin.\n\n===Secondary characters===\n* Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford&nbsp;\u2013 former members of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the original leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Caf\u00e9\u2014with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, in the course of his editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a [[memory hole]]. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.\n* Ampleforth&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's one-time Records Department colleague who was imprisoned for leaving the word \"God\" in a Kipling poem as he could not find another rhyme for \"rod\";{{refn|This may be a reference to \"[[McAndrew's Hymn]]\", which includes the lines \"From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God\u2014 / Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/george-orwell-weighs-scottish-independence/#! |title=George Orwell Weighs in on Scottish Independence |magazine=[[LA Review of Books]] |first=Nina |last=Martyris |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> }} Winston encounters him at the [[Ministry of Love|Miniluv]]. Ampleforth is a dreamer and intellectual who takes pleasure in his work, and respects poetry and language, traits which cause him disfavour with the Party.\n* Charrington&nbsp;\u2013 an officer of the [[Thought Police]] posing as a sympathetic antiques dealer amongst the Proles.\n* Katharine Smith&nbsp;\u2013 the emotionally indifferent wife whom Winston \"can't get rid of\". Despite disliking sexual intercourse, Katharine married Winston because it was their \"duty to the Party\". Although she was a \"goodthinkful\" ideologue, they separated because the couple could not conceive children. Divorce is not permitted, but couples who cannot have children may live separately. For much of the story Winston lives in vague hope that Katharine may die or could be \"got rid of\" so that he may marry Julia. He regrets not having killed her by pushing her over the edge of a quarry when he had the chance many years previously.\n* Tom Parsons&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's na\u00efve neighbour, and an ideal member of the Outer Party: an uneducated, suggestible man who is utterly loyal to the Party, and fully believes in its perfect image. He is socially active and participates in the Party activities for his social class. He is friendly towards Smith, and despite his political conformity punishes his bullying son for firing a [[slingshot|catapult]] at Winston. Later, as a prisoner, Winston sees Parsons is in the Ministry of Love, as his daughter had reported him to the Thought Police, saying she heard him speak against Big Brother in his sleep. Even this does not dampen his belief in the Party, and he states he could do \"good work\" in the hard labour camps.\n* Mrs. Parsons&nbsp;\u2013 Parsons's wife is a wan and hapless woman who is intimidated by her own children.\n** The Parsons children&nbsp;\u2013 members of the Party Youth League, representing the new generation of Oceanian citizens, without memory of life before Big Brother, and without family ties or emotional sentiment; the model society envisioned by the Inner Party.\n* Syme&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's colleague at the Ministry of Truth. He was a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] who helped develop the language and the dictionary of [[Newspeak]]. Although he is enthusiastic about his work and support for the Party, Winston notes that \"He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly.\" Winston predicts, correctly, that Syme will become an unperson.\n\n===Unseen characters===\nWhether these characters are real or fabrications of Party propaganda is something that neither Winston nor the reader is permitted to know:\n* [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]&nbsp;\u2013 the leader and figurehead of the Party that rules Oceania.\n* [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly a former leading figure in the Party who became the counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of The Book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''. Goldstein is the symbolic [[enemy of the state]]\u2014the national [[Archenemy|nemesis]] who ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during the [[Two Minutes Hate]] and other fearmongering.\n\n==World in novel==\n===Ingsoc===\n{{Main|Ingsoc}}\nIngsoc (English Socialism) is the predominant ideology and [[pseudophilosophy]] of Oceania, and [[Newspeak]] is the official language of official documents. Orwell depicts the Party's ideology as an [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] worldview that \"rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it does so in the name of Socialism.\"\n\n===Ministries of Oceania===\n{{Main|Ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\nIn London, the capital city of Airstrip One, Oceania's four government ministries are in pyramids (300 m high), the fa\u00e7ades of which display the Party's three slogans. As mentioned, the ministries' names are the opposite ([[doublethink]]) of their true functions: \"The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.\" (Part II, Chapter IX&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'')\n\n====Ministry of Peace====\nThe [[Ministry of Peace]] supports Oceania's perpetual war against either of the two other superstates:\n<blockquote>The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognised and not recognised by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.</blockquote>\n\n====Ministry of Plenty====\nThe [[Ministry of Plenty]] rations and controls food, goods, and domestic production; every fiscal quarter, it publishes false claims of having raised the standard of living, when it has, in fact, reduced rations, availability and production. The Ministry of Truth substantiates the Ministry of Plenty's claims by [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising]] historical records to report numbers supporting the current \"increased rations\".\n\n====Ministry of Truth====\nThe [[Ministry of Truth]] controls information: news, entertainment, education, and the arts. Winston Smith works in the Minitrue RecDep (Records Department), \"rectifying\" historical records to concord with Big Brother's current pronouncements so that everything the Party says is true.\n\n====Ministry of Love====\nThe [[Ministry of Love]] identifies, monitors, arrests and converts real and imagined dissidents. In Winston's experience, the dissident is beaten and tortured, and, when near-broken, he is sent to [[Room 101]] to face \"the worst thing in the world\"\u2014until love for Big Brother and the Party replaces dissension.\n\n===Doublethink===\n{{Main|Doublethink}}\n{{quotation|The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.|Part II, Chapter IX&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''|}}\n\n===Political geography===\n{{Main|Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n[[File:1984 fictitious world map v2 quad.svg|thumb|Fictitious map illustrating the political landscape of the novel]]\nThree perpetually warring [[totalitarian]] super-states control the world:<ref name=\"Part II, Ch. 9\">Part II, Ch. 9</ref>\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] (ideology: [[Ingsoc]], i.e. English Socialism), whose core territories are the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[British Isles]], [[Australasia]], [[Polynesia]] and Southern Africa\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eurasia|Eurasia]] (ideology: [[Neo-Bolshevism]]), whose core territories are [[Continental Europe]] and Russia, including [[Siberia]]\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eastasia|Eastasia]] (ideology: [[Obliteration of the Self]] or [[Death Worship]]), whose core territories are China, Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Indochina]]\n\nThe perpetual war is fought for control of the \"disputed area\" lying \"between the frontiers of the super-states\", which forms \"a rough [[quadrilateral]] with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and Hong Kong\",<ref name=\"Part II, Ch. 9\"/> and Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Indonesia are where the superstates capture and use slave labour. Fighting also takes place between Eurasia and Eastasia in [[Manchuria]], Mongolia and Central Asia, and all three powers battle one another over various Atlantic and Pacific islands.\n\n===The Revolution===\n{{Main|The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism}}\nWinston Smith's memory and Emmanuel Goldstein's book communicate some of the history that precipitated the Revolution. Eurasia was formed when the [[Soviet Union]] conquered Continental Europe, creating a single state stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] does not include the British Isles because the United States annexed them along with the rest of the British Empire and Latin America, thus establishing Oceania and gaining control over a quarter of the planet. [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], the last superstate established, emerged only after \"a decade of confused fighting\". It includes the Asian lands conquered by China and Japan. Although Eastasia is prevented from matching Eurasia's size, its larger populace compensates for that handicap.\n\nThe annexation of Britain occurred about the same time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of [[Colchester]] is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.\n\nWhile the precise chronology cannot be traced, most of the global societal reorganisation occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet in the ruins of a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack \"thirty years\" earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the atomic war that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the \"fourth quarter of 1983\" was \"also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan\", which implies that the first quarter of the first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.\n\n===The War===\n{{See also|Perpetual war}}\nIn 1984, there is a perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates that emerged from the global atomic war. ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the [[Malabar Coast]].\n\nThat alliance ends and Oceania, allied with Eurasia, fights Eastasia, a change occurring on Hate Week, dedicated to creating patriotic fervour for the Party's perpetual war. The public are blind to the change; in mid-sentence, an orator changes the name of the enemy from \"Eurasia\" to \"Eastasia\" without pause. When the public are enraged at noticing that the wrong flags and posters are displayed, they tear them down; the Party later claims to have captured the whole of Africa.\n\nGoldstein's book explains that the purpose of the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise what the government is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with [[V-weapons|rocket bombs]], helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).\n\n===Living standards===\nThe society of Airstrip One and, according to \"The Book\", almost the whole world, lives in poverty: hunger, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of the civil war, the atomic wars and the purportedly enemy (but possibly [[false flag]]) rockets. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministerial pyramids, little of London was rebuilt. Members of the Outer Party consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality \"luxuries\" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the \"Victory\" brand. (That is a parody of the low-quality Indian-made \"Victory\" cigarettes, widely smoked in Britain and by British soldiers during World War II. They were smoked because it was easier to import them from India than it was to import American cigarettes from across the Atlantic because of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].)\n\nWinston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include [[telescreens]] that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.\n\nIn contrast to their subordinates, the Inner Party upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarter of the city, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, coffee and sugar, all denied to the general populace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp|title=Barron's Booknotes-1984 by George Orwell|last=Reed|first=Kit|year=1985|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]]|accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Winston is astonished that the [[elevator|lifts]] in O'Brien's building work, the [[telescreens]] can be switched off and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All members of the Inner Party are attended to by slaves captured in the disputed zone, and \"The Book\" suggests that many have their own motorcars or even helicopters. Nonetheless, \"The Book\" makes clear that even the conditions enjoyed by the Inner Party are only \"relatively\" comfortable, and standards would be regarded as austere by those of the prerevolutionary \u00e9lite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/16.html|title=1984}}Part 2, Chapter 9</ref>\n\nThe proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with alcohol, pornography and a national lottery whose winnings are never actually paid out; that is obscured by propaganda and the lack of communication within Oceania. At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the middle-class Outer Party: they are subject to certain levels of monitoring but are not expected to be particularly patriotic. They lack telescreens in their own homes and often jeer at the telescreens that they see. \"The Book\" indicates that is because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions. The model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or \"reintegration\" by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they are deemed to lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that \"the future belonged to the proles\".<ref>Lines 29\u201335, p. 229, Chapter X, Part II of the Penguin paperback edition of 1984: \"The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill\".</ref>\n\nThe standard of living of the populace is low overall. Consumer goods are scarce, and all those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot. The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and \"The Book\" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war consumes surplus industrial production. Outer Party members and proles occasionally gain access to better items in the market, which deals in goods that were pilfered from the residences of the Inner Party.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay \"[[Notes on Nationalism]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html|title=George Orwell: \"Notes on Nationalism\"|date=May 1945|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces.

The crowd instantly transfers its hatred to the new enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions from one power unit to another (for example, Communism, [[Pacifism]], Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say that they must be the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.\n\nO'Brien concludes: \"The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.\"\n\n===Futurology===\nIn the book, Inner Party member O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future: {{Quote|There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.

One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He proceeds to write an article about '''Comrade Ogilvy''', a made-up party member who displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.<ref>{{Cite book|title=1984|last=Orwell|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=part 1, chapter 4}}</ref>\n\n===Surveillance===\nThe inhabitants of [[Oceania (Ninteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], particularly the Outer Party members, have no real privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way [[telescreen]]s so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.\n\n==Newspeak appendix==\n{{Main|Newspeak|List of Newspeak words}}\n\"The Principles of Newspeak\" is an academic essay appended to the novel. It describes the development of Newspeak, the Party's minimalist artificial language meant to ideologically align thought and action with the principles of Ingsoc by making \"all other modes of thought\" (i.e. any thoughts, concepts, or sayings that go against Ingsoc) impossible. The idea that the structure of language can be used to influence thought is known as [[linguistic relativity]].\n\nWhether or not the Newspeak appendix implies a hopeful end to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' remains a critical debate, as it is in Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the [[past tense]]: \"Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised\" p.&nbsp;422).

Some time at an unspecified date after the first American publication of the book, producer [[Sidney Sheldon]] wrote to Orwell interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell sold the American stage rights to Sheldon, explaining that his basic goal with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:\n<blockquote>[''Nineteen Eighty-Four''] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Russian Foreign Office]].<ref>Sheldon, Sidney (2006) ''The Other Side of Me'', Grand Central Publishing, p. 213</ref></blockquote> According to Orwell biographer [[D. J. Taylor]], the author's ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'' (1935) has \"essentially the same plot of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' ... It's about somebody who is spied upon, and eavesdropped upon, and oppressed by vast exterior forces they can do nothing about. It makes an attempt at rebellion and then has to compromise\".<ref name=\"fivebookstaylor\">{{Cite interview |last=Taylor |first=D.

A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete\"; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-Aggression]]. Thereafter, and continuing until the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped\u2014including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line. Orwell had criticised the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] for supporting the Treaty in his essays for ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' (1941). \"The Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 reversed the Soviet Union's stated foreign policy. It was too much for many of the [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveller]]s like [[Victor Gollancz|Gollancz]] [Orwell's sometime publisher] who had put their faith in a strategy of construction [[Popular Front]] governments and the peace bloc between Russia, Britain and France.\"<ref>Perry, Matt.

However, members of the ruling class of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' use brutal force, torture and [[mind control]] to keep individuals in line, while rulers in ''Brave New World'' keep the citizens in line by addictive drugs and pleasurable distractions. Regarding censorship, in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' the government tightly controls information to keep the population in line, but in Huxley's world, so much information is published that readers do not know which information is relevant, and what can be disregarded.\n\nElements of both novels can be seen in modern-day societies, with Huxley's vision being more dominant in the West and Orwell's vision more prevalent with dictators in ex-communist countries, as is pointed out in essays that compare the two novels, including Huxley's own ''Brave New World Revisited''.<ref>[http://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/ Aldous Huxley;s ''Brave New World Revisited'']</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/books/review/which-dystopian-novel-got-it-right-orwells-1984-or-huxleys-brave-new-world.html|title=Which Dystopian Novel Got It Right: Orwell's '1984' or Huxley's 'Brave New World'?|date=13 February 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=17 June 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/orwells-1984-and-trumps-america|title=Orwell's \"1984\" and Trump's America|website=The New Yorker|access-date=17 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"conway\" />\n\nComparisons with other dystopian novels like ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[Virtual Light]]'', ''[[The Private Eye]]'' and ''[[The Children of Men]]'' have also been drawn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/26/1984-dystopias-reflect-trumps-us-orwell|title=Forget Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Bachelor of Arts programs generally take three or four years depending on the country and institution. They are contrasted with [[Bachelor of Science]]. \n\n[[Diploma]]s generally give the name of the institution, signatures of officials of the institution, type of degree conferred, conferring authority, and location at which the degree is conferred. Diplomas are printed on high-quality [[paper]] or [[parchment]]; individual institutions set the preferred abbreviation for their degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harvard.edu/on-campus/commencement/degree-abbreviations|title=Degree Abbreviations|website=Harvard University}}</ref>\n\n* Degree attainment generally takes four years in [[Ghana]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]], [[Kenya]], [[Brunei]], [[Canada]], [[Greece]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Turkey]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]], and most of the [[Americas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US5/REF/gpa.html|title=FAST-US-5 United States Education Reference File<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Degree attainment generally takes three years in nearly all of the [[European Union]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Albania]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[the Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec]].\n\n==Australia, Canada, India, Nepal, New Zealand and South Africa==\n{{ anchor | India | Nepal | Australia | New Zealand | South Africa | Canada}}\nIn colleges and universities in Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and South Africa, the BA degree can be taken over three years of full-time study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144|title=Bachelor of Arts degrees|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401072859/http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|archive-date=2010-04-01}}</ref> Students must pursue at least one [[academic major|major]] area of study and units from that subject are usually studied in each year, though sometimes students may choose to complete upper-level classes in the same year and as a result, can leave space for elective subjects from a different field. At some universities, students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects make up the degree.\n\nUnlike in other countries, students do not receive an overall grade for their Bachelor of Arts degree with varying levels of honours (\"honours\" is a distinction but not part of the degree itself). Qualified students may be admitted, after they have achieved their (general) bachelor's program with a high overall grade point average, to a further one-year bachelor (with) Honours degree program (''(with) Honours'' is part of the degree itself). Thus, to achieve a Bachelor (with) honours degree (e.g. BA (Hons.) or BA hons.), an extra \"[[postgraduate]]\" year and a high research honour's thesis must be completed; see [[honours degree]]s. A student who holds a (with) honours degree is eligible for direct entry to either a doctorate (PhD) or a very high research master's degree program.\n\nEducation in [[Canada]] is controlled by the provinces and can be very different depending on the province. Canadian universities typically offer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as BA or as honours BA degrees. The term \"honours\" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their BA degrees with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.\n\nThe honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive [[honours degree|BA degree \"with Honours\"]], Latin ''baccalaureatus in artibus cum honore\", 'BA hon.' ''de jure'' without brackets and with a dot. It is a \"postgraduate\" degree. Going back in history, a three-year BA degree (also known e.g. in Qu\u00e9bec as ''grade de bachelier \u00e8s arts'') was also called a pass degree or general degree.\n\nA student who first achieves a general BA degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a \"postgraduate\" ''baccalaureatus cum honore'' degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one year, but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students may be required to undertake a long high-quality research empirical thesis (honours seminar thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive ''B. cum Honore'' degree is essential if students' ultimate goals are to study towards a two- or three-year very high research master's degree qualification. A student holding a ''B. cum Honore'' degree also may choose to complete a doctor of philosophy (PhD) program without the requirement to first complete a master's degree. Over the years in some universities, certain ''B. cum Honore'' programs have been changed to corresponding master's degrees.\n\nIn general, in all four countries, the BA degree is the standard required for entry into  a [[Master of Arts|master's]] programme. In science, a BA hons degree is generally a prerequisite for entrance to a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] program or a very high research activity master's programme. As such, for example, the UK awarded ''honours'' are designed and should not be confused with Canadian-, Australian-, New Zealand-, and South African-awarded BA hons/BA (Hons) degrees.\n\nFor further clarification, in other countries, the so-called \"honours\" bachelor may not be an actual degree, but the name of a (vocational) programme that can be completed through specified course work, a high grade average, and the completion of possibly a short paper or project; students who completed such an honours BA programme sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' after the degree abbreviation without a space, in parentheses, and after the 'Hon(s)' without a dot, for example 'BA (Hon)'. The three- and four-year BA.degree is also accepted for entry into graduate professional programmes such as [[LLB#Structure of LL.B. programmes|law]] or a [[M.B.A.|master of business administration]] program.\n\n==Netherlands==\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the BA and master of arts (MA) degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then, a single program led to the ''[[doctorandus]]'' degree. This comprised the same course load as the bachelor's and master's programs combined. The title ''doctorandus'' was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (''meester'', Dutch for master, abbreviated ''Mr.'') and engineering (''[[ingenieur]]''). Those who had already started the ''doctorandus'' program could, on completing it, opt for the ''doctorandus'' degree (entitling them to use \"Drs.\" in front of their name), or could use the master's degree (postnominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a ''Universit\u00e4t'' (plural: ''Universit\u00e4ten'') or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (plural: ''Fachhochschulen''); both can be referred to as a ''Hochschule'', which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. Fachhochschule is often translated as \"University of Applied Sciences\". Universit\u00e4ten place greater emphasis on fundamental science and theoretical background, while Fachhochschulen are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at Universit\u00e4ten and Fachhochschulen are legally equivalent.\n\nIn Germany, the B.A. normally lasts between three and three and a half years \u2013 six or seven semesters \u2013 and is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].\n\n==United Kingdom and Ireland==\n{{Main|British undergraduate degree classification}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding [[Scotland]]) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. However, some older or [[ancient universities]], such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] traditionally award B.A.s to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g. Part II [[Tripos]] (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderatorship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] established in the 1960s, such as [[University of York|York]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding B.A.s in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding B.Sc. degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] can be claimed, usually twenty-one terms after [[matriculation]]. For many centuries, the bachelor's degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and increasingly in the UK\u2014the [[International Baccalaureate]]) come from this: le [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]] and el ''Bachillerato'', respectively.\n\nThe [[Ancient Universities of Scotland]] award a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a B.Sc. to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinar.  In Scotland, it is possible to opt to take an ordinary degree rather than this simply ranking below a third class honours (for example, B.A. with distinction, merit or pass).\n\nA Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the designation B.A. for an ordinary/pass degree and B.A. (Hons) for an honours degree. Students who completed an honours B.A. sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' or '(Hons)' after the degree abbreviation in parentheses. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Typically these degrees lack the final year requirement of a dissertation.\n\n== High School ==\n[[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] in [[Philadelphia, PA]], USA, is the only high school in the United States that is allowed to give this degree to its graduates<ref>{{cite web |title=About Central |url=https://centralhs.philasd.org/about-central-high-school/about-us-2/ |website=Central High School |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Associate of Arts]]\n* [[Lady Literate in Arts]]\n* [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]]\n* [[Bachelor of Science]]\n* [[Master of Arts]]\n* [[Educational attainment in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Academic degrees}}\n\n[[Category:Bachelor's degrees|Arts, Bachelor of]]\n[[Category:Liberal arts education]]\n[[http://www.solutionsofyou.com/dravidian-university-ba-1st-year-result-check-here2020/BA 1st Year Result 2020-check Result here]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the R.

They are contrasted with [[Bachelor of Science]]. \n\n[[Diploma]]s generally give the name of the institution, signatures of officials of the institution, type of degree conferred, conferring authority, and location at which the degree is conferred.

At some universities, students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects make up the degree.\n\nUnlike in other countries, students do not receive an overall grade for their Bachelor of Arts degree with varying levels of honours (\"honours\" is a distinction but not part of the degree itself). Qualified students may be admitted, after they have achieved their (general) bachelor's program with a high overall grade point average, to a further one-year bachelor (with) Honours degree program (''(with) Honours'' is part of the degree itself). Thus, to achieve a Bachelor (with) honours degree (e.g. BA (Hons.) or BA hons.), an extra \"[[postgraduate]]\" year and a high research honour's thesis must be completed; see [[honours degree]]s. A student who holds a (with) honours degree is eligible for direct entry to either a doctorate (PhD) or a very high research master's degree program.\n\nEducation in [[Canada]] is controlled by the provinces and can be very different depending on the province. Canadian universities typically offer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as BA or as honours BA degrees. The term \"honours\" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their BA degrees with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.\n\nThe honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive [[honours degree|BA degree \"with Honours\"]], Latin ''baccalaureatus in artibus cum honore\", 'BA hon.' ''de jure'' without brackets and with a dot. It is a \"postgraduate\" degree. Going back in history, a three-year BA degree (also known e.g. in Qu\u00e9bec as ''grade de bachelier \u00e8s arts'') was also called a pass degree or general degree.\n\nA student who first achieves a general BA degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a \"postgraduate\" ''baccalaureatus cum honore'' degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one year, but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students may be required to undertake a long high-quality research empirical thesis (honours seminar thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive ''B. cum Honore'' degree is essential if students' ultimate goals are to study towards a two- or three-year very high research master's degree qualification. A student holding a ''B. cum Honore'' degree also may choose to complete a doctor of philosophy (PhD) program without the requirement to first complete a master's degree. Over the years in some universities, certain ''B. cum Honore'' programs have been changed to corresponding master's degrees.\n\nIn general, in all four countries, the BA degree is the standard required for entry into  a [[Master of Arts|master's]] programme.
